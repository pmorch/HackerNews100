    <h2>Why we made this</h2>
  
    <p>We built our own typeface for a few key reasons:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: we can customize the fonts to align with our preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Features</strong>: we can integrate advanced typography features tailored to our use cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: the cost of licensing commercial typefaces increases as we grow.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Source Sans was the perfect foundation for Nebula Sans because it shares many primary characteristics with <em>Whitney SSm</em>, our previous brand typeface — both were designed to bridge the gap between American gothic and European humanist typefaces, with a strong emphasis on readability. The majority of the adjustments we made were to adapt the metrics of <em>Source Sans</em> to better match those of <em>Whitney SSm</em>, since <em>Source Sans</em> is smaller and narrower by default.</p>

  <h2>Typographical Details</h2>

  <h3>Punctuation</h3>
  <p>The default punctuation marks in <em>Whitney SSm</em> were, to our taste, too straight. Nebula Sans uses beautiful curly glyphs from <em>Source Sans</em>.</p>

  <h3>Stylistic Alternates</h3>
  <p>Nebula Sans features the same stylistic alternates as <em>Source Sans</em>, with the defaults aligned with those of <em>Whitney SSm</em>.</p>

  <figure role="group">

    </figure>
  </figure>


  <h3>Asterisk</h3>
  <p>In typography, the asterisk symbol was named as such because it resembles a star. We love stars, so how could we not put our own spin on this little glyph?</p>

    </figure>
  </figure>


  <h3>Tabular Figures</h3>
  <p>The default version of <em>Whitney SSm</em> lacks support for tabular lining figures, so we were thrilled to be able to include them in Nebula Sans. Tabular figures (or monospaced numerals) allow us to do things like increment the timestamp in the video player while keeping the digits from jumping around as they change.</p>

                    <article>
                        
                        <div>
                                                        
<p>President Trump on Wednesday announced tariffs on practically every foreign country (and some non-countries), ranging from a 10 percent minimum all the way up to 50 percent. The economic fallout has been dramatic, with the stock market losing nine percent of its value (based on the S&amp;P 500 index at the time of writing) and forecasted probabilities of a recession rising.</p>



<p>President Trump described the tariffs as reciprocal, equal to half of the rate of tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers imposed by other countries. However, they are nothing of the sort. The tariff the United States is placing on other countries is equal to the US trade deficit divided by US imports from a given country, divided by two, or 10 percent, whichever rate is higher. So even if the United States has no trade deficit (or a trade surplus) with a country, they still receive a minimum tariff of 10 percent.</p>



<p>As an example, if the US imports $100 million worth of goods and services while exporting $50 million to a country, then the Trump Administration alleges that country levies a 50 percent tariff on the United States (the difference between $100 million and $50 million, divided by $100 million). The “reciprocal” tariff put into effect by President Trump on Wednesday would be half of that, 25 percent.</p>



<p>The formula for the tariffs, originally credited to the Council of Economic Advisers and&nbsp;<a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, does not make economic sense. The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if one were to take the Trump Administration’s tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold. As a result, the “reciprocal” tariffs imposed by President Trump are highly inflated as well.</p>



<p>Though in effect the formula for the tariff placed on the United States by another country is equal to the trade deficit divided by imports, the formula published by the Office of the US Trade Representative has two additional terms in the denominator that just so happen to cancel out: (1) the elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices,&nbsp;<em>ε</em>, and (2) the elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs,&nbsp;<em>φ</em>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="236" height="83" src="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/corinthveugerequation040425.png?x85095" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>The idea is that as tariffs rise, the change in the trade deficit will depend on the responsiveness of import demand to tariffs, which depends on how import demand responds to import prices and how import prices respond to tariffs. The Trump Administration assumes an elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices of four, and an elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs of 0.25, the product of which is one and is the reason they cancel out in the Administration’s formula.</p>



<p>However, the elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs should be about one (actually 0.945), not 0.25 as the Trump Administration states. Their mistake is that they base the elasticity on the response of&nbsp;<em>retail&nbsp;</em>prices to tariffs, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>import</em>&nbsp;prices as they should have done. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>&nbsp;they cite by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/albertocavallo/status/1907974351967633570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alberto Cavallo</a>&nbsp;and his coauthors makes this distinction clear. The authors state that “tariffs [are] passed through almost fully to US import prices,” while finding “more mixed evidence regarding retail price increases.” It is inconsistent to multiply the elasticity of import demand with respect to&nbsp;<em>import</em>&nbsp;prices by the elasticity of&nbsp;<em>retail</em>&nbsp;prices with respect to tariffs.</p>



<p>Correcting the Trump Administration’s error would reduce the tariffs assumed to be applied by each country to the United States to about a fourth of their stated level, and as a result, cut the tariffs announced by President Trump on Wednesday by the same fraction, subject to the 10 percent tariff floor. As shown in Table 1, the tariff rate would not exceed 14 percent for any country. For all but a few countries, the tariff would be exactly 10 percent, the floor imposed by the Trump Administration.</p>



<p>Now, our view is that the formula the administration relied on has no foundation in either economic theory or trade law. But if we are going to pretend that it is a sound basis for US trade policy, we should at least be allowed to expect that the relevant White House officials do their calculations carefully. Hopefully they will correct their mistake soon: the resulting trade liberalization would provide a much-needed boost to the economy and may yet help us stave off a recession.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	On March 27, 2022, on the heels of a weekend marked by dozens of gang-related murders, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/el-salvador/" id="auto-tag_el-salvador" data-tag="el-salvador">El Salvador</a>’s President <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/nayib-bukele/" id="auto-tag_nayib-bukele" data-tag="nayib-bukele">Nayib Bukele</a> and his legislature plunged the country into a <em>régimen de excepción</em> — a state of exception — and declared war against the gangs. The state of exception suspended fundamental rights like freedom of assembly and association, the right to legal representation, and the right to see a judge within 72 hours of detention. The age of criminal responsibility was lowered to 12.</p>



<p>
	The crackdown that ensued saw tens of thousands of arrests of suspected gang members, who were tried en masse and disappeared into the nation’s prison system without even the illusion of due process. Allegations of torture, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses abounded — and still do. Bukele is serving a second term despite a constitutional prohibition against it. The state of exception — originally a 30-day decree —&nbsp; has been extended 37 times. Over the course of three years, human rights in El Salvador have crumbled under its boot.

	</p>




<p>
	It’s here that President <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/" id="auto-tag_donald-trump" data-tag="donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> hopes<strong> </strong>to find a workable model for his own <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/immigration/" id="auto-tag_immigration" data-tag="immigration">immigration</a> crackdown, and the potential eradication of opposition to his nativist, right-wing agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In March, the Trump administration sent three plane loads of primarily Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, where they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/americas/deportation-videos-el-salvador.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">greeted by professional camera crews</a>, blinding lights, and soldiers clad in military fatigues who manhandled them as they were frogmarched, shaved, and transported into the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) — a massive prison that functions as both a detention center, and a propaganda soundstage for the Bukele government.<strong> </strong>The planes landed in El Salvador despite a court order from a federal judge <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-deport-alleged-gang-members-court-order-1235297412/">blocking the administration</a> from deporting the detained migrants to a third nation without appropriate due process. The Trump administration paid El Salvador <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/trump-administration-deportations-alien-enemies-act/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least $6 million</a> for the stunt, and the migrants have been thrust into a legal void that few manage to escape.&nbsp;

<p>
	“The Venezuelans have been sent to basically a judicial black hole,” says Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a leading human rights organization that has represented victims and the families of those internally displaced and disappeared in Central America for more than 20 years. “There’s already tens of thousands of El Salvadorans who are in it, who have not been able to exercise a defense, who have been subjected to systematic torture. Hundreds — probably more like thousands — have been killed.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Ruth López, a <a href="https://www.elsalvadornow.org/2024/12/03/bbc-nominates-lawyer-ruth-eleonora-lopez-among-the-100-most-influential-women-on-the-planet-in-2024-la-cadena-publica-britanica-bbc-nomina-a-la-abogada-ruth-eleonora-lopez-entre-las-100-muje/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">renowned</a> Salvadoran human rights lawyer who works as a chief legal officer at Cristosal, says the organization has been contacted by roughly 70 relatives and families of individuals caught in the deportation stunt, including “migrants without a prior criminal record, people who were detained on the street or upon entering the United States, others who had previously applied through the CPB One app or had existing formal asylum processes.”</p>



<p>
	López says it’s often Cristosal’s job to explain to families — who in these cases live primarily outside of El Salvador — the reality of what the detained person will face, and the challenges of fighting for their release. “Here in Salvador, between March 27, 2022, and December 31, 2024, there have been over 7,200 writs of habeas corpus submitted just to the Supreme Court. We can estimate that the rulings in favor of the people on those cases don’t surpass one percent,” she says. “These cases are also unique because these are not Salvadoran citizens, and additionally the government of El Salvador is being paid to hold them in an irregular situation — an unconstitutional situation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	El Salvador’s state of exception — billed as a necessary measure to eliminate crime and corruption — has led to the imprisonment of thousands of innocents alongside dozens of community leaders, union leaders, and human rights defenders. The situation in El Salvador may seem like a far cry from the institutions of the United States, which for decades have been revered as the global gold standard for democratic governance. But the erosion of individual rights, and the Trump administration’s willingness to recreate — even partially — the Bukele model at home, should be a warning and a wake up call for Americans.&nbsp;

<p>
	“America constantly talks about corruption elsewhere, this assumption that American institutions are incorruptible,” Bullock says. “In the end, human rights, corruption, autocracy — from an American exceptionalist mindset — is for the third world, and it makes it hard for people to see when it’s playing out in front of their faces.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In the aftermath of the Salvadoran Civil War — a more than decade-long conflict <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/jimmy-carter-oscar-romero-legacy-el-salvador-1235224083/">made exponentially worse</a> by the meddling of the United States — the country struggled to create a new egalitarian state, at the the same time that the American government began deporting undocumented migrants with criminal convictions from California <a href="https://newamericanstoryproject.org/context/brief-history-of-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back to Central America</a>. The result was the rapid entrenchment and growth of criminal groups within an already unstable El Salvador, and the nation quickly became one of the world’s most dangerous countries. When Bukele entered office in 2019, the murder rate in El Salvador was 38 per 100,000 people, and gangs outright controlled parts of rural El Salvador. While it’s undeniable that the Bukele crackdown has reduced violent crime in the nation, the extent of its success is a matter of debate, as crime statistics are <a href="https://www.dw.com/es/los-presuntos-%C3%A9xitos-de-nayib-bukele-en-la-lucha-contra-la-violencia/a-63107030" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">controlled by the Bukele government</a>. Allegations have also persisted that Bukele negotiated <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nayib-bukele-el-salvador-gangs-c378285a36d55c18f741c3f65892f801" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a backdoor truce</a> between some of the nation’s <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/secret-bukele-trump-deal-grenas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">most powerful gangs</a>. At the same time, over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/americas/el-salvador-war-on-gangs-bukele-intl-latam/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two percent</a> of the nation’s population is now incarcerated — the highest percentage in the world — and reports of state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses have skyrocketed.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	“Of course we were on board with neutralizing the gangs and the criminal elements, but that wasn’t the only thing the state of exception was for,” says Samuel Ramirez, founder of Movimiento de Víctimas del Régimen (Movement of Victims of the Regime), a protest and advocacy group that works with thousands of individuals and families affected by the state of exception. Bukele “used the gangs to create a spectacle, to command the attention of the world” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	While polling consistently shows that Bukele is quite popular in El Salvador, surveys also show <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/el-salvador/freedom-world/2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a steady increase</a> in fear of public criticism of the government — to degrees that sometimes match the president’s approval rating. “There’s a sector of the population that feels better, because it’s true that we perceive more security, we’re no longer afraid of the gangs. Now we’re afraid of the regime,” says Ramirez. “We see soldiers everywhere, police everywhere, patrol cars, and they’re arresting people.” Ramirez notes that on top of Bukele’s control of all three branches of government, and repression of <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/journalists-fear-renewed-hostility-towards-the-press-with-bukeles-re-election-in-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the free press</a>, families and activists he works with fear retaliation or arrest if they speak out against abuses or advocate for their imprisoned relatives. The murder rate — a statistic <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/08/el-salvador-bukele-crime-homicide-prison-gangs/#:~:text=In%20May%202021%2C%20Bukele's%20government,of%20the%20nation's%20homicide%20figures." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">provided by</a> the Bukele government — is down, but doesn’t include those who die in custody of the prison system or are killed by police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	El Salvador’s prisons have long been a hotbed of arbitrary detention and abuse, but the Bukele regime has operated under new levels of impunity. Officers are reportedly given daily <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/20/el-salvador-statement-us-house-tom-lantos-human-rights-commission#:~:text=Many%20arrests%20appear%20to%20be,number%20of%20people%20per%20day." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">arrest quotas</a>, transfers to other prisons are frequent, and the government closely guards information about detainees from families, attorneys, and their advocates. The state of exception means little more is needed than the suspicion of an arresting officer to secure a lengthy stay in prison. Detainees are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-launches-mass-trial-nearly-500-accused-gang-leaders-2024-02-08/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tried en masse</a>, with no opportunity to present counter evidence — or even access to the evidence against them — and are often handed decades-long prison sentences. “People [are] being held for now three full years [since the state of exception was imposed], in some cases, without even going to trial,” Bullock says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	As the Trump administration looks to crack down on undocumented immigration — using the specter of crime, gang violence, and “terrorism” as the justification for their dismissal of established law — their playbook is looking increasingly similar to Bukele.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Over the weekend, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="https://x.com/reichlinmelnick/status/1906378176856572001?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">obtained a copy</a> of a “Validation Guide,” used by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to determine if a Venezuelan detainee was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ice-list-venezuelan-immigrants-gang-members-1235306641/">a member of the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang</a>, and subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act — an <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/alien-enemies-act-explained" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">18th century law</a> that allows the government to arrest, detain, and deport men over the age of 14 who are citizens of an enemy nation during times of war. Citing this infamous law — which was used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — is a major stretch. The United States is not at war with Venezuela.</p>



<p>
	The guide included a points system through which suspected members are graded on their degree of suspected affiliation with the gang (scoring anything above a five is potentially enough to be declared an “alien enemy”). Criteria include tattoos and other symbolism; residing with someone declared a member of TDA; group photos featuring two or more “known” TDA members; and any form of communication with alleged members of TDA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The administration’s guide does not require due process; the supposed links between the detainee and a criminal group are not presented as evidence before a judge at a deportation hearing. The arresting officer has discretion, much like in El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Following the deportations in March, the Trump administration resisted releasing information regarding the identities of those arrested, and any evidence against them. The names of the more than 200 men deported were not made public <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuelans-deported-el-salvador-names/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">until CBS News</a> obtained the full list from an anonymous source last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The Trump administration <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/noncitizens-deported-alien-enemies-act-criminal-records-ice/story?id=119912375" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">admitted in court documents</a> that “many” of those sent to El Salvador did not have criminal records. As more information about those deported was unearthed, it became clear that some of the “evidence” against them was as absurd as a tattoo of <a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2025/03/21/eeuu/tatuajes-ordinarios-deportados-el-salvador-ap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Real Madrid CF</a> logo, or an <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-incredible-trump-admin-reportedly-deports-man-over-autism-awareness-tattoo-235625029616" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">autism awareness</a> tattoo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Under the Alien Enemies Act, they have no recourse to challenge their removal, especially when they’re sent into a third country’s penal system as part of a financial agreement to hold prisoners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The videos produced by Bukele’s government in CECOT make clear the prison is also a propaganda casting department. Inmates are more often than not shirtless, displaying large tattoos and body art supposedly indicating their affiliations with transnational gangs. It’s an image both Bukele and the Trump administration are actively searching for when they make arrests — even though, for years now, gangs have been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna22279005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">increasingly reluctant</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/tattoos-deported-venezuelans-not-necessarily-gang-members-rcna197089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand members</a> with clearly identifying, permanent symbols and tattoos as governments crack down on organized crime. More often than not, arrests in El Salvador are based on anonymous tips to police, or social and geographic proximity to someone previously arrested.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

	</p>




<p>
	On Tuesday, a report from <em>The Atlantic </em>revealed that in one court filing, the Trump administration admitted it had <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-admin-admits-wrongfully-deported-el-salvador-1235307858/">wrongfully deported</a> a man with protected status to El Salvador. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously won a legal battle against the Trump administration after being accused in 2019 of being a member of the gang MS-13, and was granted protected status that should have prevented his removal to El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	While the Trump administration acknowledged that Abrego Garcia had been deported due to an “administrative error,” they claimed neither they nor the court had standing to order the U.S. government to secure his return, as he was in the custody of El Salvador and outside of their jurisdiction. Despite that logic, the Trump and Bukele administrations last week <a href="https://sv.usembassy.gov/secretary-kristi-noem-visits-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inked</a> a “memorandum of cooperation” in which the two countries agreed to work together to deport “fugitives” who are wanted in El Salvador back to the Central American nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked Bukele for his “partnership” <a href="https://x.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1905050186977624065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in a video</a> filmed inside CECOT late last month. Before a backdrop of shirtless prisoners crowded into cage-like cells, Noem — sporting a $50,000 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/kristi-noem-venezuela-prison-rolex-watch.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rolex Daytona watch</a> — warned that CECOT is “one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”</p>



<p>
	Bullock, of Cristosal, notes that the Trump administration sending people without convictions to El Salvador with no chance to defend themselves constitutes a “forced disappearance,” a violation of international human rights law. “It also violates another principle of international law, which is called <a href="https://migrationnetwork.un.org/resources/principle-non-refoulement-under-international-human-rights-law" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">non-refoulement</a>, he says. “Non-refoulement is an established tenant of international human rights law that prohibits nations from <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Migration/GlobalCompactMigration/ThePrincipleNon-RefoulementUnderInternationalHumanRightsLaw.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">deporting or removing</a> individuals under their control — regardless of their immigration status — into a situation where they are likely to face imminent harm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Bullock continues: “[Bukele] brags about the ways that they use cruel and inhumane treatment in CECOT and our organization has documented amply systematic practices of torture generally in the prison system. So the United States, in doing this, is generating a point of inflection for the international human rights system. The outcome of this is basically the creation of this transnational penal colony where a president, a head of state, can make a deal with President Bukele and disappear undesirables indefinitely.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Disappeared is an apt description for the state of those in El Salvador’s prisons. Cristosal and other advocacy groups working with the families of the detained say that CECOT is just “the public face” of a much larger system of prisons in El Salvador holding the vast majority of those arrested under the state of exception. The Bukele administration makes it nearly impossible to track the whereabouts of an arrestee once they’ve entered the system. Family members are not allowed contact with inmates, and are given little information on their condition and location. Release papers, if they manage to secure them, <a href="https://www.vozdeamerica.com/a/el-salvador-no-excarcela-a-sus-presos-pese-a-que-tienen-cartas-de-liberacion-/7801430.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">are often ignored</a>. “We do work with hundreds of families of people, innocent people have been detained, and they don’t even know for sure if they’re alive.” Bullock says. “They bring monthly packages [of basic goods] to the prisons out of fear that their loved ones don’t think they’ve been forgotten, but they have no guarantees or assurances that they’re even there or they ever received the packages.” (In many Latin American countries, prisons do not provide basic goods for inmates, whose families are expected to collect and deliver them to detention centers on a monthly basis.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In 2024, Cristosal <a href="https://cristosal.org/ES/el-silencio-no-es-opcion-informe-completo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">published a report</a> detailing alleged torture within El Salvador’s prison system, unreported deaths of inmates, and the systematic dissappearances of those arrested. The organization has received thousands of complaints, investigated over 1,000 specific cases of alleged abuse, and documented the deaths in custody of over 200 prisoners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Cristosal provided <em>Rolling Stone</em> with recorded testimony from a former inmate named Oscar<em> </em>who said he and other detainees are often forced to sign confessions by arresting officers, crammed into cells with over 250 other inmates, and regularly beaten by guards. Oscar describes witnessing food deprivation, denial of medical treatment, frequent transfers (he spent time at several prisons in El Salvador), deaths of inmates due to illness or abuse, and burials in mass graves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In a 2023 <a href="https://cristosal.org/EN/2023/08/17/report-one-year-under-the-state-of-exception/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> examining in-custody deaths investigated by the state-run Institute of Legal Medicine (IML), Cristosal was able to corroborate that the institute has investigated at least 28 deaths within prisons that were likely caused by torture. The actual number is estimated to be at least in the hundreds. Deaths in custody are often reported to be the result of chronic disease or natural causes, despite inmates’ families claiming they had no known conditions before being arrested.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	In the case of a 30-year-old man whose IML reports were obtained by Cristosal, “the forensic medical examination of the IML stated that he had died as a result of ‘mechanical asphyxia by strangulation.’ The corpse presented a kind of protuberance at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and hematomas, possibly perpetrated with a rigid object. That is to say, he could have been strangled with a stick, club, or tonfa.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	One 24-year-old man, whose family spoke to Cristosal, died of a burst intestine theorized to have been caused by a severe beating. After an initial hospitalization due to malnutrition after seven months in prison, he was granted special release by a judge who told him that the “good news” was that a polygraph determined he was innocent — but the bad news was that he had “terminal renal insufficiency.” He told a relative shortly before he died that at Mariona Prison the “water is hot and tastes like chlorine and they hardly give us food, we get fed once a day, they don’t give us breakfast or lunch only dinner … we wait in line in a large court and everyone who gets food receives two hard blows on the back … so I stopped going out to eat so they wouldn’t hit me, because those blows hurt.”</p>



<p>
	One man previously incarcerated at Mariona testified to Cristosal that at one point, guards “showed up with a bucket of food. We arrived on a Thursday (and it was Monday), the guard asked, ‘Are you hungry?’ When we answered yes, the guard threw the food on the floor, which was full of mud and other dirt, and said, ‘You are only going to pick the food up with your mouth and if you grab it with your hands I will take you out and I will beat you,’ and gave them five seconds to pick up the food with their mouths.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Luisa — a woman whose daughter was arrested by the regime — wondered in an interview with Cristosal why her daughter was being held prisoner. “I would like for someone to come to me and say, ‘Look, here is [the evidence against your daughter] I can prove it,’ but I’ve always said we’re not of a dual-morality.” Luisa notes that since her daughter, who was the primary source of the family’s income, was arrested, she now spends around $120 a month on supplies her daughter needs, taking them to the prison with only the vaguest assurance that they will actually reach her daughter. Thousands of families whose loved ones are lost in the system are now forced to carry a similar financial burden. “Many of them already have a letter of release, they know they are innocent, why don’t they let them go?” Luisa asks.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	It’s into this system that the United States is now sending migrants without trial, with the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment being part of the system’s appeal. The families of those deported from the United States cannot deliver life-saving subsistence packages to inmates. They may not even know where they are. And they will face the additional challenge of having to contend with two hostile governments — one of which is their own — as they work to extricate their loved ones from a foreign penitentiary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Meanwhile, the changes ushered in by the Trump administration are quickly eroding support services in El Salvador. Cristosal has had to <a href="https://episcopalnewsservice.org/2025/02/04/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-halts-episcopal-affiliated-humanitarian-aid-program-in-central-america/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">downsize its operations significantly</a> in the wake of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of international aid and financial assistance programs. The cuts to their operations are also taking place alongside <a href="https://amnesty.ca/urgent-actions/el-salvador-free-fidel-zavala-and-other-community-leaders/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a wave of government retaliation</a> against activists and advocates in El Salvador. “The capacity of the human rights community in El Salvador to respond is significantly diminished,” Bullock says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The biggest challenge, Bullock explains, is helping the families of those who are detained or missing navigate a system in El Salvador that is increasingly serving the interests of the president rather than the people — a pattern he says mirrors the changes rapidly taking place in the United States. “Bukele often talked about his popularity and his electoral victories as a source of legitimacy that makes any institution or norm that doesn’t align with him, illegitimate,” he says. “You hear that same language with President Trump.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The public dialogue taking place between Bukele and the Trump administration is undeniable. In the aftermath of U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg’s attempt to block the deportation flights, Bukele echoed Republican complaints of obstruction and claimed that the U.S. was “facing a judicial coup” on <a href="https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1902164881769467923" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>. Bukele would know all about it, given that one of his first actions upon gaining control of the legislature in 2021 was to launch a judicial coup within El Salvador. Five Supreme Court justices and the attorney general — who had ruled against Bukele’s attempts at overreach — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56970026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">were removed from their positions</a> via votes by the legislature, and replaced by Bukele loyalists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	From López’s perspective in El Salvador, the similarities between the two men — and the manner in which they approach power — is clear. “One has to understand that the limits [placed on power] are for the population,” she says.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Checks and balances are often explained as a mechanism to prevent discord between branches of a government, or resolve disputes, but López argues that their primary function is the “protection of the population” from government abuses and overreach. When those protective systems are attacked and dismantled “the population ends up suffering those consequences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Trump is currently testing the limits of the United States’ checks and balances, seizing power for the executive through initiatives like he and Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), daring the courts to defy him, and threatening consequences if they do. El Salvador’s state of exception has only been in place for three years — ages for those in it, a blink in the timeline of global politics — but it’s been long enough for democratic norms to crumble virtually unopposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In a 2023 speech before <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/nayibbukeleunga78.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the United Nations General Assembly</a>, Bukele defended his attacks against El Salvador’s judiciary, telling the international community that if his party “had left the same general prosecutor as before, if we had left the magistrates of the previous chamber, if we had left the judges, who many protected and who even issued convictions when we removed them, we would still be the murder capital of the world. If we had listened to them, we would still be losing thousands of Salvadorans to terrorists.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Bukele made similar statements during a decidedly Trumpian speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last year. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfgSshYXD98" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">received raucous applause</a> after telling the audience that in order to “cleanse our society,” his government embraced the “unthinkable” and removed “corrupt judges, and corrupt attorneys, and prosecutors,” who — according to him — were practically supportive of the violent criminals he sought to thwart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Trump’s inauguration earlier this year brought with it a purge of career prosecutors and federal attorneys who the president deemed disloyal to the cause, and now threats of impeachment or investigation against jurists who don’t let him have his way. Foreign student activists opposing American policies toward Israel and Gaza have been arrested, stripped of their visas, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/us/what-we-know-college-activists-immigration-hnk/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and deported</a>. “It’s the classic authoritarian proposition that ‘I as the leader am uniquely equipped to solve this crisis and everyone else needs to get out of my way,’” says Bullock.

	</p>




<p>
	“Leaders constantly need emergencies in order to justify the concentration of power, the capture of the state itself, and also they need to create the image of an internal enemy,” Bullock explains.

<p>
	Trump has centered his political career around a drumbeat of fear mongering over “invasions” by criminal gangs and undocumented migrants, positioning himself as the only one who can combat them. The beat grew especially intense down the stretch of his most recent presidential campaign. In October, just weeks before the election, Trump drew <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-enemy-from-within-democrats-evil-1235135375/">widespread backlash</a> after repeatedly stating that he intended to squash the threat of the “enemy from within.” One of his first actions upon assuming office in January was to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign an executive order</a> declaring a national emergency at the southern border, and he’s since used this imaginary war against immigrants as a predicate for a fascist crackdown — one many Americans never thought they’d see.</p>



<p>
	“This deceptive bargain between security and rights will only take the American people down a pathway of loss of rights for all people,” Bullock adds. “A leader who offers that bargain to their population doesn’t do it out of a concern for security, rather to concentrate power and to capture institutions.”</p>

But for the first time in months, I picked up my laptop instead of my Switch.</p> <p>I don’t remember the last time I took a new side project at all seriously, but a glance through my projects folder indicates it’s been at least a year since I spent more than a day or two on one. I found a few I didn’t even remember starting, it’s been so long. Some I hadn’t even taken far enough to demonstrate whatever basic idea must’ve been in my head at the time; abandoned before they were even working.</p> <p>So it’s been a while. I haven’t exactly been feeling inspired since…</p> <p>Well, since I don’t know when.</p> <p>Maybe I’ve been depressed, or burned out. I don’t know. I haven’t been at my best; that’s all I really know for sure. It’s not that things have been bad, exactly, but they haven’t been easy, either.</p> <p>Whatever the reason: I realize now I’ve let it push my consumption-to-creation ratio wildly out of balance.</p> <p>I’ve spent pretty much every night in recent memory burning through video games, and I finally, inevitably, hit the wall with that approach. I wasn’t interested, or compelled. The fun things weren’t even fun anymore. The diminishing returns finally dwindled to the point I felt like I <em>had</em> to try something new.</p> <p>Something I’d been resisting.</p> <p>Something I was afraid of.</p> <p>I’m not sure why.</p> <p>Maybe I was scared to fail. Maybe I didn’t think I had a good enough idea. Maybe I didn’t think I was inspired enough yet.</p> <p>Maybe I thought it would be too hard.</p> <p>But finally, the pain of continuing with my existing approach outweighed the fears of change. So, for the first time in many months, I spun up a new project.</p> <p>It was a SvelteKit project, incidentally, although that’s entirely beside the point. I considered just creating HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and building from scratch. I also considered learning something new.</p> <p>I don’t think what I picked matters, though; I think it just matters that I picked <em>something</em>.</p> <!----> <p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> the project is; it matters <em>that</em> it is.</p><!----><!----> <p>Soon enough, I was staring at a blank white page with minimal black text in my browser; the web equivalent of a blank canvas.</p> <p>I began to write the variables I knew I’d need. I grabbed some things here and there from other projects. I added some minimal CSS classes just to get things roughly laid out. Functions and event handlers soon followed.</p> <p>A loose demo began to take shape.</p> <p>An hour or two went by, as I prototyped the idea. I tried some things; they didn’t work; I tried some others. I changed my approach, then changed it again, free to do whatever I saw fit, free to explore in any direction I liked.</p> <p>This morning, I tried a few more things. And though I’m not sure the core idea really works, or is anything special, simply <em>allowing</em> myself to explore it felt like being able to finally take a deep breath after a long time underwater.</p> <p>I felt something in that freedom. I felt a simple, understated joy that I hadn’t felt in a long time; a candle in a long-darkened room.</p> <hr> <p>Maybe you can relate. Maybe there’s an idea that’s been in your head.</p> <p>Maybe not; maybe you just haven’t created something in a long time. Maybe what you’re doing isn’t working for you. Maybe you just aren’t having <em>fun</em> anymore.</p> <p>I don’t know your situation, and I’m certainly not qualified to give out helpful life advice.</p> <p>But I know that when <em>I’m</em> not creating something, a part of me withers. And I think, in some way, we all have that compulsion inside of us.</p> <p>I don’t think <em>what</em> we create is the important part. I don’t even think it needs to be something “creative” to begin with.</p> <p><strong>Don’t limit your view of creation to things considered creative</strong>—or, for that matter, to things you’ve done before. These days I make apps, but I used to make entirely different things, and got the same pleasure from those.</p> <p>Some days, all I want to create is something tangible and functional. Last summer, my wife and I built new steps to our patio door, and even though that was well beyond both my range of experience and the typical definition of creativity, I found the work more engaging and compelling than anything else I had going on at the time.</p> <p>Sometimes it’s artistic; sometimes it’s not; other times, what we create isn’t a tangible thing at all.</p> <p>What you create might be words. It might be relationships, or time and space for others. Sometimes it’s the intangible places we create together. Sometimes we create experiences. Sometimes we create homes, communities, and families, of both the literal and figurative varieties.</p> <p>Sometimes we just create <em>change</em>.</p> <hr> <p><strong>I think we exist to bring new things into existence</strong>. If you ask me, to the extent there <em>is</em> a meaning of life, that’s it. We exist to create. It lights us up in a way nothing else does, putting something new into our world—and in doing so, fundamentally changing it, in whatever way, however big or small.</p> <p><em>What</em> you create, and <em>how</em> you do it, is entirely up to you. That’s the beauty of it.</p> <!----> <p>Enjoying the freedom to explore possibilities, and happily follow any compelling whim—that’s the blissful zen of a good side project.</p><!----><!----> <p>It’s having a carved-out space in your life where you, and only you, get to make the choices.</p> <p>Nobody else. You might have to share everything outside this little room, but everything in here is yours and yours alone.</p> <p>You don’t have to listen to any other voices here, except that quiet one inside of you that’s gently urging you to do the thing you know you need to do. You don’t owe it to anyone to choose anything—except yourself, and what you honestly feel.</p> <p>You don’t need to know where it’s going to lead. For that matter, it doesn’t have to lead <em>anywhere</em>. Nothing ever has to come of it. It’s ok if this project never even exists, as far as anyone else is concerned. Failure isn’t failure; it’s part of the process. It’s done when you’re done with it.</p> <p>The important part is that you explored that little corner of the map, and uncovered what was there. It’s ok if that was nothing. The exploration was the success. Now you know better where to explore next.</p> <p>So whatever your side project is: I encourage you to pick it up, and let that part of you exist (again).</p> <p>Happy wandering.</p><!---->  <!--[--> <!--]--></article><!----></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>8-pin Linux</span></p><h2>An interactive-speed Linux computer on a tiny board you can easily build with only 3 8-pin chips</h2>


<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I've long been experimenting with minimal computers that can run Linux. I've flirted with the <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=35.%20Linux4004">extreme</a> <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit">low-end</a> and with <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">fun form factors</a>. I felt like there was a place for another fun experiment: a simple-to-build kit computer using only 8-pin chips.

<h2>A minimal computer</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plAssembled.jpg"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plAssembledSmall.jpg"></a>

<a name="_TOC_7ee4079a39b0cfcb828325af6aa657e0"></a></p><h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
<p>There was a time when one could order a kit and assemble a computer at home. It would do just about what a contemporary store-bought computer could do. This time is long gone. Modern computers are made of hundreds of huge complex chips, with no public datasheets, with many hundreds of watts of power supplied to them over complex power delivery topologies. It does not help that modern operating systems require gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of storage, and always-on internet connectivity to properly spy on you. But, what if one tried to fit a modern computer into a kit that one could easily assemble at home?
</p>
<p>What is the minimum to be considered a "modern computer"? I would say being able to run Debian Linux, <span>vi</span>, <span>gcc</span>, and <span>make</span> is close enough, so that became the goal. Thanks to my previous exploits, I knew that this could be accomplished in 8MB of RAM and with 1 MIPS of CPU. Storage is easy: SD cards easily provide storage of any size. A serial port is still the de-facto method for easily interfacing with an embedded system, but as computers no longer have serial ports, USB-serial takes its place. Thus, I had the target: at least 8MB of RAM, at least 1 MIPS of CPU, SD card, USB.
</p>
<p>On the hardware front, I wanted to design something that could be assembled by someone with little-to-no soldering experience and a RadioShack 45W soldering iron, something small, cute, and cheap. Chips with fewer pins are easier to solder, so I settled on using <b>only chips with 8 pins</b>, as a fun challenge. Since all chips need at least a power supply and a ground pin, this limits each chip to no more than 6 useful pins. This decision turned out to inform a lot of the design's features and limitations. Physically, I decided to make it a small circular board, with a board-edge USB-C connector on top, as you can see on the image here. That is the final working design, assembled using the directions below, by me, actually using a RadioShack 45W soldering iron.
</p>
<h3>Parts Selection</h3>
<p>There really are not too many 8-pin chips that can speak USB. One and a half options exist. The first was the very cute <a href="https://prolificusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DS-23181002_PL2303GL.pdf">PL2303GL</a>, which is a USB-to-serial bridge that requires <em>NO external components at all</em>, and even provides 100mA of 3.3V regulated output. Super convenient! It works precisely as promised. I am a fan! Prolific even have drivers for all major and minor operating systems available easily. Sadly, on macOS, they <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pl2303-serial/id1624835354?mt=12">need to be installed from the AppStore</a>, but it is a simple process. It should be noted that its predecessor, the PL2303SA could also be considered, but it is EOL, and thus not worth mentioning. So, what is meant by "half a chip"? Well, thanks to <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html">V-USB</a>, The <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny85">ATTINYx5</a> series chips can also speak USB. It is only USB low-speed, and uses a lot of CPU time, but it works. The problem is that all existing USB-serial protocols require bulk endpoints, and USB low-speed is prohibited by the USB spec from using BULK endpoints. To stay spec-compliant this would then require designing my own comms protocol using interrupt endpoints and writing drivers for all major OSs. No fun. Luckily, <em>ALL</em> major OSs do not enforce this no-bulk-EPs-on-USB-low-speed thing. It <em>just works</em>, and implementing ACM to act as a serial port works. So, there they are - the two options for USB interfacing.
</p>
<p>There were not really any questions with regards to the RAM to use. SOIC-8 PSRAMs are the solution. <a href="https://www.issi.com/us/product-cellular-ram.shtml#jump1">ISSI</a>, <a href="https://www.apmemory.com/products/psram-iot-ram/">APMEMORY</a>, and <a href="https://www.vilsion.com/VTI7064MSM.shtml">Vilsion</a> make them. All of them have been promising 16MB chips for a year now, and none have delivered, so it is probably fair to assume that they are all bullshitting. However, 8MB parts are easily available for a few bucks at the usual retailers, so it was decided to make it work with 8MB of RAM.
</p>
<p>The last question was: which microcontroller to use? <a href="https://www.mouser.com/c/semiconductors/embedded-processors-controllers/microcontrollers-mcu/?number%20of%20i%2Fos=2%20I%2FO~~6%20I%2FO&amp;package%20%2F%20case=DFN-8~~DIP-8%7C~MSOP-8%7C~PDIP-8%7C~QFN-8~~SO8N-8%7C~SOIC-8~~SO-N-8%7C~SOT-23-8~~SOT-8%7C~TSSOP-8~~UDFN-8%7C~USON-8%7C~WDFN-8%7C~WSON-8&amp;rp=semiconductors%2Fembedded-processors-controllers%2Fmicrocontrollers-mcu%7C~Number%20of%20I%2FOs%7C~Package%20%2F%20Case">A parametric search</a> presented a few families of options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PIC16F is a messy old 8-bit architecture that can really only be programmed well in assembly. There is a C compiler, but it produces shit code (not its fault - the architecture is not well suited for C). These clock up to 32MHz, but as they take 4 cycles per instruction, the real performance is 8MIPS at 8 bits per op at best. The fact that this is an accumulator-based arch means that most things take more instructions. Overall, not a performant option. The largest code space available is 8192 instructions' worth (14KB), and the largest RAM available is 1KB.</li>
<li>Renesas R5F series is a weird little 16-bit core they call RL78. There is a passable GCC port for it too. The instructions <a href="https://www.renesas.com/en/document/mah/rl78-family-users-manual-software-rev230">take a variable number of cycles between 1 and 6</a>. For typical code it'll average an IPC of 0.55, and at 16MHz at most. They do not overclock well either. At least these cores are 16 bits wide, so they can do more per cycle than the PIC. In the 8-pin package, the largest possible flash size is 8KB. RAM? 1KB. As instructions are all <em>at least</em> 2 bytes, this option is limited to 4096 instructions at best, possibly less. It would be fair to expect 8MIPS at 16 bits per op.</li>
<li>PSoC1 series uses a core Infineon (née Cypress) calls <a href="https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_CY8C20x24_CY8C20x34_Technical_Reference_Manual_(TRM)-AdditionalTechnicalInformation-v08_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f904c2b7cc0">M8C</a>. Instruction encoding is pretty dense, with many instructions being only a byte long. Sadly, the performance is not there. No instruction takes fewer than 4 cycles, and some take over 10 cycles, including function calls. The maximum clock rate is 24MHz, with overclocks of 28MHz possible. But at an average of 6 cycles per instruction in a typical program, this only nets ~4.7MIPS at 8 bits per op. Not great. The maximum flash size is 4KB, and RAM is only 256 bytes. This is ... not great.</li>
<li>Somehow, ZiLOG still exists, and they sell 8-pin microcontrollers based on the core they call <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/240/PS0243-2584610.pdf">eZ8</a>. In the 8-pin package, the maximum flash size is 8KB, and RAM is 1KB. The core seems to use variable-length instructions, but they are quite slow. Most seem to take 2-4 cycles to fetch and then 3 or more to execute. Jumps take a lot more. Overall, expecting this core to get an IPC of over 0.2 is probably asking for too much. The maximum clock rate for these microcontrollers is 20Hz, so that should be about 4 MIPS at 8 bits per op. A new low.</li>
<li>NXP's <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/302/MC9S08QG8-3139058.pdf">S08CPUv2</a> core makes an appearance in a few chips here. It is an 8-bit accumulator-based architecture that clocks up to 40MHz. The maximum flash is 8KB, RAM size is 512 bytes - tight. Instructions are 1-4 bytes long. While some of them execute in 1 cycle, most take 2 or more. My guess at this thing's IPC in typical scenarios would be 0.6 or so. It is 8-bits wide. Expected perf is thus around 24MIPS at 8 bits per op.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/programming_manual/pm0044-stm8-cpu-programming-manual-stmicroelectronics.pdf">STM8</a>-based chips are an option. They are 8-bits-wide, run at 16MHz, have a pretty compact instruction encoding, and feature very high IPCs near 0.8, if you are lucky and keep the prefetch queue full. There is a C compiler available for these, too. In the 8-pin package, the maximum amount of flash is 8KB, and 1.5KB of RAM. Expected perf is around 13MIPS at 8 bits per op.</li>
<li>MSP430 (aka: the 2000s' PDP11) is represented in the search results too. Sadly, with only 2KB of flash and 128bytes of RAM, none of these chips are of much use for this project - they are simply too tiny.</li>
<li>There is, of course, AVR: 20MHz at 1.0 IPC, overclockable to around 25MHz easily, 8KB of flash and 512 bytes of RAM in the ATTINY85. There is an active GCC port, and the instructions are designed in the modern day and age, producing very compact and efficient code, none of that "move things into accumulator, now move them out of the accumulator" nonsense. This is the best option so far. As an extra bonus, if used for USB, then the entire board could be just two chips: the AVR for USB and CPU, and the RAM chip for RAM. Tempting. However, as V-USB needs about 1.5KB of flash and a hundred bytes of RAM, that leaves rather little to the emulator. It likely would not easily fit.</li>
<li>My old friend, the <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=23.%20PSoC4">PSoC4</a> is also represented in the results. A 16MHz ARM Cortex-M0 core basically obliterates all of the above options on performance trivially. It will execute most instructions in a single cycle (but branches take 3) and it is 32-bits wide. Flash size is 8KB officially, but, as I <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=24.%20PSoC4%20confidential">had documented</a>, really there is 16KB. RAM really is just 2KB in size. The major downfall of this option is that it uses three pins for supplying power to the chip, leaving only 5 pins available for I/O. Being already short on pins, giving one up is a lot to ask!</li>
<li>TI's new <a href="https://www.ti.com/microcontrollers-mcus-processors/arm-based-microcontrollers/arm-cortex-m0-mcus/overview.html">MSPM0C series</a> is a possibility. The Cortex-M0+ core is even faster than a Cortex-M0 by virtue of taking one cycle fewer to branch. In an emulator this matters! 16KB of flash, 1KB of RAM, and all 6 pins usable as I/O. What's not to like? Well, one pin is open-drain only, which sucks. This makes the pin unsuitable for fast output. The speed is 24MHz, with a little bit of overclockability available. However, without a PLL, this chip cannot overclock far. Still, this is now the best option, easily outperforming the AVR.
</li>
<li>The last option (as using STM's chips should always be the last option due to their habit of not publishing accurate and complete errata sheets) is the STM32G0 series. The STM32G030 is immediately discarded as an option, since one of the pins is a permanent RESET input, leaving only 5 I/Os. The <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/511-STM32G031J4M6">STM32G031J4M6</a> seems like a possibility. It is a relatively recent chip, so there is hope that STM got their shit together and fixed some of the usual myriad of issues their chips contain. Then again, as the plan called for minimal use of on-chip peripherals, maybe it'll be fine? 32KB of flash, 8KB of RAM! Those are serious numbers, completely obliterating the previous contestants. The Cortex-M0+ core makes it a tie for the best so far. Officially, this chip clocks at 64MHz. With effort, it'll overclock to 80MHz. With more effort (see below), it'll run at 150MHz. Assuming one can avoid the errata, this seems like the clear winner by far, as much as I hate it. Maybe one day there'll be an RP2354 in an SOIC-8 package with 6 PIO pins?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Designing the hardware</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plSchematic.png"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plSchematicSmall.png"></a>
<a name="_TOC_e4f7809d0d0a71f1f6d8a954f6ed011b"></a></p><h3>The Console</h3>
<p>The UART pins cannot be combined with anything. Any attempts to combine UART RX with something would create the possibility of missing some incoming data while the "something" is going on. Combining UART TX with something, no matter how fast that "something" is, is problematic as well. Any low pulse would be seen as a character by the PC. For brief lows it would be seen as a <span>0xFF</span> byte. In theory, parity could be enabled and used to hide this, but this is not surefire. Plus, who uses parity in 2024? Really, UART pins, lacking a higher-level protocol, chip select, or a separate clock are basically un-combinable with anything else. There go two of the 6 pins. Oh well...
</p>
<h3>RAM</h3>
<p>All the SPI PSRAMS support QSPI mode for speed. Sadly, QSPI requires 6 pins and only 4 are left. OK, most of them also support dual-SPI, wherein <span>MISO</span> and <span>MOSI</span> are used concurrently to send two bits of data per clock unidirectionally. This is twice the speed of normal SPI, just as you'd imagine. As an extra credit, it does not require any more pins than normal SPI and is compatible with sharing the SPI bus with other devices, since they would not expect to read <span>MOSI</span> or drive <span>MISO</span> when deselected.
</p>
<p>STM32G031 does not support dual-SPI. It could be bit-banged, of course. But, could it be done fast enough to beat the hardware SPI unit? The hardware SPI unit can run at one-half of the CPU clock and mate to the DMA unit for nonstop transmission/reception. To match this via CPU, would require bit-banging dual-SPI using no more than 4 cycles per clock. This is barely possible, given a few preparatory steps. Doing it any faster than that is impossible. Since the best that can be done is to match the hardware SPI unit, why bother? RAM will be accessed using garden-variety SPI. That uses four of the remaining four pins. Damn...
</p>
<h3>SD Card</h3>
<p>So, here was the situation: no pins left and still an SD card to attach. SD cards speak SPI, so one more pin to give it a chip select signal would be enough, but there were no pins left. A few options were considered. The simplest idea was to include an inverter on the RAM's <span>nCS</span> and use that as the SD card's <span>nCS</span>. This was prototyped and it worked somewhat well. The issue with this approach is two-fold. First of all, some cards did not like being selected and deselected with no data bytes being sent to them, but that is precisely what two RAM accesses would look like to them. Not many cards had this issue, so it is not a showstopper. The second issue is that the inverter is either an extra IC or an extra transistor. The more components the board has, the harder it is for a novice to assemble. This solution was put aside, labeled "worst case". A search of a better one went on.
</p>
<p>This device will not produce data very quickly, so it is safe to run the <span>UART</span> super slowly. So, then the UART TX pin can be low-pass-filtered on the way to the USB-to-serial chip. That same pin can then be used for SD card's <span>nCS</span>, as long as the commands are short and the clock rate is high enough that the selection time is below what the low-pass filter will permit through. This solution is workable but fragile. Once the math is worked out for the baudrate necessary to permit card initialization as per spec, it gets sadder. The UART would need to be run at a 300 bps rate or slower to make this work. And even then, it is fragile if the card decides to be slow, since the SD spec's SPI chapter does not technically allow deselecting the card while waiting for it to read data. No, this was even worse than the first option.
</p>
<p>Before surrendering to the first option, there was a crazier yet option to consider. Would the SPI RAM at all mind being selected and then deselected with no commands or data in between? Experimentation provides the answer: no. This test passed on all the SPI RAM chips. Why? Well, besides SPI, SD cards also speak the SDIO protocol. Instead of using four unidirectional wires, this protocol uses one unidirectional <span>CLK</span> signal and two bidirectional signals: <span>CMD</span> and <span>DAT</span>. The four-bit-wide version uses three more data pins, but that does not matter here. Unlike SPI, this protocol is not quite documented in the public SD documentation, but it is not too hard to figure out. Using one fewer pins is nice, but there were <em>no</em> free pins, and this approach would have needed three, so this was not immediately useful. Before trying to make it <em>useful</em>, it had to first be make to work at all. After some time, this was done and a working implementation of SDIO 1-bit protocol was produced. It successfully initialized and accessed all SD cards tried. Cool.
</p>
<p>So, which pins could be combined with SDIO's three? After much thinking, the solution is obvious. RAM's <span>nCS</span> can be the SD card's <span>CLK</span>. RAM's <span>CLK</span> can be the SD card's <span>CMD</span>. RAM's <span>MOSI</span> can be the SD card's <span>DAT</span>. Try and figure out all the possible interactions with each device and what that would look like to the other, to convince yourself that it will work safely. When the RAM is selected, the SD card will see its <span>CLK</span> go down, when RAM is deselected, the SD card will see its <span>CLK</span> go up. The RAM's SPI is configured for mode 3, which means that its <span>CLK</span> idles high. This, in turn, means that every RAM access, no matter how short, is seen by the SD card as a single bit sent to it, a <span>1</span> bit. This is the idle state of the SDIO's <span>CMD</span> line between commands, and this is safe. SD cards do not drive or read the <span>DAT</span> line between commands so the movement of the RAM's <span>MOSI</span> will be ignored. Good so far. Accessing the SD card requires toggling its <span>CLK</span> line, while reading or writing its <span>CMD</span> and <span>DAT</span> lines. To the RAM, this will look like it is being selected and deselected with nothing in between happening. This is safe. Cool!
</p>
<p>It should be noted that this will only work if the entire SD transaction is done to completion at a time without any intervening RAM accesses. This means that multi-block reads or writes cannot be used. This is acceptable given the pin deficit. Well, there it is, a potentially working solution! Experimental verification followed. Success! Of course, the STM32G031 does not have the proper pinout to use any hardware unit for this, so the SD accesses are entirely bit-banged. This is acceptable, and my assembly code to do this achieved about 14 CPU cycles per bit throughput. Overall, not too bad.
</p>
<h3>The Console again</h3>
<p>Now that it was clearly established that all the I/O could, at least in theory, fit into 6 pins, it was time to assign things to pins. Some of that was trivial: the RAM needs real SPI so those are the pins. The SD card shares the RAM's pins so that's clear too. Left over were pins 7 and 8. These pins make up the SWD interface, which was convenient for early debugging. Also, by process of elimination, they needed to be the serial port. Pin 8, as <span>A14</span> can act as <span>USART2.TX</span>, and with USART's "pin swap" functionality enabled, this can be turned into <span>USART2.RX</span>. This is good, since UART receive is a pain to do without hardware assistance. That leaves pin 7 as my <span>TX</span> pin. This pin has no alternate functions related to any USART at all. Well, luckily, it is not too hard to bit-bang UART transmission. This is ironic - an earlier approach called for an as-slow-as-possible UART baudrate. Bit-banging UART calls for an as-fast-as-possible baudrate since the entire world needs to stop while the transmission is going on. Sending every character at 115,200bps will take 87 microseconds. In theory, a very slow baudrate could be used, with timer-driven interrupts use to send bits of each character, but the jitter in interrupt timing could cause issues. Anyways, most of the time the board is not outputting anything, so it is OK as is. Bit-banging UART transmit works well. Pins are assigned. Time to get to the software.
</p>
<p>But, you might say, what about initial flashing? Surely STM's bootloader will not support using these weird pins for initial flashing? Indeed, that is the case. This is why the board has four solder bridges that configure the wiring for the serial port. In one configuration, the bootloader will work but RAM and SD card will not and cannot work, in the other, the ROM bootloader is no longer useful but the project will boot. Luckily, this project includes its own bootloader, so the ROM bootloader is not needed after the initial flashing.
</p>

<h2>The software story</h2>
<h3>The Emulator</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plConsole.png"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plConsoleSmall.png"></a></p><p>I <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">did already have</a> a MIPS emulator that could boot Linux, written in ARMv6M assembly. Reusing this would be trivial. In search of more speed, I actually wrote a MIPS-to-ARMv6M JIT, which worked well. The tragedy is that it was too big (compiling to 46KB of code) and did not produce that much speed gain with only 6KB of translation cache to be of use on this project. It was shelved, until another time.
</p>
<p>The 32KB of flash in the STM32G31 was split into an 8KB area for the bootloader and a 24KB area for the main code. The rest was simply polish. The main emulator code remains as it was before.
</p>
<h3>The Bootloader</h3>
<p>Why was there a need for a bootloader? Well, there were no pins left for debugging, there was a need to find a way to update the firmware to fix bugs or add features. The simplest solution would be a bootloader that can use the SD card, understand FAT filesystem, and apply an update from it if it finds it. That is precisely the solution chosen. The reason that the bootloader is a whopping 8KB in size (well, actually 6.5KB, but flash blocks are 2KB so it gets rounded up) is that it must include a full SDIO driver, FAT filesystem driver, flash writing code, and lots of logging to help debug any issues that come up. Of course, it also includes a copy of the bit-banged UART transmit code. The word at offset 16 in the application image is considered a version number and an update will only be applied if its version is higher than the current application's version and it passes some basic checks. The byte at offset 8 in the bootloader is the bootloader version. This is not used for any way other than displaying in the main app's boot text. The firmware update is applied if it passes all tests and is called <span>FIRMWARE.BIN</span>.
</p>
<p>The bootloader itself runs after the chip is reset, so it runs at 16MHz. The main application can run at various CPU speeds, to allow everyone to experiment with overclocking. However, there needs to be a failsafe way to change the speed, and manually recompiling the image each time seemed like too much of a drag. This is solved  easily. The bootloader already mounts the FAT filesystem on the card to look for firmware updates. While doing that, it also looks for any file or directory whose name begins with <span>CLOCK</span>. If found, the numbers following the name are used the clock rate for the main application. If the number is out sane range (32-200MHz), or no such file is found, 132 MHz is used. Yes, 132MHz. More on that later.
</p>
<h3>Card partitioning and the boot process</h3>
<p>Same as in my previous MIPS-emulating projects, the boot process is reminiscent of the PC boot process. The first sector of the card is read into the first bytes of RAM and jumped to. It may then load the next stage. It does so by looking for a partition with type <span>0xBB</span> and loading it into ram at address <span>0x80001000</span> and then jumping to it. There, lives the second-stage bootloader. It is large enough to contain logging and console output. It will look for a partition marked as active, attempt to mount it as <span>FAT16</span>, and find a file there called <span>VMLINUX</span>. If it is found, it is loaded as an ELF file and its entry point is jumped to. If this is a valid Linux kernel, it will then boot. The commandline passed to the kernel is embedded in the bootloader since it is not expected to change. It instructs the kernel to mount <span>/dev/pvd3</span> as root and use <span>/sbin/uMIPSinit</span> as init. It will try to mount <span>/dev/pvd1</span> as <span>/boot</span>
</p>
<p>A careful read of the above paragraph would show that while the rootfs needs to be the third partition, no other order is specified or matters. This is on purpose. For this project, the FAT partition is first, the bootloader partition second, and rootfs third. Why? When an SD card with multiple partitions is inserted, Windows and macOS will mount the first partition. Linux will mount them all. This means that (1) the FAT partition can be used to easily get files in and out of this machine as they are also visible to the booted Linux in <span>/boot</span> and (2) clock speed changing/overclocking is easy from the host machine <em>and/or</em> from the booted Linux itself.
</p>
<p>The first thing the bootloader does is simply wait six seconds without doing anything. This is done before reconfiguring the pins. The delay allows for some time to attach an SWD debugger, if so desired (the board has a 4-pin header for that). After this delay, the pins are reconfigured and there are no more pins assigned to SWD, and thus a debugger cannot be attached anymore. As a secondary backup, the bootloader configures the option bytes to allow forcing the chip to boot from ROM by raising the <span>BOOT0</span> pin (pin 8). It also programs the option bytes to disable the reset pin (it is being used as a GPIO) and to disable the BOR (it is of no use here). Then it will try to initialize comms with the SD card and check for updates, then it will boot.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>STM32G031 is specified to run at 64MHz, so why all this talk about running it at 150MHz? Well, with the proper application of dark magic, STM32G031 overclocks quite well. The CPU core runs from an internal regulator whose voltage is adjusted using the <span>PWR-&gt;CR1</span> register. STM documents two settings: <span>VOS2</span> (corresponding to <span>Vcore</span> of 1.0V) where the chip can only be run up to 16MHz and <span>VOS1</span> (corresponding to <span>Vcore</span> of 1.2V) where the chip can only be run up to 64MHz. Indeed, at <span>VOS1</span>, the chip will not run well past about 75MHz. A respectable overclock, but not that exciting. However.... older documentation (and documentation of similar chips) also mentions <span>VOS0</span>, corresponding to <span>Vcore</span> of 1.35V. What if one tries? Well, what do you know? It works, and the chip gets a <em>LOT</em> more overclockable. Now, most instances of the chip run well at 136MHz, and some get to 180MHz. You do need to manage the flash wait states correctly, since the flash memory will not magically get any faster. The extra wait states do eat into the speed gains, but it is still worth it.
</p>
<p>At 148MHz host CPU speed, the emulated MIPS CPU is approximately equivalent to a 1.65MHz MIPS R3000 with FPU disabled. It is not a speed beast, but it does boot in about a minute, and things like <span>vi</span>, <span>make</span>, <span>objdump</span>, and <span>gcc</span> work. This is a full Debian system, so you can bring in <span>.deb</span> packages via <span>/boot</span> and install them even. It all works.
</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plNakedBoard.png"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plNakedBoard.png"></a>
<a name="_TOC_7a077d612f50226cff67a767f4b8af00"></a></p><h3>Acquisition</h3>
<p>You can buy the parts yourself and get a board made by your favourite board house (all the things you need are in the downloads below), or (I hope) you'll be able to buy a kit soon. I am looking for a company that wants to sell the kit. <a href="mailto:contact@dmitry.gr">Contact me</a> if you have a lead on this. They would make great gifts!
</p>
<h3>Initial assembly</h3>
<p>The part you came here for: how to build your own. Here you see the board you are likely holding in your hands. It is pretty easy to assemble, and this is by design. The first thing you solder in should be the SD card socket. Line it up carefully in the box and solder the pins one at a time, then solder the four corner pads that hold it to the board. These take a bit more heat so be patient. Next, solder in all the capacitors. There are four and they are all the same value so it is easy. They go into slots labeled <span>C1</span> through <span>C4</span>. Next up, solder in all the resistors. They are also all the same value for ease of assembly. They go into places labeled <span>R2</span> through <span>R7</span> (there is no R4). Do not fill in slots <span>R101</span>, <span>R102</span>, <span>R201</span>, and <span>R202</span> yet.
</p>
<p>Next up, solder in the microcontroller (STM32G031J6). It goes into the place labeled <span>U1</span>. Direction matters here. On these, the first pin is labeled by a little image of the STM logo. On the board, pin 1 is labeled using a small circle inside the outline as well as outside of it. Rotate the chip correctly and solder it in. Next, solder in the USB-to-serial chip (PL2303GL). It goes into the slot labeled <span>U3</span>. On this chip, pin one is indicated by a little dimple in the corner on top of the chip. Line that up with the board's pin 1 marker and solder it in.
</p>
<h3>Secondary assembly</h3>
<p>At this point in time, you must program the bootloader into the microcontroller. To do this, use STM's "flasher" utility. You'll need a USB-C cable. To connect the proper pins to the serial port, you'll need to use two pieces of wire (or just solder) to bridge the places labeled <span>R101</span> and <span>R201</span> on the board. Make sure you do <em>not</em> have an SD card inserted into the onboard socket and you did not yet solder-in the RAM chip. Then, plug the cable into your computer and insert the board carefully <em>into</em> the USB-C end of the cable. The PC should detect a virtual serial port and install drivers automatically. Now you'll need the flasher utility. You may get it <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html">here</a> for windows. There is an open-source alternative with other platform support <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash/">here</a>. If you build that tool, the process is the usual one: <span>./configure &amp;&amp; make</span>. Using it is easy too: <span>./stm32flash -w BOOTLOADER.BIN -v /dev/ttyUSB0</span>, assuming those names and paths are correct for your use case. If you have an SWD debugger you may instead use it to program the bootloader into the chip. From the download package, grab "BOOTLOADER.BIN" and have that programmed into the chip.
</p>
<p>At this point, remove the solder bridges or wires you used to bridge <span>R101</span> and <span>R201</span> and instead bridge <span>R102</span> and <span>R202</span>. This is the proper final configuration for the serial port pins. Solder in the RAM chip now (APS6408 or VTI7064), marked <span>U2</span>. Pin 1 on this chip is also marked with a small dimple. Match that up with the small circle on the board and solder the chip in. This concludes the hardware assembly.
</p>
<h3>Flashing the main firmware and first boot</h3>
<p>Use a disk imaging tool (<a href="https://win32diskimager.org/">WIN32 DISK IMAGER</a> for windows, built-in "Disk Utility" for macOS, dd for Linux) to write the provided disk image unto an SD card of at least 1GB in size. This image includes the first-stage MIPS bootloader, the second-stage MIPS bootloader, a partition with the Linux kernel and a copy of the firmware, and a debian rootfs. After the card is written, eject it and reinsert it. Your PC should now recognize the FAT filesystem and mount it. Drop the main firmware into it from the download package, named FIRMWARE.BIN. This will allow the bootloader to pick it up and self-flash it on first boot. This step is not necessary if you did not rebuild it, as the provided image already contains that file there. It is, however, safe to do it anyways. You're done!
</p>
<p>Insert the SD card, connect the cable to the PC again, open your favourite serial terminal, and configure it for 115,200 bps, 8N1. After a few seconds you'll see text appear as the various stages of bootloaders run. The very first time, STM32's fuses will be programmed and you may need to unplug and replug the USB-C cable to continue the boot process. This will only need to happen once since the fuses are nonvolatile. After about 20 seconds, the Linux kernel boot messages will start. The boot process will take about a minute. At the end you'll end up at a shall prompt. As there is only 8MB of RAM, making <span>swapon /swapfile</span> your first command is strongly suggested. This will take a few dozen seconds to complete, but after it you'll have swap and ability to run a lot more things. Play around. Enjoy!
</p>


<h2>Downloads and Use</h2>
<h3>The files</h3>
<p>The main download is [<a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/uMIPS.8PL.zip">here</a>]. That is an archive that contains everything you need. The <span>schematics</span> directory contains the schematics, <span>gerbers</span> contains the gerbers you'd need to have boards made, and <span>srcs</span> contains the sources of the emulator and the bootloader. In the <span>binaries</span> directory you'll find the SD card image (<span>SD.img</span>) that you'll want to write directory to your card, <span>BOOTLOADER.BIN</span> is the bootloader you'll write to the chip in the middle of assembling the project, and <span>FIRMWARE.BIN</span> is a pre-built firmware image (a copy of which is already in <span>SD.img</span>'s first partition). 
</p>
<h3>Using it</h3>
<p>The device boots to a shell prompt using <span>sh</span>. You may start bash if you wish - it works. To not run out of RAM, as mentioned above, it is advisable to enable swap. A pre-made swapfile is in the image, simply run <span>swapon /swapfile</span> as one of your first commands. The effective CPU speed is about 1.5MHz assuming you're running the MCU at 120MHz, so go keep in mind that commands will take time. Compiling a simple program with gcc will take a few minutes, but it will work. Provided examples include two Mandelbrot set generators (floating point and fixed point), compiled and binary both.
</p>
<p>The usual tools are installed: <span>vim</span>, <span>make</span>, and <span>gcc</span>. All the usual debian packages are there too, and you can load more things using the shared FAT16 partition on the SD card. Under Linux it is mounted under <span>/boot</span>

<blockquote><p>I feel very comfortable working in a company where you can’t touch anything.</p>
<p>— Walter Forbes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of 1996, Sierra On-Line was still basking in the success of the previous summer’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay"><em>Phantasmagoria</em></a>, the best-selling game it had ever published. With revenues of $158.1 million and profits of $16 million in 1995, the company was bigger and richer than it had ever been. In light of all this, absolutely nobody anticipated the press release that went out from Sierra’s new headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, on February 20. It announced that Sierra would soon “merge with CUC International, Inc., a technology-driven retail and membership-services company that provides access to travel, shopping, auto, dining, home-improvement, financial, and other services to 40 million consumers worldwide. Sierra stockholders will receive 1.225 shares of CUC common stock for each share of Sierra common stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $1.06 billion. The merger is subject to stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.”</p>
<p>As this bombshell filtered down to the gaming sites that were popping up all over <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/06/a-web-around-the-world-part-11-a-zero-sum-game">the young Web</a>, and eventually to the laggardly print magazines, one question was first on the lips of every gamer who read about it. Just who or what was this CUC International anyway? Or, to frame the question differently: if CUC was such a big wheel, why had no one ever heard of it, and why did CUC itself seem to have such a hard time explaining what it actually did?</p>
<p>Time would show the answers to both of those questions to be more complicated and fraught than anyone could have expected. Still, it was clear from the outset that the path to understanding must pass through CUC’s CEO, a sprightly, dapper-looking man of business named Walter Forbes. This particular Forbes was not a member of the wealthy family who owned and operated <em>Forbes</em> magazine, one of the business and investment world’s primary journals of record. That fact notwithstanding, he had been born into decidedly privileged circumstances, and would certainly not have looked out of place with that other Forbes family at a blue-blood country club. Walter Forbes was a titan of industry straight out of Central Casting, from his artfully arranged salt-and-pepper coiffure to the gleaming Gucci loafers he donned on “casual” days. He was as convincing a figure as has ever walked into a corporate boardroom. In a milieu where looking the part of a General Patton of business was a prerequisite to joining the war for hearts, minds, and wallets, Forbes had the role down pat. With a guy like this at its head, how could CUC be anything but amazing? And how could little Sierra count itself anything but fortunate to become a part of his burgeoning empire?</p>
<p>As Forbes himself told the story to a wide-eyed journalist from <em>Wired</em> magazine in 1997, it had all begun for him back in 1973, when, having recently graduated from Harvard Business School, he was eating dinner one evening with some friends and some of his former professors. Somehow the discussion turned to the future of shopping. “Wouldn’t it be neat if we could bypass stores and send products from the manufacturer to the home, and people would use computers to shop?” Forbes recalled “someone” at the table saying. “Everyone forgot about what we talked about that night. Except me.”</p>
<p>Forbes envisioned a scenario in which brick-and-mortar retailers, those traditional middlemen of the chain of commerce, would be replaced by digital storefronts operated by his own company, which was founded in 1973 under the name of Comp-U-Card. According to his own testimony, he mooted various impractical schemes for priming the e-commerce pump before the technology of telecommunications finally showed signs of catching up with at least some of his aspirations circa 1979, the year that <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/a-net-before-the-web-part-1-the-establishment-man-and-the-magnificent-rogue">the pre-Web commercial online services The Source and CompuServe</a> made their debut. Now favoring the acronym CUC over the “Comp-U-Card” appellation — needless to say, nobody would rush to embrace that name today; the evolution of language can be a dangerous thing for corporate branders — Forbes took his company public in 1983, with an IPO that came in at $100 million. His business plan at the time, at least as he explained it fourteen years later, rings almost eerily prescient.</p>
<blockquote><p>Manufacturers would simply send information about their products to [Forbes’s] database company, which would aggregate the data, organize it, and then present it to consumers in an engaging way. When a shopper ordered something, the manufacturer would be notified to ship it directly to the consumer’s home. Since no retailer would be involved, the customer would simply pay the wholesale price, plus shipping charges. The database company would make almost no money on the transactions. Rather, it would make its money by charging the consumer a flat annual membership fee — typically $49 — for access to the data and the chance to buy at such low prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from a few details here and there, this is the way that Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of modern online retail, operates today, right down to the “buyers club” where it makes most of its real money.</p>
<p>But here’s where the waters surrounding Walter Forbes and CUC start to get muddy. (I do hope you packed your diving goggles, because there are a lot of such waters ahead.) For the first ten years after the IPO, CUC actually took very little in the way of concrete steps in pursuit of the proto-Amazonian dream that Forbes had supposedly been nursing since 1973. Instead it administered offline shopping clubs that were marketed via bulk-rate post and telephone cold-calling. This was a sector of the consumer economy that thrived mostly on fine print and the failure of its often elderly customers to do their due diligence, being just one step removed from timeshares on the continuum of shady business models that never turn out to deliver quite what their customers think they are getting; in fact, timeshares soon became a part of CUC’s portfolio too. CUC sold its shopping clubs and other services as turnkey packages that could be purchased and branded by other corporations, thus partially explaining why so few people had ever heard of the company even fourteen years after its IPO. It wasn’t above using guile to retain customers, such as quietly signing them up for automatic recurring billing plans — charges that, it hoped, some portion of its customers who thought they were just making a one-time payment would fail to notice on their credit-card statements. Even the fawning profile in <em>Wired</em> had to acknowledge how close to the ethical edge CUC was prepared to fly.</p>
<blockquote><p>If a customer takes the trouble to call and quit, the CUC telephone operator goes into what any football fan would recognize as a prevent defense. The operator frantically starts explaining the value of the service, then often sacrifices a $20 coupon or check as a bribe to stick around. They will give up ground, but [will] do anything to keep you from reaching that goal line.</p></blockquote>
<p>As late as the year that CUC acquired Sierra On-Line, it was the offline shopping clubs that were still the heart of its revenue stream, the subject that its annual report for the year chose to open with and to return to again and again.</p>
<blockquote><p>CUC International is a leading technology-driven, membership-based consumer services company, providing approximately 66.3 million members with access to a variety of goods and services. The Company provides these services as individual, wholesale, or discount program memberships. These memberships include such components as shopping, travel, auto, dining, home improvement, lifestyle, vacation-exchange [i.e., timeshares], credit-card and checking-account enhancement packages, financial products and discount programs. The Company also administers insurance-package programs which are generally combined with discount shopping and travel for credit-union members, distributes welcoming packages which provide new homeowners with discounts for local merchants, and provides travelers with value-added tax refunds. The Company believes it is the leading provider of membership-based consumer services of these types in the United States.</p>
<p>The Company solicits members for many of its programs by direct marketing and by using a direct sales force calling on financial institutions, fund-raising charitable institutions and associations…</p>
<p>The Company offers Shoppers Advantage, Travelers Advantage, AutoVantage, Dinner on Us Club, PrivacyGuard, Buyers Advantage, Credit Card Guardian, and other membership services. These benefits are offered as individual memberships, as components of wholesale membership enhancement packages and insurance products, and as components of discount-program memberships. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997, approximately 536 million solicitation pieces were mailed, followed up by approximately 70 million telephone calls.</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter Forbes’s digital aspirations that got <em>Wired</em> so hot and bothered are mentioned only in passing in the report: “Some of the Company’s individual memberships are available online to interactive computer users via major online services and the Internet’s World Wide Web.”</p>
<p>Forbes first became associated with Sierra in 1991, when he agreed to join the company’s board. Ken Williams, Sierra’s co-founder and CEO, considered this a major coup, a sign that his little publisher of computer games was <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/01/sierra-at-the-cusp-of-the-multimedia-age">really going places</a> in this new decade of multimedia and cyber-everything. He was excited even though, as he admits in his recent memoir, he “never completely understood Walter’s business. To this day, I can’t completely tell you what it was. There were components of it that made sense — for instance, they owned a company called RCI that facilitated timeshare swapping. They also operated a series of discount shopping clubs, where customers would pay an annual subscription fee, allowing them to buy products at near-wholesale prices. Whatever it was, they were certainly doing something right. They had $2 billion in revenue and over $200 million in profit.”</p>
<p>The voice of Forbes whispering in Ken Williams’s ear was a hidden motivator behind <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online">the spate of acquisitions</a> that the latter pursued during the first half of the 1990s, which saw the American educational-software developer Bright Star, the French adventure-games maker Coktel Visions, the British strategy house Impressions, and the American sim specialists Papyrus and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/01/the-dream-of-flight">subLOGIC</a> all entering the Sierra tent. Having thus hunted down and captured so much smaller prey with Forbes at his side, Williams perhaps shouldn’t have been surprised when his trusted advisor started eying his own company with a hungry look. Nevertheless, when Forbes broached the subject with Ken’s wife Roberta Williams, the designer of Sierra’s flagship <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/07/the-unmaking-and-remaking-of-sierra-on-line"><em>King’s Quest</em> series</a> as well as <em>Phantasmagoria</em> and many other adventure and children’s games, she at least was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Have you and Ken ever thought about selling Sierra?” he asked her out of the blue one day in the lobby of the Paris hotel where they happened to be attending a board-of-directors meeting. (An insatiable connoisseur of French food and wine, Forbes had had enough sway with Ken to convince him to hold the meeting at this distant and expensive location.)</p>
<p>“No,” Roberta answered shortly. “We’re not interested.”</p>
<p>“But if you ever were, what sort of price would you be looking at?”</p>
<p>“A lot,” Roberta replied, then walked away as quickly as decorum allowed. She had the discomfiting feeling that Forbes was a predator probing for a flock’s weak link, and she was determined that it wouldn’t be her.</p>
<p>But when Forbes brought the subject up in a more formal way, at another Sierra board meeting closer to home on February 2, 1996, Roberta’s husband proved far more receptive than she had been.</p>
<p>The only detailed insider account of what happened next and why is the one written by Ken Williams. Needless to say, this must raise automatic red flags for any historian worth his salt. And yet his memoir does appear to be about as even-handed as anyone could possibly expect under the circumstances. To his credit, he owns up to many of his own mistakes with no hesitation whatsoever. While we would be foolish to take his account as the unvarnished gospel truth, he doesn’t strike me as a completely unreliable witness by any means. I think we can afford to take much if not all of what he writes at face value as we ask ourselves what led him to the most monumental decision of his life, excepting only the decision to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/on-line-systems-is-born">found Sierra</a> in the first place all the way back in 1980.</p>
<p>To begin with, Williams admits forthrightly that he was quite simply <em>tired</em> at this juncture of his life, and that his sense of exhaustion made the prospect of selling out and taking a step back more appealing than it might have been just a few years earlier. His fatigue is eminently understandable: Sierra had consumed almost his every waking hour for over fifteen years by this point. He tells us that people had been telling him for ages that he “needed to delegate more, but it just wasn’t in my personality to do so.” More and more as the games got more expensive and the stakes for every new release higher, Williams had felt forced to play the role of the corporate heavy.</p>
<blockquote><p>My visits to Sierra’s development teams were occasionally liked, but not very often. Left to their own devices, the teams would agonize over the games forever. Asking an artist to compromise quality in order to bring the art in on budget is not a win-win for either of us, but it’s something I had to do every day. Shutting down projects, ruining dreams, staring endlessly at spreadsheets, riding on airplanes. That was my life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sierra had become rather notorious these last few years for <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/quest-for-glory-iii-and-iv">shipping games before they were ready</a>. At the end of the day, the decision to do so was Ken Williams’s, but he often believed he had no real choice in the matter at all. For Sierra was now a publicly traded company, and he felt it couldn’t afford the hit to the stock price that would result from not having Game X on the shelves in time for some given Christmas shopping season. Now, the skeptical reader might argue that there were surely ways to improve internal processes such that games weren’t continually falling behind schedule, going over budget, and winding up caught in the “ship it now or die” trap — and such a reader would be absolutely right. But that doesn’t change the state of play on the ground from the perspective of Ken Williams, who was not a good delegater and seemed to lack the turn of mind that was required to implement more rigorous methodologies of game development. This situation being what it was, he hoped that the (apparently) deep pockets of CUC would insulate Sierra somewhat from the vagaries of stock prices and holiday seasons, would give him more leeway to grant a promising game the six more months in the oven it needed to become a great one.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the above, Williams leans heavily on his “fiduciary duty” to his shareholders to explain why he was so willing and even eager to embrace Forbes’s offer. As CEO, he says, he was obliged to maximize his shareholders’ return on their investment, regardless of his personal feelings: “To state it simply, the decision wasn’t mine to make. I had a responsibility to the company’s true owners.” Alas, it’s here that I do have to part ways somewhat with the idea of Ken Williams as a completely reliable witness; this statement does begin to veer into self-serving territory.</p>
<p>The majority of Sierra’s shareholders were of the passive stripe, who had little understanding of the company’s business and were thus very ready to listen when the CEO who had just delivered a record profit told them what he thought they ought to do. And Ken Williams made it abundantly clear to these shareholders that he thought they ought to take the deal.</p>
<p>Yet he did so over the objections of virtually everyone he talked to who <em>did</em> understand Sierra’s business reasonably well. His board of directors was unanimous in its opposition, with the exception only of the member named Walter Forbes. Mike Brochu, Sierra’s hard-nosed president and chief operating officer, who was in many ways the architect of the company’s last couple of years of solid growth and profitability, saw no reason for it to surrender its independence now, just when things were going so swimmingly for it.</p>
<p>Likewise, Jerry Bowerman, a former investment banker who was now vice president for product development, says today that he “pleaded” with Williams to at the very least take a longer, harder look at Forbes and his “company that sells coupons” than he had shown any interest in doing prior to this point; something about CUC, Bowerman says, “made [the] hair stand up on the back of my neck.” In particular, he saw a communist convention worth of red flags in CUC’s habit of <em>just</em> beating its earnings expectations on Wall Street every single quarter: “That’s categorically impossible. Does not happen.” But somehow with CUC it did. “He has a fiduciary responsibility, and the board has a fiduciary responsibility, to take the offer seriously,” acknowledges Bowerman. “What [Williams] never <em>did</em> do was, like, hire an investment bank to say, is this actually a fair offer?”</p>
<p>Even Ken’s own wife Roberta was dead-set against the acquisition: “When Walter asked me, did we ever think of selling the company, and I said no, I meant it. I always had a little bit of intuition about Walter. Not that he was a crook or anything like that. Just… take him with a grain of salt.”</p>
<p>Ken Williams normally listened to his wife. As lots of people knew then and will happily tell you today, Roberta was often the final arbiter of what did and didn’t happen at Sierra, in discussions that took place around the Williams family dinner table long after the lights in the boardroom and executive suites had been extinguished. In this case, however, he ignored her advice, as he did that of so many of his professional colleagues. Instead of taking Walter Forbes with a grain of salt, he took his deal — signed on the dotted line, with no questions asked, selling the company that had been his life’s work to another one whose business model and revenue streams were almost entirely opaque to him.</p>
<p>Doing so was without a doubt the worst decision Ken Williams ever made in his business career, but it wasn’t totally out of character for the man. There’s a theory in pop psychology that every alpha male is really looking to become the beta to an even bigger cock-of-the-walk. Be that as it may, Ken Williams — this man’s man who had the chutzpah to imagine becoming a transformative mogul of mass media, a Walt Disney-like figure — could be weirdly quick to fall under the sway of other men who seemed to embody the same qualities he cherished in himself. Sometimes that worked out okay, as when he met the furloughed police officer Jim Walls through his hairdresser and asked that man who knew nothing of computers or the games they played to join Sierra as a game designer. The three <em>Police Quest</em> games that resulted were… well, it’s hard to really call them&nbsp;<em>good</em> in any fundamental sense, but they were good enough for the times, whilst being fresh and unique in their subject matter when compared with all those other adventure games about dragons and spaceships. At other junctures, however, Williams’s gut instinct led him badly astray, as when he asked the police brutalist <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/chief-gates-comes-to-oakhurst-a-cop-drama">Daryl F. Gates</a> to replace Walls as the personality behind <em>Police Quest</em>, a decision which appalled and outraged most of his own employees and left a stain on Sierra’s legacy that can never be fully expunged.</p>
<p>Just as the aforementioned two men walked and talked the part of the hard-edged, no-nonsense cop in a way that profoundly impressed Ken Williams, Walter Forbes was the very picture of the suave and sophisticated financier, making monumental deals next to a crackling fire in his elegant parlor, a glass of Chianti in hand, before rushing off to Europe in his private jet to take in an opera. For Ken, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta">a working-class striver</a> without any university degree to his name, much less one from Harvard, the idea that a man like this would be so interested in him and his company must have been a very alluring one indeed.</p>
<p>Had Ken Williams followed the advice of Jerry Bowerman and dug a little deeper into Walter Forbes and CUC, he might have learned some things to give him pause. He might have discovered, for example, that Forbes hadn’t founded CUC himself to pursue his grand vision of e-commerce, as the interview in <em>Wired</em> implies; he had rather bought himself a seat on an existing company’s board with a cash investment from his familial store of same, then fomented from that perch a revolt that led to the real founder being defenestrated and Forbes himself taking his place. If nothing else, this did cast Forbes’s willingness to join Sierra’s board and his early chat with Roberta Williams on the subject of an acquisition, as if he was nosing around for a weak link, in rather a different light.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s been an elephant in the room through all of the foregoing paragraphs, one which we can no longer continue to ignore. Once more to his credit, Ken Williams doesn’t fail to mention the elephant in his book: “Personally speaking, it would be a nice payday.”</p>
<p>Ken Williams had grown up with just one dream. It wasn’t to make great games or to revolutionize entertainment or even to become the next Walt Disney, although all of those things were eventually folded into it as the means to an end. It was to become rich — nothing more, nothing less. “Somewhere along the way, I developed an aggressive personality,” he writes of his boyhood and adolescence. “All that I could think about was becoming rich. Note that I said ‘rich,’ not ’employed’ or ‘successful.’ Amongst the few memories I have from that time is the constant thought of wanting to live a different life than the one I grew up in. I read books about business executives who owned yachts and jets, and who hung out with beautiful models in fancy mansions. I knew that was my future and I couldn’t wait to claim it.”</p>
<p>By most people’s standards, Ken and Roberta Williams <em>were</em> rich by the mid-1990s. But most of their wealth was illiquid, being bound up in their company — an arrangement which entailed duties and obligations that were becoming, for Ken at least, increasingly onerous. “It seemed like everyone associated with Sierra except me was having fun,” he says.</p>
<p>I just wrote that the decision to sell to Walter Forbes was the worst business decision Ken Williams ever made. Ironically, though, it was his best decision ever in terms of his private finances. For he sold Sierra when the “Siliwood” craze of which he had been the industry’s most outspoken and articulate proponent — that peculiar melding of computer games with Hollywood movies, complete with live actors and unabashedly cinematic audiovisual aesthetics — was at its absolute zenith; he sold when <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, the latest poster child for the trend, had just become Sierra’s best-selling game ever. The remainder of 1996 — <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/06/toonstruck-or-a-case-study-in-the-death-of-adventure-games">a year which produced no more Siliwood hits</a> on the scale of&nbsp;<em>Phantasmagoria</em>, from Sierra or anyone else — would show that there was only one way forward for “interactive movies” from here, and that way was down. They were <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-5-narratives-of-doom">doomed</a> to be replaced by a very different vision of gaming’s future, emphasizing visceral action, emergent behavior, and player empowerment over the elaborate set-piece storytelling that had been Sierra’s bread and butter for so long.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, signing Walter Forbes’s contract has allowed Ken and Roberta Williams to enjoy that enviable lifestyle that is the preserve of the ultra-wealthy alone, with multiple homes in multiple countries and a boat in which they have cruised around the world several times. Mind you, I don’t say that such a lifestyle was foremost on Ken Williams’s mind when he made the decision to sell; on the contrary, he had every expectation at the time of continuing to manage Sierra for the foreseeable future. I merely say — as if it needs to be said yet again! — that life is seldom black and white.</p>
<p>But we’ve belabored these points enough: Ken secured the preliminary approval of Sierra’s shareholders, signed on the dotted line on their behalf, sent out the press release, then secured their final approval to complete the transaction a few months later. On the face of it, it was indeed a great deal for them: they got to trade in their Sierra stock for 22 percent more shares in CUC, a far bigger, even faster-growing company.</p>
<p>Once all that was behind them, Walter Forbes and Ken Williams and all of their closest associates flew off to Paris in Forbes’s jet to celebrate the acquisition. Some members of the entourage were happier than others. At an expensive Parisian restaurant, Forbes ordered a $5000 bottle of wine, saying it was on him. “I [found] out after the fact, digging around in the accounting system, that he’d expensed it,” says Jerry Bowerman. “So he was just a liar. Just a very fat liar.”</p>

Amazingly, Sierra On-Line wasn’t the only software publisher that Walter Forbes and CUC agreed to purchased during February of 1996. In a way, the other major acquisition turned out to be even more of a plum prize than this one. It was a publisher and distributor of educational software and games called Davidson and Associates. If that name fails to set any bells a-ringing, know that Davidson was itself the proud owner of Blizzard Entertainment, whose <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/06/a-dialog-in-real-time-strategy"><em>Warcraft 2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/07/diablo"><em>Diablo</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/07/starcraft-a-history-in-two-acts"><em>Starcraft</em></a>, combined with <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/01/the-rise-of-pomg-part-1-it-takes-a-village">its innovative Battle.net</a> service for online multiplayer play, would make it the hottest brand in gaming over the course of the next few years, a veritable way of life for millions of (mostly) young men. CUC, this company nobody had ever heard of, was suddenly in possession of a gaming empire with few peers.</p>
<p>But for Ken Williams, the time to come would be filled with far less pleasant surprises than the meteoric ascent of Blizzard. After the acquisitions of Sierra and Davidson were finalized in June of 1996, it slowly and agonizingly dawned on him that he had made a terrible mistake. He learned that Walter Forbes had given the exact same promise of ultimate superiority in the new software arm of CUC to both him and Bob Davidson, the co-founder of Davidson and Associates. Forbes obviously couldn’t honor his promise to both men. Worse, it soon became clear that he favored Davidson whenever push came to shove. Davidson’s people took over most of the marketing and distribution of Sierra’s games, with Williams’s own people being sidelined or laid off. Williams chafed at his newfound beta status, and feuded bitterly if futilely with his de-facto superior. When Sierra failed to come up with another hit to rival <em>Phantasmagoria’</em>s sales in 1996 — a failure which further reduced his standing in the conglomerate as a whole, what with the numbers Blizzard was shifting — he blamed it on Davidson’s logistics and marketing.</p>
<p>Yet he did manage to do Sierra and CUC one great service that year, despite the constraints that were being laid upon him. Late in 1996, he agreed to hear a pitch from a new studio called Valve Corporation, founded by a couple of former Microsoft employees who had never made a game before and who were therefore having trouble gaining inroads with the other major publishers. With his background in adventure games, Williams was intrigued by Valve’s proposal for <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/12/half-life"><em>Half-Life</em></a>, a first-person shooter which, so he was told, would place an unusual emphasis on its story. Even when setting that element of the equation aside, Williams knew all too well that Sierra really, really needed to become a player in the shooter space if it was to survive the popping of the Siliwood bubble. Listening to his gut, he signed Valve to a publishing contract. Well after he left Sierra, <em>Half-Life</em> would become by most metrics the most successful single shooter in history, by a literal order of magnitude the best-selling game that Ken Williams was ever involved with. The landscape of gaming might look vastly different today had he not made that deal; Steam, for instance, was able to come to be only thanks to <em>Half-Life’</em>s publication and success. Not all of Ken Williams’s gut decisions were bad ones. Far from it.</p>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> aside, though, life under the new regime had little to offer him beyond constraints and warning signs. One of the other perks he had been promised, and that in this case was delivered, was a seat on CUC’s board. His first board meeting only reinforced his sense of the cloud of obscurity hanging around CUC’s operations. He realized that he wasn’t the only person sitting at the table who didn’t entirely understand what the company they were all supposed to be overseeing actually did. The other board members, however, didn’t much seem to care. As long as the stock price kept climbing, they were happy to leave it all in the evidently capable hands of Walter Forbes. Ken Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the end of the first hour, we had covered everyone’s golf scores and favorite wines. I was not a golfer and was left out of the discussion. I avoided the game, and was disappointed that these pillars of the business world thought it was important enough to disrupt a board meeting. We finally sat at the table, and vacations were discussed. Walter was asked at some point, “How’s business?” He answered that all was good, followed by hardly anything more. I was waiting patiently for the lights to dim and the projector to light up. It never happened. Instead we were back to conversations having nothing to do with CUC. And then the meeting ended.</p></blockquote>
<p>Feeling out of place among the old-money scions gathered around tables such as this one, tired of having his decisions in the software space countermanded by Bob Davidson, Williams started casting about for someplace else within CUC where he could rule the roost as he had once done at Sierra. He dove deep into another recently acquired company, the e-commerce facilitator NetMarket, which had scored a prominent write-up in <em>The New York Times</em> two years earlier for enabling the first encrypted credit-card transaction — for a Sting CD — ever to take place on the Internet. Yet he was never quite sure of his ground there, and never felt that NetMarket was much of a priority for Forbes — a strange thing in itself, given the way the latter was always rattling on about e-commerce in interviews. Williams had become an executive without a clear role or any clearly delineated scope of authority. It was not a comfortable situation for a man of his personality and predilections.</p>
<p>It might therefore have seemed like good news when Bob Davidson abruptly quit in January of 1997. And yet the circumstances of his resignation were just odd enough that it was hard for even his primary internal rival to feel too sanguine about it. Davidson had had a dream job, running a software empire that had just shipped Blizzard’s <em>Diablo</em> to a rapturous reception. Why had he thrown it away? Williams heard through the grapevine that Davidson had come to Forbes with an ultimatum, demanding that the software arm be spun out from the CUC mother ship to become its own company as the condition of his staying on there. Why had he been so strident about this? Had he discovered something that other people hadn’t? It was almost as if he felt he had to <em>protect</em> the software business from whatever was coming for the rest of the company.</p>
<p>As it happened, Williams was never offered Davidson’s job anyway. It was given instead to one Chris McLeod, a “member of the office of the president and executive vice-president” of CUC with no background in technology, software, or gaming, although he did sport a rather impressive golf handicap.</p>
<p>In May of 1997, Walter Forbes announced his latest deal. CUC was to merge with another company that nobody other than Wall Street investment bankers had ever heard of, one that went by another anonymous-sounding three-letter acronym. But it turned out that HFS (“Hospitality Franchise Systems”) owned a considerable number of brands that actually were household names: Avis Rental Cars, the real-estate chains Century 21, ERA, and Coldwell Banker, and the hotel chains Days Inn, Ramada, Super 8, Howard Johnson’s, and Travelodge. <em>The New York Times</em> diplomatically described CUC, by contrast, as “a powerful but less known force in telemarketing, home-shopping clubs, and travel information.” HFS was far too big for CUC to gobble up like it had Sierra On-Line and Davidson and Associates. This was to be a “merger of equals.”</p>
<p>HFS had been founded in 1990 by an infamously ruthless, hard-charging Wall Street money man named Henry Silverman, who had grown tired of playing “second banana” to the moguls and investors he stood in between. His business plan was deceptively simple: HFS bought brands, then rented them out to others under the franchising model. Said model allowed the company to accrue most of the benefits of running a chain of real-estate firms or rental-car offices or hotels without getting bogged down in most of the responsibilities. Anyone who wished to open a branch of one of these businesses could apply to HFS for a license to use one of its brands. If approved, they would pay a lump sum up-front, followed by ongoing “subscription” fees. In return for their money, they would receive, in addition to the brand itself, guidance on best practices and access to proprietary computer systems. On the stick side of the ledger, they would also need to pass regular inspections, to assure that they didn’t dilute the cachet of the brand they leased. It would be an overstatement to claim that administering such a franchising system was trivial for HFS, but it was much less financially and logistically fraught than actually owning and running thousands of properties all over the country. The Wall Street portfolio managers who had so recently been Silverman’s colleagues ate it up. And why shouldn’t they? An investor who got in on the ground floor with HFS in 1992, when it first went public, would have gotten her money back twenty-fold by the time of the merger with CUC.</p>
<p>HFS was a larger company than CUC in 1997, with a more transparent and more obviously sustainable business model. Although both stock prices were overvalued by any objective measure, sporting fairly outrageous price-to-earnings ratios, you could go out into Main Street, USA, and see the sources of HFS’s revenues right there in bricks and mortar. This was not true of CUC.</p>
<p>Given this reality, those who knew Henry Silverman well would continue to ask themselves for years to come why he had wanted to make this deal in the first place, and why he had failed to look harder into CUC’s business before consummating it. For Silverman, unlike Ken Williams, was not in the habit of letting the gravitational pull of charm, power, and ostentatious displays of wealth trump sober-minded judgment. On the contrary, Silverman was a numbers guy to the core, a classic cold fish who seemed immune to personal charisma when he considered his potential business partners. And yet he allowed Walter Forbes to reel him in almost as easily as Ken Williams had. The player got played: “A master deal-maker bought a pig in a poke,” as <em>Fortune</em> magazine would be writing in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Still, the terms of this deal quite clearly left Silverman rather than Forbes in the catbird seat. The merger agreement stipulated that Silverman would be the CEO of the conjoined venture and Forbes only the chairman of the board until January 1, 2000, after which date the two would swap roles. They would then continue to trade places, in two-year cycles, for as long as they both wanted to keep at it. That said, many of those who knew Henry Silverman best suspected that he never intended to relinquish the position of CEO, that he would find some way to freeze Forbes out when the time came to trade places. In the end, though — and as we’ll see in my next article — other developments would make all of that a moot point. In the meanwhile, Wall Street was all-in; one investment analyst said that it would take “mismanagement for this deal not to work.” She had no idea what a soothsayer she was…</p>
<p>Any merger as big as this one, valued at $14 billion, takes some time to effectuate. It wouldn’t go through until the very end of 1997, by which point Ken Williams would be gone from CUC and from Sierra.</p>
<p>In August of 1997 — “one miserable year after Sierra’s acquisition had been completed,” as he puts it — Williams decided that he had had enough. A proud man, he felt disrespected, even “humiliated,” at that month’s board meeting, where his proposals and all of his attempts to steer the conversation around to actual matters of business had not gone down well. As soon as the meeting adjourned, he sat down at the computer in his office and typed out a letter of resignation. Walter Forbes, this fellow whom Williams had once thought he shared a special bond with as a fellow dynamic man of business, accepted the letter without much comment or expression of regret. It took some time to finalize Williams’s departure with Human Resources, but it was agreed in the end that his last day would be November 1.</p>
<p>So, Ken Williams’s association with Sierra On-Line, the company he had founded and built from the ground up over almost eighteen years, officially ended on November 1, 1997. There was no public or private fanfare — no going-away party, no line of colleagues awaiting a last handshake. Nothing like that. “I just packed my stuff and went home,” he says. Both coincidentally and not so coincidentally, Mike Brochu and Jerry Bowerman, Williams’s right-hand men who had argued so fruitlessly against the acquisition, likewise decided they had had enough at around the same time. This left Sierra as little more than another of Henry Silverman’s brands, in the hands of people who had bought their way into it rather than growing it from the grass roots. They would deign to fund and release a few more games that played in the old Sierra’s worlds, would even employ a few of the old designers to make them. Nevertheless, one can make a compelling argument that the main story of the Sierra that is still so fondly remembered by adventure-game fans today ended on that November 1, 1997, when Ken Williams walked out of his office for the last time, with no one even bothering to tell him goodbye. What followed — and will follow, in the next two articles of this series — was merely the epilogue, or perhaps the hangover; you can pick your own metaphor.</p>
<p>It beggars belief that something so huge — something that touched the lives of so many people who worked for Sierra or played the many, many games of its golden years — could end so anticlimactically, with one unremarkable-looking 43-year-old office worker quietly switching off his computer and driving home. But such is life in the real world. Concluding whimpers are more common than bangs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  

  <p><em><strong>Advisory:</strong> I am not a legal expert and there could likely be inaccuracies in this post.</em></p>
<p>Today Gumroad announced that they’ve become open source, with this being echoed by the founder and on social sites like Hacker News:</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gumroad/status/1908142543100842303" target="_blank"><img src="https://danb.me/blog/images/2025/04/gumroad_x.png" alt="Gumroad X account post announcing 'Gumroad is officially open source!'"></a>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580103" target="_blank"><img src="https://danb.me/blog/images/2025/04/gumroad_hn.png" alt="Gumroad hacker news post titled 'Gumroad is now open source'"></a>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, this <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/main/LICENSE.md">uses a custom license</a> which wouldn’t meet <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">the widely regarded definition of open source</a>, and therefore wouldn’t be widely regarded as open source so calling this open source could be misleading to many.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-not-open-source">Why is it not open source?</h3>
<p>The license <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/d0eaae04935d3cc011dfda29efc822e725d7437b/LICENSE.md?plain=1#L18-L29">sets limits</a> upon open rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small Business and Exempt Organizations <br>
You may use the software under this license only if (1) your company has less than 1 million USD (2024) total revenue in the prior tax year, and less than 10 million USD (2024) GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), or (2) you are a non-profit organization or government entity. Adjust the revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, 1982–1984=100 reference base. If you are a company and exceed either of the limits in (1), your license ends. You may contact the licensor to discuss an alternative license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redistribution is also questionable from my non-legal-expert understanding since the license explicitly allows distribution while also not allowing sublicensing or license transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These parts of the license go against the following requirements of the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">open source definition</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Free distribution</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring the questionable redistribution part of the license, it still limits distribution rights to only those meeting the “Small Business and Exempt Organizations”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3. Derived Works</strong>
<ul>
<li>Again, these are only allowed by those meeting the “Small Business and Exempt Organizations”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</strong>
<ul>
<li>License specifically limits rights provided to those that meet their criteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>7. Distribution of License</strong>
<ul>
<li>This part is questionable as per my quoted line above</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="isnt-this-fair-though-whats-wrong">Isn’t this fair though, what’s wrong?</h3>
<p>Sure! I personally believe that it’s fair for folks to license their own efforts however they wish.
The issue isn’t that the license exists, it’s that it’s misrepresented as open source.</p>
<p>This appears to be another example of a business wanting to use “open source” for its marketing &amp; reputation potential,
while not wanting to give away the rights usually afforded in open source to limit risk.
But it’s the risk taken and rights given by other developers &amp; projects which has given open source that reputation and marketing power.</p>
<p>Not to say that it’s the intention to mislead or be malicious though, this can easily be done by not understanding, or not considering, the commonly regarded open source definition.</p>
<h3 id="to-users-whats-the-actual-difference-compared-to-being-open-source">To users, what’s the actual difference compared to being open source?</h3>
<p>All of the rights provided to users depend on being within the “Small Business and Exempt Organizations” conditions quoted above.
With open source, rights are provided evenly, without specific targeting of software users.</p>
<p>While you may think that the requirements won’t impact normal users, their wider effects can do so.
For example, this could limit possibilities of service providers providing the software as a service, meaning less hosting options for users.
It also can impact forking, a crucial part of open source which allows software to thrive and survive beyond it’s original author, especially on a larger project like this since development &amp; maintenance efforts would be limited to those that fit their conditions.</p>
<p>With the specific wording used here, these conditions may have wider impact than you expect. Looking at <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/d0eaae04935d3cc011dfda29efc822e725d7437b/LICENSE.md?plain=1#L82">their definitions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your company</strong> is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite broad. For example, if you just worked for a $1M revenue company, you wouldn’t have rights to use/modify/redistribute the software as a side project, for self-hosting, or for other uses like a community-project/charity etc…
$1M revenue isn’t a lot when it comes to business, and I think there’s a considerable overlap in admins &amp; developers able to work with the code-base, and those working for $1M+ revenue business.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-solution">So what’s the solution?</h3>
<p>Just don’t call it open source. “Source Available” is a common term for the wider scope of software which has been made available to viewing.
There are some more focused movements like <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a>, <a href="https://fair.io/">fair source</a>, and <a href="https://sourcefirst.com/">source first</a> but I’m not sure it fits into any of those.
The <a href="https://commonsclause.com/">commons clause</a> is kind of similar without a threshold.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a license meeting <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">the OSD</a> could be used instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="aside-problematic-license-wording">Aside: Problematic License Wording</h3>
<p>Upon the mentioned questionable distribution rights of the license, there are other things in this custom license which just appear quite strange.</p>
<p>Firstly, the USD specific condition is just odd. I can’t see any mention of equivalent or other currency. Going by the text, it seems like you might not be subject to some of the conditions if you don’t deal with USD. This requirement is also a bit complex, having to adjust it for inflation following the “United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index”. What if the Bureau of Labor Statistics is dismantled? Wouldn’t say that’s out of the question at the current state of things.</p>
<p>Secondly, the way rights are afforded are a little strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor’s copyright, but only as long as you meet all the conditions below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally licenses provide specific rights, but this allows “everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor’s copyright”. The “licensor” is specifically defined as “Gumroad, Inc.” but this otherwise seems very broadly scoped.
Thinking out a scenario, I could modify the software to consume other content &amp; repos from “Gumroad, Inc.”, then republish that as my own? Usually that’s be infringing on their copyright but here I’ve been provided permissions to infringe their copyright in “everything you might do with the software”. Not sure it’d hold up in court, but seems like a questionable approach to provide rights in a license.</p>

On March 8, 1982, hundreds of admirers lined up outside a funeral home on Manhattan’s Upper East Side to pay their respects to the author and philosopher, basking in their shared love for the queen of selfishness. Inside, a phonograph played jovial turn-of-the-century tunes—Rand called it her “tiddlywink music”—at high volume. Colorful bouquets lined the room, including a six-foot-tall floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign.</p><p>Off to the side, perched on a red plush couch, a man in his late 40s named Leonard Peikoff held court. Skinny and energetic, with groomed hair and thick glasses, he looked every bit the tweedy philosophy professor. He greeted well-wishers and answered questions about Rand’s remarkable life and singular philosophy. A visitor unfamiliar with Rand’s personal history might have assumed he was her son.</p><p>In some ways, he was. Peikoff had attached himself to Rand more than 30 years earlier, when he was just a teenager, and never let go. Both were immigrants of Russian Jewish extraction—she from Russia itself, he by way of Canada—who felt more at home in the salons of New York City than in their countries of origin. Rand called him by the affectionate diminutive “Leonush.” They shared an intensity, a ferocious intellectualism, a love of cigarettes and Viennese operetta, and a combustible mix of ego and insecurity. Rand had demanded total loyalty of her disciples, and Peikoff was the most loyal of all. He had stood by her through ups and downs: her struggle to write her magnum opus, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780613357661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Atlas Shrugged</em></a>; the triumph of publication; the book’s <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2005/01/big-sister-watching-you-whittaker-chambers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dismissive critical reception</a>; and her falling out with some of her closest allies.</p><p>Peikoff’s devotion paid off: Rand designated him as her sole heir. He was not Rand’s original choice; she had promised her inheritance to other followers over the years. But by the time she died, she had alienated all of them. Peikoff was one of the only close friends Rand had left—the person she turned to for day-to-day help, for comfort, and for affirmation that she and her work still mattered.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Managing Rand’s estate would entail more than handling her personal property. By the end of her life, her <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayn-rand/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">philosophy of objectivism</a>—which proclaims the glory of individualism and the evils of altruism—had become a full-blown movement, and it was now Peikoff’s job to guide it forward. Rand’s books sold in the millions, despite their imposing heft. Her angular face and enormous eyes were all over magazines and TV sets in the ’60s and ’70s, and her eccentric charm won over talk-show hosts like Johnny Carson and Phil Donahue. But Rand’s life had always been a mystery. She spoke little of her upbringing in Russia and kept her personal affairs private. The gap between her cultural ubiquity and the scarcity of information about her created a fascination bordering on obsession among both fans and detractors. The person in charge of her property—her diaries, her letters, the copyrights to her books—would wield great power over how Rand would be remembered.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The inheritance was also a windfall for Peikoff. Rand’s estate was worth an estimated half a million dollars at the time of her death, and her copyrights would eventually bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in royalties. Peikoff, a lifelong advocate of autonomy and self-reliance, would never have to worry about money again.</p><p>After the funeral service, Peikoff asked to be left alone with the casket. Like Rand, he was a strident atheist; he knew she couldn’t hear him. Still, he spoke aloud to her, promising that he would live up to the responsibility she’d bestowed on him. He swore to keep her philosophy “pure,” and to make sure that her work lived on. “It was a vow,” he later said, “which I spent the rest of my life carrying out.”</p><p>Fulfilling that promise would come at a cost. His quest to defend Rand’s legacy would provoke&nbsp;nasty brawls with other objectivists. And his stewardship of her estate would lead to a painful conflict closer to home: Four decades after Rand’s death, Peikoff has found himself mired in an ugly legal battle with his own daughter. The dispute has left him estranged from friends and surrounded by courtiers, much like Rand at the end of her life. Peikoff’s Lear-like proclamations and denunciations have riveted the objectivist community. The chaos has risked damaging the legacy he swore to protect. And like many tragedies, this one is marked by a dark irony: A man devoted to the principle of individualism has ended up living a life defined by a reliance on others.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>Leonard Peikoff was born</span> in Winnipeg in 1933. His father, a Russian immigrant, was a surgeon whom Peikoff admired for his success but resented for his volatility and abusiveness; Peikoff would later compare him to a “dictator of the Soviet Union.” His mother was loving, but not intellectual in the way that Peikoff valued. He did well in school but struggled to make friends; the other kids called him “the brain.” When Peikoff was young, in a bizarre incident that made the local newspapers, he and his younger brother got swept out to sea in a rowboat and were not rescued until the next day. According to Peikoff, they spent the night talking about labor unions.</p><p>As a teenager, Peikoff agonized over what to do with his life. His father wanted him to become a doctor, but Peikoff had no interest in medicine; he wanted to study philosophy. Growing up meant choosing realism over idealism, his father always said. But Peikoff remained an idealist. Could he nonetheless find a way to make a living? The question tormented him.</p><p>When he was 15 or 16, he read <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780452286757" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Fountainhead</em></a>, the 1943 best seller that had made Rand famous. Reading the book was “like putting an electric plug into the wall,” Peikoff said later, after “waiting to be connected to some source of power.” The novel, which tells the story of an idealistic architect who would rather see his creation destroyed than compromise his vision, lays out a blueprint for living and working on one’s own terms. “It was like a ray of hope, a beacon—if I could understand it fully,” Peikoff told an interviewer in the 2004 documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XMYs2t1MJw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Leonard Peikoff: In His Own Words</em></a>. Peikoff would boast that he’d memorized the whole book.</p><p>Once a year, Peikoff’s father allowed him to travel to a U.S. destination of his choice. In 1951, during the spring of his freshman year at the University of Manitoba, he took the train to Los Angeles to visit his cousin Barbara Weidman. She had a connection to Ayn Rand through her boyfriend, Nathan Blumenthal—another child of Russian Jewish immigrants, who would later change his name to Nathaniel Branden—and Peikoff hoped to meet the author of his favorite book. The chance to ask his nagging question about idealism versus pragmatism was too good to pass up, and soon after his arrival Weidman and Blumenthal arranged a meeting.</p><p>Peikoff was nervous as their car approached Rand’s imposing ranch house in the San Fernando Valley, where she lived with her husband, Frank O’Connor. Once inside, Peikoff endured a minute or two of small talk before blurting out “Let’s get down to business” and asking his question: Can an idealist live pragmatically? Rand didn’t just take him seriously; she treated his question as the most urgent one in the world, fixing him with her black eyes and dissecting the dilemma with precise logic. Rand told him there was no contradiction between idealism and pragmatism—in fact, they were mutually supportive. As Peikoff later summarized it, “The more moral you are, the more successful you are.” Rand then brought up various counterarguments and shot those down too. Then she critiqued Peikoff’s method of thinking, explaining why he had not come up with the answer on his own. By the time she stopped talking, half an hour had passed.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Photo764726481091_inner_23-292-723-292-23-761-741-773.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 982px) 928px, (min-width: 786px) calc(100vw - 54px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ovKmkx1wWKCdhVjlj0YjYKfHuIc=/0x0:2835x1900/640x429/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726481091_inner_23_292_723_292_23_761_741_773-1/original.jpg 640w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nG39pEfIT9HPbYtEW6EcUlQFUgQ=/0x0:2835x1900/750x503/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726481091_inner_23_292_723_292_23_761_741_773-1/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/MvI6Zqutg6CbBiZ9pnwTKBExJZE=/0x0:2835x1900/850x570/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726481091_inner_23_292_723_292_23_761_741_773-1/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/x_YlyieBqZL6_2PdMmT2lp3z9uE=/0x0:2835x1900/928x622/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726481091_inner_23_292_723_292_23_761_741_773-1/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nYQEBtsEY-JbX9_5yEG3mLKVNTo=/0x0:2835x1900/1536x1030/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726481091_inner_23_292_723_292_23_761_741_773-1/original.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nKoOJJ2b9dcozIbjwx60g0J4a5o=/0x0:2835x1900/1856x1244/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726481091_inner_23_292_723_292_23_761_741_773-1/original.jpg 1856w" src="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/ayn-rand-peikoff-inheritance-battle/682219/Photo764726481091_inner_23-292-723-292-23-761-741-773.jpg" width="928" height="622"></picture><figcaption><p>Courtesy of Kira Peikoff</p><p>Peikoff first read <em>The Fountainhead </em>as a teenager.

Rand had given him something to live for: an entire worldview built on rationality and individual freedom. The world seemed good and full of possibility. His self-doubt was gone. Philosophy wasn’t just a way of thinking; it was a way of living. Peikoff knew that everything would be different from then on. That night, as he washed his hands, he thought to himself that he’d even have to find a new way to wash his hands now that he’d met Rand.</p><p>He returned to Winnipeg and spent two more years at the University of Manitoba. His father was still pushing for him to go into medicine, so before senior year, Peikoff made a deal with him: He would move to New York City, where Rand had relocated, and study philosophy at NYU for a year. Then he would come home to Winnipeg and become a doctor. “Of course, I never came home,” he later said.</p><p>In New York, his real studies began. By day, Peikoff would go to class. By night, he would visit Rand in her apartment. The gatherings of Rand’s growing inner circle, cheekily referred to by its members as the Collective, would become much mythologized. At the time, Rand was working on her novel <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>. Rand intended <em>Atlas</em> as a rollicking epic and the definitive statement of her philosophy, and expected it to be an even bigger triumph than <em>The Fountainhead</em>. At her Saturday-night gatherings, she would share the latest section, and the group—which included the now-married Barbara and Nathaniel Branden, as well as the young economist Alan Greenspan, whom Rand called “the Undertaker” for his dour mien—would offer feedback and discuss the philosophical points at hand.</p><p>Peikoff would also visit Rand alone once or twice a week to talk philosophy late into the night. As he described it in interviews years later, he would often leave her apartment as late as 4 a.m. and walk to the elevator, only for her to delay him to make a final point, yelling down the hall as Peikoff kept calling the elevator and sending it back. “I don’t know why the neighbors didn’t kill us,” he said in the 2004 documentary about his life. He’d then rush home to scribble it all down.</p><p>Week by week, Peikoff’s understanding of Rand’s philosophy grew. He would bring her questions about his lessons at school, and she would set him straight. Rand had little patience for modern philosophy, which she saw as a dunghill of subjectivity and moral relativism. According to Rand, the truth was knowable and could be discovered through reason, hence the name she gave her philosophy: objectivism. Rand also argued, famously, that people should act in their own self-interest and never make sacrifices for others, and that the system that best promotes individual flourishing is laissez-faire capitalism. Peikoff’s questions sometimes drove Rand nuts—she couldn’t understand why someone wouldn’t see things her way—but he endured her tantrums in exchange for wisdom. Peikoff said he learned “ten times more” during those bull sessions than from getting his Ph.D.</p><p>Peikoff had never had much success with women, and Rand offered to act as matchmaker. Reading through her mountains of fan mail, she and members of her circle kept an eye out for young women who might be a good fit. In 1955, they found a promising candidate: an aspiring actor and dancer named Daryn Kent. On their first date, Peikoff and Kent talked for hours about their shared admiration for Howard Roark, <em>The</em> <em>Fountainhead</em>’s protagonist. The two started dating and moved in together. (Kent also began working for Rand as a typist.) “I was in love with her,” Peikoff later said. According to Rand, love is inherently selfish: You love someone not as an act of altruism but because they share your values and make you feel good. If your morals are aligned, Rand argued, sexual attraction follows.</p><p>One day, Kent arrived at Rand’s apartment to find a group of Collective members, including Peikoff, sitting in a circle waiting for her. They had decided that she wasn’t right for Peikoff. Branden kicked off what amounted to a struggle session, interrogating Kent for hours about her psychology and personal life, including her sexual behavior, according to Anne C. Heller’s biography, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781400078936" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ayn Rand and the World She Made</em></a>. Mortified, Kent committed to undergoing psychotherapy with Branden. But it was over between her and Peikoff; she moved out that night. Peikoff later said that he regretted the outcome, but that a prestigious member of the group—likely Branden—had “pressured me, in a way that I shouldn’t have been, into it.”</p><p>Still, the excitement of being part of the Collective during this creatively fertile period for Rand overrode other considerations for Peikoff. When Rand finally finished writing <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> in March 1957, the Collective celebrated it like an atheist Second Coming, popping champagne and staying up late. Peikoff predicted that the book would usher in a new era of political liberty and laissez-faire capitalism. Around that time, Peikoff would later recall, he and Rand were walking along Madison Avenue toward the office of her publisher when Rand turned to him and said: “Don’t ever give up what you want in life. The struggle is worth it.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">R<span>and and the Collective</span> expected <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>to be hailed as a masterpiece. They were shocked when, upon its publication in October 1957, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.salon.com/2013/08/08/conservatives_once_ridiculed_ayn_rand/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">almost every major outlet panned it</a>. (“I had to flog myself to read it,” the <em>National Review</em> founder William F. Buckley Jr. said.) Although the novel would become a perennial best seller and one of the most influential books of all time—second only to the Bible, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/books/book-notes-059091.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">one national poll</a>—the critical reception felt like a blow. Rand sank into a depression, growing paranoid and intolerant of dissent, according to Heller’s biography. She expelled second-guessers from her circle. The Collective members who survived the purges became tighter than ever; in the early ’60s, many of them, including Peikoff, moved into the same high-rise on East 34th Street.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Even if Peikoff was Rand’s most devoted follower, he was not assumed to be her successor. That title belonged to Nathaniel Branden, whom Rand referred to as her “intellectual heir.” Rand made no secret of her favoritism, once describing the Collective “as a kind of comet, with Nathan as the star and the rest as his tail.” Starting in the late ’50s, with Rand’s blessing, Branden began teaching courses on objectivism under the banner of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, or NBI. (Rand didn’t want him to use her name, lest she have to answer for his errors.) Branden organized her ideas into a series of digestible lectures, giving her philosophy both structure and mainstream appeal.</p><p>If operating in Branden’s shadow bothered Peikoff, he didn’t say so. In Branden’s memoir, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780787945138" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>My Years With Ayn Rand</em></a>, he describes Peikoff as nervous and sycophantic, and recalls Peikoff telling him how lucky Rand was to have him around. (Branden couldn’t understand, he writes, “how someone so intelligent could be so lacking in independence.”) Still, an element of competition existed between the two. Rand would often make an example of Peikoff, berating him in front of the group to show what happened to people who held the wrong ideas. In 1963, Peikoff went to teach at the University of Denver for two years—a fate that Branden characterized as “exile” after Peikoff had antagonized Rand with some perceived error. According to a member of the circle quoted in Heller’s biography, Peikoff once said, “I would let her step on my face if she wanted.”</p><p>What Peikoff did not realize—or did not want to realize—was that Rand and Branden were carrying on an affair. Starting in late 1954, with the permission of their spouses, the two began seeing each other romantically, despite the fact that Rand was 25 years older than Branden. The affair, as recounted in Branden’s memoir, was passionate and tempestuous, full of jealousy and psychological games. When Branden finally ended it, in 1968, Rand, who was then 63, responded with a barrage of verbal abuse and slaps in the face. She banished Branden from her circle and denounced him publicly, claiming that he’d betrayed the principles of objectivism, exploited her financially, and—perhaps worst of all—engaged in “irrational” behavior. She also cut Branden out of her will, telling Barbara that she was the new heir, until they, too, fell out soon after.</p><p>Peikoff apparently had no idea about the affair. (It wasn’t revealed publicly until 1986, after Rand’s death, when Barbara Branden published a salacious biography, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780385243889" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Passion of Ayn Rand</em></a>.) But Rand’s explanation for the banishment was enough for Peikoff. He became Rand’s enforcer, spreading the word that the Brandens were no longer welcome within objectivism. At his own lectures, Peikoff would make students sign pledges to not engage with the Brandens or their work, according to Barbara’s book.</p><p>With both Brandens gone, Peikoff rose to fill the vacuum at Rand’s side. He offered lectures on objectivism, just as Nathaniel Branden had. Under Rand’s guidance, he also began working on a book of his own, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780452011175" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Ominous Parallels</em></a>, about the ways in which America’s subjectivist culture had come to resemble that of prewar Germany. According to Heller’s biography, Rand used the book-writing process to control Peikoff. She put him through an editorial gauntlet, requiring revision after revision. Peikoff later credited Rand with teaching him how to write.</p><p>In 1971, Peikoff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/03/archives/susan-ludel-is-bride-of-professor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">married Susan Ludel</a>, a journalist who’d taken an interest in Rand’s ideas; at the wedding, Rand, who never had children of her own, was the matron of honor. “I think she regarded him as a son,” Ludel later told an interviewer. Peikoff saw his relationship with Rand that way too. “She was my guide and my support when I was down or unhappy with graduate school, or if I had troubles, even down to financial troubles,” he later said. “She was, in effect, my mother for many, many years.” It was around this time that Rand made a new will, designating Peikoff and another follower named Allan Blumenthal as her heirs.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Photo764726453821_inner_38-328-708-328-82-894-691-886.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 982px) 928px, (min-width: 786px) calc(100vw - 54px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OcWaArNkr33uVzZkCXYJuDKfUhM=/0x0:2701x2386/640x566/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726453821_inner_38_328_708_328_82_894_691_886/original.jpg 640w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/XApQTgwQoU-grZHy9nK2ZYgrHAo=/0x0:2701x2386/750x663/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726453821_inner_38_328_708_328_82_894_691_886/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nrnpztrJJf3tkfQDD2ESyRItvo8=/0x0:2701x2386/850x751/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726453821_inner_38_328_708_328_82_894_691_886/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/z4kNcS7VJJDV-6NtNsNhUjs4NvY=/0x0:2701x2386/928x820/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726453821_inner_38_328_708_328_82_894_691_886/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Hl9bbPopk8-O-oc7RJpCDuUzsoU=/0x0:2701x2386/1536x1357/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726453821_inner_38_328_708_328_82_894_691_886/original.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/xJpOwYb-1NM_GtGKt47vtjD-wgg=/0x0:2701x2386/1856x1640/media/img/posts/2025/03/Photo764726453821_inner_38_328_708_328_82_894_691_886/original.jpg 1856w" src="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/ayn-rand-peikoff-inheritance-battle/682219/Photo764726453821_inner_38-328-708-328-82-894-691-886.jpg" width="928" height="820"></picture><figcaption><p>Courtesy of Kira Peikoff</p><p>Peikoff with his second wife, Cynthia, who once worked as Rand’s secretary.</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In 1973, Peikoff failed to get tenure at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and quit academia. Peikoff claimed his association with Rand had hurt his job prospects—“I was a pariah in the academic world,” he told an interviewer—and he didn’t excel at the “publish or perish” game. Peikoff’s commitment to Rand also strained his marriage. He and Ludel lived in the same building as Rand, and Peikoff continued his late-night discussions with his mentor. In 1978, he and Ludel divorced. Apparently there were no hard feelings: On Ludel’s recommendation, he started dating and soon married Cynthia Pastor, an aspiring psychologist who later became Rand’s secretary.</p><p>Toward the end of her life, Rand fell out with numerous friends—over book reviews, philosophical disagreements, perceived slights—and Peikoff took her side every time. The perpetual conflict was hard on Peikoff, according to Heller, who quotes an unnamed acquaintance saying, “Leonard was destroyed. He was a robot at the end.” When Rand’s scythe finally came for Blumenthal, Peikoff was left as her sole heir.</p><p>In November 1981, Peikoff and Cynthia accompanied Rand to what would be her last lecture, speaking to a group of businessmen in New Orleans. On the train ride home, Rand got sick, and she didn’t get better. She’d been a lifelong smoker and had already undergone lung surgery; she had also been diagnosed with arteriosclerosis, and her heart was failing. In her final weeks, Peikoff attended to her. One Saturday morning, he got a call from the nurse saying he should come quickly. “I ran like a maniac through the New York traffic,” he later recalled, “but by the time I got there she was dead.”</p><p>“It was just unreal to me,” Peikoff went on, describing Rand as “completely irreplaceable. Your mind just couldn’t get around it.” <em>The Ominous Parallels</em>, 12 years in the making, was finally published soon after Rand’s death.&nbsp;Rand had written the introduction, which concluded with a variation on a quote from <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>: “It’s so wonderful to see a great, new, crucial achievement which is not mine!”</p><p>With Rand’s death, Peikoff had lost the most important and controlling force in his life: a woman who demanded complete devotion, to the point of cutting off even his closest relationships. In time, he would find another.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/05/ayn-rand-comes-to-somalia/302209/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">From the May 2001 issue: Peter Maass on Ayn Rand in Somalia</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">R<span>unning Rand’s estate</span> was a full-time job. Peikoff and Cynthia got to work sorting her letters and diaries, which would eventually be published as collections. Rand had wanted to donate her original manuscripts of <em>The Fountainhead</em> and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> to the Library of Congress, but Peikoff kept the first and last pages of the former and hung them on his wall. (Federal agents later seized the pages after Peikoff said in an interview that he “stole” them; the seizure outraged Peikoff.) When she died, Rand had been working on a teleplay of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>. Peikoff shopped around the rights for a film adaptation, a project that would take decades to materialize. And as Rand’s “intellectual heir”—a title that Rand had never officially bestowed upon him, according to Heller, but that he now claimed—Peikoff started working on what would become his definitive contribution to Rand’s legacy, a distillation of her thought titled <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780452011014" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand</em></a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In 1985, Peikoff, now living in Orange County, co-founded the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit based in Marina del Rey, California. The goal, he wrote at the time, was to spread objectivism to a wider audience. The institute sponsored an annual essay contest for high schoolers with prizes in the thousands of dollars, and established an archive for Rand’s papers.</p><p>With Rand no longer around to defend herself from critics, Peikoff redoubled his efforts to protect her. In 1989, he excommunicated a prominent objectivist named David Kelley—he’d read a Kipling poem at Rand’s burial ceremony—for the sin of speaking to a group of libertarians. (Despite Rand’s reputation, she was opposed to the libertarians of her time, dismissing them as anti-intellectual anarchists.) Kelley wrote an essay arguing that objectivism “is not a closed system,” and that its followers needed to engage with other ideologies in order for it to grow and spread. Peikoff wrote a high-handed response declaring that objectivism was in fact “closed.” Kelley went on to start a competing, comparatively inclusive objectivist organization now called the Atlas Society.</p><p>But the most transformative moment in this period of Peikoff’s life was the birth of his daughter, Kira, named after the headstrong heroine in Rand’s first novel, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780451233592" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>We the Living</em></a>. Peikoff liked to tell the story of holding baby Kira in the hospital waiting room, where she grasped two of his fingers with her tiny hands. He said he felt something he’d never felt before: total, protective, unconditional love. (Ever the objectivist, he made sure to note that this love was <em>not</em> altruistic.) It was “the feeling that this was something I wanted for my life and that I would support her with everything I could, everything in every way,” he said years later, in a diary recording he made at Kira’s suggestion.</p><p>“He was an amazing father,” Kira, who is now 39 and lives in New Jersey, told me. Many summers while she was growing up, he took her to Hawaii. After he and Cynthia got divorced, when Kira was 6, Peikoff signed up for a group for divorced fathers and daughters to help them bond. The two would sometimes play a game in which they told collaborative stories, alternating sentences to spin a yarn. He tried to avoid indoctrinating her with his ideology, Kira recalls, but he did hire an objectivist teacher to homeschool Kira and a couple of other students for three years during middle school, with lessons free of multiculturalism or moral relativism.</p><p>When Kira was young, Peikoff told her that she would inherit part of Rand’s estate after he died. He eventually decided that Kira would get the copyrights to Rand’s three biggest books—<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Fountainhead</em>, and <em>We the Living</em>—and that the rest of Rand’s works would go to the Ayn Rand Institute. Peikoff gave Kira a copy of <em>The Fountainhead</em> with an inscription alluding to Howard Roark’s uncompromising independence: “Judge it completely on your own, ignoring your parents’ opinions &amp; everybody else’s. That’s what HR would do.”</p><p>Kira finally read <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>in college. Studying journalism at NYU, she skipped classes and stayed up late to tear through the novel. “I was so utterly gripped by the book,” she told me. “I remember crying at the end of it and thinking, <em>Now I get it. This is going to be my life philosophy as well</em>.” When she met the man who would become her husband, they bonded over their love of Rand’s books, which inspired him to scrap a career in finance and pursue his passion for music.</p><p>After college, Kira decided to try to write novels, a pursuit that brought her even closer to her father. Peikoff encouraged her and agreed to sponsor her for one year. When Kira got her first book deal, in 2010, Peikoff proudly blogged about it. After years of playing their storytelling game, he was happy to take some small credit for her success. Kira soon had kids of her own, and Peikoff delighted in playing with them, marveling at their smarts and athleticism.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Even as Peikoff thrived as a father and grandfather, however, his professional life was becoming more controversial. Although he had resigned from his position as chair of the ARI board in 1989, he retained influence over the institute’s policies. After the Kelley schism, throughout the ’90s and 2000s, he continued to issue fiats and purge deviants. The number of pariahs climbed: the economist George Reisman, for questioning some of Peikoff’s decisions at ARI; the <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> film producer John Aglialoro, for participating in an event with the libertarian Cato Institute; the historian and philosopher John P. McCaskey, for daring to criticize a Peikoff-endorsed book about methods of scientific discovery. In a public letter denouncing McCaskey, Peikoff called him “an obnoxious braggart as a person, and a pretentious ignoramus as an intellectual.”</p><p>As with Rand, the irony of someone ostensibly dedicated to freedom of thought demanding ideological conformity was inescapable. Some wondered whether Peikoff, who’d had a heart attack in 1991, had lost a step. In response to the 2010 McCaskey flap, Peikoff’s cousin Barbara Branden—who hadn’t spoken with him in decades—commented on an online forum: “As we grow older, we become more firmly and openly the person we really are. Leonard Peikoff is not senile. He is merely Leonard Peikoff.” (Barbara Branden died in 2013.)</p><p>Peikoff also drew criticism for his management of the estate. In the ’90s, as ARI allowed scholars to examine Rand’s letters and diaries, some of them noticed discrepancies between the published documents and the originals. One Rand scholar revealed in a 1998 article that the editors of her published journals had apparently cleaned up her prose, omitting context at best, changing the meaning of sentences at worst. Whether or not Peikoff had directed the changes, the airbrushing occurred under his watch, damaging the credibility of both ARI and the movement—not to mention their commitment to the value of objectivity. Over the years, some scholars perceived as insufficiently aligned with Rand or ARI have been restricted or denied access to the archives. (ARI did not respond to my requests for access or for comment.)</p><p>Peikoff seemed to accept that he would be remembered as Rand’s propagandist. “If I am to go down in history as her apologist or glamorizer, then so be it,” he said in one lecture. “I am proud to be cursed as a ‘cultist,’ if the ‘cult’ is unbreached dedication to the mind and to its most illustrious exponents.” In 2011, when someone asked who would be <em>his</em> intellectual heir, he said, “Nobody I know qualifies.” It surely didn’t help that his world was shrinking—and would soon shrink further.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/meeting-ayn-rand-on-the-las-vegas-strip/383608/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">John Paul Rollert: Meeting Ayn Rand on the Las Vegas strip</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">I<span>n early 2020</span>, Peikoff, then 86, was lonely and miserable. He was living at the Ivy at Wellington, a retirement home in Orange County, and wasn’t allowed to leave due to pandemic restrictions. A woman he’d been in love with at the home had died the year before, at age 99, a loss that he described as “a tragedy” in one of his diary recordings. And with a media diet of talk radio and the <em>New York Post</em>, not to mention a lifetime of anti-regulatory messaging under Rand, Peikoff bristled at the lockdowns and mask mandates. Kira and her family were living nearby temporarily; often, she would stand outside Peikoff’s residence so they could see each other while talking by phone.</p><p>That spring, Peikoff’s friend Carl Barney visited him at the Wellington and was horrified at Peikoff’s state. “He was alone, clearly despairing, using oxygen with a tank,” Barney wrote on his blog. “I feared for his life.” He decided to hire a nurse to take care of his friend. After some research, Barney found an agency called Golden Age Companions and hired a woman named Grace Davis.</p><p>Davis, then in her 50s, was quiet and professional at first, according to Kira and Peikoff’s former driver. She and Peikoff clearly got along well, despite the fact that he was an avid atheist and she was a churchgoing Christian. But people near Peikoff soon started to notice her behaving in inappropriate ways. On his birthday that October, she gave him an affectionate card: “I hope you know I love you in an agape &amp; phileo way,” she wrote, using the Greek words for unconditional and brotherly love. She would call Peikoff before he went to sleep, and join him to watch the Viennese operettas that he and Rand had always loved, according to Kira. Within a year or so of Davis’s arrival, a friend of Peikoff’s saw him and Davis exchange kisses, as that friend later testified in a deposition. (Through his lawyer, Peikoff declined an interview request and did not answer a list of questions about this story, which he said consisted of “baseless and false charges.”)</p><p>Kira grew concerned about Davis in January 2021, after Peikoff had a life-threatening case of COVID. When he was released from the hospital, Kira, on the recommendation of Peikoff’s doctors, asked Davis to take a COVID test, because Peikoff was in a vulnerable state. Davis provided a document that supposedly confirmed her status as negative, but it was an undated, unaddressed letter apparently printed on County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency letterhead. Suspicious, Kira contacted the testing company to ask for a sample test result and was shown a very different-looking document. Kira’s husband, Matt, confronted Davis about the document over text, but Davis never responded; according to Kira, her father later acknowledged that Davis’s letter was fake. (When I contacted the health agency, a spokesperson would not say whether the letter was authentic or not.)</p><p>According to Kira, when she confronted Peikoff about the apparent deception and demanded that he get rid of his nurse, Peikoff threatened to kill himself if Davis left. Kira didn’t trust Davis to manage Peikoff’s medical care, so she tried to cut Davis off from Peikoff’s doctors, saying they should instead communicate with Peikoff’s assistant; she also hired another nurse to provide supplemental help for a short period. But Kira soon moved back to New Jersey and was limited in what she could do from afar.</p><p>In January 2022, Peikoff wrote Kira a heartfelt letter. In it, he thanked Kira “for loving me and showing it. You know my doubts about being loved. But <em>yours</em> is what I have no doubt about.” (“He’s always been very insecure about whether people truly love him for him, or whether it’s because of his status in objectivism,” Kira told me.) He soon amended his will to include not just Kira but also her husband and kids as beneficiaries of his literary trust.</p><p>Any peace of mind that gesture might have brought Kira was spoiled in early 2023, when Peikoff helped Davis and her adult son, Jaymeson—an EMT who was helping care for Peikoff—buy a house in an expensive neighborhood near San Diego. They wanted to turn the house into a “board and care” facility for the elderly, including some of Peikoff’s friends from the Wellington, he told her. Peikoff initially told Kira he would contribute $200,000; the promised amount soon went up to $2 million, according to a sworn declaration by Kira. But the house they settled on—a $3.7 million mansion in Rancho Santa Fe—had only five bedrooms, which wouldn’t accommodate many residents beyond Peikoff, Davis, and Jaymeson. After purchasing the house, Peikoff signed a document transferring ownership to Davis. According to Peikoff’s former dog-walker and driver, he asked them to keep the transaction a secret. Worried that he was being exploited, one of them decided to tell Kira anyway.</p><p>“I freaked out,” Kira told me. “I was like, <em>What are you thinking? What are you doing? This is your caregiver. And why are you doing this behind everyone’s back?</em>” Kira begged for help from Peikoff’s lawyer and his psychiatrist. She noted that California law treats large gifts from a dependent elder to a caregiver as “presumed to be the product of fraud or undue influence.” But the transaction was done. (In public court documents from 2005 related to Davis’s divorce, her ex-husband claimed that Davis had several aliases and Social Security numbers, accused her of credit-card fraud, and alleged that she’d used his credit history to fraudulently apply for a bank loan. Davis did not respond to multiple interview requests for this article. Her lawyer declined to address specific questions, but described the allegations against Davis as “highly inflammatory, malicious, and false.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A month later, Peikoff wrote to Kira apologizing for his “emotionalist” behavior (the worst kind for an objectivist) and promising her “the totality of the Estate” when he dies. To assuage her concerns, he transferred $2 million of his stock portfolio to Kira as an upfront payment on the inheritance. “I hope this letter enables us to go on being two people who unconditionally love each other,” he wrote. But Kira still had concerns about Davis. Although she hadn’t seen any romantic behavior between Peikoff and his nurse, she knew they were getting close; a few weeks later, Kira told Peikoff that she was worried he was going to marry Davis and that she would take everything. According to Kira, he laughed off her concerns.</p><p>In the summer of 2023, Peikoff was hospitalized for sepsis and pneumonia. Doctors put his chance of recovery at 50–50, according to Kira, who says that Peikoff was never the same afterward. When he got out and moved into the new house in Rancho Santa Fe, Kira struggled to reach him despite numerous calls and texts to him and Davis. According to Kira, Davis told her they were going to install a landline, but they never did. A night nurse who was working for Peikoff at the time said in a sworn statement that Davis and Jaymeson would turn off the ringer on Peikoff’s phone so he wouldn’t hear it, and would screen his emails. (Jaymeson declined to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to requests for comment.) At one point, an email from Kira was mysteriously deleted from Peikoff’s inbox, according to his assistant at the time. In her statement, the night nurse also described Peikoff as completely dependent on Davis: “Grace would make decisions on Leonard’s behalf or tell him what to do and Leonard would simply agree.”</p><p>Nine days after his discharge from the hospital, Peikoff told Kira that he did, in fact, now want to marry Davis. “He said, ‘I want to have a family around me, not paid help,’” Kira recalled. “At that point, I was in a total panic. I didn’t believe she was in it for the love of a 90-year-old, very disabled, ill man.” In her recollection, Peikoff told her they would get married in November and go to Fiji together. But then, in September, he called Kira with some news: He and Davis had gone to the San Diego courthouse and were now husband and wife. Kira, trying to stay calm, told him he needed to amend his will to make sure that she would still receive the portion of the estate he’d promised her. He assured her he would. He also said there would be a wedding celebration a few months later, according to Kira. But then he and Davis abruptly moved up the date—all while Kira was trying and failing to get her father to sign a document that would guarantee her the copyrights to the three novels—and held a ceremony in their backyard. Kira and her family did not attend. In one photo taken that day, Peikoff sits in a wheelchair, holding Davis’s hand. In her sworn statement, Peikoff’s night nurse at the time said that Peikoff was disoriented and “did not understand he was getting married.”</p><p>The next month, Kira flew out for Peikoff’s 90th birthday. The day she arrived, Peikoff told her in an email that though she would still inherit the copyrights to Rand’s three biggest books, he would divide his assets between her and Grace in a 50–50 split. "I have now married a wife whom I love, and I intend to be sure that she is looked after financially,” he wrote. The next day, Kira pulled him into a private room and told him that she thought Davis was taking advantage of him. Peikoff said he understood her point of view, and in order to preserve their relationship, they eventually agreed not to discuss Davis anymore. But a few months later, Peikoff’s night nurse told Kira that she had witnessed Davis and Jaymeson mistreating Peikoff—screening his calls, pressuring him to change his will, and failing to administer proper treatment on a day when his blood pressure spiked to a dangerous level—and Kira raised the matter with her father. After a tense back-and-forth, Peikoff said he was removing Kira from his will. When Kira later called him in a last-ditch effort to make amends, he responded coldly. “You’re my enemy,” he said, according to Kira. Once again, he had cut off someone close to him out of devotion to the woman at the center of his life.</p><p>In March 2024, Kira played her final card: She filed a petition in San Diego Superior Court to put a conservator in charge of Peikoff’s trust. The petition claims that Davis exercised “undue influence” over Peikoff by isolating him, persuading him to buy the Rancho Santa Fe house, marrying him, neglecting his medical needs, and “poisoning” his relationship with Kira. As a result, Kira argued, Peikoff could not be trusted to make his own financial decisions.</p><p>Peikoff’s legal response might be the most objectivist objection ever filed. It opens with a quote from Ayn Rand: “My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, <em>with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life</em>, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.” And it includes Peikoff’s own declaration of independence: “If being reasonable is sitting in a library, alone, until I die, and if being unreasonable is choosing to be with the woman I love, then I choose to be unreasonable.” That choice, Peikoff’s lawyer argues, was made purposely and with “abundant and overwhelming mental capacity,” an assertion supported by statements from doctors. He claims that Kira “has omitted very significant facts from her pleadings, and also included outright lies,” and that her communication with Peikoff in recent months amounted to “harassment,” concluding, “Leonard Peikoff should remain a free man.”</p><p>In September, an open letter with Peikoff’s byline appeared on an objectivist website. In it, Peikoff went even further, saying that he no longer loved Kira and that she was motivated by “Greed, Jealousy, and Revenge.” He framed the conservatorship as an objectivist’s worst nightmare: submitting oneself to the government. If implemented, it would “enslave me immediately.” He then called on all objectivists to help him fight. Because he had already given Kira “a sizable fraction” of his estate, he wrote, he didn’t have enough money to pay his legal expenses. The letter included a link to a GoFundMe page requesting $40,000 in donations, organized by an objectivist friend named James Valliant. It raised $28,000.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>he conservatorship petition</span> and Peikoff’s explosive reaction captivated the objectivist community. Prominent members took sides online. Some saw a daughter desperate to protect her vulnerable father in his final years. Others saw a man in love, trying to live out the rest of his life according to his own wishes—and a daughter attempting to control him.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As in schisms past, those who didn’t side with Peikoff found themselves cut off. Kira, now deluged with inquiries from friends and admirers of her father, posted a message on Facebook requesting privacy, along with a photo of herself and Peikoff taken a year before, at his 90th birthday, the last time she had seen him. “I deeply miss my father, the man who unconditionally loved me for 38 years,” she wrote. “I dream of him often, and it’s always the way he used to be—the loving, steadfast, and kind father I knew, not the man who has now become unrecognizable.”</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="IMG_4744-final.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 982px) 928px, (min-width: 786px) calc(100vw - 54px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/bRScFjFRk998isnhPiBSaYono1A=/0x0:2541x1589/640x400/media/img/posts/2025/03/IMG_4744_final/original.jpg 640w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/N-ALFF7NT082DP9BNJLIDBrCjFU=/0x0:2541x1589/750x469/media/img/posts/2025/03/IMG_4744_final/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/eKMxPYJAYdeLYt3myd7O-LHiwKE=/0x0:2541x1589/850x531/media/img/posts/2025/03/IMG_4744_final/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/XogdlpiOt5DCYw-LEaKBY91NqxQ=/0x0:2541x1589/928x580/media/img/posts/2025/03/IMG_4744_final/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HXRsJoYl5urTncOxdk3nqWLBNXE=/0x0:2541x1589/1536x960/media/img/posts/2025/03/IMG_4744_final/original.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/yJ44zzBxe-JVs_mBZJJe0Mwwx34=/0x0:2541x1589/1856x1160/media/img/posts/2025/03/IMG_4744_final/original.jpg 1856w" src="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/ayn-rand-peikoff-inheritance-battle/682219/IMG_4744-final.jpg" width="928" height="580"></picture><figcaption><p>Courtesy of Kira Peikoff</p><p>Peikoff and Kira at his 90th birthday party, in October 2023</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Valliant, a lawyer who once wrote a book meticulously rebutting claims made in the Brandens’ memoirs—it was titled <em>The Passion of Ayn Rand’s Critics—</em>took the lead as Peikoff’s spokesperson and defender in chief. In September and October, he posted on YouTube two long video interviews with Peikoff in which they discuss politics, Peikoff’s love for Davis (she makes a brief appearance), and his future plans for the estate (he says he is appointing a committee of objectivists to handle it). In the videos, Peikoff slurs his words and breathes through an oxygen tube but speaks lucidly and energetically. The subtext: Peikoff is still with it. (Valliant declined an interview request, saying he could not speak with me because of possible “further litigation.”)</p><p>Andrew Lewis, a longtime friend and former colleague of Peikoff’s, told me that the claim that Davis has isolated him is “garbage.” Lewis said he sees Peikoff every Sunday, and that a few dozen people showed up to celebrate his 91st birthday in October. Some old friends even flew in. It’s just the people who have taken Kira’s side that he doesn’t want to see, Lewis said.&nbsp;He also dismissed the idea that Davis is manipulating Peikoff as “bullshit.” I asked why. “Because he loves her,” Lewis said. “And she cares for him. And as far as I can tell, she loves him back.”</p><p>Kira rescinded her conservatorship petition in November. She’d received an anonymous threatening message on X—“i can be anywhere at anytime,” the person wrote, adding that Kira and her husband “don’t really understand force qua force”—and didn’t want to make her father spend his twilight years in court. “My father’s love for me has been destroyed, and I no longer believe that any amount of evidence brought to his attention will open his eyes,” she told me. However, when I asked whether she planned to sue after Peikoff’s death, she didn’t rule it out. Aside from her own financial interest, she said, she worries about what will happen if Rand’s estate is controlled by someone with no background in objectivism and no experience in philosophy or publishing.</p><p>But she also told me she understands why her father has chosen Davis. “I think my dad is someone who is desperate for affection,” Kira said. “And I think she provides that.” He’s always been gullible and generous, she added, and the combination makes him easy to manipulate.</p><p>Jennifer Burns, a history professor at Stanford and the author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780199832484" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right</em></a>, told me she has never met Peikoff but is not surprised by his rift with his daughter, given his devotion to a woman with so many broken relationships of her own. Rand “designed a world where her views and preferences were logically arrived at, and for anyone else’s to be logical they’d have to match hers,” she said. “If a friend of hers liked music she didn’t like or a movie she didn’t like, she interpreted it as a sign of inner corruption. In this context, breaking with someone on principle becomes a moral act.”</p><p>From that perspective, perhaps Peikoff is living the Randian dream. As he sees it, he’s doing what he wants, acting in his own perceived self-interest to the very end. Sure, it’s hard to square the ideals of individualism and autonomy with an adult life characterized at nearly every turn by dependence: first on Rand’s approval, then on her largesse, and now on Davis.</p><p>But he doesn’t seem to mind. In his interview with Valliant, Peikoff—wearing a Hawaiian shirt, oxygen tubes in his nose—glows as he describes his first encounter with Davis: “I saw a woman coming toward me, and I thought to myself, <em>A nurse can’t possibly look like that. Wow!</em> That beautiful hair, framing her face, cascading down; beautiful figure; such gorgeous features. And her smile transported me to another world. So I fell for her right away.” He was even more delighted to discover she liked the things he liked, such as Viennese operetta and Wordle. “Not only is she beautiful,” he says, “she has my soul.” He gushes about the workout routine she designed for him, brags about how he convinced her to marry him after proposing four times, and says he wrote a 14-part essay about all the reasons he loves her. When she appears on-screen, smiling toward the camera, he kisses her. “This is my beautiful wife,” he says. And then he grasps her hands, fumbling a bit, and reaches for her arm, only for her to pull it away.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><em><small>*Lead image credit: Illustration by Akshita Chandra / The Atlantic.

As the biggest toothed predator on earth, it feasts on mysterious bottom-dwelling sharks, skates and, most notably of all, the giant squid - another of the world’s least well-understood animals.</p><p>Superlatives abound. Sperm whales have the biggest heads (in proportion to the rest of their bodies) of any large animal. A typical sperm whale might be one-third head.

Even today no-one is entirely sure what function the spermaceti serves. One theory says it has something to do with buoyancy, the other that it is for echolocation.

These things are quite rare in the wild, to the extent that there are few other naturally-occurring substances which behave quite the way sperm whale oil does.</p><p><span>Humans are ingenious at devising all sorts of random uses for all sorts of random substances (come to think of it, that’s pretty much the subtext of </span><em>Material World</em><span>) and so it was for this oil. Sailors soon realised that it worked brilliantly as a lubricant for their clocks and watches (its viscosity doesn’t change much whatever the temperature - yet another unusual feature of this unusual substance). But eventually an even more popular use-case was discovered: as a fuel for lanterns.</span></p><p>This of course was long before the invention of electricity and most other light sources had severe drawbacks. Tallow and other forms of oil derived from animal fat burnt with a dim, smoky flame. Whale oil, by contrast, provided an excellent light and produced little smoke. While tallow burnt with a foul smell, whale oil produced no unpleasant odours. And so, in the early days of lighting, spermaceti became a sought-after fuel for lanterns.</p><p><span>If you have read much about the history of lighting - or for that matter </span><em>Material World</em><span> - you will know what happened next. Mankind began to hunt and slaughter sperm whales in vast quantities. People panicked that they would soon be extinct. Then, in the middle of the 19th century, humankind worked out how to make kerosene from crude oil, and it rapidly replaced whale oil in lanterns. Since kerosene burnt six times brighter, there was no need any longer to kill whales for lighting.</span></p><p><span>As William Nordhaus, the Nobel prize-winning economist, put it in his </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c6064/c6064.pdf" rel="">seminal paper</a><span> on lighting, as well as </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/05/02/309040279/in-4-000-years-one-thing-hasnt-changed-it-takes-time-to-buy-light" rel="">interviews since</a><span>, kerosene “saved the whales”. It’s a great, counterintuitive story: look! Fossil fuels saved the world (until they threatened it a couple of centuries later)! And so this Nobel prize winning version of history has been </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38650976" rel="">trotted out</a><span> </span><a href="http://www.sjvgeology.org/history/whales.html" rel="">pretty much everywhere</a><span> ever since, including, I should acknowledge, in my own book. It’s become a part of the conventional wisdom.</span></p><p><span>But there’s a problem with the Nordhaus version of events. It is plain </span><strong>wrong</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Crude oil did </span><em>not</em><span> save the whales. While it’s true that whale oil fell out of favour as a fuel for lighting after the discovery of kerosene, the number of whales being killed in the following years didn’t fall to zero. On the contrary, it rose. A lot.

As you see, it’s pretty stark. Far from dropping to zero after the widespread adoption of kerosene, whale oil catches only fell a bit before picking up dramatically in the 20th century. Many multiples more died in the 20th century, long after Nordhaus suggested they had been saved, than in the 19th. Why?</p><p><span>The story features in Jean-Baptiste Fressoz’s brilliant book </span><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/464145/more-and-more-and-more-by-fressoz-jean-baptiste/9781802067309" rel="">More and More and More</a><span>, which I highly recommend as a companion piece to </span><em>Material World</em><span>. As he explains, it turns out lighting oil wasn’t the only use we found for spermaceti.</span></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, right from the start whale oil had other uses, beyond lighting. It was used to grease naval clocks, as well as being deployed in pharmaceuticals, paints and explosives. And when added to conventional petroleum oil, spermaceti transformed a good engine lubricant into the world’s finest engine lubricant. Thanks to those esters, whale oil-infused lubricants were incredibly good at reducing friction. And so while whales were no longer hunted for lighting fuel, they became even more prized in the 20th century for a somewhat more obscure use no-one spent much time thinking about.</p><p>And since whaling technology had come along so much since the 19th century - with powerful diesel engined vessels equipped with ever more lethal harpoons and even onboard processing plants, allowing sailors to drain the spermaceti out of their catches at sea rather than having to bring them back to land - sperm whale populations were ravaged long, long after the discovery of kerosene.</p><p><span>Indeed, that chart above slightly understates the full scale of the onslaught in the 20th century, because quite a lot of the whaling fleets from Japan and the Soviet Union weren’t declaring all their catches to the International Whaling Commission. </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276844456_Emptying_the_Oceans_A_Summary_of_Industrial_Whaling_Catches_in_the_20th_Century" rel="">Adjusted estimates</a><span> are somewhat higher.</span></p><p>Fressoz’s point is that far from saving the whales…</p><blockquote><p>Actually, petroleum increased the demand for whale oil: top-of-the-range lubricants for gearboxes and machine tools used to contain between 5 and 20 per cent whale oil. Until the mid-1970s, aircraft turbojet engines were lubricated at least in part with whale oil.</p></blockquote><p><span>But this story ends somewhat happily, because that chart really does show a dramatic fall to close to zero in recent decades. So what </span><em>really</em><span> saved the whales? Well, the answer is first, the whaling bans which, across most of the world, made it illegal to hunt these whales (a few countries refused to sign up, but catches have nonetheless dropped dramatically in recent years). And, in the face of this enforced shortage of whale oil, lubricant manufacturers and other users of whale oil had to try to find a satisfactory substitute.</span></p><p><span>Lo and behold, in the 1970s there was a sharp rise in research and development spending on esters. Chemists worked out how to create synthetic alternatives. Eventually, however, it was the natural world that provided the best substitute: the </span><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-jojoba-desert-shrub-help-save-endangered-whales" rel="">oil from the jojoba tree</a><span>, which has most of the same properties as whale oil. All of a sudden, an obscure plant, never much cultivated, helped fill the gap left by spermaceti.</span></p><p>So in one respect, Nordhaus was right: technology did eventually save the whales. But a) it happened more than a century later than he suggested, by which point whale stocks were much lower than in the 1860s, b) the technology in question wasn’t derived from crude oil and c) it was only developed in response to a government-enforced ban on whale hunting.</p><p>These might seem like minute distinctions, but they all matter, and perhaps it’s worth reflecting on this in the 2020s. After all, here we are at another inflection point, with a lively debate between those who believe technology, left more or less to its own devices, will deliver the solutions to climate change and those who believe nothing will happen without government intervention.</p><p>For a long time that Nordhaus-fuelled conventional wisdom, that kerosene saved the whales, left one with the impression that technology alone could save the day. But now ponder the corrected story of the whales and you’re left with, well, if not the opposite impression, then a considerably more nuanced conclusion. And I’ve been taught another lesson: always fact check Nobel laureates!</p><p><span>Anyway, </span><a href="https://edconway.substack.com/p/hang-on-are-there-any-lost-minerals" rel="">as promised</a><span>, this was the first of a series of posts about “forgotten materials” - substances we convinced ourselves we had stopped exploiting even as we were mining massive amounts of them. There’s quite a few other interesting examples to come in the weeks ahead.</span></p><p><span>UPDATE 31 Dec: A couple of readers have pointed me towards </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023117739217" rel="">this absolutely excellent paper</a><span> on precisely this topic from Richard York a few years ago.

<p>"The findings are a stark reminder that even the wealthiest Americans are not shielded from the systemic issues in the US contributing to lower life expectancy, such as economic inequality or risk factors like stress, diet or environmental hazards," lead study author Irene Papanicolas, a professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown, said in a news release.</p>
<p>The study looked at health and wealth data of more than 73,000 adults across the US and Europe who were 50 to 85 years old in 2010. There were more than 19,000 from the US, nearly 27,000 from Northern and Western Europe, nearly 19,000 from Eastern Europe, and nearly 9,000 from Southern Europe. For each region, participants were divided into wealth quartiles, with the first being the poorest and the fourth being the richest. The researchers then followed participants until 2022, tracking deaths.</p>
<p>The US had the largest gap in survival between the poorest and wealthiest quartiles compared to European countries. America's poorest quartile also had the lowest survival rate of all groups, including the poorest quartiles in all three European regions.</p>
<p>While less access to health care and weaker social structures can explain the gap between the wealthy and poor in the US, it doesn't explain the differences between the wealthy in the US and the wealthy in Europe, the researchers note. There may be other systemic factors at play that make Americans uniquely short-lived, such as diet, environment, behaviors, and cultural and social differences.</p>
<p>"If we want to improve health in the US, we need to better understand the underlying factors that contribute to these differences—particularly amongst similar socioeconomic groups—and why they translate to different health outcomes across nations," Papanicolas said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Britain is a rich country with the world’s 6th largest economy and the highest tax income for decades, which raises a simple question - why do we seem so broke? Tom Calver, Data Editor at The Times, </span><a href="https://x.com/TomHCalver/status/1903752785012682961" rel="">tackled the question last week</a><span>. The big picture is pretty simple: we have a huge debt burden sucking over £100bn out of the budget every year (more than the entire education budget and nearly double the defence budget); and that would be okay-ish if the economy were growing, but it’s not. </span></p><p>That creates what Calver calls, in the kind of obscure jargon popular among data nerds, “a uniquely shit set of circumstances for the government.” It also raises the next question: why aren’t we growing? The answer broadly comes down to two things.</p><p><span>First, we have the lowest rate of investment (public and private) in the G7, with some trailing off since Brexit.  There are many compelling examples of this, but a fun one was presented in </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/roadscholar.bsky.social/post/3lkxbjp2u7k2p" rel="">a thread by Michael Dnes</a><span> this week: it turns out that over two thirds of the growth in Britain’s motorway network since 2012 has come not from actually building new roads, but because the Ordnance Survey are more accurate at measuring them.  </span></p><p><span>Second, the public sector is getting less and less value for money. In statistical terms, “</span><a href="https://x.com/TomHCalver/status/1903752785012682961" rel="">productivity is about 9 per cent lower than it was in 2019</a><span>,” but we can see that viscerally in e.g. the state of the NHS, a near-£200bn black hole into which tens of billions of additional spending has been poured with </span><a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/there-really-nhs-productivity-crisis" rel="">sluggish improvement to show for it</a><span>. I’m in favour of increased defence spending, but even I have to admit that procurement right now is a disaster, and that without serious reform the extra cash could be spaffed up the wall on things like the </span><a href="https://james1940.substack.com/p/getting-ready-for-war?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">helicopter debacle recounted by James Holland</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The purchasing of new helicopters two-and-a-half years ago, for example, was halted at the last moment because the MOD suddenly decided some competition was needed. It wasn’t. Two – foreign - firms who subsequently tendered for the contract then pulled out at the last minute, wasting valuable time, money and effort, and presumably had entered the bid in the first place only to undermine that of the original British firm. The RAF still doesn’t have any of these new helicopters. </p></blockquote><p><span>What the government gets for the money it spends has been in decline for some time, and is often shockingly poor compared to other nations. HS2 is an </span><a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/britains-infrastructure-is-too-expensive" rel="">order of magnitude more expensive</a><span> than high speed rail projects run by comparable European powers. The new nuclear power station at Hinckley Point C is coming in at </span><a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/visiting-the-worlds-most-expensive" rel="">four times the cost of comparable projects elsewhere</a><span>. These two projects </span><em>alone</em><span> represent an overspend of perhaps £60-70bn versus our competitors, which is the equivalent of cutting a penny from the base rate of income tax… for over a </span><em>decade</em><span>. Obviously that’s a gross simplification - Hinckley Point C is in part privately financed - but it gives you some idea of the sheer </span><em>scale</em><span> of waste.</span></p><p>One reason for this is that parts of the British state are fundamentally misaligned with goals like ‘improving living standards’ or ‘increasing wealth’, whether that’s through hand-wringingly incompetent procurement processes, long-term failure to invest in the infrastructure and management required to support ‘moar frontline staff!!’, acute treasury brain, or endless cohorts of committees and quangos. </p><p><span>Speaking at a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/07/cost-of-shed-to-protect-bat-colony-near-hs2-has-topped-100m-chair-says" rel="">rail conference last year</a><span>, HS2 Chair Sir Jon Thompson said: “To build a railway between Euston and Curzon Street in Birmingham, I need 8,276 consents from other public bodies, planning, transport, the Environment Agency or Natural England. They don’t care whether parliament did or didn’t approve building a railway.”</span></p><p>Imagine for a moment the sheer human effort, the cost, the entire lives consumed by the gigantic national project of ticking each of those 8,276 checkboxes. It is absolutely correct that we have additional checks and balances, but this is an organically-grown system operating with no overall oversight or coherent strategy, spawning busy-work for thousands of people, much of it duplicated, unnecessary or redundant, much of it - like the infamous bat tunnel - having little provable benefit for things like environmental protection in the first place. </p><p><span>Indeed, improving things like the environment </span><em>is not the de facto goal of this system</em><span>, it is not what it was ‘designed’ or incentivised to accomplish. If it were, much of the money would be far better spent. I cannot stress this enough: this is not a battle between, say, infrastructure and the environment. It’s a battle between people who think we can do both, better; and people who seriously believe that a bat tunnel is the best way to spend £120m to support wildlife, a proposition for which no compelling evidence has ever been provided. </span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, local government </span><a href="https://martinrobbins.substack.com/p/the-death-of-a-playground" rel="">veers towards bankruptcy,</a><span> in large part because they’re mandated to write blank cheques for social care with no support or strategy from central government. Individual cases in Central Bedfordshire are now costing up to £750,000 per year, a quarter of the entire libraries and leisure budget and an amount that is rising rapidly with no apparent ceiling. As I wrote previously, “In a single year, residential care costs for children have increased by £2,000 per child… per </span><em>week</em><span>,” taking the </span><em>average</em><span> cost for a single case from ~£200,000 to ~£300,000 per child per year, again with little explanation as to where the money is going or how this is even possible. </span></p><p><span>Similarly, “school transport costs have increased by over 100% - from £9m to £20m - in just 4 years” - that’s driven by an unexplained rise in the number of SEND pupils eligible for support and it amounts to roughly the same as - deep breath - the transport, roads, parking, libraries, leisure, housing benefit, public protection and safety budgets </span><em>combined</em><span>. Central Bedfordshire Council is not an outlier here - collectively, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/30/english-councils-send-debt-analysis" rel="">council overspends on SEND services are set to hit £2bn in the next year, risking further bankruptcies</a><span>. Again this is not about pitting children against libraries, but asking if we seriously believe we’re addressing either of these things well? </span></p><p>There’s a growing tendency for political commentators to talk about the need to raise taxes this year to fix failing public services, and I get it, I really do. Many of these entrenched problems require up-front capital investment to fix or reform broken systems. But they’re overlooking a major issue: to many voters this will sound bonkers given the endemic problems above; and no amount of ‘but actually other countries have a higher tax burden’ or ‘taxes are still lower than they were in the 70s’ is going to persuade them otherwise. </p><p><span>That’s before we consider an inconvenient truth about those nations with higher tax burdens - they fall more heavily on middle earners, because (‘eat the rich’ fantasies aside) you simply can’t get that much money without a broad base of people and businesses to provide it. </span><a href="https://ifs.org.uk/taxlab/taxlab-key-questions/how-do-uk-tax-revenues-compare-internationally" rel="">Per the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a><span> (my italics):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>If the UK were to adopt the income tax and [national insurance] rates of one of its higher-tax European neighbours, it would, in most cases and unsurprisingly, have higher tax rates and raise more revenue from both middle and high earners. </span><em>But the difference in the tax levied would be larger for the median worker than for one near the top of the distribution</em><span>. This is because </span><strong>average tax rates</strong><span> rise more quickly with income in the UK, and are already higher at the top relative to the median, than in most of the European countries that raise more revenue overall.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Advocates of tax rises point out that actually, middle income families face lower taxes than in many other developed nations, and that’s absolute true, but it overlooks a glaring problem: housing costs. Britain’s houses are </span><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uk-spends-more-on-housing-than-almost-any-other-developed-country-and-gets-the-least-value-from-it-too-13099925" rel="">cramped, ancient and in the wrong places</a><span> leaving workers with longer, more expensive commutes. And we get to pay more for the privilege, almost single-handedly reversing the relative wealth of </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/13/uk-low-middle-income-families-poorer-oecd-counterparts-study-western-europe" rel="">many British families</a><span> versus their European counterparts. It’s a cliché that every other policy problem in Britain resolves to a housing problem, but in this case punishing rents and mortgage payments are consuming a large percentage of the income that other countries would tax. </span></p><p><span>Asking this of middle income voters at a time when trust in </span><em>all</em><span> political parties is at historic lows and standards of living are being eroded is a recipe for outright militancy. </span></p><p><span>If anything is done on taxes, it </span><em>has</em><span> to be coupled with serious, once-in-a-generation reforms that stop the state from simply bleeding out the extra cash, and visibly improve the fabric of people’s lives. That means things like a total rethink of local government funding, a massive expansion of house building, ripping up procurement processes, far more radical reforms of planning, and an integrated strategy for social care. </span></p><p><span>Labour need to put forward an epoch-defining deal for the public to sign up to, not just incremental tweaks and budgetary fixes in response to whatever the OBR says this week. The current level of ambition, of </span><em>vision</em><span>, just doesn’t match up to the situation we’re in. </span></p><p>In short, it’s time for Starmer and Reeves to go big or go home. If they don’t they lose anyway, so go out in style. To quote Jack London: “I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.”</p><p><span>Another plug for my new podcast with </span></p><p><span>. This week: the Lower Thames Crossing, affordable housing, and an interview with Joe Hill, policy director at the Reform think-tank, on “Everythingism”. Also I go on an unsolicited rant about Maidenhead NIMBYs. </span></p><p>Ben Ansell has a fascinating essay on what he calls ‘chaos chasers’. In a nutshell, “people whose lives are easy and vote for disruptive populism on the assumption it won’t change anything about their lives. These people believe in FADFO - Fuck Around, Don’t Find Out.”</p><p>Ben’s post largely looked at voters in the context of populism, but I think this applies neatly to other areas so I left a comment, which I’ve reproduced (lightly edited) below: </p><blockquote><p>This is fascinating and I think it applies strongly in the activist space as well. The term I've always used for it is 'escalators' - people or organisations who, given a crisis, will always try to increase the complexity or drama involved instead of breaking it down and working towards a solution. So with e.g. climate activism, you can see this in protest groups who wrap the whole thing up with ending capitalism, solving Gaza, minority rights and god knows what else, until there's a massive intractable knot of stuff that precludes any notion of actually fixing it.</p><p>It's almost like they *want* a gigantic omnicrisis because that's more exciting than just boring old climate change. So they go and scream at people on the M25 and it feels like that's... sort of the point, to go out and do chaotic, shouty, cathartic stuff without any risk that you might have to actually take responsibility for a real problem or fix it.</p><p>And inevitably the kinds of activists doing this are often time-rich, privileged types who are relatively insulated from the consequences, which is why I think the Just Stop Oil jail sentences were quite triggering for some of these groups - they were shocked that doing something illegal and disruptive might actually result in serious consequences. There's a sense of "yes but surely prison isn't for real people like me?"</p></blockquote><p>Not all activists, obviously, but a certain percentage do just seem to want the world to burn, and in my experience it’s usually the ones who are most comfortable in it.</p><p>Chris Spargo relaunched his YouTube channel this year with an epic series of videos on… I guess the best description I can come up with is ‘the fabric of British society’. He combines the production values of early Tom Scott (which is a complement, it’s still very personal and not overproduced) with a curiosity about the sorts of topics that quietly permeate our environment but rarely get discussed. </p><p>Why do so many supermarkets have clock towers? Why do we think cheese &amp; onion crisp packets should be green? And in the latest video, why is a mysterious symbol carved into thousands of walls and buildings across the UK? It’s addictive stuff. </p><div id="youtube2-sWxXyR4ifbk" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;sWxXyR4ifbk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sWxXyR4ifbk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Behind the Bastards has been one of my favourite podcasts for several years, and they have an absolute banger of a 4-part series on the Zizians, a cult-like offshoot of the Rationalist movement linked to a string of deaths in the United States. What makes the series particularly good is that it properly identifies the Rationalist traits that made it such a fertile breeding ground for this kind of group in the first place. </p><p>A few points stuck out to me. One is how so much of the discussion around AI and the singularity was monopolised by fringe characters with little experience of developing the technology or using it in real, practical environments, distorting public perceptions of the field. </p><p>Another is on the dangers of overthinking. A major problem smart people seem to have, which you see a lot in e.g. conspiracy theorists - is an inability to turn their brains off after a certain point. The real world is messy, and behind any truth you’ll find a web of open questions and contradictions. Think too hard, or too obsessively, and you’ll wind up on a doomed attempt to resolve all of them, plummeting down the rabbit hole until you land in a parody of thought. </p><p>The consequences can be highly disturbing, as Robert explores. It’s well worth a listen on whatever Podcast app you use, or on YouTube below. </p><div id="youtube2-9mJAerUL-7w" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;9mJAerUL-7w&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9mJAerUL-7w?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>That’s all for this week, another essay coming Tuesday week (I’m on holiday next week). Until then, please don’t join any cults (except for our </span><a href="https://www.abundancepod.com/p/the-lower-thames-crossing-boomers-everythingism" rel="">podcast</a><span> obviously).</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">If you installed Docker Desktop (on a Mac or Windows machine), you can run the following command to start the Docker services:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you are on Linux, or installed Docker via a package manager on a mac, you may have to manually give docker superuser access to open ports 80 and 443. To do that, use <code>sudo make local</code> instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">This command will not terminate. You run this in one tab and start the application in another tab.
If you want to run Docker services in the background, use <code>LOCAL_DETACHED=true make local</code> instead.</p>
