<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-opensourceisnotaboutyou-md" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="OpenSourceIsNotAboutYou.md content, created by richhickey on 11:56PM on November 26, 2018.">
    <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">The only people entitled to say how open source 'ought' to work are people who run projects, and the scope of their entitlement extends only to their own projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just because someone open sources something does not imply they owe the world a change in their status, focus and effort, e.g. from inventor to community manager.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all. You are not entitled to contribute. You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others.  You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have expectations (of others) that aren't being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period. It means you get the source for software and the right to use and modify it. All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of 'community-driven-development' are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work, a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things <em>can</em> work and a pervasive sense of communal entitlement.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you think Cognitect is not doing anything for the community, or is not listening to the community, you are simply wrong. You are not, however, entitled to it being the effort, focus or response you desire. We get to make our own choices as regards our time and lives.</p>
<p dir="auto">We at Cognitect have to show up to work, every day, to make a living. We get no royalties of any kind from Clojure. We are in no way building Clojure for profit. Far fewer than 1% of Clojure users are our consulting or product customers, and thus contributing to our livelihood.</p>
<p dir="auto">We take some of what we earn, money that could e.g. go into our retirement savings and instead use it to hire people to work on Clojure and community outreach, some full-time. To be honest, I could use that money in my retirement account, having depleted it to make Clojure in the first place. But I love working with the team on Clojure, and am proud of the work we do.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alex Miller is extremely attentive to and engaged with the Clojure community. He and Stu Halloway and I regularly meet and discuss community issues. Alex, at my direction, spends the majority of his time either working on features for the community or assessing patches and bug reports. I spend significant portions of my time designing these features - spec, tools.deps, error handling and more to come. This is time taken away from earning a living.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am grateful for the contributions of the community. Every Clojure release incorporates many contributions. The vast majority of the user community doesn't contribute, and doesn't desire to contribute. And that's fine. Open source is a no-strings-attached <em>gift</em>, and all participants should recognize it as such.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Clojure process is not closed, but it <em>is</em> conservative. I think Clojure benefits greatly from that conservatism, in contrast to some other projects with high churn rates and feature bloat. If you disagree or imagine otherwise, that's too bad. It's my life and I'm not going to spend it arguing/negotiating on/with the internet. Write your own things and run your own projects as you see fit.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can always do more, but it is specious to claim that the core team is standing in the way of meaningful contributions to Clojure, as opportunities abound: in library development, outreach, training, tutorials, documentation, giving talks, tool building etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">And yes, on patches to core. Did you know that most patches/issues have poor problem statements, no description of the plan (read my code!), no consideration of alternatives, no tests, no designs, and are ill-conceived and/or broken in some way? Community efforts to triage matter <em>a lot</em> in moving things forward - thanks Nicola, Ghadi and many others!</p>
<p dir="auto">The time to re-examine preconceptions about open source is right now. Morale erosion amongst creators is a real thing. Your preconceptions and how you act upon them are your responsibility and yours alone. I am not going to answer for them or to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the way Clojure works isn't for you, a process which produced Clojure in the first place, paradoxically, so be it. I'm sure you know better about the one true way to write software. But kindly don't burn the community down on your way out, with self-serving proclamations. Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but, tragedy of the commons and all that.</p>
<p dir="auto">I encourage everyone gnashing their teeth with negativity at what they think they can't do instead pick something positive they can do and <em>do it</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rich</p>
<p dir="auto">p.s. My partners and coworkers at Cognitect were not consulted regarding this message - I am certain they would have dissuaded me. These opinions are mine alone.</p>
<p dir="auto">p.p.s. I think the vast majority of people in the Clojure community are wonderful and positive. If you don't recognize yourself in the message above, it's not for/about you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ios-countdown.win/">https://ios-countdown.win/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47003064">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        Deadline: end of WWDC 2026. The exact dates haven't been announced yet
        and this timer is based on the estimated schedule (June 9–13).
        I'll update it when Apple confirms the dates. They have until the
        conference ends.
      </p><p>Time's up.</p><div>
        <p>
          The iOS keyboard has been broken since at least iOS 17 and it's
          somehow only gotten worse. iOS 26 has been my breaking point.
          Autocorrect is nearly useless and often hostile, that part I'm used
          to. But now the correctly tapped letters aren't even registering
          correctly.
          <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hksVvXONrIo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This isn't just me.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          iOS has bugs across the whole ecosystem. But having the keyboard,
          the thing I interact with hundreds of times a day on my primary
          device, get progressively worse with every update is absolutely
          maddening.
        </p>
        <p>
          I randomly tried Android again for a few months last spring. Using a
          functioning keyboard was revelatory. But I came crawling back to iOS
          because I'm weak and the orange iPhone was pretty and the Pixel 10
          was boring and I caved to the blue bubble pressure. But the keyboard
          on this beautiful phone is worse than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here's the deal, Apple, if that's even your real name: fix this
          broken keyboard, or at the very least <strong>publicly
          acknowledge</strong> it's broken and commit to fixing it in iOS 27
          or earlier. If that countdown hits zero without either of those
          things happening, I'm switching to Android for good. (Good = at
          least 2 calendar years)
        </p>
        <p>
          I know losing one customer means absolutely nothing to your bottom
          line. But I'd like to think it should mean something to the
          engineers, UX designers, product people, and whoever else had a hand
          in building this thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were the "it just works" company. Now you're just a fruit that
          I used to know.
        </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/46758">https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/46758</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47002825">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">it works worse for vram and perfomance</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">have you read the thread above? This statement is simply not true when comparing to blade. The implementation already has a lower VRAM and memory footprint than the blade implementation had, and that is before some performance improvements addressing the comments above. Performance will not change with this PR significantly either, the wgpu implementation does essentially the same thing as the blade implementation did. Feel free to run benchmarks on this...</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">slow compilation and twice rust-analyzer ram usage at dev time</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Have you tried compiling the zed repo? Wgpu build times are not the issue or bottleneck here. On my system the difference was barely noticable, and since we have incremental builds for dependencies most of it will be one-time only anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">sometimes it has long-time problems without fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Sure, wgpu has issues too. The difference is that it is actively maintained and a core dependency of many big projects. There is generally a big interest in getting significant things fixed. Blade on the other hand has open PRs (not even just issues) with small fixes that have a big impact (breaking issues) for downstream apps that haven't been merged in half a year. I don't want to attack the author, I know maintaining OSS is a lot of work and usually doesn't pay the bills, but zed and gpui are projects people rely on, so I don't think this is acceptable for a core dependency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You personally like wgpu, i personally dislike it especially after development and usage of apps based on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I could also turn that argument around, but more importantly I think community support and stability are plainly more important that slight differences in API ergonomics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">looks like something that can be made selectable by cfg flags based on checking this pr</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Yes of course it could, but that has certain implications that should be considered. If you add it  as a new backend, it will also have to be maintained, so more work for further improvements. This is already a bit of an issue with GPUI given the different renderer implementation. I respect the decision of the zed maintainers to support those implementation, but personally I think we should thrive to consolidate the rendering infrastructure, not further fragment it. There are exciting things for the future that could be enabled (or significantly simplified for end-users) by consolidation, like APIs for custom shaders, direct buffer access for custom elements, embedding into other wgpu apps (or being embeddable by them), like bevy.</p>

        <div>
                        
            
            <h2>macOS 26.3, Release Candidate</h2>
<p>In the release notes for macOS 26.3 RC, Apple stated that the window-resizing issue I demonstrated in <a href="https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/">my recent blog post</a> had been resolved.</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_262"><img decoding="async" width="1568" height="324" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/resolved-issues.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>I was happy to read that, but also curious about what had actually changed.</p>
<p>So I wrote a little test app.</p>


<p>It performs a pixel-by-pixel scan in the area around the bottom-right corner of the window, hammering it with simulated mouse clicks to detect exactly where it responds to those clicks (red), where it’s about to resize (green), where it’s about to resize vertically or horizontally only (yellow), and where it doesn’t receive any mouse events at all (blue).</p>
<p>And indeed, the window resize areas now follow the corner radius instead of using square regions:</p>

<p>So that’s definitely better!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, as you can see, the thickness of the yellow area – used for resizing the window only vertically or horizontally – also became thinner. The portion that lies inside the window frame is now only 2 pixels instead of 3.</p>
<p>In total the thickness went down from 7 to 6 pixels, which is a 14% decrease, making it 14% more likely to miss it.</p>
<h2>macOS 26.3, Final Release</h2>
<p>When the final version of macOS 26 was released I was curious if Apple might have further refined the implementation. So I performed the scan once again. But to my big surprise, the fix was not only unrefined – it was completely removed! So we are now back to the previous square regions:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_249"><img decoding="async" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/26.3.webp"></figure>
<p>And in fact, the release notes have also been updated: the problem went from a “Resolved Issue” to a “Known Issue”.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following intense backlash to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801856/amazon-ring-partners-flock-video">partnership with Flock Safety</a>, a surveillance technology company that works with law enforcement agencies, Ring <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-and-flock-cancel-partnership/">has announced</a> it is canceling the integration.</p><p>In a statement published on Ring’s blog and provided to <em>The Verge</em> ahead of publication, the company said: “Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners … The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.”</p><p>The statement goes on to say that Ring’s mission to make neighborhoods safer “comes with significant responsibility — to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the trust you place in our products and features.”</p><p>Trust is the big one there. Over the last few weeks, the company has faced significant public anger over its connection to Flock, with Ring users being encouraged to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/866003/ring-ice-camera-access-flock">smash their cameras</a>, and some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUjxevZD59K/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">announcing on social media</a> that they are throwing away their Ring devices.</p><p>The Flock partnership was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801856/amazon-ring-partners-flock-video">announced last October</a>, but following recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/870315/ice-invades-minnesota-and-minnesotans-fight-back">unrest across the country</a> related to ICE activities, public pressure against the Amazon-owned Ring’s involvement with the company started to mount.</p><p>Flock has reportedly allowed ICE and other federal agencies to<a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/"> access its network of surveillance cameras</a>, and influencers across social media have been claiming that Ring is providing a direct link to ICE.</p><p>While that claim is not accurate, as the Flock integration has never gone live, Ring has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20746156/amazons-ring-law-enforcement-partnerships">history of partnering with police</a>, and the new partnership quickly came under intense criticism.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-10-at-7.36.46%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100"

fuel to the fire, this weekend Ring aired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/876866/ring-search-party-super-bowl-ad-online-backlash">a Super Bowl ad</a> for its new AI-powered Search Party feature. While the company says the feature is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871916/search-party-non-ring-owners-neighbors-app">designed to find lost dogs</a> and maintains it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/790928/ring-search-party-cameras-default-opt-out#:~:text=The%20combination%20of,process%20human%20biometrics.%E2%80%9D">not capable of finding people</a>, the ad raised fears that Ring cameras were being used for mass surveillance. The ad shows dozens of Ring cameras in a neighborhood scanning the streets.</p><p>On top of this, the company recently launched a new facial recognition feature, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/788290/ring-amazon-hardware-event-price-specs#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20also%20a%20new%20AI%20facial%20recognition%20feature%20called%20%E2%80%9CFamiliar%20Faces%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20allows%20you%20to%20register%20friends%20and%20family.%20The%20doorbells%20will%20then%20tell%20you%20who%E2%80%99s%20actually%20at%20the%20door%20or%20if%20the%20person%20isn%E2%80%99t%20someone%20you%20know.%20The%20idea%20is%20to%20help%20reduce%20notifications%20triggered%20by%20daily%20routines.">Familiar Faces</a>. Combined with Search Party, the technological leap to using neighborhood cameras to search for people through a mass-surveillance network suddenly seems very small.</p><p>Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) – a longtime critic of Ring – sent an open letter this week<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950296-260211-follow-up-ring-frt-letter/"> calling on Amazon</a> to cancel the company’s facial recognition feature.</p><p>Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger said in an email that its products are purpose-driven tech, “not tools for mass surveillance.” She added that “Familiar Faces is an opt-in feature designed to give customers more control over the alerts they receive (e.g., ‘Mom at front door’ instead of ‘Someone at front door’) while keeping their data protected.”</p><div><p id="why-did-ring-partner-with-flock"><h2>Why did Ring partner with Flock?</h2></p></div><p>Ring’s partnership with Flock was announced in October 2025 as part of Ring’s <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-launches-community-requests-a-new-way-to-help-your-community/">Community Requests program</a>, which launched last September. It was designed to allow local law enforcement agencies that use Flock’s software to integrate directly with the program.</p><div><p>Community Requests launched after Ring ended its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049165/ring-police-neighbors-app-clips-search-warrant">controversial Requests for Assistance (RFA) program</a>, which consumer advocacy groups criticized for allowing video to be provided to police without a warrant, calling it a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/ring-announces-it-will-no-longer-facilitate-police-requests-footage-users">threat to civil liberties</a>.</p></div><p>In its statement about the Flock cancellation, Ring maintains that Community Requests will continue, claiming it helped authorities locate a suspect during the recent Brown University shooting:</p><div><blockquote><p>“When a shooting occurred near Brown University in December 2025, every second mattered. The Providence Police Department turned to their community for help, putting out a Community Request. Within hours, 7 neighbors responded, sharing 168 videos that captured critical moments from the incident. One video identified a new key witness, helping lead police to identify the suspect’s vehicle and solve the case. With a shooter at large, the community faced uncertainty about their safety. Neighbors who chose to share footage played a crucial role in neutralizing the threat and restoring safety to their community.”</p></blockquote></div><p>As with RFA, Community Requests still allows public safety agencies to request video footage from users in a certain area during an active investigation, but it differs from the previous program because law enforcement agencies are required to partner with a third-party evidence management system – such as Flock – to use the service. Ring says this is to better maintain the chain of custody. The previous system allowed police to request footage directly from a user.</p><p>Flock was the second partner Ring announced for Community Requests, the first <a href="https://www.axon.com/blog/building-safer-communities-together-axon-and-ring">being Axon</a>, a law enforcement technology company known for making Tasers. With the new service, only law enforcement agencies that use these companies’ software can submit requests. But the end result is the same: law enforcement gets video from users if they choose to share it.</p><p>Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger says the Axon partnership is unaffected by the end of the Flock integration. Additionally, she says no other integrations are currently being explored.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTQy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

        <p><a href="https://michael-dev-tech.github.io/Website/index.html">← Back to Home</a></p><h2>Discord Just Killed Anonymity. Matrix is the Lifeboat.</h2>
        <p><em>February 12, 2026</em></p>

        <p>It finally happened. After months of speculation, Discord dropped the hammer: <strong>mandatory age verification for all users</strong> is rolling out next month. The era of anonymous gaming chats is officially over.</p>

        <p>Naturally, the internet is panicking. A massive exodus is underway, with thousands of users fleeing to <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, the open-source, decentralized alternative. But if you think switching platforms is a magic bullet, I have some bad news for you.</p>

        <p>The Matrix.org team just posted a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/welcome-discord/">sobering welcome message</a>. While they are happy to take in the refugees, the main <strong>matrix.org</strong> homeserver is <em>also</em> bowing to the same draconian laws (like the UK’s Online Safety Act). They are exploring "privacy-preserving" age verification, which likely involves credit card checks or similar hurdles.</p>
        
        <p>So, are we screwed? Not entirely. Unlike Discord, Matrix is federated. You don't <em>have</em> to use their main server. You can spin up your own homeserver on a Raspberry Pi or rent a VPS in a country that doesn't demand your ID card to send a meme.</p>

        <p>The trade-off? The user experience is still... rough. Missing features like seamless game streaming and proper voice channels will make the transition painful for power users. But frankly, <span>I’d rather deal with clunky UI than scan my passport for a chat app.</span></p>

        <p>If you're staying on Discord, enjoy the surveillance. For the rest of us: it's time to learn how to self-host.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/welcome-discord/">https://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/welcome-discord/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46995046">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We’ve seen a huge spike of signups on the <a href="https://matrix.org/homeserver/about/">matrix.org homeserver</a> over the last few days due to <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">Discord announcing its plans to age-verify all users as of next month</a>. We’d like to give a warm welcome to the massive influx of users currently trying Matrix as an open decentralised alternative to centralised platforms like Discord. We wish we had more time and resources to develop all the features needed for mainstream adoption (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkCKhP1jxdk">The Road To Mainstream Matrix</a> from last year’s FOSDEM), but we're happy to welcome you anyway!</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Matrix and Discord is that Matrix is an open standard, like email or the Web. There’s a wide range of both clients and servers, and anyone can run their own server on their own terms while participating in the global Matrix network.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that server admins are still subject to the law in the jurisdiction where they operate.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, that means that people and organisations running a Matrix server with open registration must verify the ages of users in countries which require it. Last summer we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2025/07/terms-update/">announced</a> a series of changes to the terms and conditions of the Matrix.org homeserver instance, to ensure UK-based users are handled in alignment with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). Since then Australia, New Zealand and the EU have introduced similar legislation, with movement in the US and Canada too. If you’ve been around for a while, you will have seen that we started <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/19/how-the-uk-s-online-safety-bill-threatens-matrix/">raising the alarm</a> about the dangers and potential risks of the OSA back in 2021 - but the reality is that these laws already apply, and the consequences of getting it wrong are serious.</p>
<p>From our perspective, the matrix.org homeserver instance has never been a service aimed at children, which our terms of use reflect by making it clear that users need to be at least 18 years old to use the server. However, the various age-verification laws require stricter forms of age verification measures than a self-declaration. Our Safety team and DPO are evaluating options that preserve your privacy while satisfying the age verification requirements in the jurisdictions where we have users. As a free service, we also have to be mindful of the cost of age-verification compliance. Paying for a matrix.org <a href="http://account.matrix.org/">Premium account</a> with a credit card is one approach which would verify your account and support our work. <a href="https://matrix.org/homeserver/pricing/">Premium accounts</a> are currently going through a phased roll out, so if you’re on an older account you might not see the option to convert your account yet, you can mail <a href="https://matrix.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a6c4cfcacacfc8c18bd5d3d6d6c9d4d2e6cbc7d2d4cfde88c9d4c1"><span data-cfemail="6103080d0d080f064c121411110e1315210c00151308194f0e1306">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> if you wish to be upgraded.</p>
<p>We also want to make it easy for users to move their account to another server with a feature called account portability. Account portability would give users more freedom to choose a server that matches their needs, and it would reduce the load on our matrix.org server. This takes significant work, but there should be some new Matrix Spec Change proposals (MSCs) in the coming weeks showing the direction of travel.</p>
<p>Finally: we’re painfully aware that none of the Matrix clients available today provide a full drop-in replacement for Discord yet. All the ingredients are there, and the initial goal for the project was always to provide a decentralised, secure, open platform where communities and organisations could communicate together. However, the reality is that the team at Element who originally created Matrix have had to focus on providing deployments for the public sector (see <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/commission-trials-european-open-source-communications-software/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/matrix_element_secure_chat/">here</a>) to be able to pay developers working on Matrix. Some of the key features expected by Discord users have yet to be prioritised (game streaming, push-to-talk, voice channels, custom emoji, extensible presence, richer hierarchical moderation, etc). Meanwhile no other organisation stepped up to focus on the “communication tool for communities” use case and provide a production ready Discord alternative, but clients like <a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a> or <a href="https://commet.chat/">Commet</a> may feel much closer to Discord. On the other hand, Matrix goes far beyond Discord in other areas: both messages, files and calls are end-to-end-encrypted; we have read receipts; Matrix is an open protocol everyone can extend, and in the end, most Matrix clients are open source; there is nothing stopping developers from starting their own project based on existing ones and adding the missing features themselves. They may even eventually get accepted in the original projects!</p>
<p>Anyway, TL;DR: Welcome to everyone trying Matrix for the first time; please understand that public Matrix servers will also have to uphold age verification laws, as misguided as they might be. However, at least in Matrix you have the opportunity to run your own servers as you wish: we actively encourage you to make your own assessments and seek legal advice where needed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-532176">

				


				


				<h3>from the <i>fuck-everyone-but-us-policy-still-in-play</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>The DHS and its components want to find non-white people to deport by any means necessary. Of course, “necessary” is something that’s on a continually sliding scale with Trump back in office, which means everything (legal or not) is “necessary” if it can help White House advisor Stephen Miller hit his self-imposed <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/08/courts-start-asking-about-the-ice-arrest-quota-the-administration-is-now-pretending-isnt-a-quota/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/08/courts-start-asking-about-the-ice-arrest-quota-the-administration-is-now-pretending-isnt-a-quota/">3,000 arrests per day</a> goal.</p>
<p>As was reported last week, DHS components (ICE, CBP) are using a web app that supposedly can identify people and link them with citizenship documents. As has always been the case with DHS components (dating back to the Obama era), the rule of thumb is “deploy first, compile legally-required paperwork later.” The pattern has never changed. ICE, CBP, etc. acquire new tech, hand it out to agents, and much later — if <em>ever</em> — the agencies compile and publish their legally-required Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs). </p>
<p>PIAs are supposed to <em>precede</em> deployments of new tech that might have an impact on privacy rights and other civil liberties. In almost every case, the tech has been deployed far ahead of the precedential paperwork. </p>
<p>As one would expect, the Trump administration was never going to be the one to ensure the paperwork arrived ahead of the deployment. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/06/facial-recognition-tech-used-to-hunt-migrants-was-deployed-without-required-privacy-paperwork/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/06/facial-recognition-tech-used-to-hunt-migrants-was-deployed-without-required-privacy-paperwork/">As we covered recently</a>, both ICE and CBP are using tech provided by NEC called “Mobile Fortify” to identify migrants who are possibly subject to removal, even though neither agency has bothered to publish a Privacy Impact Assessment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-fortify-face-recognition-nec-ice-cbp/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-fortify-face-recognition-nec-ice-cbp/">As Wired reported</a>, the app is being used widely by officers working with both agencies, despite both agencies making it clear they don’t have the proper paperwork in place to justify these deployments. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>While CBP says there are “sufficient monitoring protocols” in place for the app, ICE says that the development of monitoring protocols is in progress, and that it will identify potential impacts during an AI impact assessment. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.ph/o/j89xB/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-21-Accelerating-Federal-Use-of-AI-through-Innovation-Governance-and-Public-Trust.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance</a>&nbsp;from the Office of Management and Budget, which was issued before the inventory says the app was deployed for either CBP or ICE, agencies are supposed to complete an AI impact assessment&nbsp;before&nbsp;deploying any high-impact use case. Both CBP and ICE say the app is “high-impact” and “deployed.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is obviously concerning, it would be far less concerning if we weren’t dealing with an administration that has told immigration officers that they don’t need warrants to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/since-last-may-ice-officers-have-been-told-they-dont-need-warrants-to-enter-homes/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/since-last-may-ice-officers-have-been-told-they-dont-need-warrants-to-enter-homes/">enter houses</a> or <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/03/ice-director-says-officers-are-now-allowed-to-make-arrests-without-warrants/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/03/ice-director-says-officers-are-now-allowed-to-make-arrests-without-warrants/">effect arrests</a>. And it would be insanely less concerning if we weren’t dealing with an administration that has claimed that simply observing or reporting on immigration enforcement efforts is an act of terrorism.</p>
<p>Officers working for the combined forces of bigotry d/b/a/ “immigration enforcement” know they’re safe. The Supreme Court has ensured they’re safe by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/14/supreme-court-makes-it-all-but-impossible-to-sue-federal-officers-for-rights-violations/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/14/supreme-court-makes-it-all-but-impossible-to-sue-federal-officers-for-rights-violations/">making it impossible</a> to sue federal officers. And the people running immigration-related agencies have made it clear they don’t even care if the ends justify the means. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-ice-dhs-mobile-fortify-face-recognition-verify-identity/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-ice-dhs-mobile-fortify-face-recognition-verify-identity/">These facts make what’s reported here even worse</a>, especially when officers are using the app to “identify” pretty much anyone they can point a smartphone at. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Despite DHS repeatedly framing Mobile Fortify as a tool for identifying people through facial recognition, however, the app does not actually “verify” the identities of people stopped by federal immigration agents—a well-known limitation of the technology and a function of how Mobile Fortify is designed and used.</em></p>
<p><em>[…]</em></p>
<p><em>Records reviewed by WIRED also show that DHS’s hasty approval of Fortify last May was enabled by dismantling centralized privacy reviews and quietly removing department-wide limits on facial recognition—changes overseen by a former Heritage Foundation lawyer and Project 2025 contributor, who now serves in a senior DHS privacy role.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you’re the sort of prick who thinks whatever happens to non-citizens is deserved due to their alleged violation of civil statutes, one would hope you’d actually care what happens to your fellow citizens. I mean, one would hope, but even the federal government doesn’t care what happens to US citizens if they happen to be unsupportive of Trump’s migrant-targeting crime wave. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DHS—which has declined to detail the methods and tools that agents are using, despite repeated calls from&nbsp;<a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/90964138-44eb-483d-990e-057ce4c31db7/Use%20of%20FRT%20by%20TSA%2C%20PCLOB%20Report%20%285-12-25%29%2C%20Completed%20508%2C%20May%2019%2C%202025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oversight officials</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Coalition-Letter-on-ICE-Mobile-Fortify-FRT-Nov2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonprofit privacy watchdogs</a>—has used Mobile Fortify to scan the faces not only of “targeted individuals,” but also people later&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/technology/tech-ice-facial-recognition-palantir.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to be US citizens</a>&nbsp;and others who were observing or protesting enforcement activity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLDR and all that: DHS knows this tool performs worst in the situations where it’s used most. DHS and its components also knew they were supposed to produce PIAs before deploying privacy-impacting tech. And DHS knows its agencies are not only misusing the tech to convert AI shrugs into probable cause, but are using it to identify people protesting or observing their efforts, which means this tech is also a potential tool of unlawful retribution.</p>
<p>There’s nothing left to be discussed. This tech will continue to be used because it can turn bad photos into migrant arrests. And its off-label use is just as effective: it allows ICE and CBP agents to identify protesters and observers, even as DHS officials continue to claim doxing should be a federal offense if they’re not the ones doing it. Everything about this is bullshit. But bullshit is all this administration has. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div role="presentation"><p>A lot of what we find interesting about cities is the retail within them. We lean on retail – shops, cafes, restaurants and so on – to make cities what they are. Urban economist Ed Glaeser called this <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article-abstract/1/1/27/2964661">the rise of the consumer city</a>, showing how consumption agglomeration was becoming increasingly important, as well as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/">production agglomeration</a>, in driving up urban rents.</p>



<p>When people say Hayes Valley in San Francisco or Williamsburg in Brooklyn are interesting neighborhoods, what they often mean is that they have interesting retail. Hayes Street is Hayes Street because of stores and restaurants, rather than something inherent about the streetscape. Williamsburg is Williamsburg because of its wine bars, taco trucks, and fancy coffee shops.&nbsp;</p><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/print"><img src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WIP-Cover-i22-v2.png"><div><p><span>Get the print magazine</span></p><hr><p>Subscribe for $100 to receive six beautiful issues per year.</p><p>Subscribe</p></div></a>



<p>Yet the retail operating environment is as hard as it’s ever been. Online shopping <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/829220/share-of-retail-sales-by-channel-us/#:~:text=Retail%20sales%20channel%20share%20in%20the%20United%20States%202022%2D2026&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20the%20in%2Dstore,percent%20of%20all%20retail%20sales." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to capture market share</a>, remote work <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/economics/insights/clicks-and-commutes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduces foot traffic</a>, and <a href="https://nrf.com/advocacy/policy-issues/organized-retail-crime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crime eats into already-small margins</a>. <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/05/18/san-francisco-union-square-store-closures-pandemic-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Almost half of stores shuttered</a> within four years in one San Francisco shopping district.</p>



<p>We risk losing something that makes cities what they are, because we don’t have a good model for letting retail capture the value it creates.</p>



<h3><strong>Retail suffers from leaky value capture</strong></h3>



<p>Hayes Valley has some of the most interesting retail in San Francisco – clothes shops like Marine Layer, Lisa Says Gah and Faherty; some of SF’s best coffee at Ritual; the best bagels in the city at Wise Sons; and some of its best ice cream at Salt + Straw. But the shops there go in and out of business all the time. They barely survive. The neighborhood thrives, the rents go up, the stores struggle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because a big fraction of the value created by these retailers is not captured by them. Consider how you enjoy going into interesting shops – often independent, or quirky, from which you are unlikely to buy something. Going there is a leisure value in itself. Compare to a Walmart where the value is largely in getting food and household items that directly benefit you, and people rarely walk around the shop without buying things.</p>



<p>When an interesting new store, cafe, bar, or restaurant opens up, as well as it profiting from selling its products (if it does), others benefit too: owners of other commercial properties on the street benefit because potential customers are attracted to the area, and owners of homes nearby benefit because their house is now near a nice thing to do. This means that the value of commercial and residential properties go up. A substantial part of the efforts of the retailers on Hayes Street gets realized through the home values of the folks owning Victorians on Fell Street two blocks away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In American cities, there is an issue with value capture. One party creates the value (in this case retailers), another party (landowners or homeowners) captures it. Of course retailers would love to capture more value. But homeowners would likely be willing to share value too: the homeowners like having the retailers there, yet those retailers often go out of business, making the homeowners worse off. They’d be better off if there was an institution to support them, but it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>You see a similar dynamic with public transportation infrastructure. The government spent billions building Caltrain’s regional rail service to the Bay Area Peninsula. Unfortunately, most of those stations are surrounded by low density housing. The few hundred homes within walking distance of a station capture a large amount of the value from the infrastructure. Meanwhile, the train system runs unprofitably and needs to be propped up by taxpayers across the whole region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you like having shops, parks and trains in your city, the fact that these institutions are failing to capture so much of the value they create should alarm you. The less they capture, the less of it will be created in the first place. As a result, we will have empty storefronts, fewer parks, and less public transit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, history and international practice show us quite a few examples of doing this much better.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Internal cross-subsidization (within big developments)</strong></h3>



<p>The first model, which has been widely used historically, is <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-merits-of-unified-ownership/">unified ownership</a>. When ownership of a main street is splintered, a large spillover from ‘cool retail’ leaks away to unaffiliated parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The failure of splintered pedestrian main streets in the 1960s and 1970s led to the rise of destination shopping malls and strip malls. Both make use of ‘anchor stores’ to bring in customers, plus regulated signage, and usually pick a diverse set of interesting shops. A single entity can capture the resulting spillover. The single owners captured enough of the benefit from policing them with private security, and from excluding cars, that they could survive where the splintered outdoor main streets could not.</p>

<p>Supermarkets and department stores are classic anchor tenants. They make lower profits, and are often charged lower rents, but bring in customers that benefit all the other shops. Effectively they raise land values. Single ownership allows them to capture some of the land value appreciation, usually by being charged lower rents from the unified owner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But shopping malls only go so far, mostly capturing only the spillover benefits between businesses, and not the spillovers that all the businesses taken together give the rest of the community, such as to the homeowners who live nearby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers are beginning to try this, returning to a historic model by having a single entity own both housing and retail, in order to sell the housing for more. One of the authors of this piece helped start <a href="https://culdesac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Culdesac</a>, where we selected commercial tenants not only on the rents we anticipated the tenant would pay, but also the value they would provide to residents in the surrounding apartment units. For developers building at a sufficient scale and where zoning permits it (a big if in the USA, where zoning has historically favored separated uses), this approach is fairly common around the world.</p>



<p>This requires single entities that control a large swath of land. It’s part of the reason why large planned communities such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside,_Florida">Seaside</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebration,_Florida">Celebration</a> in Florida are able to have nice common amenities. They are in a position to do this cross-subsidization. It’s also why shopping malls from the past few decades as far apart as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://baystreetemeryville.com/directory/">Bay Street </a>Emeryville in the East Bay or Coal Drops Yard in Kings Cross, London increasingly have housing included.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transit is another classic example where unified ownership can capture spillover effects.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-rail-plus-property-model">buys up the land around new station sites</a> before they start building them. This rail-plus-property model makes them one of the few profitable transit services in the world. Japan goes even further: Tokyo’s metros, trams, and buses are private, and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/conference-papers/transit-value-capture">fund their investment into infrastructure</a> by speculating on property they expect to rise in value as a result of their investment.</p>



<p>How could we get cities without unified ownership blocks to create them?</p>



<p>One way to encourage this comes from Donald Shoup: <a href="http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/GraduatedDensityZoning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graduated density zoning</a>. This gives properties the right to build more on their plots if they are part of a larger assembled plot. This is effectively how the old light plane–based zoning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1916_Zoning_Resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1916–1961 New York City</a> worked as well. The larger the plot, the more externalities internalized. A still further way to enable consolidation might be to give local governments more power to plan for it where they think it will maximize value for the public, for example by letting them waive transfer taxes (like <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56eddde762cd9413e151ac92/t/59f35a84f9619a618714a5df/1509120655818/Beyond+the+Call+of+Duty+.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the UK’s stamp duty</a>), in exchange for a bigger property tax (or in the UK, business rates) take.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Hyperlocal taxes, hyperlocal authorities&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Local taxing authorities can tax the increase in the land value and funnel it back into supporting retail or common infrastructure. Something like this is happening when local authorities in the UK <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/architects-warn-of-disastrous-consequences-as-government-allows-entire-high-streets-to-become-housing/5109580.article">refuse to let commercial landlords convert their commercial properties</a> into residential ones. They argue that, although it is a benefit considered on its own terms (because it uses the land for something more in demand), it deprives the area of valuable amenities.</p>



<p>But typical local governments are often too big to do this well, in a way that really does achieve the optimal use of the land. Individual local government units – like cities or counties in the US – often have hundreds of thousands of residents, spread over hundreds of square miles. It is very difficult to track where land value is spilling over from, and where it should be funneled back, and residents thus have no faith that this is what will happen.</p>



<p>By contrast, this sort of value capture can work when the taxing authority is very local. <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/growing-the-growth-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two thirds of new American homes</a> are in some sort of community association, typically homeowners’ associations, but also co-ops, and condominium associations, and 30 percent of American homes overall. Buyers opt into these associations, pay annual fees in the thousands of dollars, and <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-great-downzoning/">suffer their annoying restrictions and demands</a> because they create amenities: quiet, cleanliness/tidiness, safety, or things like public pools and parks. But so far, the community association model has been applied almost exclusively to purely residential areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Business Improvement Districts are one way of trying to bring this sort of institution to a high street. Businesses opt into charging themselves higher taxes or fees to support projects that make local businesses more successful like planting trees, improving streets, and tackling local crime or antisocial behavior. But while these districts can help internalize externalities that spill over among businesses, they haven’t so far been applied to capture value that spills over to nearby residents. Given that there is more residential real estate than commercial, a BID that could capture the residential interest too could be an interesting avenue for capturing value and funding public goods.</p>



<p>Special Purpose Bonds, like the one raised to fund the Golden Gate Bridge and this <a href="https://www.nzinitiative.org.nz/assets/DMSDocuments/Funding-the-Future-The-case-for-special-purpose-bonds.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example from New Zealand</a> are a variation where voters approved bond-funded investments, usually infrastructure, that will be paid back through their property taxes. We can imagine an example where voters are approving not a bridge, but a neighborhood organization that raised a small tax to keep the most interesting shops in business, the streets clean, and the plants fed.</p>



<p>Really bringing this system alive would require creating an institution, like special purpose bonds, or a mixed homeowners’ association-business improvement district that would allow hyperlocal taxes to part-subsidize valued community retail assets.</p>



<h3><strong>Providing the commons</strong></h3>



<p>We are asking a lot of retail in cities.</p>



<p>We want it to be entertainment, a gathering spot or third space, and we want it to help form a city’s culture. We also want it to pay its rent. Delivering on all of those goals may be too much to ask of our retail base, without some help.</p>



<p>We offer a prediction: as the ‘selling stuff’ model of retail becomes less viable due to internet-based alternatives, the ‘commons’ or ‘third space’ version of it may rise up instead. There are already examples: <a href="https://www.thesfcommons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Commons</a> in San Francisco took over a former clothing shop and runs a member-based ‘home outside of home’. These models can work for private spaces, but they won’t fully capture spillovers, meaning they will be underprovided.</p>



<p>These value capture models could help neighborhoods more directly provide the thing people actually want without having a shoehorn a high-margin retail business model alongside it. And they may provide a path to capturing, in a more direct way, the benefits a space gives to its surrounding community.</p>

<p>A party balloon mistaken for a cartel drone shut down El Paso for hours. Here’s what it cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On February 10, 2026, the FAA shut down all flights over El Paso for what was supposed to be 10 days because the U.S. military had shot down what it thought was a drone. It turned out to be a party balloon. The closure was lifted within hours, but not before 15 flights were canceled, others delayed by hours, medevacs rerouted to Las Cruces, and Fort Bliss grounded.</p>
<p>So, how much did it cost?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s my method for answering that question.</strong> I used only public, citable data. I reconstructed the timeline, built a flight dataset, classified cancellations and delays, converted disruption into passenger-hours and labor-hours, and monetized it with USDOT value-of-time guidance. I then applied sanity checks and documented all assumptions. Below is the analysis.</p>
<h2 id="1-timeline">1. Timeline</h2>





























<div><table><thead><tr><th>Event</th><th>Local (MST)</th><th>UTC</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TFR effective (closure start)</td><td>11:30 PM Feb 10</td><td>06:30 Feb 11</td><td>FAA TFR notice, El Paso Times</td></tr><tr><td>TFR lifted (closure end)</td><td>6:54 AM Feb 11</td><td>13:54 Feb 11</td><td>FAA X post (6:54 MT)</td></tr><tr><td>Effective duration</td><td>~7.4 hours</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p><strong>What changed:</strong> The FAA initially announced a 10-day restriction. After coordination between federal agencies—and clarification that the threat had been addressed—the FAA reversed the restriction within hours. No partial reopening was reported; the closure was lifted in full.</p>

<p>Southwest, American, and Delta canceled 15 flights in and out of El Paso before the FAA lifted the restriction (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/el-paso-flights-halted-10-days-security-reasons-airlines-faa-2026-2">Business Insider</a>). Departing aircraft experienced average delays of over three hours.

<p>The cost estimates here are based only on publicly available data. The true impact is likely higher because the following factors cannot be quantified from public sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fort Bliss / Biggs Army Airfield</strong> — Military aviation was grounded (within 10 nm TFR). No public data on overnight military flight volume or mission impact.</li>
<li><strong>Medevac / medical</strong> — Mayor Johnson reported medical evacuation flights rerouted to Las Cruces and surgical equipment unable to reach El Paso. No public cost or clinical outcome data.</li>
<li><strong>Cargo</strong> — Sierra West diverted to Las Cruces; other cargo likely affected. Perishable and time-sensitive freight costs not reported.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel / holding</strong> — Additional fuel from diversions and holding; magnitude unknown.</li>
<li><strong>General aviation</strong> — GA within the TFR excluded; no public flight count.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary effects</strong> — Aircraft/crew rotation cascade, crew legal/rest limits, spillover demand to nearby airports, call-center surge volume. No public benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>Tertiary effects</strong> — Business and supply-chain disruption, ground transport, medical outcomes, reputational impact. Not quantifiable from public data.</li>

<h2 id="5-sanity-check">5. Sanity Check</h2>
<p>El Paso Rep. Chris Canales estimated a <strong>10-day</strong> closure could cost El Paso 40–50 million dollars (<a href="https://elpasotimes.com/story/news/2026/02/11/live-updates-flights-at-el-paso-airport-grounded-for-10-days/88621302007">El Paso Times</a>). My estimate is for the <strong>actual ~7-hour</strong> disruption. Scaling linearly: 7.4 hrs / (10 × 24) ≈ 3.1% of a 10-day scenario → <span></span>573K falls below that estimate, as I guessed it would due to only including public data. ELP typically has ~55 departures and ~106 total daily operations; the disruption affected the overnight/early-morning bank.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> There is no way to know if this was the most expensive party balloon in history. But I wouldn’t pay $573k for one.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Post-script:</strong></em> This piece is not intended to criticize or judge anyone involved. Who among us hasn’t, at some point, mistaken a party balloon for a cartel drone? Let him cast the first stone.</p>
<p>Finally, this analysis was vibed together quickly as the situation unfolded, using only publicly available data. It is not a substitute for professional economic analysis.</p></article><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>We have raised $30 billion in Series G funding led by GIC and Coatue, valuing Anthropic at $380 billion post-money. The round was co-led by D. E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX. The investment will fuel the frontier research, product development, and infrastructure expansions that have made Anthropic the market leader in enterprise AI and coding.</p><p>Significant investors in this round include: Accel, Addition, Alpha Wave Global, Altimeter, AMP PBC, Appaloosa LP, Baillie Gifford, Bessemer Venture Partners, affiliated funds of BlackRock, Blackstone, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, General Catalyst, Greenoaks, Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Insight Partners, Jane Street, JPMorganChase through its Security and Resiliency Initiative and Growth Equity Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, NX1 Capital, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Sands Capital, Sequoia Capital, Temasek, TowerBrook, TPG, Whale Rock Capital, and XN. This round also includes a portion of the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/microsoft-nvidia-anthropic-announce-strategic-partnerships">previously announced investments</a> from Microsoft and NVIDIA.</p><p>“Whether it is entrepreneurs, startups, or the world’s largest enterprises, the message from our customers is the same: Claude is increasingly becoming more critical to how businesses work,” said Krishna Rao, Anthropic’s Chief Financial Officer. “This fundraising reflects the incredible demand we are seeing from these customers, and we will use this investment to continue building the enterprise-grade products and models they have come to depend on.”</p><p>It has been less than three years since Anthropic earned its first dollar in revenue. Today, our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="5760" height="4146" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F3b0ce5da844b454d85f4538162bb70f749dc5877-5760x4146.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F3b0ce5da844b454d85f4538162bb70f749dc5877-5760x4146.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>This growth has been driven by our position as the intelligence platform of choice for enterprises and developers. The number of customers spending over $100,000 annually on Claude (as represented by run-rate revenue) has grown 7x in the past year. And businesses that start with Claude for a single use case—API, Claude Code, or Claude for Work—are expanding their integrations across their organizations. Two years ago, a dozen customers spent over $1 million with us on an annualized basis. Today that number exceeds 500. Eight of the Fortune 10 are now Claude customers.</p><p>Claude Code represents a new era of agentic coding, fundamentally changing how teams build software. Claude Code was made available to the general public in May 2025. Today, Claude Code’s run-rate revenue has grown to over $2.5 billion; this figure has more than doubled since the beginning of 2026. The number of weekly active Claude Code users has also doubled since January 1. A recent <a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/claude-code-is-the-inflection-point">analysis</a> estimated that 4% of all GitHub public commits worldwide were being authored by Claude Code—double the percentage from just one month prior.</p><p>Business subscriptions to Claude Code have quadrupled since the start of 2026, and enterprise use has grown to represent over half of all Claude Code revenue. The same capabilities that make Claude exceptional for coding are also unlocking other new categories of work: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-teams-up-with-anthropic-automate-banking-tasks-with-ai-agents-cnbc-2026-02-06/">financial and data analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/servicenow-anthropic-claude">sales</a>, <a href="https://claude.com/customers/esentire">cybersecurity</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/accelerating-scientific-research">scientific discovery</a>, and beyond.</p><p>In January alone, we launched more than thirty products and features, including <a href="https://claude.com/product/cowork">Cowork</a>, which brings Claude Code’s powerful engineering capabilities to a broader scope of knowledge work tasks. Cowork includes eleven open-source plugins that let customers turn Claude into a specialist for specific roles or teams, like sales, legal, or finance. We also expanded our reach into <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences">healthcare and life sciences</a>, with Claude for Enterprise now available to organizations operating under HIPAA.</p><p>“Since our initial investment in 2025, Anthropic’s focus on agentic coding and enterprise-grade AI systems has accelerated its progress toward large-scale adoption,” said Philippe Laffont, Founder &amp; Portfolio Manager of Coatue. “The team’s ability to rapidly scale its offerings further positions Anthropic as a leader in a highly competitive AI market.”</p><p>Claude’s frontier-setting intelligence continues to advance. Our newest model—<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6">Opus 4.6</a>, launched last week—can power agents that manage entire categories of real-world work, generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations with professional polish. And Opus 4.6 is the world’s leading model on <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa">GDPval-AA</a>, which measures performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains.</p><p>“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI, demonstrating breakthrough capabilities and setting a new standard for safety, performance, and scale that will drive their long-term success,” said Choo Yong Cheen, Chief Investment Officer, Private Equity, GIC.</p><p>The Series G will also power our infrastructure expansion as we make Claude available everywhere our customers are. Claude remains the only frontier AI model available to customers on all three of the world's largest cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services (Bedrock), Google Cloud (Vertex AI), and Microsoft Azure (Foundry). We train and run Claude on a diversified range of AI hardware—AWS Trainium, Google TPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs—which means we can match workloads to the chips best suited for them. This diversity of platforms translates to better performance and greater resilience for the enterprise customers that depend on Claude for critical work.</p><p>The demand we are seeing from enterprises and developers reflects the trust they place in Claude for the work that matters most. As AI moves toward scaled implementation, we will continue to build the models, products, and partnerships to lead that transition.</p></div></article></div><div data-theme="ivory"><p><h2>Related content</h2></p><div><div><h3>Anthropic is donating $20 million to Public First Action</h3><p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/donate-public-first-action" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"><span>Read more</span><span><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 21 21"><path d="M4.14585 9.87492L14.4584 9.87492L9.60419 5.04158L10.5 4.14575L16.8542 10.4999L10.5 16.8541L9.60419 15.9583L14.4584 11.1249L4.14585 11.1249L4.14585 9.87492Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span></a></p></div><div><h3>Covering electricity price increases from our data centers</h3><p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"><span>Read more</span><span><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 21 21"><path d="M4.14585 9.87492L14.4584 9.87492L9.60419 5.04158L10.5 4.14575L16.8542 10.4999L10.5 16.8541L9.60419 15.9583L14.4584 11.1249L4.14585 11.1249L4.14585 9.87492Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span></a></p></div><div><h3>Introducing Claude Opus 4.6</h3><p>We’re upgrading our smartest model.
