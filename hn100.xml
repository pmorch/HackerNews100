<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The modern Olympics sell themselves on a simple premise: the whole world, watching the same moment, at the same time. On Friday night in Milan, that illusion fractured in real time.</p><p>When Team USA entered the San Siro during the parade of nations, the speed skater Erin Jackson led the delegation into a wall of cheers. Moments later, when cameras cut to US vice-president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance, large sections of the crowd responded with boos. Not subtle ones, but audible and sustained ones. <a href="https://x.com/donkoclock/status/2019887497891696788" data-link-name="in body link">Canadian viewers heard them</a>. Journalists seated in the press tribunes in the upper deck, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/06/intimate-and-enormous-milano-cortina-opening-ceremony-winter-olympics-2026" data-link-name="in body link">myself included</a>, clearly <a href="https://x.com/cbrennansports/status/2019884436121125181" data-link-name="in body link">heard them</a>. But as I quickly realized from a groupchat with friends back home, American viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Um9gPUoA0" data-link-name="in body link">watching NBC did not</a>.</p><figure id="60a9b2dc-fbb1-42da-a579-ddbed3a0a525" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:2,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;NBC appears to cut crowd’s booing of JD Vance from Winter Olympics broadcast&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;60a9b2dc-fbb1-42da-a579-ddbed3a0a525&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/06/nbc-appears-to-cut-crowds-booing-of-jd-vance-from-winter-olympics-broadcast&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:8,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}"></gu-island></figure><p>On its own, the situation might once have passed unnoticed. But the defining feature of the modern sports media landscape is that no single broadcaster controls the moment any more. CBC carried it. The BBC liveblogged it. <a href="https://x.com/donkoclock/status/2019887497891696788" data-link-name="in body link">Fans clipped it</a>. Within minutes, multiple versions of the same happening were circulating online – some with boos, some without – turning what might once have been a routine production call into a case study in information asymmetry.</p><p>For its part, <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/denies-editing-jd-vance-boos-olympics-opening-ceremony-audio.html" data-link-name="in body link">NBC has denied</a> editing the crowd audio, although it is difficult to resolve why the boos so audible in the stadium and on other broadcasts were absent for US viewers. But in a broader sense, it is becoming harder, not easier, to curate reality when the rest of the world is holding up its own camera angles. And that raises an uncomfortable question as the United States moves toward hosting two of the largest sporting events on the planet: the 2026 men’s World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p><p>If a US administration figure is booed at the Olympics in Los Angeles, or a World Cup match in New Jersey or Dallas, will American domestic broadcasts simply mute or avoid mentioning the crowd audio? If so, what happens when the world feed, or a foreign broadcaster, shows something else entirely? What happens when 40,000 phones in the stadium upload their own version in real time?</p><p>The risk is not just that viewers will see through it. It is that attempts to manage the narrative will make American broadcasters look less credible, not more. Because the audience now assumes there is always another angle. Every time a broadcaster makes that trade – credibility for insulation – it is a trade audiences eventually notice.</p><p>There is also a deeper structural pressure behind decisions like this. The Trump era has been defined in part by sustained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/trump-sues-media-outlets-bias" data-link-name="in body link">hostility toward media institutions</a>. Broadcasters do not operate in a vacuum; they operate inside regulatory environments, political climates and corporate risk calculations. When presidents and their allies openly threaten or target networks, it is naive to pretend that has no downstream effect on editorial choices – especially in high-stakes live broadcasts tied to billion-dollar rights deals.</p><p>But there is a difference between contextual pressure and visible reality distortion. When global audiences can compare feeds in real time, the latter begins to resemble something else entirely: not editorial judgment, but narrative management. Which is why comparisons to Soviet-style state-controlled broadcasting models – once breathless rhetorical exaggerations – are starting to feel less hyperbolic.</p><p>The irony is that the Olympics themselves are built around the idea that sport can exist alongside political tension without pretending it does not exist. The International Olympic Committee’s own language – athletes should not be punished for governments’ actions – implicitly acknowledges that governments are part of the Olympic theater whether organizers like it or not.</p><p>Friday night illustrated that perfectly. American athletes were cheered, their enormous contingent given one of the most full-throated receptions of the night. The political emissaries were not universally welcomed. Both things can be true at once. Crowd dissent is not a failure of the Olympic ideal. In open societies, it is part of how public sentiment is expressed. Attempting to erase one side of that equation risks flattening reality into something audiences no longer trust. And if Milan was a warning shot, Los Angeles is the main event.</p><p>Since Donald Trump’s first term, American political coverage around sport has fixated on the micro-moments: Was the president booed or cheered? Did the broadcast show it? Did he attend or skip events likely to produce hostile crowds? The discourse has often felt like a Rorschach test, filtered through partisan interpretation and selective clips.</p><p>The LA Olympics will be something else entirely. There is no hiding from an opening ceremony. No ducking a stadium when the Olympic Charter requires the host country’s head of state to officially declare the Games open. No controlling how 200 international broadcasters carry the moment.</p><p>If Trump is still in the White House in mid-2028, one month after his 82nd birthday and in the thick of another heated US presidential campaign, he will stand in front of a global television audience as a key part of the opening ceremony. He will do so in California, in a political environment far less friendly than many domestic sporting venues he has appeared in over the past decade. And he will do it in a city synonymous with the political opposition, potentially in the back yard of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/gavin-newsom-2028-presidential-race" data-link-name="in body link">the Democratic presidential candidate</a>.</p><p>There will be some cheers. There will almost certainly be boos. There will be everything in between. And there will be no way to make them disappear. The real risk for American broadcasters is not that dissent will be visible. It is that audiences will start assuming anything they do not show is being hidden. In an era when trust in institutions is already fragile, that is a dangerous place to operate from.</p><p>The Olympics have always been political, whether through boycotts, protests, symbolic gestures or crowd reactions. What has changed is not the politics. It is the impossibility of containing the optics.</p><p>Milan may ultimately be remembered as a small moment – a few seconds of crowd noise during a long ceremony. But it also felt like a preview of the next phase of global sport broadcasting: one where narrative control is shared, contested and instantly verifiable. The world is watching. And this time, it is also recording.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-31/">https://lineageos.org/Changelog-31/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46931595">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2 id="232-halftime-release">23.2 Halftime Release</h2>

<p>Hello again!</p>

<p>The last few months have been quite the endeavor, as we have been busy rebasing and updating LineageOS, on not one but two large AOSP releases. Nevertheless, we have persevered and are pleased to present LineageOS 23.2.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-aosp">Changes in AOSP</h3>

<p>Over the last few years, AOSP has been shifting to a quarterly release cadence, meaning that new features and bug fixes are released every three months. Google recently announced that AOSP will be shifting to a biannual release cadence, meaning that the latest fixes and features will drop every six months now.</p>

<p>Android Security Bulletins will still be released, and picked to all supported LineageOS versions monthly.</p>

<p>While this change does not significantly alter our development process, it is worth noting that LineageOS will adopt a six-month cadence, with work on each new point release starting every six months.</p>

<h3 id="whats-changed">What’s Changed</h3>

<p>When you install or upgrade to this release, you will immediately notice the new UI and color scheme. This is because LineageOS is now officially using Google’s Material Expressive design system which focuses on expressive colors, and emotive design elements.</p>

<p>In addition, you may notice the updated UI of the Quick Settings panel, which now contains fully customizable tiles, which in our opinion are much more pleasant to use! In this release, you will also find an expanded dark theme, and more powerful file utilities surrounding private spaces.</p>

<h3 id="updated-apps">Updated Apps</h3>

<p>This release mainly focuses on the Material Expressive design language, and in the interest of keeping up with these guidelines, we have been working diligently at updating the default apps to Material Expressive.</p>

<h4 id="updater">Updater</h4>

<p>Contributor pjgowtham has been hard at work on updating the Updater app, and when those changes are merged, you will be treated to a completely redesigned UI, improved update management, delightful animations and various bugs fixed. It wasn’t quite ready for the 23.2 launch, but will be soon, so be on the lookout!</p>

<h4 id="other-apps">Other apps</h4>

<p>In addition to the Updater, Twelve (the default music app), Deskclock and ExactCalculator have received Material 3 Expressive updates, which brings them into the modern era. Stay tuned for similar updates to the other default apps!</p>

<h3 id="development-tools">Development Tools</h3>

<p>In the previous release changelog, we teased some development tools that were in the midst of being reviewed. These have now been merged, and developers have some new tools in their arsenal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>beautify_rro.py</code>: Beautifies multiple existing RROs given a directory.</li>
  <li><code>generate_rro.py</code>: Extracts RROs from a prebuilt overlays directory.</li>
  <li><code>update_certificates.py</code>: Updates app certificates given a stock dump directory.</li>
  <li><code>decompile_cil.py</code>: Extracts sepolicy rules from a prebuilt SELinux image.</li>
  <li><code>extract_aconfig.py</code>: Extracts config files from stock dumps.</li>
  <li><code>match_manifest_tarball.py</code>: Matches kernel (or source) tarball releases against public Git history.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leadership-changes">Leadership Changes</h3>

<p>After roughly seven years with Lineage, and another five with CyanogenMod, we’re sad to announce Rashed is stepping away from the project to spend more time offline. We wish him the best!</p>

<p>We’re also glad to announce that the current directors group have voted Nolen Johnson (npjohnson) in as the ninth director. Welcome!</p>

<h3 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h3>

<p>Overall, we feel that the 23.2 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 23.0 and is
ready for initial release.</p>

<p>We will still allow new LineageOS 21 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we will continue our policy of no longer
allowing newly submitted LineageOS 21 devices to ship.</p>

<p>LineageOS 23.2 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to
come as they meet the requirements specified by the
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md">Charter</a> and are
marked as ready for builds by their maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-to-lineageos-232">Upgrading to LineageOS 23.2</h3>

<p>To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> and then on “Upgrade to a higher version of LineageOS”.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole’ install guide for your
device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> by clicking on your device and then on “Installation”.</p>

<p>Please note that if you’re currently on an official build, you <em>DO NOT</em> need to wipe your device,
unless your device’s wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with
massive changes, such as a repartition.</p>

<h3 id="developers-developers-developers">Developers, Developers, Developers</h3>

<p>Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!</p>

<p>If you’re a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it’s easier than ever.
Just follow the instructions <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but
are no longer supported - seriously - even if it’s not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe
we can help you complete it.</p>

<p>After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you’ll receive some
feedback on your device submission; and if it’s up to par, you’ll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS’s official repositories.</p>

<p>Don’t have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots
of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/contributing-apps/">improve them</a>, or you can
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/contributing_wiki">contribute to the wiki</a> by adding
more useful information &amp; documentation.
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html">Gerrit</a> is always open for submissions! Once
you’ve contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we’ll
get you in the loop.</p>

<p>Also, if you sent a submission that didn’t get a response in the last few months, please follow up,
we’ve swapped providers again!</p>

<h3 id="generic-targets">Generic Targets</h3>

<p>We’ve talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.</p>

<p>Although we’ve had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to
developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we’ve documented how to use
them in conjunction with the Android
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html">Emulator/Android Studio</a>!</p>

<p>Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations,
and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google’s
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>.
We won’t be providing official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies
entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble’s requirements, but feel
free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!</p>

<p>Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy all later Android versions) diverged GSI and Emulator
targets. Emulator targets reside in <code>lineage_sdk_$arch</code>, while GSI targets reside in
<code>lineage_gsi_$arch</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, experimental targets now exist for QEMU-based virtual machine software (libvirt,
UTM, etc). Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?</p>

<p>If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate">our wiki</a> and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we’ll take
the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.</p>

<p>Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 01:55:09 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/beyond-agentic-coding">https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/beyond-agentic-coding</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46930565">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm generally pretty pro-AI with one major exception: agentic coding.  My consistent impression is that agentic coding does not actually improve productivity and deteriorates the user's comfort and familiarity with the codebase.  I formed that impression from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/my-experience-with-vibe-coding">my own personal experiences</a></p>
<p>Every time I use agentic coding tools I'm consistently unimpressed with the quality of the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my experiences interviewing candidates</p>
<p>I allow interview candidates to use agentic coding tools and candidates who do so consistently performed <em>worse</em> than other candidates, failing to complete the challenge or producing incorrect results<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.  This was a huge surprise to me at first because I expected agentic coding to confer an unfair advantage but … nope!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>research studies</p>
<p>Studies like the <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">Becker study</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245">Shen study</a> show that users of agentic coding perform no better and sometimes worse when you measure productivity in terms of fixed outcomes rather than code velocity/volume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe agentic coding is a lost cause, but I do believe agentic coding in its present incarnation is doing more harm than good to software development.  I also believe it is still worthwhile to push on the inadequacies of agentic coding so that it empowers developers and improves code quality.</p>
<p>However, in this post I'm taking a different tack: I want to present other ways to leverage AI for software development.  I believe that agentic coding has so captured the cultural imagination that people are sleeping on other good and underexplored solutions to AI-assisted software development.</p>
<h2>The master cue</h2>
<p>I like to design tools and interfaces from first principles rather than reacting to industry trends/hype and I've accrued quite a few general design principles from over a decade of working in DevProd and also an even longer history of open source projects and contributions.</p>
<p>One of those design principles is my personal "master cue", which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good tool or interface should keep the user in a flow state as long as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle isn't even specific to AI-assisted software development, and yet still highlights why agentic coding sometimes misses the mark.  Both studies and developer testimonials show that agentic coding breaks flow and keeps developers in an idle/interruptible holding pattern more than ordinary coding.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089">Becker study</a> took screen recordings and saw that idle time approximately doubled:</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/idle-time.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I believe we can improve AI-assisted coding tools (agentic or not) if we set our north star to “preserve flow state”.</p>
<h2>Calm technology</h2>
<p><a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm technology</a> is a design discipline that promotes flow state in tools that we build.  The design principles most relevant to coding are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tools should minimize demands on our attention</p>
<p>Interruptions and intrusions on our attention break us out of flow state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools should be built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>A tool is not meant to be the object of our attention; rather the tool should <em>reveal</em> the true object of our attention (the thing the tool acts upon), rather than obscuring it.  The more we use the tool the more the tool fades into the background of our awareness while still supporting our work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools should create and enhance calm (thus the name: calm technology)</p>
<p>A state of calm helps users enter and maintain flow state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-LLM examples of calm technology</h2>
<p>Engineers already use “calm” tools and interfaces as part of our work and here are a couple of examples you're probably already familiar with:</p>
<h3>Inlay hints</h3>
<p>IDEs (like VSCode) can support <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-editing#_inlay-hints">inlay hints</a> that sprinkle the code with useful annotations for the reader, such as inferred type annotations:</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/inlay-hints.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These types of inlay hints embody calm design principles because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they minimize demands on our attention</p>
<p>They exist on the periphery of our attention, available for us if we're interested but unobtrusive if we're not interested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>They don't replace or substitute the code that we are editing.  They enhance the code editing experience but the user is still in direct contact with the edited code.  The more we use type hints the more they fade into the background of our awareness and the more the code remains the focus of our attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they create and enhance calm</p>
<p>They promote a sense of calm by informing our understanding of the code <strong>passively</strong>.  As one of the <a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</a> principles puts it: <em>“Technology can communicate, but doesn't need to speak”.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>File tree previews</h3>
<p>Tools like VSCode or GitHub's pull request viewer let you preview at a glance changes to the file tree, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/file-tree-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You might think to yourself “this is a very uninteresting thing to use as an example” but that's exactly the point.  The best tools (designed with the principles of calm technology) are pervasive and <strong>boring</strong> things that we take for granted (like light switches) and that have faded so strongly into the background of our attention that we forget they even exist as a part of our daily workflow (also like light switches).</p>
<p>File tree previews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>minimize demands on our attention</p>
<p>They're there if we need the information, but easy to ignore (or even forget they exist) if we don't use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>When we interact with the file tree viewer we are interacting directly with the filesystem and the interaction between the representation (the viewer) and the reality (the filesystem) feels direct, snappy, and precise.  The more we use the viewer the more the representation becomes indistinguishable from the reality in our minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create and enhance calm</p>
<p>We do not need to constantly interact with the file tree to gather up-to-date information about our project structure.  It passively updates in the background as we make changes to the project and those updates are unobtrusive and not attention-grabbing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chat-based coding agents are not calm</h2>
<p>We can think about the limitations of chat-based agentic coding tools through this same lens:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they place high demands on our attention</p>
<p>The user has to either sit and wait for the agent to report back or do something else and run the LLM in a semi-autonomous manner.  However, even semi-autonomous sessions prevent the user from entering flow state because they have to remain interruptible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are not built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>Chat agents are a highly mediated interface to the code which is <strong>indirect</strong> (we interact more with the agent than the code), <strong>slow</strong> (we spend a lot of time waiting), and <strong>imprecise</strong> (English is a <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html">dull interface</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they undermine calm</p>
<p>The user needs to constantly stimulate the chat to gather new information or update their understanding of the code (the chat agent doesn't inform the user's understanding passively or quietly).  Chat agents are also fine-tuned to maximize engagement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prior art for calm design</h2>
<h3>Inline suggestions from GitHub Copilot</h3>
<p>One of the earliest examples of an AI coding assistant that begins to model calm design principles is the OG AI-assistant: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions">GitHub Copilot's support for inline suggestions</a>, with some caveats I'll go into.</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/inline-suggestions.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This does one thing really well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it's built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>The user is still interacting directly with the code and the suggestions are reasonably snappy.  The user can also ignore or type through the suggestion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, by default these inline suggestions violate other calm technology principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they demand our attention</p>
<p>By default Copilot presents the suggestions quite frequently and the user has to pause what they're doing to examine the output of the suggestion.  After enough times the user begins to condition themselves into regularly pausing and waiting for a suggestion which breaks them out of a flow state.  Now instead of being proactive the user's been conditioned by the tool to be reactive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they undermine calm</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot's inline suggestion interface is visually busy and intrusive.  Even if the user ignores every suggestion the effect is still disruptive: suggestions appear on the user's screen in the center of their visual focus and the user has to decide on the spot whether to accept or ignore them before proceeding further.  The user also can't easily passively absorb information presented in this way: understanding each suggestion requires the user's focused attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>… <em>buuuuut</em> these issues are partially fixable by disabling the automatic suggestions and requiring them to be explicitly triggered by <code>Alt</code> + <code>\</code>.  However, unfortunately that also disables the next feature, which I like even more:</p>
<h3>Next edit suggestions (also from GitHub Copilot)</h3>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions#_next-edit-suggestions">Next edit suggestions</a> are a related GitHub Copilot feature that display related follow-up edits throughout the file/project and let the user cycle between them and possibly accept each suggested change.  They behave like a “super-charged find and replace”:</p>
<video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>These suggestions do an amazing job of keeping the user in a flow state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they minimize demand on the user's attention</p>
<p>The cognitive load on the user is smaller than inline suggestions because the suggestions are more likely to be bite-sized (and therefore easier for a human to review and accept).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they're built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>Just like inline suggestions, next edit suggestions still keep the user in close contact with the code they are modifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they create and enhance calm</p>
<p>Suggestions are presented in an unobtrusive way: they aren't dumped in the dead center of the user's attention and they don't demand immediate review.  They exist on the periphery of the user's attention as code suggestions that the user can ignore or focus on at their leisure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI-assisted calm technology</h2>
<p>I believe there is a lot of untapped potential in AI-assisted coding tools and in this section I'll sketch a few small examples of how we can embody calm technology design principles in building the next generation of coding tools.</p>
<h3>Facet-based project navigation</h3>
<p>You could browse a project by a tree of semantic facets.  For example, if you were editing <a href="https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell">the Haskell implementation of Dhall</a> the tree viewer might look like this prototype I hacked up<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>:</p>
<video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/semantic-facets.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>The goal here is to not only provide a quick way to explore the project by intent, but to also improve the user's understanding of the project the more they use the feature.  "String interpolation regression" is so much more informative than <code>dhall/tests/format/issue2078A.dhall</code><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, the above video is based on a real tool and not just a mock.  You can find the code I used to generate that tree of semantics facets <a href="https://github.com/Gabriella439/facet-navigator">here</a> and I'll write up another post soon walking through how that code works.</p>
<h3>Automated commit refactor</h3>
<p>You could take an editor session, a diff, or a pull request and automatically split it into a series of more focused commits that are easier for people to review.  This is one of the cases where the AI can <em>reduce</em> human review labor (most agentic coding tools <em>create</em> more human review labor).</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/458416/how-to-decompose-a-large-git-commit-with-an-ai">some prior art here</a> but this is still a nascent area of development.</p>
<h3>File lens</h3>
<p>You could add two new tools to the user's toolbar or context menu: <em>“Focus on…”</em> and <em>“Edit as…”.</em></p>
<p><em>“Focus on…”</em> would allow the user to specify what they're interested in changing and present only files and lines of code related to their specified interest.  For example, if they want to focus on “command line options” then only related files and lines of code would be shown in the editor and other lines of code would be hidden/collapsed/folded.  This would basically be like “Zen mode” but for editing a feature domain of interest.</p>
<p><em>“Edit as…”</em> would allow the user to edit the file or selected code as if it were a different programming language or file format.  For example, someone who was new to Haskell could edit a Haskell file “as Python” and then after finishing their edits the AI attempts to back-propagate their changes to Haskell.  Or someone modifying a command-line parser could edit the file “as YAML” and be presented with a simplified YAML representation of the command line options which they could modify to add new options.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is obviously not a comprehensive list of ideas, but I wrote this to encourage people to think of more innovative ways to incorporate AI into people's workflows besides just building yet another chatbot.  I strongly believe that <a href="https://haskellforall.com/2026/01/chat-is-least-interesting-interface-to">chat is the least interesting interface to LLMs</a> and AI-assisted software development is no exception to this.</p>

<p>Getting the correct output wasn't even supposed to be the hard part of the coding challenge.  The standard interview challenge provided the candidate with a golden output that their program needed to match and despite that agentic coders would not only fail to match the golden output but sometimes <em>not even realize</em> their program didn't match the golden output because they hadn't even run their agentically coded solution to check if it was correct.  The actual hard part of the coding challenge was supposed to be follow-up questions about the journey to production, which vibe coders also performed worse on. <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been passionate about writing “Good Code™” since before I started my career, beginning way back when I was still a kid in middle school.</p> <blockquote><p>What is “Good Code™“?</p></blockquote> <p>Good Question™ :)</p> <p>Good Code is code that is easy to read and understand. Good Code is code that is pleasing to develop with and maintain. Good Code is code that exists for a specific reason, and no more. Good Code is a product of the rare combination of talent, experience, passion, and the investment of time that may not be immediately useful for the business. And most unfortunately, Good Code is rare.</p> <p>That being said, by trade, I am a Software Engineer. Not a “Computer Programmer”, nor a “Coder”, nor any other title that implies that my job is to “write good code”. In fact, nothing about my job title necessitates that I read or write code at all! My job is to create useful software that solves real problems.</p> <p>Recently, a colleague of mine at <a href="https://modal.com/"><!--[!--><!--]--> Modal</a><!----> rewrote an external system that integrated deeply with the Linux kernel. The initial rewrite was a simple translation of a C codebase to a Rust one, in preparation for some custom feature work. The resulting code wasn’t bad, nor was it un-idiomatic Rust. What it also wasn’t was Good Code. It was hard to read and understand, would have been difficult to extend and maintain, and it wasn’t even clear to us why we’d taken the burden of rewriting and maintaining this extra system.</p> <p>The initial rewrite also relied heavily on coding agents.</p> <p>This same colleague then invested time into understanding the kernel subsystem, the exact reasons why the original C program was written how it was, and rewrote the Rust translation himself. The difference was night and day; the code flowed naturally, explained itself and the underlying subsystems, and may genuinely be some of the nicest parts of the entire codebase. Better, I think, than even the original C, despite this type of program being arguably one of the best places to use C over Rust.</p> <p>It was the first time in weeks, maybe months, that I’d felt something that used to be common in my day-to-day: excitement about the lines of code in front of me. I used to write (approximations of) Good Code most days. Somewhere along the way, everything changed. Nowadays I don’t even write the first version of most of the code I commit. I’m definitely far more productive with an agent at my side. They’re not at all <em>horrible</em> at this coding stuff, just not truly <strong>great</strong> at it. At the end of the day, the code they spit out is… acceptable. It gets the job done, it passes my litmus tests, but it certainly isn’t Good Code.</p> <p>Perhaps the age of caring about these lines of code is over. I’m sure that there were folks passionate about Good Assembly or Good Circuits whose passions have quietly faded into the echoes of “how things used to be,” forgotten as they and their fields evolved. From my (biased) perspective, the change in Software Engineering feels uniquely sudden, and I can’t help but mourn the silent death of Good Code.</p><!----></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing its intent to take decisive steps to restrict GLP-1 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) intended for use in non-FDA-approved compounded drugs that are being mass-marketed by companies — including Hims &amp; Hers and other compounding pharmacies — as similar alternatives to FDA-approved drugs. These actions are aimed to safeguard consumers from drugs for which the FDA cannot verify quality, safety, or efficacy. &nbsp;We take seriously any potential violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p><p>The FDA is also taking steps to combat misleading direct-to-consumer advertising and marketing following warning letters that were sent in the fall of 2025. In promotional materials, companies cannot claim that non-FDA-approved compounded products are generic versions or the same as drugs approved by FDA. They also cannot state compounded drugs use the same active ingredient as the FDA-approved drugs or that compounded drugs are clinically proven to produce results for the patient.</p><p>The FDA will use all available compliance and enforcement tools within its authorities to address unsubstantiated claims and associated public health concerns. Entities engaged in the manufacture, distribution, or marketing of unapproved compounded GLP-1 products should be aware that failure to adequately address any violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

[Note: I am no longer working on TCC. Check the mailing list to get up
to date information.]

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>

<li> <b>SMALL!</b> You can compile and execute C code everywhere, for
  example on rescue disks (about 100KB for x86 TCC executable,
  including C preprocessor, C compiler, assembler and linker).</li>

<li> <b>FAST!</b> tcc generates x86 code. No byte code
  overhead. Compile, assemble and link several times <a href="#speed">faster</a> than <tt>GCC</tt>.</li>

<li> <b>UNLIMITED!</b> Any C dynamic library can be used directly. TCC is
  heading torward full <b>ISOC99</b> compliance. TCC can of course compile
  itself.</li>

<li> <b>SAFE!</b> tcc includes an optional <b>memory and bound
checker</b>. Bound checked code can be mixed freely with standard
code.

</li><li> Compile and execute C source directly. No linking or assembly
  necessary. Full C preprocessor and GNU-like assembler
  included. </li>

<li> C script supported : just add <tt>'#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run'</tt> at the first
  line of your C source, and execute it directly from the command
  line.</li>

<li> With <code>libtcc</code>, you can use TCC as a backend for dynamic code
generation. </li>

</ul>

Compilation speed for the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/download.php">Links
Browser project</a>. There are 76936 lines (including
headers). 1950947 lines (67.2 MBytes) are compiled because the same headers are
included in many files. TinyCC is about <b>9 times</b> faster than
GCC.

<p id="0d38a78f-3354-4f86-b602-38f93fb8d4e4">A couple of weeks ago, I found that I couldn't open Notepad on my desktop PC. It wasn't because Windows 11 had crashed, but rather, Microsoft told me it wasn't <em>"available in (my) account". </em>It turned out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-apps-like-notepad-arent-loading-what-is-error-code-0x803f8001-and-how-d" data-url="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-apps-like-notepad-arent-loading-what-is-error-code-0x803f8001-and-how-d" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-apps-like-notepad-arent-loading-what-is-error-code-0x803f8001-and-how-d">an error (0x803f8001) with Microsoft Store's licensing service</a> stopped me from opening a few first-party apps, including the Snipping Tool.</p><p>Yes, even the app I usually use to screenshot error messages was busted. Ironic.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I didn’t ask for this and neither did you.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for a robot to consume every blog post and piece of code I ever wrote and parrot it back so that some hack could make money off of it.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for the role of a programmer to be reduced to that of a glorified TSA agent, reviewing code to make sure the AI didn’t smuggle something dangerous into production.</p>
<p>And yet here we are. The worst fact about these tools is that they work. They can write code better than you or I can, and if you don’t believe me, wait six months.</p>
<p>You could abstain out of moral principle. And that’s fine, especially if you’re at the tail end of your career. And if you’re at the beginning of your career, you don’t need me to explain any of this to you, because you already use Warp and Cursor and Claude, with ChatGPT as your therapist and pair programmer and maybe even your lover. This post is for the 40-somethings in my audience who don’t realize this fact yet.</p>
<p>So as a senior, you could abstain. But then your junior colleagues will eventually code circles around you, because they’re wearing bazooka-powered jetpacks and you’re still riding around on a fixie bike. Eventually your boss will start asking why you’re getting paid twice your zoomer colleagues’ salary to produce a tenth of the code.</p>
<p>Ultimately if you have a mortgage and a car payment and a family you love, you’re going to make your decision. It’s maybe not the decision that your younger, more idealistic self would want you to make, but it does keep your car and your house and your family safe inside it.</p>
<p>Someday years from now we will look back on the era when we were the last generation to code by hand. We’ll laugh and explain to our grandkids how silly it was that we typed out JavaScript syntax with our fingers. But secretly we’ll miss it.</p>
<p>We’ll miss the feeling of holding code in our hands and molding it like clay in the caress of a master sculptor. We’ll miss the sleepless wrangling of some odd bug that eventually relents to the debugger at 2 AM. We’ll miss creating something we feel proud of, something true and right and good. We’ll miss the satisfaction of the artist’s signature at the bottom of the oil painting, the GitHub repo saying “I made this.”</p>
<p>I don’t celebrate the new world, but I also don’t resist it. The sun rises, the sun sets, I orbit helplessly around it, and my protests can’t stop it. It doesn’t care; it continues its arc across the sky regardless, moving but unmoved.</p>
<p>If you would like to grieve, I invite you to grieve with me. We are the last of our kind, and those who follow us won’t understand our sorrow. Our craft, as we have practiced it, will end up like some blacksmith’s tool in an archeological dig, a curio for future generations. It cannot be helped, it is the nature of all things to pass to dust, and yet still we can mourn. Now is the time to mourn the passing of our craft.</p>

<p dir="auto">The second clip-path is a polygon that is used to simulate the "ray".
The polygon is hardcoded now, but it can be calculated with js, for dynamic dimension that respect the navigation dimensions for responsiveness.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>Why I Write Games in C (yes, C)</h2>
<p>I am an unusual beast. All my solo project games I've been making recently have
been written in 'vanilla' C. Nobody does this. So I think it might be
interesting to explain why I do.</p>
<p>Dry programming language opinions incoming, <strong>you have been warned</strong>.</p>
<h2>What I need from a language</h2>
<p>There's some things which are non-negotiable. First of, it has to be reliable.
I can't afford to spend my time dealing with bugs I didn't cause myself.</p>
<p>A lot of my games were written for flash, and now flash is dying. I do <strong>not</strong>
want to spend my time porting old games to new platforms, I want to make new
games. I need a platform that I am confident will be around for a while.</p>
<p>Similarly I want to avoid tying myself to a particular OS, and <em>ideally</em> I'd
like to have the option of developing for consoles. So it's important that my
programming language is portable, and that it has good portable library
support.</p>
<h2>What I want from a language</h2>
<p>The strongest thing on my desired, but not <em>required</em> list is simplicity. I
find looking up language features, and quirky 'clever' api's incredibly tiring.
The ideal language would be one I can memorize, and then never have to look
things up.</p>
<p>Dealing with bugs is huge creative drain. I want to produce less bugs, so I
want strict typing, strong warning messages and static code analysis. I want
bugs to be easier to find, so I want good debuggers and dynamic analysis.</p>
<p>I'm not interesting in high-def realism, but I do still care a bit about
performance. Having more cycles available broadens the palette of things you
can do. It's particularly interesting to explore what is possible with modern,
powerful computers if you aren't persuing fidelity.</p>
<p>Even more than that I care about the speed of the compiler. I am not a zen
master of focus, and waiting 10+ seconds is wasteful, yes, but more importantly
it breaks my flow. I flick over to Twitter and suddenly 5+ minutes are gone.</p>
<p>I am not an OOP convert. I've spent most of my professional life working
with classes and objects, but the more time I spend, the less I understand why
you'd want to combine code and data so rigidly. I want to handle data as data
and write the code that best fits a particular situation.</p>
<h2>The Alternatives</h2>
<p>C++ is still the most common language for writing games, and not without
reason. I still do almost all of my contract work in it. I dislike it
intensely.</p>
<p>C++ covers my needs, but fails my wants badly. It is desperately complicated.
Despite decent tooling it's easy to create insidious bugs. It is also slow to
compile compared to C. It is high performance, and it offers features that C
doesn't have; but features I don't want, and at a great complexity cost.</p>
<p>C# and Java have similar issues. They are verbose and complex beasts, and I am
searching for a concise, simple creature. They both do a lot to railroad a
programmer into a strongly OOP style that I am opposed to. As per most higher
level languages they have a tendency to hide away complexity in a way that
doesn't actually prevent it from biting you.</p>
<p>I like Go a lot. In many ways it is C revisited, taking into account what has
be learnt in the long years since it was released. I would like to use it,
but there are big roadblocks that prevent me. The stop-the-world garbage
collection is a big pain for games, stopping the world is something you
can't really afford to do. The library support for games is quite
poor, and though you can wrap C libs without much trouble, doing so adds
a lot of busy work. It is niche enough that I worry a little about long term
relevance.</p>
<p>It would be nice to make things for the web, but it feels like a terrifyingly
fast moving enviroment. It is particularly scary with the death of flash.
I really dislike javascript, it is so loose that I marvel that people are
able to write big chunks of software in it. I have no interest in trying.</p>
<p>Haxe feels much more promising than most alternatives. If I do web stuff again
I'll be diving in here. There is some good library support. I am a little
concerned by its relative youth, will it last? I don't much have else to say
about it though, I've only dabbled with the surface.</p>
<p>Some people just say screw it, I'll write my own language, the language I want
to use. I admire this, and sometimes I toy with the idea of doing the same. It
feels like too much to throw away all existing library support, and taking
full responsibilty for future compatibility. It is also very difficult, and
when it comes down to it I would rather be making games than programming
languages.</p>
<h2>Why C is <em>still</em> my best fit</h2>
<p>C is dangerous, but it is reliable. A very sharp knife that can cut fingers as
well as veg, but so simple it's not too hard to learn to use it carefully.</p>
<p>It is fast, and when it comes to compilation I can't think of anything faster.</p>
<p>It can be made to run on just about anything. Usually this is relatively easy.
It is hard to imagine a time when this won't be the case.</p>
<p>The library and tooling support is strong and ongoing.</p>
<p>I say this with some sadness, but it is still the language for me.</p>
<p>I absolutely DO NOT mean to say "hey, you should use C too". I full appeciate
preferences here are pretty specific and unusual. I have also already written
more 'vanilla' C code than most, and this certainly is part of my comfort.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's it :-)</p>

<h2>SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes</h2>
<p>SectorC (<a href="https://github.com/xorvoid/sectorc">github</a>) is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It supports a
subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. It is quite likely the smallest C compiler ever written.</p>
<p>In a base64 encoding, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>6gUAwAdoADAfaAAgBzH/6DABPfQYdQXoJQHr8+gjAVOJP+gSALDDqluB+9lQdeAG/zdoAEAfy+gI

wYQA0+CaANP4jwCUwHf/lcAMAJzADgCfwIUAnsCZAJ3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVao=
</code></pre>
<h2>Supported language</h2>
<p>A fairly large subset is supported: global variables, functions, if statements, while statements, lots of operators, pointer dereference, inline machine-code, comments, etc.
All of these features make it quite capable.</p>
<p>For example, the following program animates a moving sine-wave:</p>
<pre><code>int y;
int x;
int x_0;
void sin_positive_approx()
{
  y = ( x_0 * ( 157 - x_0 ) ) &gt;&gt; 7;
}
void sin()
{
  x_0 = x;
  while( x_0 &gt; 314 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 314;
  }
  if( x_0 &lt;= 157 ){
    sin_positive_approx();
  }
  if( x_0 &gt; 157 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 157;
    sin_positive_approx();
    y = 0 - y;
  }
  y = 100 + y;
}


int offset;
int x_end;
void draw_sine_wave()
{
  x = offset;
  x_end = x + 314;
  while( x &lt;= x_end ){
    sin();
    pixel_x = x - offset;
    pixel_y = y;
    vga_set_pixel();
    x = x + 1;
  }
}

int v_1;
int v_2;
void delay()
{
  v_1 = 0;
  while( v_1 &lt; 50 ){
    v_2 = 0;
    while( v_2 &lt; 10000 ){
      v_2 = v_2 + 1;
    }
    v_1 = v_1 + 1;
  }
}

void main()
{
  vga_init();

  offset = 0;
  while( 1 ){
    vga_clear();
    draw_sine_wave();

    delay();
    offset = offset + 1;
    if( offset &gt;= 314 ){ // mod the value to avoid 2^16 integer overflow
      offset = offset - 314;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>But, how?</h2>
<p>When I started thinking about SectorC, I had just finished <a href="https://xorvoid.com/otcc_deobfuscated.html">Deobfuscating OTCC</a> with a lot of its ideas freshly loaded into my head.
I also just had some healthy doses of <a href="http://justine.lol/">justine.lol</a> and <a href="http://tom7.org/">Tom7</a> to inspire the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>Did I think I would succeed? I suspected NO. Fit an entire C compiler in 510 bytes of instruction memory? Good luck (sarcasm).</p>
<h2>Tokenizing</h2>
<p>The first problem came quickly. In C, the tokenizer/lexer alone seems larger than one 512 byte sector! We need to consume an arbitrary stream of bytes and produce “tokens”.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
  if( a &lt; 5 ){
    func();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Would be consumed and converted into:</p>
<pre><code>'int'  TOKEN_KEYWORD_INT
'main' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'if'   TOKEN_KEYWORD_IF
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
'a'    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'&lt;'    TOKEN_OPERATOR
'5'    TOKEN_NUMBER
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'func' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
';'    TOKEN_SEMI
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
</code></pre>
<p>We need to specifically recognize <code>keywords</code>, <code>identifiers</code>, <code>operators</code>, and <code>numbers</code>. And then we need to convert numbers from string to integer with something like <code>atoi()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>int atoi(const char *s)
{
  int n = 0;
  while (1) {
    char c = *s++;
    if (!c) break;
    n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
  }
  return n;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a fairly straight-forward and minimalist lexer and it took &gt;150 lines of C code. A crude estimate of the same code in x86-16 would require 300-450 bytes minimum (e.g. a simple <code>add ax,bx</code> instruction encodes as 2 bytes). And this doesn’t include any symbol table, recursive-descent parser, code-generator, branch-patching, etc.</p>
<p>No Chance.</p>
<p>So, naturally … I continued. Always pick the losers. The lolz are more fun that way.</p>
<h3>Big Insight #1</h3>
<p>Big Insight #1 came while thinking about other languages such as Forth. The tokenizer in Forth is nearly trivial. Every token is simply space-delimited. Every token is just called a <code>WORD</code> and nothing is special (slight lie). Hmm, how about a C that does that? So dreamed up a C that is technically still a C, is probably turing-complete, and will definitely make every code maintainer terrified. 😏</p>
<p>I will call it the <em>Barely C Programming Language</em>:</p>
<pre><code>int done , a , b , c , p , cond ;
int(main)(){while(!done){
     a = b - c ;
     *(int*) p = b - c ;
     a = *(int*) p ;
     if(cond) a = b - 45 ;
}}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have spacing strategically placed to create “mega-tokens”</p>
<p>For example: <code>int(main)(){while(!done){</code> is one such "mega-token".</p>
<p>In a sense, we actually have a language more like:</p>
<pre><code>VAR_BEGIN done AND a AND b AND c AND p AND cond END
MAIN_BEGIN
  a = b - c END
  DEREF p = b - c END
  a = DEREF p END
  COND a = b - 45 END
MAIN_END
</code></pre>
<p>But, a normal C compiler will also recognize it as C!</p>
<p>Even after using space-delimiters, we still have a lot of tokens and need to find more ways to minimize the tokenizer. What is essential? Well it’s quite hard to avoid the <code>atoi()</code> if we want to actually have integer literals. What else do we need? How about nothing.</p>
<h3>Big Insight #2</h3>
<p>Big Insight #2 is that <code>atoi()</code> behaves as a (bad) hash function on ordinary text. It consumes characters and updates a 16-bit integer. Hashes are perhaps the holy-grail of computer-science.
With a good hash, we can just side-step all the hard problems by trading them for an even harder problem (hash collisions), and then we just ignore that harder problem. Brilliant. (sticks fingers in ears) 🤪</p>
<p>So we have this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Token Type</th>
<th>Meaning of atoi()</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Integer Literal</td>
<td>uint16 number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Keyword</td>
<td>token ”enum” value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identifier</td>
<td>hash value into a 64K array</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Implementing Barely C</h2>
<p>The first implementation of Barely C fit in 468 bytes. It was a simple recursive-descent parser over the <code>atoi</code> tokens. There was no symbol table of any kind. Variables simply access a 64K segment using the hash value. Codegen is emitted somewhat similar to <a href="https://xorvoid.com/otcc_deobfuscated.html">OTCC</a>, using <code>ax</code> as the result register and shuffling values to the stack and then to <code>cx</code> for binary operators.</p>
<h2>Minimizing with Byte-Threaded Code</h2>
<p>In an attempt to steal every good idea Forth ever had, I then dreamed up what I will call “byte-threaded-code”. Since a sector is 512 bytes, if we simply align address on a 2-byte boundary, we can do addressing with a single byte! We can have a series of “gadgets” and do forth-style threading:</p>
<pre><code>bits 16
  cpu 386

  jmp 0x07c0:entry

entry:
  push cs
  pop  ds

  lea si,operations
next:
  xor ax,ax
  lodsb
  add ax,ax
  push next
  jmp ax

putch:
  mov ah,0x01
  mov al,bl
  mov dx,0
  int 0x14
  ret

  align 2
hang:
  jmp hang

  align 2
print_F:
  mov bx,'F'
  jmp putch

  align 2
print_G:
  mov bx,'G'
  jmp putch

operations:
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 16  ; hang
</code></pre>
<p>Annoyingly, <code>nasm</code> won’t let you do something like <code>db print_F/2</code> so I had to write a custom little assembler to do it.</p>
<p>Alas, this idea didn’t work out. In 512 bytes, the overhead of this Forth-style computation model doesn’t pay for itself. There are a lot of little overheads: 2 byte alignment, extra <code>ret</code> instructions, calling other “threads”, the <code>next</code> function, etc. The byte-threaded version of Barely C ended up at the same size as the straight-forward version</p>
<p>However, the idea is fun and I decided to document it anyways in the event that someone else finds utility.</p>
<h2>Minimizing the Straight-Forward version</h2>
<p>Instead, I returned to the straight-forward version and minimized it as much as possible. From 468 bytes ⇒ 303 bytes (165 bytes saving): 510 - 303 ⇒ 207 spare bytes to use for new features!</p>
<p>Some tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganize code to allow “fall-through” instead of <code>jmp</code> or <code>call</code></li>
<li>Use tail-calls via <code>jmp</code> wherever possible</li>
<li>Perform call-fusion (e.g. <code>call tok_next2</code> instead of <code>call tok_next; call tok_next</code>)</li>
<li>Utilize <code>stosw</code> and <code>lodsw</code> extensively</li>
<li>Eliminate machine code tables for cheaper inline <code>stosw</code> versions</li>
<li>Prefer <code>cmp ax,imm</code> over <code>cmp bx,imm</code></li>
<li>Keep jump offsets within 8-bits to encode more efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h2>Look Ma, A Real C!</h2>
<p>As it turns out, a lot can be accomplished in 200 bytes if you already have a tokenizer, parser, and code-generator in 300 bytes. With these 200 bytes, <em>Barely C</em> became a proper C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>if</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>
<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>while</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>
<li>Lots of operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></li>
<li>Grouping expressions: <code>( expression )</code></li>
<li>Function definitions and recursive function calls (using <code>func()</code> as a hash value into a symbol table at segment 0x3000)</li>
<li>A special <code>asm</code> statement for inline machine-code</li>
<li>Single-line <code>//</code> comments</li>
<li>Multi-line <code>/*</code> comments</li>
<li>A trick to do “space-injection” before semicolons to make code look more normal</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest enabler here is the <code>binary_oper_tbl</code> which allows for a very cheap way to add lots of operations. Each operator is simply a <code>&lt;16-bit token-value&gt; &lt;16-bit-machine-code&gt;</code> pair, costing just 4 bytes.The above 14 operators cost just 56 bytes plus a little overhead to scan the table.</p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>Here's the full grammer specification:</p>
<pre><code>program     = (var_decl | func_decl)+
var_decl    = "int" identifier ";"
func_decl   = "void" func_name "{" statement* "}"
func_name   = &lt;identifier that ends in "()" with no space&gt;
statement   = "if(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "while(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "asm" integer ";"
            | func_name ";"
            | assign_expr ";"
assign_expr = deref? identifier "=" expr
deref       = "*(int*)"
expr        = unary (op unary)?
unary       = deref identifier
            | "&amp;" identifier
            | "(" expr ")"
            | indentifier
            | integer
op          = "+" | "-" | "&amp;" | "|" | "^" | "&lt;&lt;" | "&gt;&gt;"
            | "==" | "!=" | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | "&lt;=" | "&gt;="
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, both <code>// comment</code> and <code>/* multi-line comment */</code> styles are supported.</p>
<p>(NOTE: This grammar is 704 bytes in ascii, 38% larger than it's implementation!)</p>
<h2>Inline Machine-Code</h2>
<p>A programming language without I/O is useless. And, as the C language is defined in an I/O agnostic way, we need some way out. Thus, an <code>asm</code> extension is supported. This allows programs to generate raw x86-16 machine code literals inline. Using <code>asm</code>, programs can access any low-level detail of the machine. This is used extensively in the example code.</p>
<h2>Error-Handling</h2>
<p>What is “error-handling”? 🤣</p>
<p>In traditional C style, we trust the programmer to write correct and well-formed programs. We are certain they are all minor gods and goddesses with the ability of perfection. Obviously, spending bytes on error-checking would be foolish. Surely all will agree that this is a very reasonable standard.</p>
<p>For the less divine among us, a <code>lint</code> was also written (that doesn’t fit in a sector) to detect errors. The author certainly didn’t require this tool for development.</p>
<h2>Runtime</h2>
<p>If C compiler writers were a secret shadow organization like the Free Masons, Illuminati, Lizard Peoples, or Pizzagaters our inner-secret would be “C actually has a runtime”.</p>
<p>SectorC has a runtime under <code>rt/</code> consisting of two files implemented in C itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rt/lib.c:</code> A collection of library routines, often coded in inline <code>asm</code></li>
<li><code>rt/_start.c:</code> The actual entry-point <code>_start()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The runtime code is concatenated with program source to construct the full source to compile and run.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>A few examples are provided that leverage the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>examples/hello.c:</code> Print a text greeting on the screen writing to memory at <code>0xB8000</code></li>
<li><code>examples/sinwave.c:</code> Draw a moving sine wave animation with VGA Mode 0x13 using an appropriately bad approximation of <code>sin(x)</code></li>
<li><code>examples/twinkle.c:</code> Play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” through the PC Speaker (Warning: LOUD)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems fitting to end an article with “takeaways” or “what did we learn”. So.. umm.. what did we learn? Honestly, I’m not sure. But in the interest of fun, here’s a Choice Your Own Adventure version of What Did We Learn:</p>

			<p>You know he did other things than Larry, right?</p>

<p>We talked with Al Lowe about Leisure Suit Larry, but mostly other stuff. This was Roar’s first interview and he ran out of time before he could dive into what Al is mostly known for.</p>
<p>Al Lowe is an American software developer who started making games in the early eighties. His is mostly known for the Leisure Suit Larry games, created with Sierra, but he is also a musical man who loves playing his sax and still plays with his model trains. He has also created lots of other games for Sierra, not only the Larry series.</p>
<p>If you think Al is great, but you already know all you need to know about Larry, then this is the article for you. And it is pretty long. Get your coffee now, before continuing…</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Have you ever been to Norway?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh yeah, sure. I have this eyeball right here. It works because I spent a week recuperating in the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital. I had a detached retina when we were flying into Oslo, and went to an ophthalmologist, and she said to get to the hospital right now. The next morning a bunch of Norwegian women started poking around in my eye and fixed it.</p>

<p>Of course, I was blind in that eye for the next week, and I was already blind in the other eye, so I wandered around in the dark while my wife went sightseeing. I went with her, but I didn’t see any sights.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> So you have felt and smelt the beautiful fjords, but never seen them.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, on an earlier trip, we did take the railroad to Bergen. Over the mountain plateau [Hardangervidda]. So we spent some time there, and that was fun.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I’ve never actually taken that trip myself, but I heard it’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It was not for us. We got to the top, up in the top of the mountains. And the electricity went off. And so, we parked in the middle of this beautiful snowy scene for three hours, before they finally got the power back on. Then we went on our journey but we had already missed the connecting rides. We had booked a trip on a boat through the fjords, and a trip on the cog railway. We missed all of them. So be sure you go when there is electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, we like to joke about that in Norway, the richest country in the world and the lousiest trains. I guess that is a good segue, because you do like trains, don’t you? At least model trains?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes, I do. I’ve been a model railroader for most of my life. I got my first model train when I was 2 years old, and my dad wouldn’t let me play with it. So he ran it around the Christmas tree and I had to watch. But eventually, when I was 9 or 10, I got interested in HO size trains, and built a layout in our basement. Completely by myself, I had no idea what I was doing or anything, but I just learned as I went, piddled around and figured it out. I went to the hobby shop sometime and would say stuff like: How do you glue this stuff to this stuff? And they’d give me some special glue and and teach me how.</p>

<p>So, it was fun. I learned a lot, and I proved that I could do things with my hands. I ended up learning a lot about wiring and electricity. And scenery, I did stuff with papier-mâché. I took old tomato sticks from our garden, cut them in different heights. I wrapped old screen door wire over the top of them and coated that with plaster to make mountains and stuff. So I did a lot of stuff, mostly things I’d read about in magazines, but I think it helped me understand that I could learn something if I didn’t already know it.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Did you add any miniature figures or models and stuff like that in the scenery as well?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Sure, yeah, lots of stuff. In fact, I built buildings out of balsa wood. And I read an article in a magazine that said if you hold your X-Acto knife at just the right angle and drag it across the balsa wood, you can make clapboard siding, you know, where the siding overlaps. I also built doors from scraps of wood.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was fun. It’s a fun hobby, and it served me for ten years at first. Then I went to college and started playing music, and I forgot about it. But then when my son was 10 years old I thought: I liked doing this when I was 10, maybe he will. So we went to the hobby shop and bought a bunch of trains. Of course he wasn’t interested at all, but I got hooked again! So for the last 35 years I’ve been doing N-scale trains, where the locomotive is about five inches long.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> So your son is 45, then?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes, then you could have been my dad, because I’m 46.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, you’re the right age, then, I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> The Pacific Northwest Region of the NMRA, yeah. I did that for 10 years at least. Then I was assistant director for another 10 years so I worked at that organization for about 20 years. But recently I said: That’s enough, let some new blood come in. So we got new people now, and they’re much better, so I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> But you didn’t get any money for it?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> No, no, it’s a volunteer organization. At first we did a paper newsletter every month. We would print and fold and staple and stamp and address-label hundreds of newsletters. I did that for a couple years until I finally convinced everybody that we’ve got to go online. So then I made a PDF, posted it, and we sent out an email. That was much better, but we still had a few die-hard people that would download it and print it out every time. I was part of this for 24 years.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Are there any physical magazines about model trains today?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes. Well, the man who ran one of the biggest ones just passed away and so his magazine’s gone now, but there’s still a magazine called N Scale, and it’s housed right here in the suburb of Seattle. It is distributed all over the world. And then there’s the National Model Railroad Association, which publishes a magazine every month, all over the world. And then there’s Model Railroader and Railroad Model Craftsman. I know there’s one for each of the scales, for HO and S and O and G for garden railroads.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> It’s an old hobby. A weird hobby, in that it follows my path. Most people get interested in trains when they’re little kids. And then they grow out of it in high school. Then later in life, they realize: I got time and money now. I could get back in it, this is a good hobby. And it really is. It’s great socially, because the group that I’m in have a layout that’s portable and we can bring it to shows. So 6-8 times a year we pack everything up into a trailer, move it to a place, and set it up. And we run trains all weekend, we talk with the public and hundreds of people come by and see my work. Then we pack it up and put it back in the trailer and then wait for the next show. So it doesn’t get old because it’s so long between shows. It’s really fun.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I guess there’s not that much development in the field, so even though you haven’t done it for 20 years, it’s not that hard to just continue where you left off?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Actually, it has changed completely with computers. So you couldn’t be more wrong! Actually, you were correct for 40 years at least. But in the 90s people started developing computerized means of running the trains. And in the mid-90s, the National Model Railroad Association set up standards and said: If you follow all these rules then your stuff can run on anybody’s system. And that’s when it really changed over.</p>
<p>About 2001 or 2002, we went from the old system, which was a rheostat that controlled the amount of voltage applied to the rails, just like a volume control. So we went from a potentiometer that changed the amount of power to the tracks to constantly powered tracks, with a computer chip inside each locomotive. It has a number address that you can set. Then on your remote control you can type in the number of the locomotive you want to drive, turn a knob, and it sends a radio signal through the air to a computer that’s permanently affixed to the layout. And that computer multiplexes a serial signal on top of the power, just kind of like your old phone modems where they overlaid a signal on top of the regular phone lines. It then tells the locomotive to go this fast, back up, or sound the whistle and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I guess for you this was not a bad thing at all, because you love that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, no, right? It was right up my the alley there.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I have some experience painting Warhammer miniature figures. Did you paint miniatures yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah. The trouble with N Scale is that the people are very small. It’s a challenge to paint. We always tell everybody that the hard part is getting the eyelashes right.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> And that’s at least one thing that does not get easier with age.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> No, no, that’s true. But I have lots of special tools for that. I have an optimizer that has LED lights built around it, so I can zoom right in on things and paint the tiny little stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Pretending to be a cyborg.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, well … getting the help I need.</p>
<h2>Al Lowe and music</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Music is very important to you. And people wouldn’t think about music when they hear your name. But for me, I got this mp3-file in the late 90s with the title: «Al Lowe – For Your Thighs Only». And that played the music from Leisure Suit Larry. So then I learned the name. And of course, I had played these games earlier, but never picked up on the name.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I hope you paid me a royalty.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, of course! So for me you were a musician before I found out that you had also created these games.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I was involved with a lot of Sierra products in one way or another. I worked on their spelling program when they had a word processor. I worked on their assembler for Apple II. I worked on … God, just a lot of different stuff. 26 products in 16 years.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, I should plug <a href="https://allowe.com/">my website</a>. Tell people, if they have gotten this far, they should visit my website. There’s lots more stuff there. If you enjoy this, you’ll enjoy that.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, I believe I will. Your kids, did they go for music, game developing, or anything else in their father’s footsteps?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Of course not. They’re my kids.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Since you’re a saxophone player, I would guess that you can play a lot of other instruments as well?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I was a high school band director, so I had to learn to play every instrument somewhat. So, I can pick up a viola and play badly, and I can play a trombone or French horn, but my real instrument is the saxophone and also flute and clarinet.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> So, what kind of music do you like?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Big Band Jazz. But I play as much as I listen. I tend to watch films and read books, but I play music. I’m in two big bands, where I play lead alto sax. And they meet every week for a couple hours in the evening. And I’m in two saxophone quartets that meet a little less regularly, but we play classical saxophone music, and also some pop songs and things, but it’s just four saxophones, and so we get a lot of interesting work. That’s real fun.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I’ve been looking at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPh4AbZOjB4">YouTube video</a>, where you played in a band called The David Hasselhoff Big Band.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes, the group is ironically named.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Metallica had been covered by a band of four cello players. Would it be possible to do something like that with saxophones?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It would absolutely be possible, but the question is, why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That is the better question. I guess being Norwegian, I don’t really feel like any music should be without some kind of growling.</p>
<h2>Al Lowe and television</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Do you watch any modern series on television?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> We watch a lot of Scandinavian noir shows. A lot of Danish and a couple of Norwegian shows. And we watch them in Norwegian with subtitles. We don’t want to use the English voiceover, because they are usually not very good.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> No, I would guess not.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It is easier and better just to listen to the Norwegian and not know what you’re saying, but be able to read the subtitles and get the gist. I can’t think of a title right now, but we’ve got a long list on Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah. Today it’s very easy to consume whatever you want to consume. Even though you don’t necessarily own the stuff you watch.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> From very early on I didn’t want to own any movies or TV shows. We never bought anything. I always felt like I would rather just rent and see something new – see more stuff, instead of looking at the same thing over and over. And so, I didn’t build up a collection of VHS or DVDs. I was «streaming» when that was still analog. We got discs in the mail, you know. That was pretty advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah like Netflix, the original Netflix?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<h2>Al Lowe and humor</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> What about humor? The modern humor scene versus the old humor scene. Some things that were acceptable to say back in the eighties are not any more, and so on, and we even rewrite old things to make them more «modern». Do you have any views about this issue, being an old humorist yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I said and did things in the eighties’ games that I would never dream of doing now. Let’s put it that way. On the other hand, violence seems to be quite popular. I don’t understand it. We get scared of humor, but yet, you just can’t blow a person up any more than we do now. It is an odd situation isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yep. There has also been so much nudity in the last 10 years in all kinds of movies, and very explicit nudity.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, which I enjoy. I have no problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I won’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, all in all, I guess my opinion is that things have gotten better. How long has it been since I wrote Larry 1? 35 years? No, 38 years. So in the 38 years since I wrote Larry 1, I think all of that stuff has gotten better, with the exception of violence. I’m not happy with that. I think we show too much, too often, and too strongly and too dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It’s very brutal now.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> But, you know, I think all these things are a pendulum, right? You know, it’s gonna swing over here, and then eventually it’s gonna swing back. Typical human behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes, that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> We’ll see what happens. Well, <em>I</em> won’t see what happens. You can see what happens.</p>

<h2>Old Sierra games</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes. Um, I guess I also have to talk to you about the old Sierra games. And these might not be the most original questions.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I only want original questions…..</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> You had, among other things, been working on the Dark Crystal Game: Gelfling Adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> And growing up when I did, I loved watching that old Dark Crystal movie. It was pretty scary when I was eight or nine, but man, what a wonderful movie.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It was. Yeah, it sure was. And Roberta [Williams] was delighted when Jim Henson asked her to do a computer game based on Dark Crystal. And I was delighted, because after the artists had done all the backgrounds and things for Dark Crystal, Sierra asked me to spin off an educational version of it. We called it the Gelfling Adventure, and it wasn’t a big hit, but it was sure fun to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I would guess if you could get it today, in a big box, it would be worth a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I used to have a copy, but I think I sold it on eBay when I cleaned out my attic. I had an attic full of games, and finally I just put them on eBay and sold them off one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> You did? Was it that collection Metal Jesus Rocks bought?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Ah, no, that was not a game, that was stuff from Sierra. We should tell people what we’re referring to – there’s a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MetalJesusRocks">Metal Jesus Rocks</a>. And he came over and did an interview one day at my house.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, I saw that, you showed him all your cool stuff. And that is gone now?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> He convinced me that I should put it up on eBay, and somebody would buy it. And I said, no, nobody would do that. Who would want such a silly thing?</p>
<p>And, it turned out that the current owner of Sierra, Activision [now owned my Microsoft] got mad and sent me a cease and desist letter: If you sell this, there might be something on those disks that we own. We don’t know what it is, you may not know what it is, and you may doubt that it’s there, but if there’s anything we’ll sue you. So I was like: oh, shit, what? Whatever I would get from selling it wouldn’t be nearly enough to pay a lawyer to defend me. So, I pulled it.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> So, it’s still up there, if you look. Let’s see if I can adjust the camera a little. <em>*Shows boxes of stuff in the background*</em> Right there, those black boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Did you ever get to meet Jim Henson?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I did not, no.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> He was big back then.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, my wife and I never missed an episode of The Muppet Show. It was one of the most creative and funny things. Just warm-hearted, good, kind spirited, and funny as hell. Just a great show. And the first movie was also great. Then the second Muppet movie was maybe a little less, and the third one was a little less, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I did like the movies too. More than I liked The Muppet Show, because I was too young to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> The Muppet Show had a lot humor that went over kids’ heads, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> And also, all those guests, I had no idea who they were.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I knew every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That does help. But I have seen the episodes as an adult, and now I enjoy them, because now I know who these people are.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, I highly recommended it. Still funny.</p>
<h2>Leisure Suit Larry</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That brings me to the first Leisure Suit Larry game. It had all these questions at the start that was usually based on American pop culture or politics.</p>
<p>In the end you just ended up writing down every question you could get. Then the answer you tried and whether it was correct or not.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> That’s how you did it? You know, all you had to do was press Alt-X.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes, we found that out after a while. But it was a very good way of learning English before that.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> And now you know who Spiro Agnew was.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, but that’s also because of the Futurama series. He was a recurring character there being Nixon’s vice president and helper. But knowing that was not normal as a 10-year-old kid in Norway in the late 80s.</p>

<h2>Disney games</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> My first real computer was a Commodore 64. So my first love with your stuff, without even knowing it was you, was Donald Ducks Playground.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, yeah! I was very proud of that game. That won a bunch of educational awards over here, and was a successful product for Disney. Not as successful for Sierra and Al Lowe.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It was probably a cheap licence to get?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> They had no idea what any of the games or computers was about. They had a couple of women who worked for them, and did educational film strips, movie slideshows and, you know, educational workbooks and stuff like that they sold to schools. And so they told these two women: You take charge of this computer thing because it’s kind of like a movie projector or a slot film strips, and I think it’s got a screen, so you’re in charge.</p>
<p>Well, I quickly realised that I knew much more, and I knew Sierra knew much more than they did. A couple of the other products we did were Mickey’s Space Adventure and <a href="https://wiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/Goofy%27s_Word_Factory">Goofy’s Word Factory</a> (never released). Those guys consulted with them often about how to create their product. But I took the approach: I’m too busy to talk to you until I get it done, and when I get it done, I’ll show it to you. And they bought off on that for a while. They didn’t know what I was doing. Then finally I said: Okay, it’s done, take a look at it.</p>
<p>Well, then they had a big, long list of changes that we should make, because for them to be important, they had to put some mark on the product. They said; Well, I think that the leaf should be red instead of green, or I think his pants should be this instead of that, or this should be over in that corner.</p>

<p>I said: Well, you know, I could make all those changes, or we could ship the product and make some money. What do you want to do? And Ken Williams said: Well, ship it, you know, let’s get it out. And so, I pretty much did that entire product without any input from Disney. And it was the same with Donald Duck. They had changes they wanted to make, but they weren’t improvements. If they had come up with something better, then yeah, I would have done it. Because I wanted to make it better, but just to make this color a little different, or move that thing over one pixel, you know, that made no difference whatsoever. Anyway, that’s my Disney story.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It’s such a nice-looking game. And I learned about quarters and dollars and cents.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I haven’t seen it in 40 years, probably.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> In other games, like Winnie the Pooh or Mickey’s Space Adventure, you improved on the Zork formula. You added graphics. And you didn’t have to type in what you wanted to do, but instead clicked buttons with text.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Did you ever play the Black Cauldron?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> No, but I did look at a YouTube video, and I thought: Maybe this is a Sierra game where you cannot die. But ah, I was wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, no, you can. I didn’t know it at the time, but I feel like I invented the point-and-click adventure. Because that whole game could be played with a mouse or a joystick. It could be played just by pointing and moving to where you wanted to go. And then using the function keys – I’m doing it the old-fashioned way, using the keys on the right side of the keyboard where God intended them to be instead of up here, where nobody can hit them. But anyway, I used the function keys instead of clicking icons and stuff. Roberta added the icons with King’s Quest V, I think.</p>
<h2>Working for, but not being employed by Sierra</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> How was it working with the Williamses?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I have no complaints, they bought me a nice house, bought me some nice cars, let me retire at 52, so I will say I was pretty happy.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, because you stayed there your whole career. At least your whole gaming career?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I resigned from my teaching gig and started working for Ken full-time. After six months, he hit hard times. There was one Friday the company started the morning with 120 employees. And in the afternoon it had been cut to 40 employees. So they fired two-thirds of the company that day, including me.</p>

<p>He then called me into the office and said: I want you to keep working. I don’t want you to quit and leave. I want you to work on this product. And, I’ll give you advances against future royalties instead of a salary. I said, whoa, how much are we talking here? What kind of advances? Well, I can do this much for that. I asked: What about this other game you wanted? Because I was going to work on that. Oh, yeah, yeah, we’ll add that on, too. So I can do that one, and we’ll give you so much for that one. And I said, okay, well, what about the translation to Atari and Commodore for, you know, Winnie the Pooh or something? Oh, yeah, you would do that too. So I added up all the advances he was talking about&nbsp; and it was double the salary he had been paying me.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Ah! Haha, nice.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I figured I could get it done in a year so I said: Okay, that sounds good. Have I just been fired? Yep. Great, thanks! And I shook his hand, and for the next 15 and a half years I was an outside contractor who only worked on a contract basis. I got royalties instead of salary, and ended up having a great relationship with Sierra until Ken left the company. And when Ken got bought out by this … well, I don’t know how much depth you want to go into that, but there was a really ugly end for Sierra, where they were bought out in a hostile takeover by one of their board members, who were then convicted and sent to prison for fifteen years for fraud. So it was an ugly end.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> When Ken left, the writing was on the wall. It was pretty obvious that they didn’t have anybody who could replace him, and there was nobody to replace Roberta. Sierra’s new method of product development was: Listen to a pitch, fund that pitch, let them do a lot of work on it, and then look at the product when it’s half done and not fun with nothing to see. Then they’d get cold feet and say: Oh, gosh, I don’t know if we should spend the rest of the money. Then cancel it.</p>
<p>They just went through this endless churn of, you know, we’ll start a new product, oh no, oh, uh, no, we’ll cancel that. Now let’s do another one. Oh, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Oh, wait, it doesn’t look very good… Well, it’s not done, dumbass. So the company quickly went into this….. Did you ever see the old World War II movies when they would shoot a plane and it would spiral out?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Oh yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, that’s what Sierra felt like for about a year there. You could just see all the good people jumping ship and going to better companies. And all the bad people were staying around and making products that were even worse. And so, maybe two years after Ken left the company, they decided to move what little work was left to Los Angeles and merge with Blizzard. Then they turned off the lights and sent all the employees home. They locked the doors, and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>Including the end of all the historic materials that we used to create the games, which were carefully… well, I shouldn’t say that. That’s a lie. They were uncarefully stored. They were thrown in a box, put in a cabinet, and then when they needed cabinet space, they rented a storage unit and threw them in there. Then at the end somebody said: Why are we paying money for a storage unit for all this old crap? Then they burned it all.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Oh, they burned it?!</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, yeah, it was just the dumbest thing. That was the end of the company. I had a few cells of animation that survived, but there’s very little of that stuff left anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> But at least you did have a copy of the source code for your games?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, for the early games I made. Once you got to Larry 6, the games were too big and you couldn’t back them up anymore. I think it was like 5 or 6 CDs, and at some point along there I just gave up. I have the source material for Larry 7, but I have no way to compile it.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> If you put it online, someone will create a compiler, I’m pretty sure of it. People are nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It’s too bad they didn’t let me sell the source code, because one of the things I loved doing was writing comments in the code. And more often than not, the comments were funnier than the game. It was a shame to let that all go to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> When you say the later games, you talk about games like Torin’s Passage and Freddy Pharkas, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, I have the source material for that somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> There are some projects that emulate these old games. ScummVM, I think, now supports a lot of non-Scumm games as well. So it might be that someone is thinking about Freddy Pharkas and Torin’s Passage for that engine [this is actually true for both these titles].</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, maybe. I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It’s not impossible and I guess that’s also a point with these old games. They are fun to play, but usually because you did play them as a kid. If I gave Leisure Suit Larry to my kids today, I’m not sure if they would like them.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, they would have to think. Sierra games were about thinking, they weren’t about shooting or killing, or building things. They were about figuring out things in your brain, and that’s something that we seem to be losing as a species.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That’s true. It’s also very popular to look at other people playing games today, on Twitch and Youtube.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> That I don’t understand at all. And I think part of it is because the games that people watch don’t require thinking, or the same kind of puzzle solving. They’re certainly thinking in shooter games, but it’s not the same, you know? You don’t sit and ponder something. You don’t wait around, figure out what to do. Can I do this? How would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah. Did you ever play that Softporn Adventure game without any hints?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Uh, only with the source code.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Because I think you have a sound argument that people don’t like to think today, but there are a lot strange solutions that are not that obvious in the old games.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Why did all the old Sierra games always have these difficult stairs everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I can’t tell you other than you had to get to a different level. I actually spoofed that in, uh, Larry 2, I think? We had a cliff face and you had to walk this narrow path alongside a cliff. If you slipped, you went over the side, but you grabbed with this long arm that extended out and then brought you back up like a rubber band, so you couldn’t die on those stairs or on that cliff. That was my joke on those stairs.</p>
<p>But you’re right, it was a definite feature of Sierra games. Also, the deaths were because we often didn’t know what people would try. And when they would try something, we had no code in there to handle that. What were we gonna do? You couldn’t ignore it. I think somewhere, Larry 3, maybe, I added the feature that said: When you die you can go back to a game you saved, or you can just go back to life. And that seemed much more friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah? And you also had these very funny comments about you dying when you died.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, sure. Yeah, it was always fun for me to make fun of the player. And there was something else that I want to bring to you that I don’t know that people have noticed. My games always referred to Larry as you. So when I talk to the player, I would say: You did this, you fell off a cliff, that was a dumb thing you did. Whereas a lot of other games referred to the main character in the third person. It was: Larry has fallen off, you know? But I always felt it like it was more meaningful to me as a player if the game referred to me as a person.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I agree. And you can only blame yourself for trying to pet that cat or something.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yep. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Someone created a game: Stair Quest. It’s a game where you move like you do in the old Sierra games, and there are these very thin diagonal stairs that you have to traverse, and you fall off all the time and die.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, the trick with the stairs usually was to use the keys on the numeric keyboard. You’d have to use all of the keypad, including the diagonals. But I guess people didn’t always have keypads. So when the layout changed it made it pretty difficult to move.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Hmm, that’s a very good point. And with that I will let you get on with the day. It was wonderful meeting you, Al Lowe.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Nice to meet you.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 06 Feb 2026</p>
<p>
  Last year, I completed 20 years in professional software
  development.  I wanted to write a post to mark the occasion back
  then, but couldn't find the time.  This post is my attempt to make
  up for that omission.  In fact, I have been involved in software
  development for a little longer than 20 years.  Although I had
  my <a href="https://susam.net/fd-100.html">first taste</a> of computer programming as
  a child, it was only when I entered university about 25 years ago
  that I seriously got into software development.  So I'll start my
  stories from there.  These stories are less about software and more
  about people.  Unlike many posts of this kind, this one offers no
  wisdom or lessons.  It only offers a collection of stories.  I hope
  you'll like at least a few of them.

</ul>
<h2 id="viewing-the-source">Viewing the Source<a href="#viewing-the-source"></a></h2>
<p>
  The first story takes place in 2001, shortly after I joined
  university.  One evening, I went to the university computer
  laboratory to browse the Web.  Out of curiosity, I typed
  <code>susam.com</code> into the address bar and landed on
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010721163153/http://susam.com/">its
  home page</a>.  I remember the text and banner looking much larger
  back then.  Display resolutions were lower, so they covered almost
  half the screen.  I knew very little about the Internet then and I
  was just trying to make sense of it.  I remember wondering what it
  would take to create my own website, perhaps at
  <code>susam.com</code>.  That's when an older student who had been
  watching me browse over my shoulder approached and asked if I had
  created the website.  I told him I hadn't and that I had no idea how
  websites were made.  He asked me to move aside, took my seat and
  clicked View &gt; Source in Internet Explorer.  He then explained
  how websites are made of HTML pages and how those pages are simply
  text instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Next, he opened Notepad and wrote a simple HTML page that looked
  something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="RED"&gt;HELLO&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  Yes, we had a <code>FONT</code> tag back then and it was common
  practice to write HTML tags in uppercase.  He then opened the page
  in a web browser and showed how it rendered.  After that, he
  demonstrated a few more features such as changing the font face and
  size, centring the text and altering the page's background colour.
  Although the tutorial lasted only about ten minutes, it made the
  World Wide Web feel far less mysterious and much more fascinating.
</p>
<p>
  That person had an ulterior motive though.  After the tutorial, he
  never returned the seat to me.  He just continued browsing the Web
  and waited for me to leave.  I was too timid to ask for my seat
  back.  Seats were limited, so I returned to my dorm room both
  disappointed that I couldn't continue browsing that day and excited
  about all the websites I might create with this newfound knowledge.
  I could never register <code>susam.com</code> for myself though.
  That domain was always used by some business selling Turkish
  cuisines.  Eventually, I managed to get the next best thing:
  a <code>.net</code> domain of my own.  That brief encounter in the
  university laboratory set me on a lifelong path of creating and
  maintaining personal websites.
</p>
<h2 id="reset-vector">The Reset Vector<a href="#reset-vector"></a></h2>
<p>
  The second story also comes from my university days.  One afternoon,
  I was hanging out with my mates in the computer laboratory.  In
  front of me was an MS-DOS machine powered by an Intel 8086
  microprocessor, on which I was writing a lift control program in
  assembly.  In those days, it was considered important to
  deliberately practise solving made-up problems as a way of honing
  our programming skills.  As I worked on my program, my mind drifted
  to a small detail about the 8086 microprocessor that we had recently
  learnt in a lecture.  Our professor had explained that, when the
  8086 microprocessor is reset, execution begins with CS:IP set to
  FFFF:0000.  So I murmured to anyone who cared to listen, 'I wonder
  if the system will reboot if I jump to FFFF:0000.'  I then
  opened <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> and jumped to that address.
</p>
<pre><samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>G =FFFF:0000</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  The machine rebooted instantly.  One of my friends, who topped the
  class every semester, had been watching over my shoulder.  As soon
  as the machine restarted, he exclaimed, 'How did you do that?'  I
  explained that the reset vector is located at physical address FFFF0
  and that the CS:IP value FFFF:0000 maps to that address in real
  mode.  After that, I went back to working on my lift control program
  and didn't think much more about the incident.
</p>
<p>
  About a week later, the same friend came to my dorm room.  He sat
  down with a grave look on his face and asked, 'How did you know to
  do that?  How did it occur to you to jump to the reset vector?'  I
  must have said something like, 'It just occurred to me.  I
  remembered that detail from the lecture and wanted to try it out.'
  He then said, 'I want to be able to think like that.  I come top of
  the class every semester, but I don't think the way you do.  I would
  never have thought of taking a small detail like that and testing it
  myself.'  I replied that I was just curious to see whether what we
  had learnt actually worked in practice.  He responded, 'And that's
  exactly it.  It would never occur to me to try something like that.
  I feel disappointed that I keep coming top of the class, yet I am
  not curious in the same way you are.  I've decided I don't want to
  top the class anymore.  I just want to explore and experiment with
  what we learn, the way you do.'
</p>
<p>
  That was all he said before getting up and heading back to his dorm
  room.  I didn't take it very seriously at the time.  I couldn't
  imagine why someone would willingly give up the accomplishment of
  coming first every year.  But he kept his word.  He never topped the
  class again.  He still ranked highly, often within the top ten, but
  he kept his promise of never finishing first again.  To this day, I
  feel a mix of embarrassment and pride whenever I recall that
  incident.  With a single jump to the processor's reset entry point,
  I had somehow inspired someone to step back from academic
  competition in order to have more fun with learning.  Of course,
  there is no reason one cannot do both.  But in the end, that was his
  decision, not mine.
</p>
<h2 id="man-in-the-middle">Man in the Middle<a href="#man-in-the-middle"></a></h2>
<p>
  In my first job after university, I was assigned to a technical
  support team where part of my work involved running an installer to
  deploy a specific component of an e-banking product for customers,
  usually large banks.  As I learnt to use the installer, I realised
  how fragile it was.  The installer, written in Python, often failed
  because of incorrect assumptions about the target environment and
  almost always required some manual intervention to complete
  successfully.  During my first week on the project, I spent much of
  my time stabilising the installer and writing a step-by-step user
  guide explaining how to use it.  The result was well received by
  both my seniors and management.  To my surprise, the user guide
  received more praise than the improvements I made to the installer
  itself.  While the first few weeks were productive, I soon realised
  I would not find the work fulfilling for long.  I wrote to
  management a few times to ask whether I could transfer to a team
  where I could work on something more substantial.
</p>
<p>
  My emails were initially met with resistance.  After several rounds
  of discussion, however, someone who had heard about my situation
  reached out and suggested a team whose manager might be interested
  in interviewing me.  The team was based in a different city.  I was
  young and willing to relocate wherever I could find good work, so I
  immediately agreed to the interview.
</p>
<p>
  This was in 2006, when video conferencing was not yet common.  On
  the day of the interview, the hiring manager called me on my office
  desk phone.  He began by introducing the team, which was called
  <em>Archie</em>, short for <em>architecture</em>.  The team
  developed and maintained the web framework and core architectural
  components on which the entire e-banking product was built.  The
  product had existed long before open source frameworks such as
  Spring or Django came into existence, so features such as API
  routing, authentication and authorisation layers, cookie management,
  etc. were all implemented in-house as Java Servlets and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP).  Since the software was used in banking environments,
  it also had to pass strict security testing and regular audits to
  minimise the risk of serious flaws.
</p>
<p>
  The interview began well.  He asked several questions related to
  software security, such as what SQL injection is and how it can be
  prevented or how one might design a web framework that mitigates
  cross-site scripting attacks.  He also asked programming questions,
  most of which I answered pretty well.  Towards the end, however, he
  asked how we could prevent MITM attacks.  I had never heard the
  term, so I admitted that I did not know what MITM meant.  He then
  asked, 'Man in the middle?' but I still had no idea what that meant
  or whether it was even a software engineering concept.  He replied,
  'Learn everything you can about PKI and MITM.  We need to build a
  digital signatures feature for one of our corporate banking
  products.  That's the first thing we'll work on.'
</p>
<p>
  Over the next few weeks, I studied RFCs and documentation related to
  public key infrastructure, public key cryptography standards and
  related topics.  At first, the material felt intimidating, but after
  spending time each evening reading whatever relevant literature I
  could find, things gradually began to make sense.  Concepts that
  initially seemed complex and overwhelming eventually felt intuitive
  and elegant.  I relocated to the new city a few weeks later and
  delivered the digital signatures feature about a month after joining
  the team.  We used the open source Bouncy Castle library to
  implement the feature.  After that project, I worked on other parts
  of the product too.  The most rewarding part was knowing that the
  code I was writing became part of a mature product used by hundreds
  of banks and millions of users.  It was especially satisfying to see
  the work pass security testing and audits and be considered ready
  for release.
</p>
<p>
  That was my first real engineering job.  My manager also turned out
  to be an excellent mentor.  Working with him helped me develop new
  skills and his encouragement gave me confidence that stayed with me
  for years.  Nearly two decades have passed since then, yet the
  product is still in service and continues to be actively developed.
  In fact, in my current phase of life I sometimes encounter it as a
  customer.  Occasionally, I open the browser's developer tools to
  view the page source where I can still see traces of the HTML
  generated by code I wrote almost twenty years ago.

<p>
  Around 2007 or 2008, I began working on a proof of concept for
  developing widgets for an OpenTV set-top box.  The work involved
  writing code in a heavily trimmed-down version of C.  One afternoon,
  while making good progress on a few widgets, I noticed that they
  would occasionally crash at random.  I tried tracking down the bugs,
  but I was finding it surprisingly difficult to understand my own
  code.  I had managed to produce some truly spaghetti code full of
  dubious pointer operations that were almost certainly responsible
  for the crashes, yet I could not pinpoint where exactly things were
  going wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Ours was a small team of four people, each working on an independent
  proof of concept.  The most senior person on the team acted as our
  lead and architect.  Later that afternoon, I showed him my progress
  and explained that I was still trying to hunt down the bugs causing
  the widgets to crash.  He asked whether he could look at the code.
  After going through it briefly and probably realising that it was a
  bit of a mess, he asked me to send him the code as a tarball, which
  I promptly did.
</p>
<p>
  He then went back to his desk to study the code.  I remember
  thinking that there was no way he was going to find the problem
  anytime soon.  I had been debugging it for hours and barely
  understood what I had written myself; it was the worst spaghetti
  code I had ever produced.  With little hope of a quick solution, I
  went back to debugging on my own.
</p>
<p>
  Barely five minutes later, he came back to my desk and asked me to
  open a specific file.  He then showed me exactly where the pointer
  bug was.  It had taken him only a few minutes not only to read my
  tangled code but also to understand it well enough to identify the
  fault and point it out.  As soon as I fixed that line, the crashes
  disappeared.  I was genuinely in awe of his skill.
</p>
<p>
  I have always loved computing and programming, so I had assumed I
  was already fairly good at it.  That incident, however, made me
  realise how much further I still had to go before I could consider
  myself a good software developer.  I did improve significantly in
  the years that followed and today I am far better at managing
  software complexity than I was back then.
</p>

<p>
  In another project from that period, we worked on another set-top
  box platform that supported Java Micro Edition (Java ME) for widget
  development.  One day, the same architect from the previous story
  asked whether I could add animations to the widgets.  I told him
  that I believed it should be possible, though I'd need to test it to
  be sure.  Before continuing with the story, I need to explain how
  the different stakeholders in the project were organised.
</p>
<p>
  Our small team effectively played the role of the software vendor.
  The final product going to market would carry the brand of a major
  telecom carrier, offering direct-to-home (DTH) television services,
  with the set-top box being one of the products sold to customers.
  The set-top box was manufactured by another company.  So the project
  was a partnership between three parties: our company as the software
  vendor, the telecom carrier and the set-top box manufacturer.  The
  telecom carrier wanted to know whether widgets could be animated on
  screen with smooth slide-in and slide-out effects.  That was why the
  architect approached me to ask whether it could be done.
</p>
<p>
  I began working on animating the widgets.  Meanwhile, the architect
  and a few senior colleagues attended a business meeting with all the
  partners present.  During the meeting, he explained that we were
  evaluating whether widget animations could be supported.  The
  set-top box manufacturer immediately dismissed the idea, saying,
  'That's impossible.  Our set-top box does not support animation.'
  When the architect returned and shared this with us, I replied, 'I
  do not understand.  If I can draw a widget, I can animate it too.
  All it takes is clearing the widget and redrawing it at slightly
  different positions repeatedly.  In fact, I already have a working
  version.'  I then showed a demo of the animated widgets running on
  the emulator.
</p>
<p>
  The following week, the architect attended another partners' meeting
  where he shared updates about our animated widgets.  I was not
  personally present, so what follows is second-hand information
  passed on by those who were there.  I learnt that the set-top box
  company reacted angrily.  For some reason, they were unhappy that we
  had managed to achieve results using their set-top box and APIs that
  they had officially described as impossible.  They demanded that we
  stop work on animation immediately, arguing that our work could not
  be allowed to contradict their official position.  At that point,
  the telecom carrier's representative intervened and bluntly told the
  set-top box representative to just shut up.  If the set-top box guy
  was furious, the telecom guy was even more so, 'You guys told us
  animation was not possible and these people are showing that it is!
  You manufacture the set-top box.  How can you not know what it is
  capable of?'
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, I continued working on the proof of concept.  It worked
  very well in the emulator, but I did not yet have access to the
  actual hardware.  The device was still in the process of being
  shipped to us, so all my early proof-of-concepts ran on the
  emulator.  The following week, the architect planned to travel to
  the set-top box company's office to test my widgets on the real
  hardware.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, I was quite proud of demonstrating results that even
  the hardware maker believed were impossible.  When the architect
  eventually travelled to test the widgets on the actual device, a
  problem emerged.  What looked like buttery smooth animation on the
  emulator appeared noticeably choppy on a real television.  Over the
  next few weeks, I experimented with frame rates, buffering
  strategies and optimising the computation done in the the rendering
  loop.  Each week, the architect travelled for testing and returned
  with the same report: the animation had improved somewhat, but it
  still remained choppy.  The modest embedded hardware simply could
  not keep up with the required computation and rendering.  In the
  end, the telecom carrier decided that no animation was better than
  poor animation and dropped the idea altogether.  So in the end, the
  set-top box developers turned out to be correct after all.

  Back in 2009, after completing about a year at RSA Security, I began
  looking for work that felt more intellectually stimulating,
  especially projects involving mathematics and algorithms.  I spoke
  with a few senior leaders about this, but nothing materialised for
  some time.  Then one day, Dr Burt Kaliski, Chief Scientist at RSA
  Laboratories, asked to meet me to discuss my career aspirations.  I
  have written about this in more detail in another post here:
  <a href="https://susam.net/good-blessings.html">Good Blessings</a>.  I will summarise
  what followed.
</p>
<p>
  Dr Kaliski met me and offered a few suggestions about the kinds of
  teams I might approach to find more interesting work.  I followed
  his advice and eventually joined a team that turned out to be an
  excellent fit.  I remained with that team for the next six years.
  During that time, I worked on parser generators, formal language
  specification and implementation, as well as indexing and querying
  engines of a petabyte-scale database.  I learnt something new almost
  every day during those six years.  It remains one of the most
  enjoyable periods of my career.  I have especially fond memories of
  working on parser generators alongside remarkably skilled engineers
  from whom I learnt a lot.
</p>
<p>
  Years later, I reflected on how that brief meeting with Dr Kaliski
  had altered the trajectory of my career.  I realised I was not sure
  whether I had properly expressed my gratitude to him for the role he
  had played in shaping my path.  So I wrote to thank him and explain
  how much that single conversation had influenced my life.  A few
  days later, Dr Kaliski replied, saying he was glad to know that the
  steps I took afterwards had worked out well.  Before ending his
  message, he wrote this heart-warming note:
</p>
<blockquote>
  ‘One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to
  others who are developing their careers, just as others have
  invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to
  another.’

  This story comes from 2019.  By then, I was no longer a
  twenty-something engineer just starting out.  I was now a
  middle-aged staff engineer with years of experience building both
  low-level networking systems and database systems.  Most of my work
  up to that point had been in C and C++.  I was now entering a new
  phase of my career where I would be leading the development of
  microservices written in Go and Python.  Like many people in this
  profession, computing has long been one of my favourite hobbies.  So
  although my professional work for the previous decade had focused on
  C and C++, I had plenty of hobby projects in other languages,
  including Python and Go.  As a result, switching gears from systems
  programming to application development was a smooth transition for
  me.  I cannot even say that I missed working in C and C++.  After
  all, who wants to spend their days occasionally chasing memory bugs
  in core dumps when you could be building features and delivering
  real value to customers?
</p>
<p>
  In October 2019, during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a Capture the
  Flag (CTF) event was organised at our office.  The contest featured
  all kinds of technical puzzles, ranging from SQL injection
  challenges to insecure cryptography problems.  Some challenges also
  involved reversing binaries and exploiting stack overflow issues.
</p>
<p>
  I am usually rather intimidated by such contests.  The whole idea of
  competitive problem-solving under time pressure tends to make me
  nervous.  But one of my colleagues persuaded me to participate in
  the CTF.  And, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be rather
  good at it.  Within about eight hours, I had solved roughly 90% of
  the puzzles.  I finished at the top of the scoreboard.
</p>

<p>
  In my younger days, I was generally known to be a good problem
  solver.  I was often consulted when thorny problems needed solving
  and I usually managed to deliver results.  I also enjoyed solving
  puzzles.  I had a knack for them and happily spent hours, sometimes
  days, working through obscure mathematical or technical puzzles and
  sharing detailed write-ups with friends of the nerd variety.  Seen
  in that light, my performance at the CTF probably should not have
  surprised me.  Still, I was very pleased.  It was reassuring to know
  that I could still rely on my systems programming experience to
  solve obscure challenges.
</p>
<p>
  During the course of the contest, my performance became something of
  a talking point in the office.  Colleagues occasionally stopped by
  my desk to appreciate my progress in the CTF.  Two much younger
  colleagues, both engineers I admired for their skill and
  professionalism, were discussing the results nearby.  They were
  speaking softly, but I could still overhear parts of their
  conversation.  Curious, I leaned slightly and listened a bit more
  carefully.  I wanted to know what these two people, whom I admired a
  lot, thought about my performance.
</p>
<p>
  One of them remarked on how well I was doing in the contest.  The
  other replied, 'Of course he is doing well.  He has more than ten
  years of experience in C.'  At that moment, I realised that no
  matter how well I solved those puzzles, the result would naturally
  be credited to experience.  In my younger days, when I solved tricky
  problems like these, people would sometimes call me smart.  Now
  people simply saw it as a consequence of my experience.  Not that I
  particularly care for labels such as 'smart' anyway, but it did make
  me realise how things had changed.  I was now simply the person with
  many years of experience.  Solving technical puzzles that involved
  disassembling binaries, tracing execution paths and reconstructing
  program logic was expected rather than remarkable.
</p>
<p>
  I continue to sharpen my technical skills to this day.  While my
  technical results may now simply be attributed to experience, I hope
  I can continue to make a good impression through my professionalism,
  ethics and kindness towards the people I work with.  If those leave
  a lasting impression, that is good enough for me.
