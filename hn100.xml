<p>Among the software developers who use Microsoft's GitHub, the most popular community discussion in the past 12 months has been a request for a way to block Copilot, the company's AI service, from generating issues and pull requests in code repositories.</p>
<p>The second most popular discussion – where popularity is <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Atop+created%3A%3E%3D2024-09-04" rel="nofollow">measured in upvotes</a> – is a bug report that seeks a fix for the inability of users to disable Copilot code reviews.</p>
<p>Both of these questions, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159749" rel="nofollow">the first</a> opened in May and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169148" rel="nofollow">the second</a> opened a month ago, remain unanswered, despite an abundance of comments critical of generative AI and Copilot.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>The author of the first, developer Andi McClure, published <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237819" rel="nofollow">a similar request</a> to Microsoft's Visual Studio Code repository in January, objecting to the reappearance of a Copilot icon in VS Code after she had uninstalled the Copilot extension.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft and GitHub, not to mention rivals like Google, have gone all-in on a technology that a sizable or at least vocal portion of their customers simply don't want. And with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/30/microsoft_hails_cloud_and_ai/">billions in capital expenditures</a> to recoup, they're making it difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>During Microsoft's July 30, 2025 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/TranscriptFY25q4">said</a> GitHub Copilot continued to exhibit strong momentum and had reached 20 million users.</p>

        

<p>"GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers increased 75 percent quarter over quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases," said Nadella, noting that AI adoption has increased usage of GitHub over the past year.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I deeply resent that on top of Copilot seemingly training itself on my GitHub-posted code in violation of my licenses, GitHub wants me to look at (effectively) ads for this project I will never touch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I've been for a while now filing issues in the GitHub Community feedback area when Copilot intrudes on my GitHub usage," McClure told <em>The Register</em> in an email. "I deeply resent that on top of Copilot seemingly training itself on my GitHub-posted code in violation of my licenses, GitHub wants me to look at (effectively) ads for this project I will never touch. If something's bothering me, I don't see a reason to stay quiet about it. I think part of how we get pushed into things we collectively don't want is because we stay quiet about it."</p>
<p>It's not just the burden of responding to AI slop, an <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/" rel="nofollow">ongoing issue</a> for Curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg. It's the permissionless copying and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sonicrocketman/115149008178747518" rel="nofollow">regurgitation of speculation as fact</a>, mitigated only by small print disclaimers that generative AI may produce inaccurate results. It's also GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/148571" rel="nofollow">disavowal of liability</a> if Copilot code suggestions happen to have reproduced source code that requires attribution.</p>
<p>It's what the Servo project characterizes in its <a href="https://book.servo.org/contributing.html#ai-contributions" rel="nofollow">ban on AI code contributions</a> as the lack of code correctness guarantees, copyright issues, and ethical concerns. Similar objections have been used to justify AI code bans in GNOME's <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/loupe/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md?ref_type=heads#use-of-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">Loupe</a> project, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/03/freebsd_project_update_no_ai/">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council/AI_policy" rel="nofollow">Gentoo</a>, <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/developers/commit-guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">NetBSD</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/3d40db0efc22520fa6c399cf73960dced423b048" rel="nofollow">QEMU</a>.</p>
<p>McClure said she has been filing requests to opt out of Copilot for a few years now, but in the last six months, her posts have been attracting more community support.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Two issues, about the abovementioned Copilot menu in VS Code and the inability to block Copilot-generated issues and pull requests, she said, have continued to attract comments.</p>
<p>"People keep finding these issues somehow and tacking on to them," McClure said. "Although Microsoft's been forcing the Copilot 'asks' into more and more places in the interface for a while, sometime this year they hit an inflection point where mass numbers of people don't feel like ignoring it anymore, where before they could shrug and ignore it or find the off switch."</p>
<p>In the past month, she said, there's been a second change in the way people see GitHub – GitHub's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/11/github_head_ankles_as_microsoft/">demotion from distinct subsidiary to part of Microsoft's CoreAI group</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>"Despite being a symbolic change, it seems to have galvanized the open source community from just complaining about Copilot to now actively moving away from GitHub," said McClure. "Many of my contacts in the open source community have been talking about plans to move from GitHub to Codeberg or a self-hosted Forgejo (Forgejo is the software used by Codeberg) over the last month, and the comments in those two always-busy GitHub threads have increasingly been people describing how Copilot is inspiring them to move to Codeberg as well."</p>
<p>Calls to shun Microsoft and GitHub go back a long way in the open source community, but moved beyond simmering dissatisfaction in 2022 when the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/software_freedom_conservancy_quits_github/">urged free software supporters</a> to <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/" rel="nofollow">give up GitHub</a>, a position SFC policy fellow Bradley M. Kuhn <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/15/codeberg_beset_by_ai_bots/">recently reiterated</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the developers participating in the issues raised by McClure and by others have said they intend to move away from GitHub over its stance on AI.</p>
<p>"Today I rejected two Copilot-generated code suggestions on my PR," <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159749#discussioncomment-13329811" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> a developer who posted to McClure's thread under the name Constantine. "This was very disturbing, so I started googling and found this discussion. I refuse using AI in the same way I don't take drugs or steal things - for me it's a matter of principle. So if this continues and Microsoft does not provide a way to opt out of AI for my repositories soon, I will move my code to a self-hosted solution and won't ever return to GitHub."</p>
<p>McClure said she has been slowly shifting toward Codeberg over the past few months. "I haven't been proactively moving repos but whenever I make a change to a repo I clone it to Codeberg, post the change there, and replace my main branch on the GitHub repo with a relocation notice," she said.</p>
<p>"Microsoft as a company has a running problem where they won't take no for an answer, whether with 'AI' or with any other product they want to ship," said McClure. "A favorite tactic of theirs recently is they will enable a thing by default and put an off switch, wait six months, and then slightly change or rename the feature you turned off, and create a new off switch you have to separately turn off. They did this with Bing in Windows 10 and now they're doing it with Copilot in their developer tools (and presumably Windows 11, I don't know, I don't use Windows 11)."</p>
<p>McClure said that when Microsoft began adding Copilot to everything, starting with Android keyboard SwiftKey, she concluded that the situation would reprise the handling of Bing/Cortana in Windows 10 and turning it off would not be enough.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>If you really find Copilot unacceptable – and I do, Copilot is so much more noxious than Microsoft's previous forced bundlings – the only option is to stop using any Microsoft product that Copilot shows up in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"If you really find Copilot unacceptable – and I do, Copilot is so much more noxious than Microsoft's previous forced bundlings – the only option is to stop using any Microsoft product that Copilot shows up in," she said. "I stopped using SwiftKey; I started migrating from desktop Windows to Linux when it became clear mandatory AI surveillance would be a core part of Win11. GitHub and, more sporadically, Visual Studio Code I have had to keep using because they're monopolies in a way even Windows isn't. The network effects (projects whose sole method of communication is GitHub, software whose only IDE integration is a VSCode plugin) are too strong."</p>
<p>Things have progressed as expected, McClure said, with Copilot buttons appearing in VS Code even when Copilot has been uninstalled and poorly labeled buttons that redirect to Copilot searches. She suggests people are starting to tire of the situation and that if it continues, it will weaken the network effects that keep developers tied to GitHub, accelerating further migration.</p>
<p>"When this happens I have no idea if Microsoft will notice or care," said McClure. "The Copilot push at Microsoft appears to be completely top-down and the people at the top seem to have completely forgotten about conventional goals like customer retention. They want to pump up those 'AI' numbers, for whatever reason, and they view their customer base as just a resource to burn to get those metrics up."</p>
<p>GitHub did not respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

<p>
Like almost all human endeavors, open-source software development involves
a range of power dynamics.  Companies, developers, and users are all
concerned with the power to influence the direction of the software — and,
often, to profit from it.  At the 2025 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open
Source Summit Europe</a>, Dawn Foster talked about how those dynamics can
play out, with an eye toward a couple of tactics — rug pulls and forks — that
are available to try to shift power in one direction or another.
</p><h4>Power dynamics</h4>
<p>
Since the beginning of history, Foster began, those in power have tended to
use it against those who were weaker.  In the days of feudalism, control of
the land led to exploitation at several levels.  In the open-source world,
the large cloud providers often seem to have the most power, which they use
against smaller companies.  Contributors and maintainers often have less
power than even the smaller companies, and users have less power yet.  
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1036470/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/osseu/DawnFoster-sm.png" alt="[Dawn Foster]" title="Dawn Foster"></a>

We have built a world where it is often easiest to just use whatever a
cloud provider offers, even with open-source software.  Those providers may
not contribute back to the projects they turn into services, though,
upsetting the smaller companies that are, likely as not, doing the bulk of
the work to provide the software in question in the first place.  Those
companies can have a power of their own, however: the power to relicense
the software.  Pulling the rug out from under users of the software in this
way can change the balance of power with regard to cloud providers, but it
leaves contributors and users in a worse position than before.  But
there is a power at this level too: the power to fork the software,
flipping the power balance yet again.
</p><p>
Companies that control a software project have the power to carry out this
sort of rug pull, and they are often not shy about exercising it.
Single-company projects, clearly, are at a much higher risk of rug pulls;
the company has all the power in this case, and others have little
recourse.  So one should look at a company's reputation before adopting a
software project, but that is only so helpful.  Companies can change
direction without notice, be acquired, or go out of business, making
previous assessments of their reputation irrelevant.
</p><p>
The problem often comes down to the simple fact that companies have to
answer to their investors, and that often leads to pressure to relicense
the software they have created in order to increase revenue.  This is
especially true in cases where cloud providers are competing for the same
customers as the company that owns the project.  The result can be a switch
to a more restrictive license aimed at making it harder for other companies
to profit from the project.
</p><p>
A rug pull of this nature can lead to a fork of the project — a rebellious,
collective action aimed at regaining some power over the code.  But a fork
is not a simple matter; it is a lot of work, and will fail without people
and resources behind it.  The natural source for that is a large company;
cloud providers, too, can try to shift power via a fork, and they have the
ability to back their fork up with the resources it needs to succeed.
</p><p>
<!-- middle-ad -->

A relicensing event does not always lead to a popular fork; that did not
happen with MongoDB or Sentry, for example.  Foster said she had not looked
into why that was the case.  Sometimes rug pulls take other forms, such as
when Perforce, after acquiring Puppet in 2022, moved it development and
releases behind closed doors, with a reduced frequency of releases back to
the public repository.  That action kicked off the <a href="https://voxpupuli.org/openvox/">OpenVox</a> fork.
</p><h4>Looking at the numbers</h4>
<p>
Foster has spent some time analyzing rug pulls, forks, and what happens
thereafter; a lot of the results are <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/tree/main/dataset/license-changes/fork-case-study/notebooks">available
for download as Jupyter notebooks</a>.  For each rug-pull event, she looked
at the contributor makeup of the project before and after the ensuing fork
in an attempt to see what effects are felt by the projects involved.
</p><p>
In 2021, Elastic <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/844016/">relicensed Elasticsearch</a>
under the non-free Server Side Public License (SSPL).  Amazon Web Services
then forked the project as <a href="https://opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a>.  Before the fork, most of
the Elasticsearch contributors were Elastic employees; that,
unsurprisingly, did not change afterward.  OpenSearch started with no
strong contributor base, so had to build its community from scratch.  As a
result, the project has been dominated by Amazon contributors ever since;
the balance has shifted slowly over time, but there was not a big uptick in
outside contributors even after OpenSearch became a Linux Foundation
project in 2024.  While starting a project under a neutral foundation can
help attract contributors, she said, moving a project under a foundation's
umbrella later on does not seem to provide the same benefit.
</p><p>
<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform">Terraform</a> was
developed mostly by Hashicorp, which <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/942346/">relicensed
the software</a> under the non-free Business Source License in 2023.  One
month later, the <a href="https://opentofu.org/">OpenTofu</a> fork was
started under the Linux Foundation.  While the contributor base for
Terraform, which was almost entirely Hashicorp employees, changed little
after the fork, OpenTofu quickly acquired a number of contributors from
several companies, none of whom had been Terraform contributors before.  In
this case, users drove the fork and placed it under a neutral foundation,
resulting in a more active developer community.
</p><p>
In 2024, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> was relicensed under the
SSPL; the <a href="https://valkey.io/">Valkey</a> fork was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">quickly organized</a>, under the Linux Foundation,
by Redis contributors.  The Redis project differed from the others
mentioned here in that, before the fork, it had nearly twice as many
contributors from outside the company as from within; after the fork, the
number of external Redis contributors dropped to zero.  All of the external
contributors fled to Valkey, with the result that Valkey started with a
strong community representing a dozen or so companies.
</p><p>
Looking at how the <i>usage</i> of these projects changes is harder, she
said, but there appears to be a correlation between the usage of a project
and the number of GitHub forks (cloned repository copies) it has.  There is
typically a spike in these clones after a relicensing event, suggesting
that people are considering creating a hard fork of the project.  In all
cases, the forks that emerged appeared to have less usage than the original
by the "GitHub forks" metric; both branches of the fork continue to go
forward.  But, she said, projects that are relicensed do tend to show
reduced usage, especially when competing forks are created under foundations.
</p><h4>What to do</h4>
<p>
This kind of power game creates problems for both contributors and users,
she said; we contribute our time to these projects, and need them to not be
pulled out from under us.  There is no way to know when a rug pull might
happen, but there are some warning signs to look out for.  At the top of
her list was the use of a contributor license agreement (CLA); these
agreements create a power imbalance, giving the company involved the power
to relicense the software.  Projects with CLAs more commonly are subject to
rug pulls; projects using a developers certificate of origin do not have the
same power imbalance and are less likely to be rug pulled.
</p><p>
One should also look at the governance of a project; while being housed
under a foundation reduces the chance of a rug pull, that can still happen,
especially in cases where the contributors are mostly from a single
company.  She mentioned the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/cortex/">Cortex</a> project, housed under
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which was controlled by Grafana; that
company eventually forked its own project to create <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/">Mimir</a>.  To avoid this kind of
surprise, one should look for projects with neutral governance, with
leaders from multiple organizations.
</p><p>
Projects should also be evaluated on their contributor base; are there
enough contributors to keep things going?  Companies can help, of course,
by having their employees contribute to the projects they depend on,
increasing influence and making those projects more sustainable.  She
mentioned the <a href="https://chaoss.community/">CHAOSS project</a>, which
generates metrics to help in the judgment of the viability of development
projects.  CHAOSS has put together <a href="https://chaoss.community/practitioner-guide-introduction/">a set of
"practitioner guides"</a> intended to help contributors and maintainers
make improvements within a project.
</p><p>
With the sustained rise of the big cloud providers, she concluded, the
power dynamics around open-source software are looking increasingly feudal.
Companies can use relicensing to shift power away from those providers, but
they also take power from contributors when the pull the rug in this way.
Those contributors, though, are in a better position than the serfs of old,
since they have the ability to fork a project they care about, shifting
power back in their direction.

</p><p>
Hazel Weakly asked if there are other protections that contributors and
users might develop to address this problem.  Foster answered that at least
one company changed its mind about a planned relicensing action after
seeing the success of the Valkey and OpenTofu forks.  The ability to fork
has the effect of making companies think harder, knowing that there may be
consequences that follow a rug pull.  Beyond that, she reiterated that
projects should be pushed toward neutral governance.

Dirk Hohndel added that the best thing to do is to bring more outside
contributors into a project; the more of them there are, the higher the
risk associated with a rug pull.  Anybody who just sits back within a
project, he said, is just a passenger; it is better to be driving.

												<p>The chairman of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> (FTC) last week sent a letter to Google’s CEO demanding to know why Gmail was blocking messages from Republican senders while allegedly failing to block similar missives supporting Democrats. The letter followed media reports accusing Gmail of disproportionately flagging messages from the GOP fundraising platform <strong>WinRed</strong> and sending them to the spam folder. But according to experts who track daily spam volumes worldwide, WinRed’s messages are getting blocked more because its methods of blasting email are increasingly way more spammy than that of <strong>ActBlue</strong>, the fundraising platform for Democrats.</p>

<p>On Aug. 13, <strong>The New York Post</strong> ran an “exclusive” <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/business/google-caught-flagging-gop-fundraiser-emails-as-suspicious-sending-them-directly-to-spam-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a> titled, “Google caught flagging GOP fundraiser emails as ‘suspicious’ — sending them directly to spam.” The story cited a memo from Targeted Victory – whose clients include the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), Rep. Steve Scalise and Sen. Marsha Blackburn – which said it observed that the “serious and troubling” trend was still going on as recently as June and July of this year.</p>
<p>“If Gmail is allowed to quietly suppress WinRed links while giving ActBlue a free pass, it will continue to tilt the playing field in ways that voters never see, but campaigns will feel every single day,” the memo reportedly said.</p>
<p>In an August 28 letter to Google CEO <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, FTC Chairman <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong> cited the New York Post story and warned that Gmail’s parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> may be engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.</p>
<p>“Alphabet’s alleged partisan treatment of comparable messages or messengers in Gmail to achieve political objectives may violate both of these prohibitions under the FTC Act,” Ferguson wrote. “And the partisan treatment may cause harm to consumers.”</p>
<p>However, the situation looks very different when you ask spam experts what’s going on with WinRed’s recent messaging campaigns. <strong>Atro Tossavainen</strong> and <strong>Pekka Jalonen</strong> are co-founders at <a href="https://www.koliloks.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koli-Lõks OÜ</a>, an email intelligence company in Estonia. Koli-Lõks taps into real-time intelligence about daily spam volumes by monitoring large numbers of “spamtraps” — email addresses that are intentionally set up to catch unsolicited emails.</p>
<p>Spamtraps are generally not used for communication or account creation, but instead are created to identify senders exhibiting spammy behavior, such as scraping the Internet for email addresses or buying unmanaged distribution lists. As an email sender, blasting these spamtraps over and over with unsolicited email is the fastest way to ruin your domain’s reputation online. Such activity also virtually ensures that more of your messages are going to start getting listed on spam blocklists that are broadly shared within the global anti-abuse community.</p>
<p>Tossavainen told KrebsOnSecurity that WinRed’s emails hit its spamtraps in the .com, .net, and .org space far more frequently than do fundraising emails sent by ActBlue. Koli-Lõks published a graph of the stark disparity in spamtrap activity for WinRed versus ActBlue, showing a nearly fourfold increase in spamtrap hits from WinRed emails in the final week of July 2025.</p>
<div id="attachment_72094"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72094" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue.png" alt="" width="749" height="399" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue.png 974w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue-768x409.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue-782x417.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-72094">Image: Koliloks.eu</p></div>
<p>“Many of our spamtraps are in repurposed legacy-TLD domains (.com, .org, .net) and therefore could be understood to have been involved with a U.S. entity in their pre-zombie life,” Tossavainen explained in the LinkedIn post.<span id="more-72091"></span></p>
<p><strong>Raymond Dijkxhoorn</strong> is the CEO and a founding member of <a href="https://www.surbl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SURBL</a>, a widely-used blocklist that flags domains and IP addresses known to be used in unsolicited messages, phishing and malware distribution. Dijkxhoorn said their spamtrap data mirrors that of Koli-Lõks, and shows that WinRed has consistently been far more aggressive in sending email than ActBlue.</p>
<p>Dijkxhoorn said the fact that WinRed’s emails so often end up dinging the organization’s sender reputation is not a content issue but rather a technical one.</p>
<p>“On our end we don’t really care if the content is political or trying to sell viagra or penis enlargements,” Dijkhoorn said. “It’s the mechanics, they should not end up in spamtraps. And that’s the reason the domain reputation is tempered. Not ‘because domain reputation firms have a political agenda.’ We really don’t care about the political situation anywhere. The same as we don’t mind people buying penis enlargements. But when either of those land in spamtraps it will impact sending experience.”</p>
<p>The FTC letter to Google’s CEO also referenced a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/11/despite-what-fox-news-tells-you-a-new-study-did-not-prove-that-gmail-is-biased-against-conservatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debunked</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16743.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 study</a> (PDF) by political consultants who found Google caught more Republican emails in spam filters. <strong>Techdirt</strong> editor <strong>Mike Masnick</strong> notes that while the 2022 study also found that other email providers caught more Democratic emails as spam, “Republicans laser-focused on Gmail because it fit their victimization narrative better.”</p>
<p>Masnick said GOP lawmakers then filed both lawsuits and complaints with the <strong>Federal Election Commission</strong> (both of which failed easily), claiming this was somehow an “in-kind contribution” to Democrats.</p>
<p>“This is political posturing designed to keep the White House happy by appearing to ‘do something’ about conservative claims of ‘censorship,'” Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/04/ftc-chair-fergusons-ridiculous-crusade-threatening-google-over-spam-filters-that-actually-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> of the FTC letter. “The FTC has never policed ‘political bias’ in private companies’ editorial decisions, and for good reason—the First Amendment prohibits exactly this kind of government interference.”</p>
<p>WinRed did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The WinRed website says it is an online fundraising platform supported by a united front of the Trump campaign, the <strong>Republican National Committee</strong> (RNC), the NRSC,&nbsp;and the <strong>National Republican Congressional Committee</strong> (NRCC).</p>
<p>WinRed has recently come under fire for aggressive fundraising via text message as well. In June, <strong>404 Media</strong> reported on <a href="https://www.404media.co/winred-texts-class-action-lawsuit-rnc-donations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lawsuit</a> filed by a family in Utah against the RNC for allegedly bombarding their mobile phones with text messages seeking donations after they’d tried to unsubscribe from the missives dozens of times.</p>
<p>One of the family members said they received 27 such messages from 25 numbers, even after sending 20 stop requests. The plaintiffs in that case allege the texts from WinRed and the RNC “knowingly disregard stop requests and purposefully use different phone numbers to make it impossible to block new messages.”</p>
<p>Dijkhoorn said WinRed did inquire recently about why some of its assets had been marked as a risk by SURBL, but he said they appeared to have zero interest in investigating the likely causes he offered in reply.</p>
<p>“They only replied with, ‘You are interfering with U.S. elections,'” Dijkhoorn said, noting that many of SURBL’s spamtrap domains are only publicly listed in the registration records for random domain names.</p>
<p>“They’re at best harvested by themselves but more likely [they] just went and bought lists,” he said. “It’s not like ‘Oh Google is filtering this and not the other,’ the reason isn’t the provider. The reason is the fundraising spammers and the lists they send to.”</p>

  <p><span>05 Sep 2025</span></p><p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/38FGT7SWVh0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In 2017 I discovered the free of charge <a href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/">Orbiter 2016</a> space flight simulator which was proprietary at the time and it inspired me to develop a space flight simulator myself.
I prototyped some rigid body physics in C and later in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a> and also prototyped loading and rendering of Wavefront OBJ files.
I used GNU Guile (a Scheme implementation) because it has a good native interface and of course it has hygienic macros.
Eventually I got interested in Clojure because unlike GNU Guile it has multi-methods as well as fast hash maps and vectors.
I finally decided to develop the game for real in Clojure.
I have been developing a space flight simulator in Clojure for almost 5 years now.
While using Clojure I have come to appreciate the immutable values and safe parallelism using atoms, agents, and refs.</p>

<p>In the beginning I decided to work on the hard parts first, which for me were 3D rendering of a planet, an atmosphere, shadows, and volumetric clouds.
I read the <a href="https://www.informit.com/store/opengl-superbible-comprehensive-tutorial-and-reference-9780672337475">OpenGL Superbible</a> to get an understanding on what functionality OpenGL provides.
When Orbiter was eventually open sourced and released unter MIT license <a href="https://github.com/orbitersim/orbiter">here</a>, I inspected the source code and discovered that about 90% of the code is graphics-related.
So starting with the graphics problems was not a bad decision.</p>

<h2 id="atmosphere-rendering">Atmosphere rendering</h2>


<p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q9aWd_14qhA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>For the atmosphere, <a href="https://ebruneton.github.io/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering/">Bruneton’s precomputed atmospheric scattering</a> was used.
The implementation uses a 2D transmittance table, a 2D surface scattering table, a 4D Rayleigh scattering, and a 4D Mie scattering table.
The tables are computed using several iterations of numerical integration.
Higher order functions for integration over a sphere and over a line segment were implemented in Clojure.
Integration over a ray in 3D space (using fastmath vectors) was implemented as follows for example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>integral-ray</span><span>

<p>Precomputing the atmospheric tables takes several hours even though <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/pmap">pmap</a> was used.
When sampling the multi-dimensional functions, <em>pmap</em> was used as a top-level loop and <em>map</em> was used for interior loops.
Using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html">java.nio.ByteBuffer</a> the floating point values were converted to a byte array and then written to disk using a <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.java.io/output-stream">clojure.java.io/output-stream</a>:</p>

<p>When launching the game, the lookup tables get loaded and copied into OpenGL textures.
Shader functions are used to lookup and interpolate values from the tables.
When rendering the planet surface or the space craft, the atmosphere essentially gets superimposed using ray tracing.
After rendering the planet, a background quad is rendered to display the remaining part of the atmosphere above the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="templating-opengl-shaders">Templating OpenGL shaders</h2>

<p>It is possible to make programming with OpenGL shaders more flexible by using a templating library such as <em>Comb</em>.
The following shader defines multiple octaves of noise on a base noise function:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="glsl"><span>#version 410 core
</span>
<span>float</span> <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>base</span><span>-</span><span>function</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>vec3</span> <span>idx</span><span>);</span>

<span>float</span> <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>method</span><span>-</span><span>name</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>vec3</span> <span>idx</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>&lt;%</span> <span>(</span><span>doseq</span> <span>[</span><span>multiplier</span> <span>octaves</span><span>]</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>multiplier</span> <span>%&gt;</span> <span>*</span> <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>base</span><span>-</span><span>function</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>idx</span><span>);</span>

<span>&lt;%</span> <span>)</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One can then for example define the function <em>fbm_noise</em> using octaves of the base function <em>noise</em> as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>noise-octaves</span><span>
  </span><span>"Shader function to sum octaves of noise"</span><span>

</span><span>; ...</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fbm-noise-shader</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>noise-octaves</span><span> </span><span>"fbm_noise"</span><span> </span><span>"noise"</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>0.57</span><span> </span><span>0.28</span><span> </span><span>0.15</span><span>]))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ce3oWQflYOY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>To render the planet, <a href="https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/collection/1484/blue-marble">NASA Bluemarble</a> data, <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights/page3.php">NASA Blackmarble</a> data, and <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/gltiles.html">NASA Elevation</a> data was used.
The images were converted to a multi resolution pyramid of map tiles.
The following functions were implemented for color map tiles and for elevation tiles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a function to load and cache map tiles of given 2D tile index and level of detail</li>
  <li>a function to extract a pixel from a map tile</li>
  <li>a function to extract the pixel for a specific longitude and latitude</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions for extracting a pixel for given longitude and latitude then were used to generate a cube map with a quad tree of tiles for each face.
For each tile, the following files were generated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A daytime texture</li>
  <li>A night time texture</li>
  <li>An image of 3D vectors defining a surface mesh</li>
  <li>A water mask</li>
  <li>A normal map</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether 655350 files were generated.
Because the Steam ContentBuilder does not support a large number of files, each row of tile data was aggregated into a tar file.
The <em>Apache Commons Compress</em> library allows you to open a tar file to get a list of entries and then perform random access on the contents of the tar file.
A Clojure LRU cache was used to maintain a cache of open tar files for improved performance.</p>

<p>At run time, a future is created, which returns an updated tile tree, a list of tiles to drop, and a path list of the tiles to load into OpenGL.
When the future is realized, the main thread deletes the OpenGL textures from the drop list, and then uses the path list to get the new loaded images from the tile tree, load them into OpenGL textures, and create an updated tile tree with the new OpenGL textures added.
The following functions to manipulate quad trees were implemented to realize this:</p>

<h3 id="solar-system">Solar system</h3>

<p>The astronomy code for getting the position and orientation of planets was implemented according to the <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/">Skyfield</a> Python library.
The Python library in turn is based on the <a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html">SPICE</a> toolkit of the NASA JPL.
The JPL basically provides sequences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> to interpolate positions of Moon and planets as well as the orientation of the Moon as binary files.
Reference coordinate systems and orientations of other bodies are provided in text files which consist of human and machine readable sections.
The binary files were parsed using <em>Gloss</em> (see <a href="https://github.com/clj-commons/gloss/wiki/Introduction">Wiki</a> for some examples) and the text files using <em>Instaparse</em>.</p>

<h3 id="jolt-bindings">Jolt bindings</h3>

<p>The required Jolt functions for wheeled vehicle dynamics and collisions with meshes were wrapped in C functions and compiled into a shared library.
The <em>Coffi</em> Clojure library (which is a wrapper for Java’s new Foreign Function &amp; Memory API) was used to make the C functions and data types usable in Clojure.</p>

<p>For example the following code implements a call to the C function <em>add_force</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>defcfn</span><span> </span><span>add-force</span><span>
  </span><span>"Apply a force in the next physics update"</span><span>
  </span><span>add_force</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>::mem/int</span><span> </span><span>::vec3</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>::mem/void</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here <em>::vec3</em> refers to a custom composite type defined using basic types.
The memory layout, serialisation, and deserialisation for <em>::vec3</em> are defined as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>vec3-struct</span><span>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>The <em>clj-async-profiler</em> was used to create flame graphs visualising the performance of the game.
In order to get reflection warnings for Java calls without sufficient type declarations, <em>*unchecked-math*</em> was set to <em>:warn-on-boxed</em>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>set!</span><span> </span><span>*unchecked-math*</span><span> </span><span>:warn-on-boxed</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Furthermore to discover missing declarations of numerical types, <em>*warn-on-reflection*</em> was set to <em>true</em>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>set!</span><span> </span><span>*warn-on-reflection*</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To reduce garbage collector pauses, the ZGC low-latency garbage collector for the JVM was used.
The following section in <em>deps.edn</em> ensures that the ZGC garbage collector is used when running the project with <em>clj -M:run</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:deps</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>; ...</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>

<p>The option to use ZGC is also specified in the Packr JSON file used to deploy the application.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-project">Building the project</h3>

<p>In order to build the map tiles, atmospheric lookup tables, and other data files using <em>tools.build</em>, the project source code was made available in the <em>build.clj</em> file using a <em>:local/root</em> dependency:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:deps</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>; ...</span><span>

<p>Various targets were defined to build the different components of the project.
For example the atmospheric lookup tables can be build by specifying <em>clj -T:build atmosphere-lut</em> on the command line.</p>

<p>The following section in the <em>build.clj</em> file was added to allow creating an “Uberjar” JAR file with all dependencies by specifying <em>clj -T:build uber</em> on the command-line.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>uber</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span><span>

           </span><span>:main</span><span> </span><span>'sfsim.core</span><span>}))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To create a Linux executable with Packr, one can then run <em>java -jar packr-all-4.0.0.jar scripts/packr-config-linux.json</em> where the JSON file has the following content:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p>In order to distribute the game on Steam, three depots were created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a data depot with the operating system independent data files</li>
  <li>a Linux depot with the Linux executable and Uberjar including LWJGL’s Linux native bindings</li>
  <li>and a Windows depot with the Windows executable and an Uberjar including LWJGL’s Windows native bindings</li>
</ul>

<p>When updating a depot, the Steam ContentBuilder command line tool creates and uploads a patch in order to preserve storage space and bandwidth.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>Although the hard parts are mostly done, there are still several things to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>control surfaces and thruster graphics</li>
  <li>launchpad and runway graphics</li>
  <li>sound effects</li>
  <li>a 3D cockpit</li>
  <li>the Moon</li>
  <li>a space station</li>
</ul>

<p>It would also be interesting to make the game modable in a safe way (maybe evaluating Clojure files in a sandboxed environment?).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1PqmVLUt5_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/wedesoft/sfsim">source code on Github</a>.
Currently there is only a playtest build, but if you want to get notified, when the game gets released, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3687560/sfsim/">wishlist it here</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me know any comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

So, how did this happen?</p><p>An investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-04/questions-over-lab-that-tested-sunscreen-spf-claims/105458458">a single US-based laboratory had certified at least half of the products</a> that had failed Choice's testing, and that this facility routinely recorded high test results.</p><p>It also found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-30/sunscreen-spf-consumer-protection-base-formula/105711012">several of the sunscreens pulled from shelves shared a similar base formula</a> and linked them to a manufacturer in Western Australia.</p><p>The TGA says it does not usually speak about ongoing investigations because it does not want to compromise them, but that it is also looking into "reviewing existing SPF testing requirements" which can be "highly subjective".</p><p>"The TGA is also aware that it is common practice for different sunscreen products to share the same or similar base formulations," a spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.</p><p>"Ultimately it is the sponsor's [seller's] responsibility to ensure that their medicine remains compliant with all applicable legislative requirements."</p><p>Consistent and comfortable sunscreens which offer high protection are very technical and difficult to make, says Dr Wong, founder of Lab Muffin Beauty Science. </p><p>Everyone's skin responds differently to the product, she adds, and it's one that is almost always being stress-tested - by sweat, water, or makeup.</p><p>It is very difficult to rate effectively for the same reasons. Historically, it has been done by spreading the sunscreen on 10 people at the same thickness, then timing how long it takes for their skin to start burning both with and without the product applied.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250828-055926-c20c0c03f5-2.28.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A spectator uses an umbrella to shield herself from the sun as another applies sunscreen during the men's singles third round match between Luxembourg's Gilles Muller and Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta on day five of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on January 19, 2018."><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Effective and popular sunscreens are hard to get right, experts say</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>While there are clear guidelines as to what you are looking for, Dr Wong says there is still a lot of variability.

<p><span data-as="p">GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are our latest flagship models, purpose-built as foundational models for agent-oriented applications. Both leverage a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. GLM-4.5 has a total parameter count of 355B with 32B active parameters per forward pass, while GLM-4.5-Air adopts a more streamlined design with 106B total parameters and 12B active parameters.</span>
<span data-as="p">Both models share a similar training pipeline: an initial pretraining phase on 15 trillion tokens of general-domain data, followed by targeted fine-tuning on datasets covering code, reasoning, and agent-specific tasks. The context length has been extended to 128k tokens, and reinforcement learning was applied to further enhance reasoning, coding, and agent performance.</span>
<span data-as="p">GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are optimized for tool invocation, web browsing, software engineering, and front-end development. They can be integrated into code-centric agents such as Claude Code and Roo Code, and also support arbitrary agent applications through tool invocation APIs.</span>
<span data-as="p">Both models support hybrid reasoning modes, offering two execution modes: Thinking Mode for complex reasoning and tool usage, and Non-Thinking Mode for instant responses. These modes can be toggled via the <code>thinking.type</code>parameter (with <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> settings), and dynamic thinking is enabled by default.</span></p>

It combines advanced reasoning, coding, and agent capabilities within a single model, achieving a significant technological breakthrough by natively fusing reasoning, coding, and agent abilities to meet the complex demands of agent-based applications.</span>
<span data-as="p">To comprehensively evaluate the model’s general intelligence, we selected 12 of the most representative benchmark suites, including MMLU Pro, AIME24, MATH 500, SciCode, GPQA, HLE, LiveCodeBench, SWE-Bench, Terminal-bench, TAU-Bench, BFCL v3, and BrowseComp. Based on the aggregated average scores, GLM-4.5 ranks second globally among all models, first among domestic models, and first among open-source models.</span>

<p><span data-as="p">GLM-4.5 has half the number of parameters of DeepSeek-R1 and one-third that of Kimi-K2, yet it outperforms them on multiple standard benchmark tests. This is attributed to the higher parameter efficiency of GLM architecture. Notably, GLM-4.5-Air, with 106 billion total parameters and 12 billion active parameters, achieves a significant breakthrough—surpassing models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen3-235B, and Claude 4 Opus on reasoning benchmarks like Artificial Analysis, ranking among the top three domestic models in performance.</span>
<span data-as="p">On charts such as SWE-Bench Verified, the GLM-4.5 series lies on the Pareto frontier for performance-to-parameter ratio, demonstrating that at the same scale, the GLM-4.5 series delivers optimal performance.</span>

<p>Tesla has changed the meaning of “Full Self-Driving”, also known as “FSD”, to give up on its original promise of delivering unsupervised autonomy.</p>



<p>Since 2016, Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles in production would be capable of achieving unsupervised self-driving capability.</p>



<p>CEO Elon Musk has claimed that it would happen by the end of every year since 2018.</p>



<p>Tesla has even sold a software package, known as “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD), for up to $15,000 to customers, promising that the advanced driver-assist system would become fully autonomous through over-the-air software updates.</p>	
	



<p>Almost a decade later, the promise has yet to be fulfilled, and Tesla has already confirmed that all vehicles produced between 2016 and 2023 don’t have the proper hardware to deliver unsupervised self-driving as promised.</p>



<p>Musk has been discussing the upgrade of the computers in these vehicles to appease owners, but there’s no concrete plan to implement it.</p>



<p>While there’s no doubt that Tesla has promised unsupervised self-driving capabilities to FSD buyers between 2016 and 2023, the automaker has since updated its language and now only sells “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” to customers:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="630" height="694" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png 630w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=136,150 136w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=272,300 272w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=318,350 318w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=140,154 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=150,165 150w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"></figure>



<p>The fine print mentions that it doesn’t make the vehicle “autonomous” and doesn’t promise it as a feature. </p>



<p>In other words, people buying FSD today are not really buying the capability of unsupervised self-driving as prior buyers did.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Tesla’s board has just submitted <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-tsla-board-fully-loses-its-mind-and-offers-elon-musk-a-pay-package-worth-up-to-1-trillion/">a new</a><span><a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-tsla-board-fully-loses-its-mind-and-offers-elon-musk-a-pay-package-worth-up-to-1-trillion/" target="_blank">, unprecedented CEO compensation package for shareholders’ approval, which could give Musk up to $1 trillion</a>&nbsp;in stock options pending</span> the achievement of certain milestones.</p>



<p>One of these milestones is Tesla having “10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.”</p>



<p>At first glance, this would be hopeful for FSD buyers since part of Musk’s compensation would be dependent on delivering on the FSD promises.</p>



<p>However, Tesla has changed the definition of FSD in the compensation package with an extremely vague one”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“FSD” means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tesla now considers FSD only an “advanced driving system” that should be “capable of performing transportation tasks that prove autonomous or similar functionality”.</p>



<p>The current version of FSD, which requires constant supervising by the driver, could easily fit that description.</p>



<p>Therefore, FSD now doesn’t come with the inital promise of Tesla owners being able to go to sleep in their vehicles and wake up at their destination – a promise that Musk has used to sell Tesla vehicles for years.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>The way Tesla discusses autonomy with customers and investors versus how it presents it in its court filings and legally binding documents is strikingly different.</p>



<p>It should be worrying to anyone with an interest in this.</p>



<p>With this very vague description in the new CEO compensation package, Tesla could literally lower the price of FSD and even remove base Autopilot to push customers toward FSD and give Musk hundreds of billions of dollars in shares in the process.</p>




	<p>There’s precedent for Tesla decreasing pricing on FSD. Initially, Musk said that Tesla would gradually increase the price of the FSD package as the features improved and approached unsupervised autonomy.</p>



<p>That was true for a while, but then Tesla started slashing FSD prices, which are now down $7,000 from their high in 2023:</p>

<p>The trend is quite apparent and coincidentally began when Tesla’s sales started to decline.</p>



<p>FSD is now a simple ADAS system without any promise of unsupervised self-driving. This might quite honestly be one of the biggest cases of false advertising or bait-and-switch ever.</p>

This map shows all the star systems that lie within 12.5
light years of our Sun.  Most of the stars are red dwarfs - stars with a tenth of
the Sun's mass and less than one hundredth the luminosity.  Roughly eighty percent
of all the stars in the universe are red dwarfs, and the nearest star - Proxima - is
a typical example.

              <p>I just received an email from Google stating that they are no longer it's going to support the Nest 1st gen and 2nd gen thermostats. While they will continue to operate locally, it appears that they will no longer work with the Nest app or Home app controls. I currently use the Nest app to control the thermostats, but does this mean that we won't even be able to control the thermostats via a Hubitat integration?</p>

            <p>I got email too. WHat a bummer. It says the API will be removed, so my guess is unless someone comes up with a heck, there's no way to interact with the thermostat other than thru the physical dial.</p>

If you do buy it, be sure this will happen and more than less in the coming years, it's either this sh!t or the now ever so popular pay a monthly fee. YOU OWN NOTHING AND WE OWN YOU</p>

              <p>These replies are all really helpful, thank you! I just checked and I have 9 Gen 1 and 2 Nest thermostats, all of which I will need to replace if I want to control them remotely (which I do). Google have offered the Gen 4 thermostats for $150 each, but I don't want to be in the same position as I am now if Google stop supporting them in the future. Is this a concern, or are we saying that these Gen 4 thermostats will ALWAYS be able to be controlled via the Hubitat hub?  If not, what other thermostats do you all recommend that are more futureproof?</p>

<p>Yes, theoritically this - Assuming your using Matter as the interface protocol.  That said, I think the support for matter T-Stats is fairly limited, setpoints, on/off, mode, and current temps, that's about it.</p>
<p>But you should definitely read the following threads - There is a HE built in Googe Nest Thermostat driver available - But some questions to be considered are:</p>



<p>Hence my comment above about "the technically" are supported, but <a href="https://community.hubitat.com/u/bcopeland">@bcopeland</a> would have to weigh in on what works, and what's actually exposed on the matter side.  - But yes, after provisioning (setup), Matter is all local (so no Google cloud dependancy).  The second thread mentioned above, has a good screenshot at the top that shows what the Matter driver exposes.</p>
<p>Regardless, I would just buy 1 and test (with a site with a good return policy), before going "all in", but obviously, YMMV</p>

<p>If always having local control over your thermostat while maintaining full functionality while being able to control remotely I can't recommend enough getting the Ecobee thermostats and setting up an instance of Home Assistant on a RPi or a cheap second hand computer.</p>
<p>Then through the Homekit Device integration in HA you connect the Ecobee via the Homekit code.  (Just connect the Ecobee to your wifi first, not the Homekit app).</p>
<p>Then using the Home Assistant Device Bridge you can bring in any amount of entities you want of your thermostats into Hubitat and have full use of them.  You can write all your rules/automations in Hubitat.</p>
<p>Then if wifi support is dropped by Ecobee you will always have local control.  The benefit of this above matter is you will have every function you would have through the Ecobee app.  Unless you didn't bring them all over and that choice is yours.</p>

              <p>Thank you both! It looks as though the Nest integration is a bit messy/painful and could have limited functionality. I have Ecobee thermostats in another house and I haven't had any trouble with them, so while IMO they don't look as cool or feel as good as the Nest thermostats, it sounds as though they are currently more reliable.</p>
<p><a href="https://community.hubitat.com/u/aaiyar">@aaiyar</a> I have a Hubitat C8-Pro, but are you saying that I can't just pair the Ecobees with the Hubitat and I need to run a RaspberryPi to somehow connect the Ecobees to the Hubitat? I'm afraid I don't have the time right now to play around with it and just need thermostats that can connect to and be controlled by the Hubitat.</p>
<p>EDIT: this article appears to say I can just connect the Ecobees directly to the Hubitat: <a href="https://docs2.hubitat.com/en/apps/ecobee-integration" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ecobee Integration | Hubitat Documentation</a></p>

            <p>Ah thanks. So I could run the ecobee thermostats with the cloud integration for now and then in a few years time if ecobee stop supporting the cloud integration then I could run a local instance of HA and still be able to control my thermostats via habita?</p>

            <p>Having been burned by Google on their Nest Secure and Nest Protect offerings, I fear it is only a matter of time before they end of life their Nest 3rd generation thermostat. So I have already been researching it's replacement.  Take a look at Go Control z-wave thermostat. Looks promising and it is natively supported in Hubitat.  Plus we won't be bugged by Google into ceeding our autonomy to the utility company over the environmental settings.  I have not which it why they bug me about it.  Do not believe Google about being always being able to override their remote adjustments. A lesson I learned by reading complaints from users in California. Seems the state declared a grid emergency so commanded participant devices to set to much higher cooling temperatures. Ok fine but also locked out any ability to change it back. A "feature" Google never mentions and a permanent deal breaker for me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>It started out harmlessly, a comment on hacker news roughly 16 years ago. </p><p>From there it expanded to reddit, substack, twitter. And it increased in frequency, from every few months to every week, peaking at several times a day. It became an addictive, productive habit—I would scan the headlines for a catchy title, quickly skim the piece, and then race to the comment section and type one out. </p><p>Sometimes the comments were insightful or funny. At other times, curt or nitpicky. It was an exercise of logic, of ideation, of debate. It was a mix of disdain, delight and discourse. But mostly it was just a fun time. </p><p>Being an active commenter felt like being an internet socialite, part of an elite society of people who put their voice out there instead of lurked. And my fellow internet socialites responded in turn. Some upvoted, responded, debated. Some liked what I said, some hated it. A few of my comments made it to the top and became a fountain of dopamine. A few comments made it to the very bottom too. </p><p>That can happen with 16 years of commenting history. </p><p>I’ve benefited incredibly from commenting. It has sharpened both my writing and logic. It has developed my voice. It has trained me in debate. It has unleashed personas that I would otherwise never become—teacher, supporter, economist, historian, debater, and of course, troll. </p><p>It has made me a (mostly) better person. But I cannot shake the conviction that I need to leave commenting for good.</p><p>Why? Well, I’ve been reflecting on what I want out of the internet (as part of a larger reflection of what I want out of life). I’ve always enjoyed the internet as the frontier of  “new”—its where I find novel ideas, content, thoughts, personalities, achievements and craft. But with the rise of doom scrolling, media echo chambers, AI, and my age, “new” is no longer that exciting. I find myself less satisfied browsing the internet, hoping the next thing I consume to be actually high quality, and I’m realizing that I’d rather just spend my time with a good set of quality friends. </p><p>Unfortunately, this is where comment culture comes in. 16 years of commenting has made me zero friends. </p><p>That scares me. All of that social activity with zero ROI. At first, I thought that I needed to change my commenting habits, and, you know, try to make connections. But the more I considered how to make friends in comment culture, the more I realized that it wasn’t just my own social ineptitude. Comment culture has a problem. Systemically, it produces an internet of strangers.</p><p>Now, making friends in real life is not easy and it doesn’t get easier over time. The social steps of growing your friend pool involve 1) meeting new people, 2) turning strangers into acquantainces, and 3) turning acquantainces into friends. This takes a surprising amount of volume and time. </p><p>Various estimates of lifetime human acquantainces range from 10,000 to 80,000 people, but actual friendships number only in the hundreds, and that’s being generous. And the number of close friends is on average, only 3-5. So, meeting strangers and turning them into close friends is a rather rare occurence that involves a serious investment of focused social energy, something that is harder to do the older you get. One study showed that in order to form a close friendship, you need to spend 200 hours of interaction time with one person. So, making 5 close friends is a 1000 hour investment, equal to a full time job for half a year. </p><p>Comment culture requires your social energy. It’s an interaction with another human being, but one that doesn’t head towards building relationships. Instead, the end result is gaining reputation, fame, and of course, internet points.</p><p>This isn’t a bad thing; besides close friends, the other spend of social energy is towards reputation and influence, especially in small communities. But in comment culture, each post is its own communal space of random strangers. It is the illusion of small community, but really the community appears and dissappears with every new post. Outside of a handful of celebrities or moderators, I rarely find myself spotting someone I know in the comments. </p><p>The end result is that comment culture is a series of one-offs with anonymous strangers upvoting you or responding to you, but never befriending you. In comment culture, you are talking to a random sampling of everybody, which is in itself a collective nobody.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the online platforms we use are not built for connection; they are built for engagement. This is universally true for all internet spaces, from stories to newsfeeds, for the intellectual and the plebian alike. And in the relentless optimization of user engagement, our social engagement is captured and rerouted from its original purpose. Instead of making friends, we are all performing for one collective internet stranger—a being that is sometimes brilliant, sometimes cruel, but always waiting to be impressed.</p><p>It somehow feels like interactions that might have grown a friendship have instead ended up growing ad impressions. This is not strictly true, but I can’t shake the feeling that it isn’t wrong either.</p><p>So this is where I say goodbye to my fellow comment writing socialites. I might miss you a bit, but you will not miss me, because you don’t even know me. I'm a stranger, and you, dear reader, are likely a stranger too. </p><p>Where do I go instead? Well, as long as engagement makes money, the pressure will always be there, from forces far bigger than us, to pull our social instincts out into the open forum where they can be measured, tracked, and sold. This isn’t a problem with comments or our internet spaces. Its a problem of market forces.</p><p>But as long as we want to make and keep good friends, that itself is its own driving force. It’s what drives us to gather a group of people around a campfire. It revives LAN parties from the childhood days. It creates those long chains of memes sent to the few that truly appreciate them. It builds its own spaces not bound to one platform or another, but bound to the people know, care for, and love.</p><p>But… knowing me, I’ll probably be on Discord.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        <p><strong>“It’s always DNS” is a famous meme among network people. Name resolution is technically quite simple. It’s “just” translating a hostname like <code>jan.wildeboer.net</code> to an IP address. What could possibly go wrong? I am a radical optimist and detail-obsessed knowledge collector, so I decided to find out. As part of my goal to make my home network a little island of Digital Sovereignty, meaning that everything at home should JustWork™, even with no working internet connection, a DNS server is needed.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on and extended from my gist <a href="https://codeberg.org/jwildeboer/gists/src/branch/main/2025/20250826DNSHomelabBind9.md">Bind on Fedora 42 as DNS server</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit, I have a lot of experience with DNS and BIND. But I still consider myself to be merely on the GoodEnough™ side of things. I know how to get DNS configured for my domains. And I want you to feel fearless too. The best place to fail with DNS is the network at home. It limits the impact :)</p>

<p>So read this blog post either as report or as a HOWTO. Both ways can be fun!</p>

<p>In my homelab I have a Raspberry Pi 4 that runs infrastructure services. DNS is one of them, my private CA (Certificate Authority) another. The CA runs as a container on Podman. For DNS I use Bind. It thus has to serve 3 networks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>192.168.1.0/24</code> My home IPv4 network</li>
  <li><code>172.16.0.0/16</code> IPv4 Network on the second ethernet ports of my homelab servers</li>
  <li><code>10.88.0.0/16</code> The (virtual) podman network</li>
</ul>

<p>It uses my Fritz box (7490) as forwarder, so I can resolve all hosts, including the DHCP entries that the Fritz Box hands out under its default local domain name <code>fritz.box</code>. For my homelab however, I use the <code>homelab.jhw</code> domain name. That’s what the Bind DNS server has to take care of.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WARNING</strong> <br>
I really should use the official <code>.internal</code> TLD (Top Level Domain) for my homelab network, but I decided against it. This introduces the risk of name resolution problems, should someone offer a public <code>.jhw</code> TLD in future. It’s a risk I am willing to accept in exchange for using a 3 letter TLD at home. Don’t be like me! Use <code>.internal</code> instead. With that out of the way, let’s continue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-we-well-i-have">What we (well, I) have</h2>

<p>Let’s gather what I have in my home network.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>inf01.homelab.jhw</code> at <code>192.168.1.10</code>: A Raspberry Pi 4 4GB, running Fedora 42 and podman with my Certificate Authority as a container that should be reachable as <code>ca.homelab.jhw</code>.

<h2 id="lets-install-bind-on-inf01">Let’s install BIND on inf01</h2>

<p>We need to do two things. Install BIND and some utilities on <code>inf01</code> and open the firewall for DNS traffic.</p>

<div><pre><code>dnf install bind bind-utils
firewall-cmd --add-service=dns --permanent
</code></pre></div>

<p>That was easy enough :)</p>

<h3 id="configure-bind">Configure BIND</h3>

<p>To run BIND in the correct way, we need to work on 3 configuration files.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/etc/named.conf</code> The main configuration file where we tell BIND on which networks it should listen and what zones it will serve.</li>
  <li><code>/var/named/forward.homelab.jhw</code> The forward zone file that maps hostnames in the <code>homelab.jhw</code> domain to IP addresses on my home network</li>
  <li><code>/var/named/reverse.homelab.jhw</code> The reverse zone for the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> network range, that looks a bit confusing, that does the opposite. It maps IP addresses to hostnames.</li>
  <li><code>/var/named/reverse2.homelab.jhw</code> The second reverse zone for the <code>172.16.0.0/16</code> network range.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s start with <code>/etc/named.conf</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>//
// named.conf

  listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.10; 172.16.1.10; 10.88.0.1; };

</code></pre></div>

<p>The first block declare the general options. Yes, it looks complicated and it is, but let’s walk you through every relevant line (the lines not mentioned are default entries that don’t need to be changed).</p>

<div><pre><code>listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.10; 172.16.1.10; 10.88.0.1; };
listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; fdda:a4da:69a5:0:2783:8c26:b2f1:a6f7; };
allow-query     { localhost; 192.168.1.0/24; 172.16.0.0/16; 10.88.0.0/16; };
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we tell BIND that it should listen for queries on port 53 on <code>localhost</code>, <code>192.168.1.10</code>, the IPv4 address in my hoem network, <code>172.16.1.10</code>, the second IPv4 address configured and <code>10.88.0.1</code>, the virtual IPv4 address the Raspberry uses to bridge to the local podman containers.</p>

<p>The second line does the same for IPv6, but that is something we will discuss in Part 2.</p>

<p>The third line tells BIND from whom to accept queries. Essentially from everyone on the three IPv4 networks we are listening to.</p>



<p>This is the directory where BIND will look for its zone files, that we will define later.</p>

<div><pre><code>forwarders { 192.168.1.254; };
recursion yes;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now what if someone asks for a hostname that is outside of <code>homelab.jhw</code>? In that case we tell BIND to forward that question to <code>192.168.1.254</code>, our Fritz Box. We will allow recursion and cache results we get from our Fritz box to avoid unneeded traffic.</p>



<p>Our simple setup will not bother with DNSSEC at the moment. Maybe we will have a Part 3 for that.</p>

<p>OK. That was the options part. We will ignore the <code>logging</code> part and the <code>zone "." IN</code> block.</p>

<p>Next (and finally) we define three zone entries (and zone files). A forward zone called <code>homelab.jhw</code> for our domain and two reverse zones for the IP addresses in the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> range called <code>1.168.192.in-addr.arpa</code>. Yep. That’s 192.168.1 reversed. 1.168.192. That’s why it’s called the reverse zone ;) We also have <code>16.172.in-addr.arpa</code> for the <code>172.16.0.0/16</code> range. Let’s look at them.</p>

<div><pre><code>zone "homelab.jhw" IN {
	type master;
	file "forward.homelab.jhw";
	allow-update { none; };
	allow-query { any; };
};
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s a zone, all right. It’s the <code>master</code> for this zone, meaning that this DNS server will be the Source of Truth to  answer all queries for the <code>homelab.jhw</code> hostnames.</p>

<p>The exact mapping of all hostnames to IP addresses is in a file called <code>forward.homelab.jhw</code> in the directory <code>/var/named</code>. Remember how we defined that path at the beginning in the <code>options</code> part? Great! We also tell BIND that we do not allow dynamic updates for this zone, meaning that what’s in the file is all we will look at. Finally we tell BIND that any machine in the network is allowed to ask for a reply.</p>

<div><pre><code>zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
	type master;
	file "reverse.homelab.jhw";
	allow-update { none; };
	allow-query { any; };
};

zone "16.172.in-addr.arpa" IN {
        type master;
        file "reverse2.homelab.jhw";
        allow-update { none; };
        allow-query { any; };
};
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reverse zones with the weird looking zone names are almost the same, except that we define these in two files called <code>reverse.homelab.jhw</code> for the reverse lookup of the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> range and <code>reverse2.homelab.jhw</code> for the <code>172.16.0.0/16</code> range. Why these zones have weird names will be explained later.</p>

<p>So now we go to the zone files!</p>

<h3 id="forward-zone-for-homelabjhw">Forward zone for homelab.jhw</h3>

<p>The forward zone resolves names to IP addresses using A records (and other types like TXT, CAA and many more exist, but we won’t cover that in this post). It also contains CNAME entries, if you have services on one machine that should be reachable via more than one hostnames. In my homelab the CA (Certificate Authority) server is a container that runs on <code>inf01.homelab.jhw</code>, but should be reachable as <code>ca.homelab.jhw</code> in the home network. The CNAME entry does exactly that. It tells clients that when they want to talk to <code>ca.homelab.jhw</code> they can. By actually talking to <code>inf01.homelab.jhw</code>.</p>

<p>Now here is the big, important lessen for zone files. They have a serial number. Which MUST be incremented with every change. If you don’t, weird things WILL happen. So:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NEVER FORGET TO INCREASE THE SERIAL WITH EVERY CHANGE TO A ZONE FILE. OR RISK DNS HELL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>/var/named/forward.homelab.jhw</code></p>

<div><pre><code>$TTL 3600
@   IN  SOA     inf01.homelab.jhw. root.homelab.jhw. (
        2025082706  ;Serial
        3600        ;Refresh
        1800        ;Retry
        604800      ;Expire
        86400       ;Minimum TTL
)
@       IN  NS          inf01.homelab.jhw.
@       IN  A           192.168.1.10

inf01           IN  A     192.168.1.10
hl01            IN  A     192.168.1.11
hl02            IN  A     192.168.1.12
hl03            IN  A     192.168.1.13

ca              IN  CNAME inf01.homelab.jhw.

inf01-m         IN  A     172.16.1.10
hl01-m          IN  A     172.16.1.11
hl02-m          IN  A     172.16.1.12
hl03-m          IN  A     172.16.1.13
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, let’s go through this.</p>



<p>The default Time To Live (TTL) for DNS entries is set at 3600 seconds. That’s 1 hour. This means that when a machine in the network gets a DNS reply, it will not ask again for the same thing until the TTL has passed.</p>

<div><pre><code>@   IN  SOA     inf01.homelab.jhw. root.homelab.jhw. (
        2025082706  ;Serial
        3600        ;Refresh
        1800        ;Retry
        604800      ;Expire
        86400       ;Minimum TTL
)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The Start Of Authority (SOA) block. Here we say which DNS server is the owner of this domain. It’s <code>inf01.homelab.jhw.</code> (yes, that dot at the end is REALLY important). The <code>root.homelab.jhw</code> actually means <code>root@homelab.jhw</code> and is the email address responsible for this domain. Don’t think to much about why and what :)</p>

<div><pre><code>@       IN  NS          inf01.homelab.jhw.
@       IN  A           192.168.1.10
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first “real” DNS entries! They are special, as the <code>@</code> indicates, which means they represent the domain itself. We first define the nameserver (again? yes, don*‘t ask) as NS record. And right after that we define the <code>A</code> record as the IP address <code>192.168.1.10</code>.</p>

<p>Did you notice that <code>.</code> at the end of <code>inf01.homelab.jhw.</code>? That’s another VERY important thing. The TL;DR is that this final <code>.</code> tells DNS to stop doing fancy recursion and lookups. Just look for the hostname `inf01.homelab.jhw. Period. (pun intended). Don’t care too much about this. Just remember:</p>

<p><strong>EVERY HOSTNAME RECORD ENDS WITH A <code>.</code> YOU WILL FORGET THIS. YOU WILL FIX THIS.</strong></p>

<div><pre><code>inf01           IN  A     192.168.1.10
hl01            IN  A     192.168.1.11
hl02            IN  A     192.168.1.12
hl03            IN  A     192.168.1.13
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here come the <code>A</code> records for <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>! We finally get to map hostnames to IP addresses. For real! It now is quite self-explanatory, isn’t it? The hostname gets an A record that is the IP address in my local network. And as these are IP addresses, no <code>.</code> is needed at the end.</p>

<div><pre><code>ca              IN  CNAME inf01.homelab.jhw.
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here is the CNAME record. Which maps the hostname <code>ca.homelab.jhw</code> to the Canonical NAME (CNAME) <code>inf01.homelab.jhw.</code>. This is a hostname at the end! So it needs the <code>.</code> Period :)</p>

<div><pre><code>inf01-m         IN  A     172.16.1.10
hl01-m          IN  A     172.16.1.11
hl02-m          IN  A     172.16.1.12
hl03-m          IN  A     172.16.1.13
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here we create another set of <code>A</code> records for the same machines, but this time in the <code>172.16.0.0/16</code> range. This range is used for management stuff, hence the <code>-m</code>.</p>

<p>And that’s the gist of it. If you add a new machine to your network, configure it with an IP address (statically or with DHCP) and add it as an A record to the forward zone. Increment the serial and tell DNS to read the updated zone with <code>systemctl reload named</code>. Done.</p>

<h3 id="reverse-zones-for-1921681024-and-172160016">Reverse zones for 192.168.1.0/24 and 172.16.0.0/16</h3>

<p>The reverse zone maps IP addresses to hostnames. Often called the PTR or pointer record. You have to make sure that the entries here are synced to the forward zone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NEVER FORGET TO INCREASE THE SERIAL WITH EVERY CHANGE TO A ZONE FILE. Or risk DNS hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the reverse zone for the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> range.</p>

<p><code>/var/named/reverse.homelab.jhw</code></p>

<div><pre><code>$TTL 3600
@   IN  SOA     inf01.homelab.jhw. root.homelab.jhw. (
        2025082601  ;Serial
        3600        ;Refresh
        1800        ;Retry
        604800      ;Expire
        86400       ;Minimum TTL
)
@       IN  NS          inf01.homelab.jhw.
@       IN  PTR         homelab.jhw.
10      IN  PTR         inf01.homelab.jhw.
11      IN  PTR         hl01.homelab.jhw.
12      IN  PTR         hl02.homelab.jhw.
13      IN  PTR         hl03.homelab.jhw.
</code></pre></div>

<p>As this is more or less the same but the other way round, I will not go through everything but instead explain the differences. It’s the reverse zone, so now we have <code>PTR</code> (pointer) entries that map an IPv4 address in the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> range to hostnames. WITH A DOT AT THE END. DO NOT FORGET THE DOT!</p>

<p>As this is a /24 block, we only need to set the last digit of the IPv4 address.</p>

<p>You might wonder, where is <code>ca</code> here? Well, it’s CNAME is <code>info1.homelab.jhw</code> and that already is in this reverse zone. That is good enough. No separate entry needed.</p>

<p>We also need the reverse zone for the <code>172.16.0.0/16</code> range:</p>

<p><code>/var/named/reverse2.homelab.jhw</code></p>

<div><pre><code>$TTL 3600
@   IN  SOA     inf01.homelab.jhw. root.homelab.jhw. (
        2025082901  ;Serial
        3600        ;Refresh
        1800        ;Retry
        604800      ;Expire
        86400       ;Minimum TTL
)
@       IN  NS          inf01.homelab.jhw.
@       IN  PTR         homelab.jhw.
10.1      IN  PTR         inf01-m.homelab.jhw.
11.1      IN  PTR         hl01-m.homelab.jhw.
12.1      IN  PTR         hl02-m.homelab.jhw.
13.1      IN  PTR         hl03-m.homelab.jhw.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks deceivingly similar. But there is a big difference. This is a /16 network, so we have to define the last two parts of the IPv4 address. And as it is a reverse zone file, yep, we have to reverse it. So now we need <code>10.1</code> to define the entry for <code>172.16.1.10</code>, which is the hostname <code>inf01-m.homelab.jhw</code>. WITH THE DOT AT THE END. AND DID YOU UPDATE THE SERIAL? :)</p>

<p>Phew. That’s the config done!</p>

<p>A final check with the <code>named-checkconf</code> command, which should say nothing when all files are OK. If not, it will tell you what is wrong so you get the chance to fix stuff. You did add all the <code>.</code> at the end of hostnames and you did update the serial of that zone file after you made changes, yes?</p>

<h2 id="start-bind">Start Bind</h2>

<p>The only thing remaining is to start BIND. And persist it as a service, so it starts after every boot. It’s DNS. It must always be available.</p>

<div><pre><code>systemctl <span>enable </span>named
systemctl start named
</code></pre></div>

<p>You most likely will make typos in your config. So do check with <code>named-checkconf </code> and <code>systemctl status named</code> and <code>journalctl -u named</code>. If something breaks, read this whole entry again. Find that missing <code>.</code> in a zone file. Increment the <code>serial</code> that you forgot to do. You will get there. Don’t give up!</p>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<p>Machines, containers etc can now be resolved in my home network. All with mow own DNS! Yay!</p>

<div><pre><code>% nslookup jhwfritz.fritz.box
Server:		192.168.1.10
Address:	192.168.1.10#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	jhwfritz.fritz.box
Address: 192.168.1.254

% nslookup ca.homelab.jhw    
Server:		192.168.1.10
Address:	192.168.1.10#53

ca.homelab.jhw	canonical name <span>=</span> inf01.homelab.jhw.
Name:	inf01.homelab.jhw
Address: 192.168.1.10
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now you should be able to <code>ping</code> the machines with their hostname. ssh into them. Get certificates with the CA that runs in the podman container. Life is good!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>
            Recently I’ve been on a small campaign to try to make my personal website more… personal. Little ways to
            make it obvious it’s <em>mine</em> and <em>personal</em>, not just another piece of the boring corporate
            dystopia that is most of the web these days. I don’t quite want to fully regress to the Geocities era and
            fill the screen with animated under construction GIFs, but I do want to capture some of that vibe.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d added some bits and pieces along those lines: floating images in articles now look like they’re stuck to
            the page with sellotape, related post links have a wavy border that animates when you hover over them, and
            so on. Next, I wanted to change the heading fonts from a monospace font to something cursive, to resemble
            handwriting. Less terminal output, more handwritten letter. I couldn’t find one I liked, though. So why not
            make my own? It can’t be that hard, right?
          </p>
          <h3>Failing to do it myself</h3>
          <p>
            I set out to try to make the font myself using open source tools. After doing a bit of research, it seemed
            like the general approach was to create vectors of each character and then import them into a font editor.
            That seems to mean either Adobe Illustrator and FontLab (if you have too much money) or Inkscape and
            FontForge (if you like open source). I fall firmly into the latter category, so I grabbed my graphics tablet
            and opened Inkscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote out my first three letters: capital A, B and C. Saved them in Inkscape, and attempted to import them
            into FontForge. Then I remembered one crucial thing that had slipped my mind: I absolutely loathe using
            FontForge. It’s a bit like when you open an old version of GIMP and get a bunch of weird looking windows
            floating all over the place; it feels like you’re fighting against the tool to do even the most basic
            operations. The difference is I have cause to edit images a <em>lot</em> more than I edit fonts, and GIMP
            has actually significantly improved their UI over the years.
          </p>
          <p>Here are the rough steps I went through with FontForge:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Launch Font Forge. It shows a weird bit of art in one window, and an open file dialog in another.</li>
            <li>I don’t want to open a file, so I close that dialog. The program exits.</li>
            <li>Relaunch Font Forge, and realise that within the “Open Font” dialog is a “New” button. Click it.</li>
            <li>
              Get to the standard font-editing UI. Right-click on the “A” looking for a way to import an SVG. Don’t see
              one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Click around a bit, exploring the menus. Everything feels a bit off. You can’t open one menu then hover
              over the next to see its content, like basically every UI toolkit in existence. I think FontForge has
              eschewed QT and GTK in favour of doing things itself.
            </li>
            <li>Find the “Import” option in the File menu. Hope it’s for a single glyph not the whole font.</li>
            <li>
              A file picker opens. Again it’s all a bit off from normal desktop conventions. Try to resize it, and just
              get blank gray space at the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Type the absolute path I want to go to in the text field.</li>
            <li>Get a dialog saying “Not a bdf file /home/chris/etc”. Press OK.</li>
            <li>Get a dialog saying “Could not find a bitmap font in”. Press OK.</li>
            <li>
              Press Ctrl+L to see if that lets me enter a path. Click everything in the dialog to try to find a way to
              enter a path. Get annoyed. Give up. Click through folder-by-folder to get to where I want to be.
            </li>
            <li>
              Get to the folder and don’t see any files. Change the format to “SVG”. Double-click the newly-visible SVG
              file.
            </li>
            <li>Get a dialog saying “You must select a glyph before you can import an image into it”. Press OK.</li>
            <li>The import dialog goes away, having not imported.</li>
            <li>Select the glyph in the main tool area, then repeat the File→Import dance.</li>
            <li>
              It’s actually there now! Open the glyph in the editor and see it’s a complete mess of Bézier curves. I
              can’t click what I want without accidentally moving a handle for an adjacent curve.
            </li>
            <li>Rage-quit.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I’m sure FontForge is less anger inducing once you’re used to it. And you definitely could use it to build a
            font like this if you had much more patience than me. I’d had enough of death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts
            though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I briefly tried Inkscape’s built-in support for making an SVG font. It annoyed me a lot less, but it’s
            fiddly: it seemed like each font had to be a single path, so you had to convert the glyphs to paths, then
            merge them correctly. If you merge them incorrectly then the wrong bits of your letters end up filled (like
            the inside of the ‘B’). Path manipulation is getting towards the limit of my knowledge of vector editing,
            and it took a bit of trial and error for each letter that had more than a single stroke. I didn’t fancy
            doing that for every letter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m usually a big advocate of open source, but this was one of those painful times where it feels like it
            just falls short. Clunky, painful UI and processes where commercial tools just let you get on with your
            work.
          </p>
          <h3>You can exchange money for goods and services</h3>
          <p>
            When I’d been looking for open source tutorials, I found many mentions of a closed source, hosted tool:
            <a href="https://www.calligraphr.com/en/">Calligraphr</a>. It has a free version with limitations (no
            ligatures, no variations, 75 glyphs per font), and a pro version for £8/month. I’d normally balk at the idea
            of a subscription for this, but they have the perfect answer: you can make a one-time payment, and your
            account automatically downgrades back to free after a month. It’s not a hidden option, either, it’s the most
            prominent button on the upgrade page. That made me happy to give them £8 to play around with the service for
            a month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calligraphr works by having you print templates, write out the letters, then scan them in. It does some
            magical processing to extract the glyphs, provides tools to tidy them up, align them, etc, and then produces
            a TTF file for you. You can see some of my completed templates here:

            </picture>
            <figcaption>Most of the templates I used for the font</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Calligraphr has a nice UI to generate the templates, allowing you to select which glyphs to include. I added
            the “minimal English”, “basic punctuation” and “Ligatures” sets. That gave me four pages to fill out, and I
            did them all twice. That let me filter out versions that didn’t work well, and have variants for some
            letters so the font wasn’t too repetitive. Later on, I went back and added some custom ligatures based on
            blog post titles that didn’t look quite right: “Re”, “To”, “ers”, “ey”, “hy”, “ra”, “re” and “ty”. Ligatures
            like this help it look more natural: when we write we don’t just stamp out identical letters regardless of
            their surroundings, instead they will connect to their neighbours, or overlap slightly, or even share a
            stroke.
          </p>
          <p>
            I filled these templates in with a Sharpie, as I wanted a fairly informal, scrap-booky look, and it would
            also give good solid shapes that should be easy to pick out of the template. I scanned them with the “Scan
            Document” function on my iPhone, and uploaded the PDFs to Calligraphr.
          </p>
          <h3>Iterating and tweaking</h3>
          <p>
            The Calligraphr UI allows you to preview the font, but I found it a lot more useful to just download a copy
            and use it on a local copy of my website. That let me test it with real text, and see how it’d look at the
            different font sizes I use on the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version was not great. Despite the guidelines on the template, I apparently wasn’t good at
            sticking to them. Some letters were floating way off the baseline, and some were sunken below. When those
            opposites met it looked terrible. Fortunately Calligraphr has a pretty easy tool to slide each letter up and
            down, and scale it up or down if needed, and you can see it next to other letters as you do it. It took a
            little bit of time to go through all the variants of all the letters, but the next version looked a lot
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another tweak I ended up doing was reducing the spacing between letters. The defaults Calligraphr uses are
            probably good for a blocky font, but I wanted to put the letters close together to give it more of a
            joined-up look. Again, this is an easy tool to use, you just drag the sides in or out as desired. While
            these tweaking steps were probably as fiddly as some of the Inkscape steps I refused to do earlier, they’re
            a lot more rewarding as you see things improving with each one. It’s a lot easier for me to commit time and
            effort to improving something that’s already working reasonably, than put that time and energy into an
            unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, I noticed that occasionally there would be a huge gap in a title. Not “the kerning is slightly off”
            but “there’s enough room to park a bus”. It took me a while to figure out what was happening: a couple of
            glyphs hadn’t been isolated perfectly and had picked up a few pixels from the template lines at the edge of
            their boxes. That meant the glyph had a width that covered the actual written glyph, a big gap, and then the
            rogue marks. At first, I fixed this by just adjusting the width, but that left the little pixels floating
            awkwardly down-sentence. The proper fix was to use the editing tool and simply delete them, and then
            Calligraphr snapped the width back to what it should be.
          </p>
          <p>
            These iterations took a while to do, but I just dipped in and out occasionally over the course of a week, so
            it didn’t actually feel like too much work. I quite enjoy the process of refining things, too.
          </p>
          <h3>Result and a surprise</h3>
          <p>
            If you’re viewing this post on my website<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, you can see the font in the headers, captions, and a few other places. Here’s how it compares to my
            actual handwriting:
          </p>
          <figure>

            </picture>
            <figcaption>My handwriting vs my handwriting font</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            It’s not close enough to forge documents, but I think it definitely gets across my style, and that’s exactly
            what I wanted. It’s surprisingly legible even at smaller font sizes — I think the weight of the Sharpie
            helps here — and at £8 and a bit of manual work was a lot more economical than spending days wresting with
            open source tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few weeks after I put the finishing touches on the font, I got an e-mail from Calligraphr. As my account
            had lapsed back to the free version, I was no longer eligible for the “server-side backup” feature. So what
            did they do? They e-mailed me an exported copy! It’s a JSON file with the properties of each glyph and a
            base64 encoded image. Not only can I re-upload this to Calligraphr if I resubscribe, I can probably hook
            something up to edit it should I ever need to. I’m blown away by how pro-user Calligraphr’s business
            practices are. They’re up-front about pricing, don’t try and get you stuck on an auto-renewing subscription,
            and automatically export your data. It’s like a breath of fresh air compared to the barrage of dark patterns
            that other websites foist on us. If you want to make this kind of font, I’d definitely recommend them just
            because of how <em>nice</em> they are.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://laist.com/news/transportation/guardrails-aluminum-theft">https://laist.com/news/transportation/guardrails-aluminum-theft</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45140786">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        
                                            
                                        

                                        

                                        <p>On a recent Thursday evening, traffic was slow on the 10 Freeway as cars crawled into the downtown Los Angeles area. It was an average commute back to Pasadena for Bryan Gonzalez until he saw a man on the other side of the freeway cutting through a guardrail with a reciprocating saw.</p><p>“OK, there's something weird going on,” Gonzalez said about his observations from Aug. 21, which he captured on video and reported to Caltrans. “I was debating whether or not saying anything, but I said, ‘Hey, I'm in slow traffic. He has a saw. No, thank you.’”</p>

<p>What Gonzalez observed was not a fluke. Guardrail theft is a problem that has been on the rise for the last eight years, according to the local Caltrans office covering L.A. and Ventura counties. Over the last two years, the state transportation agency has spent more than $62,000 on repairs related to guardrail theft in the region.</p>

<p>The man who appeared to be trying to steal the guardrail apparently didn’t succeed. A photo Gonzalez shared with LAist the following week shows an intact guardrail with a mark where the saw was used.</p><p>California Highway Patrol, whose jurisdiction includes state-owned highways, said it’s investigating the incident. A spokesperson for the agency said it hasn’t found the man in the video.</p><p>Aluminum, which Caltrans’ guardrails are made from, is just one metal used in public infrastructure that is increasingly stolen and sold to metal scrapyards and recyclers.</p>


<h2>Missing guardrails</h2><p>Over the last several months since he’s been commuting to work in Culver City, Gonzalez said he’s noticed guardrailing disappearing on the 10 Freeway near the 110 Freeway interchange.</p><p>“I was just equating it to normal wear and tear of accidents and the guardrailing doing what it's supposed to do,” Gonzalez said.</p>

<p>When he saw the man with the saw, Gonzalez said the dots began to connect.</p>

<p>A statement from Caltrans calls guardrail theft an “ongoing” problem in downtown L.A. that causes safety issues for drivers. More specifically, the state transportation agency said there has been “a marked increase in rail theft” along a stretch of the 10 Freeway between Santa Fe Avenue and the 110 interchange.</p><p>Nearly 470 sections of guardrailing were stolen in the last fiscal year alone in L.A. and Ventura counties, costing the state transportation agency $17,000 to replace, the agency said.</p><p>Guardrail theft spiked in 2023 after <a href="https://laist.com/news/transportation/the-10-is-closed-downtown-due-to-huge-pallet-yard-fire" data-cms-ai="0">an arsonist set fire to a storage yard</a> beneath the 10 Freeway. Caltrans said it spent $45,000 on repairs in the 2023-24 fiscal year.</p><p>Google Map Street View images from May 2024 near the San Pedro Street and Central Avenue ramps leading to the 10 Freeway in downtown show additional sections of missing guardrails.</p>



<p>To prevent thefts, Caltrans said it tried welding bolts into the guardrails, but thieves were able to breach that deterrent.</p><p>The next step the agency is considering is using fiberglass composite instead of aluminum to construct guard rails “to remove the value to the thieves.”<br></p>
<h2>The value of aluminum</h2><p>Aluminum is critical to transportation infrastructure, said Lance Hastings, the president and CEO of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.</p><p>“Like most base metals, the price of aluminum has increased in recent years,” Hastings said. “Tariffs further disrupt the global supply chain, driving up costs and creating market instability.”</p><p>President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earlier this summer. In August, the Department of Commerce announced that hundreds of other “derivative” steel and aluminum products would also be <a href="https://media.bis.gov/press-release/department-commerce-adds-407-product-categories-steel-aluminum-tariffs" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>subject to tariffs.</u></a><br></p>
<h2>Metal theft</h2><p>Metal theft in L.A. is a persistent problem that damages telecom, lighting, train and other critical infrastructure. It also hamstrings government agencies, which, as a result of increasing thefts, say they're unable to keep up with repairs.</p>

<p>The head of the L.A.’s street lighting department told LAist earlier this year that copper wire theft <a href="https://laist.com/news/transportation/street-light-repair-plan" data-cms-ai="0">causes 40% of all repairs</a><a href="https://laist.com/news/transportation/street-light-repair-plan" data-cms-ai="0">, </a>up from a quarter just two years ago.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, 60 feet of copper cable was stolen from a portion of the track that services L.A. Metro’s A-line train, resulting in reduced service for about 16 hours, according to a statement from the countywide transportation agency.</p><p>Ally Happel, an executive at security company ECAM, said thieves will target any materials that are “accessible and easy to sell at a high price.”</p><p>ECAM uses AI surveillance systems to “detect and predict suspicious activity.” It has partnered with Foothill Transit, as well as the L.A. Police Department and port police.</p><p>Bronze, brass, iron, lead and steel are also “vulnerable to theft,” Happel said.</p><p>It’s not just an L.A. problem. Nearly a third of all copper theft and telecom infrastructure vandalism nationwide happened in California, <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-holds-roundtable-northern-california-combat-copper-wire" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>according to state Attorney General Rob Bonta.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>It’s unclear what the LAPD is doing to address the problem for metal stolen from city infrastructure. The department disbanded its metal theft detail six years ago, <a href="https://www.lapdpolicecom.lacity.org/042324/BPC_24-075.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to a report</a> it delivered to City Council last year.</p><p>There were at least two LAPD metal theft task forces funded by council offices that were active last year. It’s unclear if they still exist.</p><p>LAPD has not responded to LAist’s repeated questions about the continued existence of those task forces and whether there has been more recent metal theft enforcement actions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I’ve spent a good deal of my professional life arguing against using protobuffers. They’re clearly written by amateurs, unbelievably ad-hoc, mired in gotchas, tricky to compile, and solve a problem that nobody but Google really has. If these problems of protobuffers remained quarantined in serialization abstractions, my complaints would end there. But unfortunately, the bad design of protobuffers is so persuasive that these problems manage to leak their way into your code as well.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hoc-and-built-by-amateurs">Ad-Hoc and Built By Amateurs</h2>
<p>Stop. Put away your email client that is half-way through writing me about how “Google is filled with the world’s best engineers,” and that “anything they build is, by definition, not built by amateurs.” I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>Let’s just get this out of the way. Full disclosure: I used to work at Google. It was the first (but unfortunately, not the last) place I ever used protobuffers. All of the problems I want to talk about today exist inside of Google’s codebase; it’s not just a matter of “using protobuffers wrong” or some such nonsense like that.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest problem with protobuffers is their terrible type-system. Fans of Java should feel right at home with protobuffers, but unfortunately, literally nobody considers Java to have a well-designed type-system. The dynamic typing guys complain about it being too stifling, while the static typing guys like me complain about it being too stifling without giving you any of the things you actually want in a type-system. Lose lose.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc-ness and the built-by-amateurs-itude go hand-in-hand. So much of the protobuffer spec feels bolted on as an afterthought that it clearly <em>was</em> bolted on as an afterthought. Many of its restrictions will make you stop, scratch your head and ask “wat?” But these are just symptoms of the deeper answer, which is this:</p>
<p>Protobuffers were obviously built by amateurs because they offer <em>bad solutions to widely-known and already-solved problems.</em></p>
<h3 id="no-compositionality">No Compositionality</h3>
<p>Protobuffers offer several “features”, but none of them see to work with one another. For example, look at the list of orthogonal-yet-constrained typing features that I found by skimming the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">documentation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> fields have dedicated syntax for their keys and values, but this isn’t used for any other types.</li>
<li>Despite <code>map</code> fields being able to be parameterized, no user-defined types can be. This means you’ll be stuck hand-rolling your own specializations of common data structures.</li>
<li><code>map</code> fields cannot be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map</code> keys <em>can</em> be <code>string</code>s, but <em>can not</em> be <code>bytes</code>. They also can’t be <code>enum</code>s, even though <code>enum</code>s are considered to be equivalent to integers everywhere else in the protobuffer spec.</li>
<li><code>map</code> values cannot be other <code>map</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>This insane list of restrictions is the result of unprincipled design choices and bolting on features after the fact. For example, <code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code> because rather than resulting in a coproduct type, instead the code generator will give you a product of mutually-exclusive optional fields. Such a transformation is only valid for a singular field (and, as we’ll see later, not even then.)</p>
<p>The restriction behind <code>map</code> fields being unable to be <code>repeated</code> is related, but shows off a different limitation of the type-system. Behind the scenes, a <code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> is desugared into something spiritually similar to <code>repeated Pair&lt;k,v&gt;</code>. And because <code>repeated</code> is a magical language keyword rather than a type in its own right, it doesn’t compose with itself.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine for why an <code>enum</code> can’t be used as a <code>map</code> key.</p>
<p>What’s so frustrating about all of this is a little understanding of how modern type-systems work would be enough to <em>drastically simplify</em> the protobuffer spec and simultaneously <em>remove all of the arbitrary restrictions.</em></p>
<p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all fields in a message <code>required</code>. This makes messages <em>product types</em>.</li>
<li>Promote <code>oneof</code> fields to instead be standalone data types. These are <em>coproduct types</em>.</li>
<li>Give the ability to parameterize product and coproduct types by other types.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! These three features are all you need in order to define any possible piece of data. With these simpler pieces, we can re-implement the rest of the protobuffer spec in terms of them.</p>
<p>For example, we can rebuild <code>optional</code> fields:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">product Unit <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>// no fields</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">coproduct Optional<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">  t    value <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">  Unit unset <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Building <code>repeated</code> fields is simple too:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">coproduct List<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">  Unit empty <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">  Pair<span>&lt;</span>t<span>,</span> List<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;&gt;</span> cons <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the actual serialization logic is allowed to do something smarter than pushing linked-lists across the network—after all, <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/follow-the-denotation/">implementations and semantics don’t need to align one-to-one</a>.</p>
<h3 id="questionable-choices">Questionable Choices</h3>
<p>In the vein of Java, protobuffers make the distinction between <em>scalar</em> types and <em>message</em> types. Scalars correspond more-or-less to machine primitives—things like <code>int32</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>string</code>. Messages, on the other hand, are everything else. All library- and user-defined types are messages.</p>
<p>The two varieties of types have completely different semantics, of course.</p>
<p>Fields with scalar types are always present. Even if you don’t set them. Did I mention that (at least in proto3<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) all protobuffers can be zero-initialized with absolutely no data in them? Scalar fields get false-y values—<code>uint32</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> for example, and <code>string</code> is initialized as <code>""</code>.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to differentiate a field that was missing in a protobuffer from one that was assigned to the default value. Presumably this decision is in place in order to allow for an optimization of not needing to send default scalar values over the wire. Presumably, though the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding guide</a> makes no mention of this optimization being performed, so your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we discuss protobuffers’ claim to being god’s gift to backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs, this inability to distinguish between unset and default values is a nightmare. Especially if indeed it’s a design decision made in order to save one bit (set or not) per field.</p>
<p>Contrast this behavior against message types. While scalar fields are dumb, the behavior for message fields is outright <em>insane.</em> Internally, message fields are either there or they’re not—but their behavior is crazy. Some pseudocode for their accessor is worth a thousand words. Pretend this is Java or something similar:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>private</span> Foo m_foo<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>public</span> Foo foo <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">  <span>// only if `foo` is used as an expression</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5">  get <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>m_foo <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7">      <span>return</span> m_foo<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8">    <span>else</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9">      <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span></span>
<span id="cb3-10">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb3-11"></span>
<span id="cb3-12">  <span>// instead if `foo` is used as an lvalue</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13">  mutable get <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14">    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>m_foo <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb3-15">      m_foo <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span></span>
<span id="cb3-16">    <span>return</span> m_foo<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-17">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb3-18"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea is that if the <code>foo</code> field is unset, you’ll see a default-initialized copy whenever you ask for it, but won’t actually modify its container. But if you modify <code>foo</code>, it will modify its parent as well! All of this just to avoid using a <code>Maybe Foo</code> type and the associated “headaches” of the nuance behind needing to figure out what an unset value should mean.</p>
<p>This behavior is especially egregious, because it breaks a law! We’d expect the assignment <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code> to be a no-op. Instead the implementation will actually silently change <code>msg</code> to have a zero-initialized copy of <code>foo</code> if it previously didn’t have one.</p>
<p>Unlike scalar fields, at least it’s possible to detect if a message field is unset. Language bindings for protobuffers offer something along the lines of a generated <code>bool has_foo()</code> method. In the frequent case of copying a message field from one proto to another, iff it was present, you’ll need to write the following code:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>if</span> <span>(</span>src<span>.</span>has_foo<span>(</span>src<span>))</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">  dst<span>.</span>set_foo<span>(</span>src<span>.</span>foo<span>());</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that, at least in statically-typed languages, this pattern <em>cannot be abstracted</em> due to the nominal relationship between the methods <code>foo()</code>, <code>set_foo()</code> and <code>has_foo()</code>. Because all of these functions are their own <em>identifiers</em>, we have no means of programmatically generating them, save for a preprocessor macro:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>#define COPY_IFF_SET</span><span>(</span>src<span>,</span><span> </span>dst<span>,</span><span> </span>field<span>)</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span>src<span>.</span><span>has_</span><span>##</span>field<span>(</span>src<span>))</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>  </span>dst<span>.</span><span>set_</span><span>##</span>field<span>(</span>src<span>.</span>field<span>());</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>

<p>(but preprocessor macros are verboten by the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros">Google style guide</a>.)</p>
<p>If instead all optional fields were implemented as <code>Maybe</code>s, you’d get abstract-able, referentially transparent call-sites for free.</p>
<p>To change tack, let’s talk about another questionable decision. While you can define <code>oneof</code> fields in protobuffers, their semantics are <em>not</em> of coproduct types! Rookie mistake my dudes! What you get instead is an optional field for each case of the <code>oneof</code>, and magic code in the setters that will just unset any other case if this one is set.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems like it should be semantically equivalent to having a proper union type. But instead it is an accursed, unutterable source of bugs! When this behavior teams up with the law-breaking implementation of <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code>, it allows this benign-looking assignment to silently delete arbitrary amounts of data!</p>
<p>What this means at the end of the day is that <code>oneof</code> fields do not form law-abiding <code>Prism</code>s, nor do messages form law-abiding <code>Lens</code>es. Which is to say good luck trying to write bug-free, non-trivial manipulations of protobuffers. It is <em>literally impossible to write generic, bug-free, polymorphic code over protobuffers.</em></p>
<p>That’s not the sort of thing anybody likes to hear, let alone those of us who have grown to love parametric polymorphism—which gives us the <em>exact opposite promise.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lie-of-backwards--and-forwards-compatibility">The Lie of Backwards- and Forwards-Compatibility</h2>
<p>One of the frequently cited killer features of protobuffers is their “hassle-free ability to write backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs.” This is the claim that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p>
<p>What protobuffers are is <em>permissive.</em> They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up and serve you something that typechecks, regardless of whether or not it’s meaningful.</p>
<p>This means that protobuffers achieve their promised time-traveling compatibility guarantees by <em>silently doing the wrong thing by default.</em> Of course, the cautious programmer can (and should) write code that performs sanity checks on received protobuffers. But if at every use-site you need to write defensive checks ensuring your data is sane, maybe that just means your deserialization step was too permissive. All you’ve managed to do is decentralize sanity-checking logic from a well-defined boundary and push the responsibility of doing it throughout your entire codebase.</p>
<p>One possible argument here is that protobuffers will hold onto any information present in a message that they don’t understand. In principle this means that it’s nondestructive to route a message through an intermediary that doesn’t understand this version of its schema. Surely that’s a win, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Granted, on paper it’s a cool feature. But I’ve never once seen an application that will actually preserve that property. With the one exception of routing software, nothing wants to inspect only some bits of a message and then forward it on unchanged. The vast majority of programs that operate on protobuffers will decode one, transform it into another, and send it somewhere else. Alas, these transformations are bespoke and coded by hand. And hand-coded transformations from one protobuffer to another don’t preserve unknown fields between the two, because it’s literally meaningless.</p>
<p>This pervasive attitude towards protobuffers always being compatible rears its head in other ugly ways. Style guides for protobuffers actively advocate against DRY and suggest inlining definitions whenever possible. The reasoning behind this is that it allows you to evolve messages separately if these definitions diverge in the future. To emphasize that point, the suggestion is to fly in the face of 60 years’ worth of good programming practice just in case <em>maybe</em> one day in the future you need to change something.</p>
<p>At the root of the problem is that Google conflates the meaning of data with its physical representation. When you’re at Google scale, this sort of thing probably makes sense. After all, they have an internal tool that allows you to compare the finances behind programmer hours vs network utilization vs the cost to store <span>\(x\)</span> bytes vs all sorts of other things. Unlike most companies in the tech space, paying engineers is one of Google’s smallest expenses. Financially it makes sense for them to waste programmers’ time in order to shave off a few bytes.</p>
<p>Outside of the top five tech companies, none of us is within five orders of magnitude of being Google scale. Your startup <em>cannot afford</em> to waste engineer hours on shaving off bytes. But shaving off bytes and wasting programmers’ time in the process is exactly what protobuffers are optimized for.</p>
<p>Let’s face it. You are not Google scale and you never will be. Stop cargo-culting technology just because “Google uses it” and therefore “it’s an industry best-practice.”</p>
<h2 id="protobuffers-contaminate-codebases">Protobuffers Contaminate Codebases</h2>
<p>If it were possible to restrict protobuffer usage to network-boundaries I wouldn’t be nearly as hard on it as a technology. Unfortunately, while there are a few solutions in principle, none of them is good enough to actually be used in real software.</p>
<p>Protobuffers correspond to the data you want to send over the wire, which is often <em>related</em> but not <em>identical</em> to the actual data the application would like to work with. This puts us in the uncomfortable position of needing to choose between one of three bad alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Maintain a separate type that describes the data you actually want, and ensure that the two evolve simultaneously.</li>
<li>Pack rich data into the wire format for application use.</li>
<li>Derive rich information every time you need it from a terse wire format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 is clearly the “right” solution, but its untenable with protobuffers. The language isn’t powerful enough to encode types that can perform double-duty as both wire and application formats. Which means you’d need to write a completely separate datatype, evolve it synchronously with the protobuffer, and <em>explicitly write serialization code between the two.</em> Seeing as most people seem to use protobuffers in order to not write serialization code, this is obviously never going to happen.</p>
<p>Instead, code that uses protobuffers allows them to proliferate throughout the codebase. True story, my main project at Google was a compiler that took “programs” written in one variety of protobuffer, and spit out an equivalent “program” in another. Both the input and output formats were expressive enough that maintaining proper parallel C++ versions of them could never possibly work. As a result, my code was unable to take advantage of any of the rich techniques we’ve discovered for writing compilers, because protobuffer data (and resulting code-gen) is simply too rigid to do anything interesting.</p>
<p>The result is that a thing that could have been 50 lines of <a href="https://github.com/passy/awesome-recursion-schemes">recursion schemes</a> was instead 10,000 lines of ad-hoc buffer-shuffling. The code I wanted to write was literally impossible when constrained by having protobuffers in the mix.</p>
<p>While this is an anecdote, it’s not in isolation. By virtue of their rigid code-generation, manifestations of protobuffers in languages are never idiomatic, nor can they be made to be—short of rewriting the code-generator.</p>
<p>But even then, you still have the problem of needing to embed a shitty type-system into the targeted language. Because most of protobuffers’ features are ill-conceived, these unsavory properties leak into our codebases. It means we’re forced to not only implement, but also use these bad ideas in any project which hopes to interface with protobuffers.</p>
<p>While it’s easy to implement inane things out of a solid foundation, going the other direction is challenging at best and the dark path of Eldrich madness at worst.</p>
<p>In short, abandon all hope ye who introduce protobuffers into your projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When done right, animations make an interface feel predictable, faster, and more enjoyable to use. They help you and your product stand out.</p>
<p>But they can also do the opposite. They can make an interface feel unpredictable, slow, and annoying. They can even make your users lose trust in your product.</p>
<p>So how do you know <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> to animate to improve the experience?</p>
<p>Step one is making sure your animations have a purpose.</p>
<a href="#purposeful-animations"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M10 19.0004L9.82843 19.1719C8.26634 20.734 5.73368 20.734 4.17158 19.1719L3.82843 18.8288C2.26634 17.2667 2.26633 14.734 3.82843 13.1719L7.17158 9.8288C8.73368 8.2667 11.2663 8.2667 12.8284 9.8288L13.1716 10.1719C13.8252 10.8256 14.2053 11.6491 14.312 12.5004" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M9.68799 12.5004C9.79463 13.3516 10.1748 14.1752 10.8284 14.8288L11.1715 15.1719C12.7336 16.734 15.2663 16.734 16.8284 15.1719L20.1715 11.8288C21.7336 10.2667 21.7336 7.73404 20.1715 6.17194L19.8284 5.8288C18.2663 4.2667 15.7336 4.2667 14.1715 5.8288L14 6.00037" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><h2 id="purposeful-animations">Purposeful animations</h2></a>
<p>Before you start animating, ask yourself: what’s the purpose of this animation? <br>As an example, what’s the purpose of this marketing animation we built at Linear?</p>

<p>This animation explains how Product Intelligence (Linear’s feature) works. We could have used a static asset, but the animated version helps the user understand what this feature does, straight in the initial viewport of the page.</p>
<p>Another purposeful animation is this subtle scale down effect when pressing a button. It’s a small thing, but it helps the interface feel more alive and responsive.</p>

<p>Sonner’s enter animation, on the other hand, has two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>-</span> <!-- -->Having a toast suddenly appear would feel off, so we animate it in.</li>
<li><span>-</span> <!-- -->Because it comes from and leaves in the same direction, it creates spatial consistency, making the swipe-down-to-dismiss gesture feel more intuitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>But sometimes the purpose of an animation might just be to bring delight.</p>
<p>Morphing of the feedback component below helps make the experience more unique and memorable. This works as long as the user will rarely interact with it. It’ll then become a pleasant surprise, rather than a daily annoyance.</p>
<div><p>Press on the button to see it morph.</p></div>
<p>Used multiple times a day, this component would quickly become irritating. The initial delight would fade and the animation would slow users down.</p>
<p>How often users will see an animation is a key factor in deciding whether to animate or not. Let’s dive deeper into it next.</p>

<p>I use Raycast hundreds of times a day. If it animated every time I opened it, it would be <em>very</em> annoying. But there’s no animation at all. That’s the optimal experience.</p>
<p>To see it for yourself, try to toggle the open state of the menu below by <span>using the buttons below</span><span>pressing <code>J</code> and then <code>K</code></span>. Which one feels better if used hundreds of times a day?</p>

<p>When I open Raycast, I have a clear goal in mind. I don’t expect to be “delighted”, I don’t need to be. I just want to do my work with no unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>Think about what the user wants to achieve and how often they will see an animation. A hover effect is nice, but if used multiple times a day, it would likely benefit the most from having no animation at all.</p>
<p><span><div><p>Imagine you interact with this list often during the day.</p></div></span>
<span><div><p>Imagine you interact with this list often during the day.</p></div></span></p><p>The same goes for keyboard-initiated actions.

<p><span><p>Since we can’t really use a keyboard on touch devices, you can press the buttons below to see how it feels with and without animation.</p></span>

<p>But even if your animation won’t be used too often and it fulfills a clear purpose, you still have to think about its speed…</p>

<p>Unless you are working on marketing sites, your animations <em>have</em> to be fast. They improve the perceived performance of your app, stay connected to user’s actions, and make the interface feel as if it’s truly listening to the user.</p>
<p>To give you an example, a faster-spinning spinner makes the app seem to load faster, even though the load time is the same. This improves perceived performance.</p>
<div><p>Which one works harder to load the data?</p></div>
<p>A <code>180ms</code> dropdown animation feels more responsive than a <code>400ms</code> one:</p>
<div><p>Click on the buttons to compare the speed.</p></div>
<p>As a rule of thumb, UI animations should generally stay under <code>300ms</code>.</p>
<p>Another example of the importance of speed: tooltips should have a slight delay before appearing to prevent accidental activation. Once a tooltip is open however, hovering over other tooltips should open them with no delay and no animation.</p>

<p>The goal is not to animate for animation’s sake, it’s to build great user interfaces. The ones that users will happily use, even on a daily basis. Sometimes this requires animations, but sometimes the best animation is no animation.</p>
