It's a calculated strategic repositioning that reveals how the company thinks about the next decade of human-computer interaction. While the design community debates readability and the tech press focuses on the absence of major AI announcements, Apple is quietly executing a playbook that should feel familiar to anyone who remembers the iPhone's introduction: prepare users for a paradigm shift by making the transition feel inevitable.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg" width="1456" height="646" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:646,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:70738,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://omc345.substack.com/i/165857187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e2f7588-0138-4dd4-9762-4b2987cc095b_2048x908.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This isn't Apple's first rodeo with controversial design changes. The move from skeuomorphic design in iOS 6 to the stark minimalism of iOS 7 sparked similar debates about usability and aesthetic merit. Critics lambasted the "too thin" fonts and complained about reduced affordances (the visual cues that tell users what they can interact with). Yet within two years, the entire industry had adopted flat design principles, from Google's Material Design to Microsoft's Metro language.</p><p>The pattern is instructive: Apple doesn't just change design for aesthetic reasons. Each major visual overhaul has preceded a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology. Skeuomorphic design made sense when touchscreens were new and users needed familiar metaphors (buttons that looked like physical buttons, bookshelves that looked like real shelves). Flat design emerged when users had internalized touch interactions and no longer needed heavy visual scaffolding.</p><p>Now, with Liquid Glass, Apple is preparing users for a world where the screen itself becomes less relevant.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:822860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://omc345.substack.com/i/165857187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d35776c-72b1-4cbb-be69-09eb0efd7fbf_4096x2305.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The timing isn't coincidental. Apple explicitly credits visionOS as the inspiration for Liquid Glass, and for good reason. In augmented reality, interface elements must coexist with the physical world. They can't be opaque rectangles that block your view. They need to be translucent, layered, and contextually aware. As Alan Dye noted during the visionOS introduction, "every element was crafted to have a sense of physicality: they have dimension, respond dynamically to light, and cast shadows."</p><p>This isn't just about making interfaces prettier. In AR, visual affordances work differently. A button that casts realistic shadows and responds to virtual lighting feels more "real" when floating in your living room than a flat, colored rectangle. The glass metaphor makes intuitive sense when you're literally looking through a device at the world around you.</p><p>By introducing these concepts on traditional screens first, Apple is doing what it does best: making the unfamiliar feel familiar. When users eventually put on AR glasses, the interface paradigms won't feel foreign. The translucent panels, the layered depth, the environmental responsiveness will all feel like a natural extension of what they already know from their iPhone.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg" width="1179" height="879" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:879,&quot;width&quot;:1179,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:160126,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://omc345.substack.com/i/165857187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25b2b8d2-5e6e-40e1-b7a2-fa64e291d548_1179x879.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This design shift also plays to Apple's core strategic advantage: vertical integration. Liquid Glass isn't just a visual flourish. It's a technical showcase that demonstrates the tight coupling between Apple's hardware and software. The real-time blurs, dynamic transparency effects, and contextual lighting require serious GPU horsepower and optimized rendering pipelines. It's the kind of feature that runs silky smooth on an iPhone with Apple Silicon but might stutter on competing hardware.</p><p>This creates what economists call a "complementary good" effect. The new design language makes Apple's hardware more valuable by showcasing capabilities that competitors can't easily match. It's similar to how Retina displays created a virtuous cycle: high-resolution screens made iOS look better, which drove demand for Apple devices, which justified the cost of those expensive displays.</p><p>The unified design language across all Apple platforms (from Apple TV to Vision Pro) reinforces this advantage. Developers can design once and trust that the visual language will work consistently across the ecosystem. Users experience cognitive continuity when switching between devices. These network effects are incredibly difficult for competitors to replicate without controlling both hardware and software.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png" width="980" height="551" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:980,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:442181,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://omc345.substack.com/i/165857187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa6b9b8-610f-40d2-807e-f10e2ea8d4dd_980x551.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>While the tech press fixated on Apple's relatively quiet AI story at WWDC 2025, the company was executing a more subtle strategy. Rather than engaging in the current LLM arms race (where it's demonstrably behind), Apple doubled down on what it does best: creating compelling user experiences through design and integration.</p><p>This mirrors Apple's historical approach to new technologies. They're rarely first to market, but they're often first to market with a polished, integrated experience. They didn't invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smartwatch, but they defined what those categories could be.</p><p>The same pattern appears to be playing out with AI. While competitors race to stuff large language models into everything, Apple is taking a more measured approach. The Liquid Glass design language actually creates opportunities for more contextual AI interactions. Imagine smart suggestions that appear as translucent overlays, or AI-generated content that floats naturally over your existing workflow. The glass metaphor provides a visual framework for AI that feels ambient rather than intrusive.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png" width="1320" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:1320,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:345813,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://omc345.substack.com/i/165857187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d313e7d-5fb3-407e-9ac4-49158b70ce8e_1500x750.webp&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcb558b-acc2-48d6-b9f3-bf7086a00b8e_1320x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Of course, every design decision involves tradeoffs. Early feedback on Liquid Glass has raised legitimate concerns about readability and cognitive load. Translucent interfaces can reduce contrast and make text harder to read. The "glass" metaphor can be confusing on a touchscreen, where users directly manipulate elements rather than looking through them.</p><p>But Apple has navigated these challenges before. iOS 7's initial release had similar problems: ultra-thin fonts that were hard to read, blue text links that didn't look clickable, animations that made some users motion sick. Apple responded with gradual refinements: thicker fonts, higher contrast, optional accessibility settings, and more obvious interactive elements.</p><p>The same evolution will likely happen with Liquid Glass. Apple has historically been responsive to accessibility concerns, and they've already provided settings like "Reduce Transparency" and "Increase Contrast" in previous iOS versions. The company can afford to start with a bold vision and refine based on feedback, especially when that vision serves larger strategic goals.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Liquid Glass creates what Paul Graham would recognize as a network effect in design language. When Apple changes direction, it doesn't just affect Apple. It influences the entire industry. Developers building for iOS will adopt the new design patterns. Designers at other companies will create similar aesthetics to stay current. Web designers will implement glassmorphism effects to match user expectations set by their phones.</p><p>This industry influence multiplies Apple's strategic advantage. Even users of non-Apple devices will encounter Apple-influenced design patterns, making the eventual transition to Apple products feel more natural. It's a form of cultural lock-in that extends far beyond Apple's direct ecosystem.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg" width="720" height="536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:536,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:55343,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://omc345.substack.com/i/165857187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6f724b-13d3-4944-91ca-f451ea4df9ea_720x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e325ea9-76e4-4fd1-bc2f-6cbbce5cb7d9_720x536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The introduction of Liquid Glass reveals Apple's theory about the future of computing: we're moving toward ambient, spatial interfaces that blend digital and physical reality. Touch will remain important, but it won't be the primary interaction model forever. Voice, gesture, and contextual awareness will play larger roles.</p><p>By establishing the visual and conceptual framework now, Apple is preparing both users and developers for this transition. When lightweight AR glasses eventually become mainstream (whether in two years or ten), the interface paradigms will already feel familiar.</p><p>This is strategic design thinking at its finest: using aesthetic choices to enable future product categories while strengthening current competitive advantages. It's the kind of long-term planning that has made Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, and it suggests they're not content to rest on the iPhone's success.</p><p>The real question isn't whether Liquid Glass will succeed aesthetically. Apple's design changes always face initial resistance. The question is whether Apple can execute the broader vision it represents: a seamless transition from touch-first to spatial-first computing, with Apple's integrated ecosystem at the center.</p><p>If history is any guide, we'll all be using glass-like interfaces within five years, wondering how we ever lived without them.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

I was the HP Chief Technology Officer who led the technical due diligence on Palm. I presented to Mark Hurd and the HP board, making the case for moving forward with the acquisition. I believed we were buying the future of mobile computing.</p><p>Then I watched it all fall apart from the worst possible vantage point—lying in bed during a eight-week recovery, helpless to intervene as everything I'd worked to build got dismantled in real time.</p><p>This is the story of how smart people destroyed $1.2 billion in innovation value in just 49 days. It's about the brutal personal cost of being blamed for a disaster that happened while you're recovering from surgery. And it's about why I still believe in HP despite everything that went wrong.</p><p>In early 2010, HP was desperately seeking mobile platform capabilities. We knew the computing world was shifting toward mobile, and our traditional PC business faced real threats from tablets and smartphones. We needed to be there.</p><p>Palm was struggling financially, but they possessed something genuinely special in WebOS—true multitasking when iOS and Android couldn't handle it, elegant user interface design, and breakthrough technology architecture buried inside a failing business.</p><p>As CTO, I led the technical due diligence process. I spent weeks embedded with the Palm engineering team in Sunnyvale, crawling through their code base, understanding their platform architecture, and assessing the quality of their technical talent. The deeper I dug, the more convinced I became that this wasn't just another mobile operating system.</p><p>My conclusion was unambiguous: WebOS represented a breakthrough platform technology that could differentiate HP in the emerging mobile computing market. The technology was solid. The team was exceptional. The platform vision was compelling.</p><p>I presented this assessment to Mark Hurd and the board with complete conviction. This wasn't about buying a struggling phone company—it was our strategic entry into the future of computing platforms. I believed every word of my presentation because I had seen the technology's potential firsthand.</p><p>The board agreed with my recommendation. In April 2010, we announced the $1.2 billion acquisition. I felt proud of the technical work we'd done and excited about what we could build together.</p><p>After the acquisition closed in July 2010, my role shifted to helping the Palm team leverage HP's massive capabilities. We had global manufacturing scale, established supply chain relationships, and a consumer and enterprise customer base that Palm had never been able to access as an independent company.</p><p>I spent countless hours working with the Palm leadership team, mapping out integration plans and identifying strategic synergies. We discussed how WebOS could expand beyond smartphones into tablets, potentially integrate with HP's PC platforms, and even find applications in our printer ecosystem.</p><p>Everything seemed aligned for success. </p><p>Then life intervened in the worst possible way.</p><p>Everything seemed aligned for success until the first disaster struck. In August 2010—just one month after we closed the Palm acquisition—Mark Hurd was forced to resign as CEO. The board replaced him with Leo Apotheker, former CEO of SAP, who brought a completely different strategic vision to HP.</p><p>Apotheker's plan was radical: transform HP from a hardware company into a software and services company, similar to IBM's transformation years earlier. He wanted to exit or minimize HP's hardware businesses—PCs, printers, and by extension, mobile devices like the TouchPad. In his mind, WebOS represented exactly the kind of hardware distraction he wanted to eliminate.</p><p>I assumed the strategic rationale for the acquisition remained sound despite the leadership change. The technology hadn't changed. The market opportunity was still there. But I was wrong about the continuity of strategic vision.</p><p>Then, in late June 2011, life intervened in the worst possible way. I faced a medical emergency requiring immediate surgery and a eight-week recovery period confined to bed. You don't schedule medical emergencies—and I had to step away from my integration work with Palm just as the most critical decisions were being made about the platform's future.</p><p>While I was recovering at home, unable to participate in meetings or provide strategic input, the entire mobile computing landscape at HP began to unravel.</p><p>On July 1, 2011, HP launched the TouchPad tablet running WebOS 3.0. I watched the launch from my bed, hoping to see the culmination of all our technical work and strategic planning. Instead, I witnessed the beginning of one of the fastest product failures in tech history.</p><p>The launch was botched from the start. HP priced the TouchPad at $499 to compete directly with the iPad, but without the app ecosystem or marketing muscle to justify that premium. The device felt rushed to market, lacking the polish that could have helped it compete. Consumer reviews were mixed at best.</p><p>Initial sales numbers were devastating: HP sold only 25,000 TouchPads out of 270,000 units shipped to retailers. While Apple was selling 9 million iPads that same quarter, TouchPads were gathering dust on store shelves.</p><p>Then came the announcement that changed everything.</p><p>On August 18, 2011—just 49 days after the TouchPad launch—HP announced it would discontinue all WebOS devices immediately. I was still confined to bed, watching my technical due diligence work and strategic recommendations get dismantled in real time through news reports and industry analysis.</p><p>Forty-nine days. That's not enough time to fix launch problems, build developer momentum, or establish retail partnerships. Platform businesses typically need 18-24 months to demonstrate real market traction. But Leo Apotheker wasn't thinking about platform timelines—he was thinking about his software transformation strategy.</p><p>The most painful part wasn't just the speed of the decision, but learning that Apotheker had made the discontinuation choice without even informing the Palm team beforehand. According to multiple reports, he seemed eager to kill off a product that didn't fit his vision of HP as a software company.</p><p>I felt helpless. Betrayed. And somehow, I was responsible for not being there to fight for what I knew was breakthrough technology.</p><p>My first day back at HP will be burned into my memory forever. I was simply trying to grab lunch in the cafeteria at HP Labs when I found myself surrounded by what felt like the entire technical staff. They weren't there to welcome me back—they were there to hold me accountable.</p><p>The scene was intense and unambiguous. Engineers and researchers who had watched the WebOS disaster unfold were pointing fingers and raising voices. Their message was crystal clear and brutal: "You can never take leave again—EVER!"</p><p>Their exact words still echo in my mind: "The CEO and board need adult supervision."</p><p>Think about the implications of that statement. HP's own technical staff, the people closest to our innovation work, believed that senior leadership couldn't be trusted to make sound technology decisions without someone there to provide oversight and guidance.</p><p>They weren't wrong. The numbers proved it in the most painful way possible.</p><p>But hearing it directed at me personally—being blamed for not providing "adult supervision" while I was recovering from surgery—was devastating. I had recommended the acquisition based on solid technical analysis. I had worked to integrate the teams and technology. But because I wasn't there during the critical 49 days when the decision was made to kill WebOS, somehow the failure became my responsibility.</p><p>Standing in that cafeteria, listening to my colleagues blame me for not being there to prevent the disaster, I realized the fundamental problem wasn't my absence. It was a systematic mismatch between Leo Apotheker's experience and the role he was asked to fill.</p><p>SAP's annual revenue while Leo served as its CEO was approximately $15 billion. The HP board hired a CEO whose largest organizational experience was running a company smaller than HP's smallest division. Based purely on revenue management experience, Apotheker wouldn't have qualified to be a Executive Vice President at HP, yet the board put him in charge of a $125 billion technology company.</p><p>This wasn't just a cultural mismatch—it was a fundamental scale and complexity mismatch that should have been immediately obvious to any functioning board. But nobody asked the right questions about whether Leo's enterprise software background prepared him to evaluate consumer platform technologies such as WebOS, and I wasn't there to provide what my colleagues called "adult supervision."</p><p>When I decided to “retire” from HP, they offered me a separation bonus—a significant financial package that would have made my transition easier. But there was a catch: accepting it would have restricted what I could say publicly about my experiences at the company.</p><p>I refused.</p><p>I've spent my career believing that the truth about innovation decisions—both successes and failures—should be shared so others can learn from them. Taking money to stay quiet about systematic thinking errors that destroyed breakthrough technology felt like betraying everything I believed about how innovation should work.</p><p>The decision cost me financially, but it preserved my ability to tell stories like this one. Stories that might help other leaders avoid similar disasters.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: The following reflects my personal investment decisions and relationship with HP leadership. This is not financial advice, and you should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.</em></p><p>Here's what might surprise you: I haven't sold a single HP share since leaving the company. Despite watching the WebOS disaster unfold, despite being blamed for not preventing it, despite everything that went wrong during that period, I still believe in HP as an organization.</p><p>I take every opportunity to remind Enrique Lores, HP's current CEO, and Antonio Neri, CEO of HPE, about this fact. Both men were peers of mine when I was at HP. We worked closely together as part of the leadership team that made HP #1 in market share for consumer and commercial PCs &amp; laptops, printers, and servers—helping drive HP to Fortune #11 during that period. They are natural leaders who understand HP's culture and values from the inside, having come up through the organization rather than being parachuted in from outside.</p><p>Enrique and Antonio represent what HP is at its best: technical excellence combined with strategic thinking, innovation grounded in operational discipline, and leadership that understands both the technology and the business. They're the kind of leaders who would have asked different questions about WebOS, who would have applied better decision frameworks to evaluate platform technology under uncertainty.</p><p>My continued shareholding isn't just a matter of financial confidence—it's a statement of faith in what HP can become when the right leadership applies systematic thinking to innovation decisions.</p><p>The WebOS failure taught me something fundamental about innovation decisions that I hadn't fully understood before: intelligence and good intentions don't predict decision quality. Systematic thinking frameworks do.</p><p>Leo Apotheker wasn't stupid. The HP board wasn't incompetent. The financial analysts weren't malicious. But they all used flawed thinking frameworks to evaluate breakthrough technology under pressure, and those systematic errors destroyed $1.2 billion in innovation value.</p><p>The thinking errors were predictable and preventable:</p><p><strong>Solving the wrong problem.</strong><span> Apotheker was asking "How do I transform HP into a software company?" when the right question was "How do we build sustainable competitive advantage in mobile computing platforms?" His entire strategic framework was about exiting hardware businesses, not building platform advantages.</span></p><p><strong>Identity-driven decision making.</strong><span> His background at SAP shaped his entire approach to HP's portfolio. He saw WebOS as a hardware distraction from his software transformation vision.</span></p><p><strong>Tunnel vision under pressure.</strong><span> During this same period, he became laser-focused on acquiring Autonomy for $10.3 billion—a software company that fit his transformation vision perfectly. Everything else, including breakthrough mobile technology, felt like a distraction from this software-focused strategy. That Autonomy acquisition later required more than an $8 billion write-down, but at the time it consumed all of leadership's attention.</span></p><p><strong>Timeline compression under stress.</strong><span> Forty-nine days isn't enough time to fairly evaluate platform technology, but pressure to show decisive leadership compressed the decision timeline artificially.</span></p><p>These errors weren't unique to HP or to Apotheker. I've seen identical patterns across multiple companies and industries. Brilliant engineers kill breakthrough prototypes because they don't fit current product roadmaps. Marketing teams reject game-changing concepts because they can't explain them using existing frameworks. CEOs avoid platform investments because the path to profitability isn't immediately clear.</p><p>Lying in bed during those eight weeks, watching the WebOS disaster unfold while being powerless to intervene, I first performed an autopsy of how we got to such a bad decision. Was there a framework that could have led to better decisions? That analysis eventually became a systematic approach to innovation decisions that could prevent these predictable errors.</p><p>The framework that emerged from this painful experience is something I call DECIDE—a systematic thinking process specifically designed for innovation decisions under uncertainty:</p><p><strong>D</strong><span>efine the real decision (not just the obvious question)</span><br><strong>E</strong><span>xamine your thinking process for cognitive biases</span><br><strong>C</strong><span>hallenge your assumptions systematically</span><br><strong>I</strong><span>dentify decision traps specific to innovation contexts</span><br><strong>D</strong><span>esign multiple genuinely different options</span><br><strong>E</strong><span>valuate with evidence frameworks appropriate for breakthrough technology</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/philmckinney/p/download-your-decide-framework-how?r=3rtha&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Download the DECIDE Framework &amp; Toolkit&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/philmckinney/p/download-your-decide-framework-how?r=3rtha&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true" rel=""><span>Download the DECIDE Framework &amp; Toolkit</span></a></p><p>This isn't theoretical academic stuff. It's a practical framework born from watching smart people make systematic thinking errors that destroyed breakthrough technology value. It's designed to prevent the specific cognitive errors that killed WebOS and continue to kill innovation investments across industries.</p><p><span>Next Wednesday (6/11/2025) , I'll walk you through exactly </span><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvB-SRr-lUbNSRQvUJBiHebPhEmQcNagU&amp;si=ZZHoccy8x6Ic5dDg" rel="">how to apply the DECIDE framework</a><span> to your current innovation decisions. I'll show you the specific tools and questions that can help you avoid the thinking traps that consistently destroy breakthrough technology value.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvB-SRr-lUbNSRQvUJBiHebPhEmQcNagU&amp;si=ZZHoccy8x6Ic5dDg&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Watch The Video on DECIDE Framework&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvB-SRr-lUbNSRQvUJBiHebPhEmQcNagU&amp;si=ZZHoccy8x6Ic5dDg" rel=""><span>Watch The Video on DECIDE Framework</span></a></p><p>Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't needed surgery during those critical weeks. Would I have been able to convince the leadership team to give WebOS more time? Could I have provided the "adult supervision" my colleagues said was missing? Would better thinking frameworks have changed the outcome?</p><p>I'll never know for certain. But I do know this: the technology was sound, the market opportunity was real, and the decision to kill WebOS after 49 days was based on systematic thinking errors that could have been prevented with better decision frameworks.</p><p>But here's the final piece of the story: Leo Apotheker was fired on September 22, 2011—just 35 days after shutting down WebOS and eleven months after taking over as CEO. The board finally recognized the systematic thinking errors that had destroyed billions in value, but it was too late for WebOS.</p><p>The human cost of these decisions goes beyond stock prices and quarterly reports. There are real people who believed in breakthrough technology, fought for innovation, and had to watch it get destroyed by preventable thinking errors.</p><p><span>In my case, I announced my retirement from HP on October 31, 2011 via </span><a href="https://www.philmckinney.com/goodbye-hp-2/" rel="">my blog</a><span> (</span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/11/hp-phil-mckinny/" rel="">Wired Magazine</a><span>). My last day at HP was December 31, 2011.</span></p><p>WebOS technology eventually found success when LG licensed it for smart TV platforms. The core architecture and UI influenced every subsequent mobile operating system. HP could have owned that platform innovation and the ecosystem value it created.</p><p>What breakthrough technology or innovation opportunity is your team evaluating right now? Before you make any irreversible choices, ask yourself: are you applying systematic thinking frameworks to this decision, or are you relying on intuition and conventional business metrics that might mislead in innovation contexts?</p><p>Because here's what I learned from watching the WebOS disaster unfold while confined to bed, helpless to intervene: when you have breakthrough technology in your hands, the quality of your decision-making process matters more than the quality of your technology.</p><p>Intelligence and good intentions aren't enough. You need systematic frameworks for thinking clearly about innovation decisions under uncertainty.</p><p><span>Wednesday, I'll show you exactly </span><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvB-SRr-lUbNSRQvUJBiHebPhEmQcNagU&amp;si=ZZHoccy8x6Ic5dDg" rel="">how to build and apply those frameworks</a><span>.

Some bad leader don’t like that!).</p><p>I have no problem interacting with younger ICs and even embrace my Dad-ness and Dad humor. I like mentoring and growing others, and I think it’s important to advocate for less experienced to get the lionsshare of the glory and attention.</p><p>For hiring, I just am not open about my age and mostly interact with people virtually. I don’t have my early irrelevant jobs and don’t show my graduation dates. So I haven’t seen it as a problem.</p></div></td></tr>

Now that we're a few decades into the conversation, that initial glut of devs are the greybeards. Thus it appears that there's more old people rolling around.</p><p>Is there ageism? I'm sure. As an old, I'm going to avoid companies that give off a younger, coder bro type vibe. Partially because I assume they're more likely to be ageist.

With shared understanding naturally causes shared compromise and solutions. Without shared understanding, situations degenerate to stalemate, war, welfare states, and economic slave states.</p><p>Individual self conversation, recognition of it, it's biases and countermeasures lay a foundation for a rational individual. The lack of formal and public recognition of self conversation itself is hurdle one. Once that is recognized, a foundation for a rational public can be considered.</p><p>Then communicating with others inter-personally, with peers, spouses, coworkers, managers, authorities and strangers. Pairs, small groups, larger groups, and audience dynamics: these all have biases, which are often magnifications of the same bias at a self conversation level. New bias forms are here too, and they must also be recognized, understood, and countermeasures established. This is all nothing but communicating, but doing so effectively, causing understanding in others, and gaining understanding from those less communication-ally skilled.</p><p>Now let's take these biases and add in mass media, social media, and all the network effects they bring to the communication situation. Strangely enough, yet again the countermeasures that operate at lower levels continue to function here - except now we're dealing with the public. countermeasures now require public education.</p><p>I think by spreading knowledge of interpersonal and self conversation biases, their countermeasures immediate and positive effect lay the foundation for widespread respect of effective communications. After all, the lack of it often only needs to be pointed out for people to consider the ease of adopting knowledge about and the countermeasures that enable more success communicating, which directly correlates to actual success. And that is with everything a person does, because this perspective begins with one's self conversation, reducing the bias there, first. That generates a more rational person, more aware, more active. Push this to network effects, and now we're talking societal change. It's a plan to impress secondary considerations on the general public, because that's the primary countermeasure in communication issues: consider further.</p></div></td></tr>

Some cultures venerate older people, some shun them. So it will vary. There isn't one "tech" culture. If you're talking about tech companies in the United States dominated by white males, ageism has been (and afaik, continues to be) a cultural norm.</p><p>Changing a culture's norms is incredibly difficult. The only way I've heard about it happening is through massive pressure, from either a large social group vocally pushing against an issue (with consequences), or a large industry spending millions of dollars to advertise something (diamonds, washing machines) and exploiting some other cultural bias to do so. Cultural norms can also change temporarily (we all worked remote during a pandemic and productivity went up, but after that it would seem our productivity went down? and women became industrial workers during WW2, but after that apparently they weren't good enough?).</p><p>So even if the norm did change temporarily, you need continued pressure to make it stick.

As they grow more senior, they will spend more time in meetings, writing more docs, aligning more teams, drawing more boxes, tossing around more terms, defining more product features, and talking to more customers. As time goes by, they gain more institutional knowledge and getting better at company dynamics. They know which VPs to trust. They know which squeaky wheels to oil, and which buttons to push. They do everything better, except designing or implementing a challenging system.</p><p>That is, the senior ICs start to resemble a strong product manager, or an effective director without a team. These are all good - until the company suddenly no longer needs them. Maybe their team has become a cost center. Maybe the project gets into maintenance mode. Or maybe the product has been so stable that the company does not even need more alignment. At that time, the ICs will find that all the institutional knowledge and so-called "leadership" is not that transferrable. And when they go out and interview for a new job, they find that they can't even sketch a solid design.</p><p>Sadly, I don't have a solution. There are exceptions. I guess it's natural that a senior engineer will gain breadth but also get distracted as they age. What they need is a different kind of depth. They can still be of value to a younger team if they are like a hard-science professor who depends on their PhD students to write papers, yet they can still advise the students as no one else. In industry, my role models are people like Michael Stonebreaker, who can still shape the architectures of modern databases in his 80s. Wernher von Braun of Saturn V rockets, who could come up with new rockets like no one else. Or Kelly Johnson of U-2, who could direct and unblock his engineers with ease. Or Marc Brooker of Amazon, who seems able to go deep into both database and distributed systems to keep coming up with amazing systems. But then, I'm not sure how many people can be talented as those engineers.</p><p>Or maybe another way is to get domain expertise, like how payment works, how insurance works, how accounting works, and etc?</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I think the general resistance from older devs comes from the velocity of software in the past decade. I just connected with a former manager I worked with at IT services from my university and we talked about how crazy tech has moved since my time working there. I had the privilege of working on the data center before the university moved to AWS. The entire backend was written in pure C, running on BSD. We had monitoring scripts written in Perl before getting a contract with Splunk. My manager worked on the design of the distributed file system for the university, and is still an active contributor to the distro. It wasn't the greatest system, but it sure was cool. I'd be a little salty too if some MBA came in and said, "we're moving to AWS, Okta, Workday, and Splunk. And oh by the way, we have to rewrite the system in node.js, and these interns are going to do it. Have fun!"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <h2>OxCaml is a fast-moving set of extensions to the OCaml programming language.</h2>
        <p>It is both Jane Street’s production compiler, as well as a laboratory for experiments focused towards making
            OCaml better for performance-oriented programming. Our hope is that these extensions can over time be
            contributed to upstream OCaml.</p>
    </div><div>

    <section>
        <h2>OxCaml’s primary design goals are:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>to provide <span>safe, convenient, predictable</span> control over performance-critical
                aspects
                of
                program behavior </li>
            <li>but <span>only where you need it,</span></li>
            <li>and…<span>in OCaml!</span></li>
        </ul>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>Let’s talk about what this means!</h2>

        <p>OxCaml’s extensions are meant to make OCaml a great language for performance engineering. Performance
            engineering
            requires control, and we want that control to be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Safe. Safety is a critical feature for making programmers more productive, and for shipping correct
                code.
                Languages that are pervasively unsafe are too hard to use correctly.</li>
            <li>Convenient. We want to provide control without bewildering programmers, or drowning them in endless
                annotations.
                To achieve this, we aim to maintain OCaml’s excellent type-inference, even as we add considerable
                expressiveness
                to the type-system.</li>
            <li>Predictable. One of the great features of OCaml today is that it’s pretty easy to look at OCaml code and
                understand how it’s going to perform. We want our extensions to maintain and improve on that property,
                by
                making
                key performance details explicit at the type-level.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By "only where you need it", we mean that OxCaml’s extensions should be pay-as-you-go. While OxCaml aims to
            provide
            more power to optimize, you shouldn’t need to swallow extra complexity when you’re not using that power.</p>
        <p>By "in OCaml", we mean that all valid OCaml programs are also valid OxCaml programs. But our more profound
            goal
            is
            for OxCaml to feel like OCaml evolving into a better version of itself, rather than a new language. For
            that,
            OxCaml
            needs to honor OCaml’s basic design sensibility, and to preserve the safety, ease, and productivity that are
            hallmarks of the language.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>OxCaml’s extensions </h2>
        <p>Our extensions can be roughly organized into a few areas:</p>

        <div>
            <div>
                <h2>Fearless concurrency</h2>
                <p>Writing correct concurrent programs is notoriously difficult. OxCaml includes additions to the
                    type
                    system to
                    statically rule out data races.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Layouts</h2>
                <p>OxCaml lets programmers specify the way their data is laid out in memory. It also provides native
                    access
                    to
                    SIMD processor extensions.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h2>Control over allocation</h2>
                <p>OxCaml gives programmers tools to control allocations, reducing GC pressure and making programs
                    more
                    cache efficient and deterministic.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Quality of life </h2>
                <p>OxCaml also contains some extensions that aren’t specifically about systems programming, but
                    which
                    we’ve
                    found helpful in our day-to-day work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Polymorphic parameters</li>
                    <li>Include functor</li>
                    <li>Labeled tuples</li>
                    <li>Immutable arrays</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <h2>Using OxCaml</h2>
        <p>OxCaml is open-source, and we’re excited to welcome experimental users, especially researchers and tinkerers
            who
            can
            kick the tires and provide feedback on the system. We put the emphasis on experimental because OxCaml makes
            no
            promises of stability or backwards compatibility for its extensions (though it does remain backwards
            compatible
            with
            OCaml).</p>
        <p>OxCaml is intended to be easy to use, and to that end comes with modified versions of the standard OCaml
            tool-set,
            including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Package management, compatible with dune and opam</li>
            <li>Editor integration via the LSP-server</li>
            <li>Source code formatting</li>
            <li>Documentation generation</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Jane Street has long open sourced a bunch of useful libraries and tools. These are now released in two forms:
            one
            for
            upstream OCaml, in which our extensions have been stripped, and one for OxCaml, where the extensions are
            fully
            leveraged.</p>

        <p>Not all extensions are erasable, so some libraries will be available only for OxCaml. We’ll export
            OCaml-compatible
            versions of these libraries when the necessary extensions are integrated upstream.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tattoy.sh">https://tattoy.sh</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44268644">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="home-content"><div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://tattoy.sh/assets/screenshots/hero.webp"></p></div><p>Tattoy with a GPU-rendered shader and live-updating minimap of the TTY scrollback.</p></div><div><h2>About</h2><p>Tattoy can generally be thought of as a framework for adding eye-candy to your terminal. It is purely text-based so works in any terminal emulator that supports true colour. "Graphics" is rendered with UTF8 half-blocks (▀,▄). Whilst most of its effects are for getting you street credibility it also has more powerful features based around its awareness of terminal contents. For example it can detect and auto adjust text contrast whilst remaining faithful to the terminal's palette.</p><p>Tattoy works with your existing shell, theme and prompt, etc. It can always and immediately toggle between its effects and your normal terminal state, allowing for easy copy-pasting for example.</p></div><div><h2>Shaders</h2><p>Perhaps the fanciest feature of Tattoy is its ability to render GPU shaders. It is designed to be able to run most shaders from <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shader Toy</a> without any editing at all. It also supports <a href="https://github.com/hackr-sh/ghostty-shaders">Ghostty shaders</a> out-of-the-box, though certain shaders that alter the position of text (such as CRT emulators) don't have a pronounced impact as text rendering is always left to the host terminal emulator.</p></div><div><h2>Second Terminal In Background</h2><p><span> You can run an arbitrary command that is rendered in the background of your normal terminal. Use-cases for this might be: <ul><li>an audio visualiser</li><li>video background</li><li>system monitor graphs</li></ul> The background terminal's opacity can be adjusted so it doesn't visual conflict too much with your actual terminal. </span><span>  </span></p></div><div><h2>Scrollback Minimap</h2><p><span>  </span><span> The minimap is a pixelised version of the contents of the scrollback, including the current contents of the screen. It live updates, even when using the so-called "alternate screen" for apps like `nvim`, `top`, `gitui`, etc. <p>Tattoy manages its own scrollback buffer (like say `tmux` does), and so can therefore also provide its own scrollbar.</p> </span></p></div><div><h2>Auto Text Contrast</h2><p><span> Have you ever run `ls` in a directory only for certain file types to be completely illegible? This has long been an intractable problem caused by the limited colours of terminal palettes. CLI applications are only ever aware of palette index values, not the underlying RGB value, therefore it is impossible for them to know if any given background colour is sufficient enough to allow its containing text to be readable. <p>Not anymore!</p> <p>Tattoy is aware of the true 24 bit RGBA value of all colours in your terminal. This allows it to use clever algorithms to detect low contrast text and auto adjust the foreground colour within the constraints of your chosen terminal theme to find the nearest colour that meets a minimum contrast threshold.</p> </span><span>  </span></p></div><div><h2>Plugins</h2><p><span>  </span><span> Plugins can be written in any language. You get full access to your terminal's contents and can render both UTF8 "pixels" and text to a dedicated plugin layer of your choosing. Currently the protocol is JSON over `STDIN` and `STDOUT`. See the <a href="https://tattoy.sh/docs/plugins">plugin documentation</a> for more info. <p>Here we see the cursor giving off smoke particles that interact with the terminal's text. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/tattoy-org/tattoy/tree/main/crates/tattoy-plugins/smokey_cursor">here</a>.</p> </span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing.</p><p>And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night.</p><p>Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed. What you should do is make sure you keep the gates open that were not gatekept for you.

We hung out the rest of Sunday until my flight left. It made what otherwise would have been a lonely and stressful day a lot of fun.</p><p>He gave me an email address to hit him up after the con. It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his "name", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a "hacker con" / being worried about real identities, etc. I'd hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize that I was pretty insufferable at that age).</p><p>If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base.

I feel like I owe something more</p><p>Debt is related to value, which is inherently subjective. In nature, nothing reproducable is one yard long, so we create something and call it a yard, and that first thing becomes the standard. The same is true economically; there's no way to measure what one loaf of bread is inherently worth. Even the time and resources needed to produce it vary depending on countless circumstances. A man with a bread factory will have a much easier time producing one loaf than a homeless man.</p><p>The same is true for pain. What's as trivial as a small papercut to one person may be overwhelmingly traumatic to another person, and another can handle losing a limb as easily as losing a pen. Countless variable psychological circumstances prevent us from making any true measurement of debt.</p><p>But justice requires that we try our best and move on. So we create economies out of barter and then gold and then bills and then credit. Or we create justice systems that are constantly flowing and changing in their understanding of right and wrong, and also value and loss.</p><p>It may be that some people who helped you had no difficulty. I do remember a teacher telling us once to be careful of what we say, because we never know which things we say will stick with someone forever with deep profoundness. Which goes to show that a small off the cuff comment has the very real potential to contribute toward making someone's life significantly better or significantly worse, yet the comment took almost no thought or effort. It <i>cost</i> little.</p><p>There's a moment in a play written by Karol Wojtyla in the 1940s, where Adam Chmielowski asks Madame Helena what it costs her to play Ophelia or Lady MacBeth. She replies, "in a way, it costs me all my life. It is a strange ransom; every time I pay it all over again."</p><p>I have met <i>many</i> people who are convinced that they have been wronged so grievously that the offender must pay every last penny they have or ever will make, and suffer every second of this life as much as possible, and they hope Hell exists purely so that the offender's suffering may not be relieved by the most torturous death imaginable. Such a person will never be satisfied or happy.</p><p>For the little it's worth, my recommendation is to repay people with what good value you justly and reasonably estimate that you owe them for the good they have done to you, and be done with it. If they consider it too much or too little, accomodate them a little, but only within reason. Inversely, if anyone has wronged you, consider their debt paid to you already, since this costs you nothing, whereas exacting justice is tiresome and restless. Besides, forgiving someone's debt to you gives them encouragement to improve, whereas exacting it discourages them and puts them on the defense. That's not to say you shouldn't insist that <i>society as a whole</i> have justice also, for example by calling the police when a legitimate crime has occurred to you or someone else. I'm only talking about the debt in context of two humans.</p></div></td></tr>

Those facilities can be found through the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/used-lithium-ion-batteries">Environmental Protection Agency’s website</a> or <a href="https://www.call2recycle.org/">other organizations</a> in the US that specialize in processing e-waste. Do not throw them in the trash, recycling bins, or used battery boxes provided at various retail locations.</p><p>The recall is also a reminder that power banks and backup batteries can potentially develop severe issues over time, as these particular units are almost a decade old. If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem. And while the technology is currently more expensive than lithium-ion batteries, you can also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/656183/kuxius-semi-solid-state-power-bank-costs-a-little-more-but-lasts-much-longer">consider upgrading to solid-state batteries</a> which are more powerful, safer, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631357/elecom-power-bank-battery-sodium-ion">longer lasting than what we commonly use now</a> to power our devices.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>That was about 10 million km (6,213,710 mi) just now.</p>
<p>Pretty empty out here.</p>
<p>Here comes our first planet...</p>
<p>As it turns out, things are pretty far apart.</p>
<p>We’ll be coming up on a new planet soon. Sit tight.</p>
<p>Most of space is just space.</p>
<p>Halfway home.</p>
<p>Destination: Mars!</p>
<p><span id="it-would-take">It would take about seven months to travel this distance in a spaceship. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="better-be-some">Better be some good in-flight entertainment.</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span id="in-case-youre">In case you're wondering, you'd need about 2000 feature-length movies to occupy that many waking hours.</span></p>
<p>Sit back and relax. Jupiter is more than 3 times as far as we just traveled.</p>
<p>When are we gonna be there?</p>
<p>Seriously. When are we gonna be there?</p>
<p><span id="this-is-where">This is where we might at least see some asteroids to wake us up. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="too-bad-theyre">Too bad they're all too small to appear on this map.</span></p>
<p>I spy, with my little eye... something black.</p>
<p>If you were on a road trip, driving at 75mi/hr, it would have taken you over 500 years to get here from earth.</p>
<p><span id="all-these-distances">All these distances are just averages, mind you.</span>  <span>&nbsp;</span><span id="the-distance-between">The distance between planets really depends on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="so-if-youre">So if you're planning on taking a trip to Jupiter, you might want to use a different map.</span></p>
<p><span id="if-you-plan">If you plan it right, you can actually move relatively quickly between planets.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="the-new-horizons">The New Horizons space craft that launched in 2006 only took 13 months to get to Jupiter.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="dont-worry-itll">Don't worry.

 <p>Pretty close to Jupiter now.</p>
 <p>Sorry. That was a lie before. Now we really are pretty close.</p>
<!-- Jupiter 224041px -->
 <p>Lots of time to think out here...</p>
 <p>Pop the champagne! We just passed 1 billion km.</p>
  <p><span id="i-guess-this">I guess this is why most maps of the solar system aren't drawn to scale.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="its-not-hard"> It's not hard to draw the planets. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="its-the-empty">It's the empty space that's a problem.</span></p>
 <p>Most space charts leave out the most significant part – all the space.</p>
  <p>We're used to dealing with things at a much smaller scale than this.</p>
 <p><span id="when-it-comes">When it comes to things like the age of the earth, the number of snowflakes in Siberia, the national debt...</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="those-things-are">Those things are too much for our brains to handle.</span></p>
 <!--Saturn 412397px-->
 <p>We need to reduce things down to something we can see or experience directly in order to understand them.</p>
 <p>We're always trying to come up with metaphors for big numbers. Even so, they never seem to work.</p>
  <p>Let's try a few metaphors anyway...</p>
  <p><span id="you-would-need">You would need</span> <span id="monitors"></span> <span id="of-these-screens">of these screens lined up side-by-side to show this whole map at once.</span><span id="depth"></span></p>
   <p><span id="if-this-map">If this map was printed from a quality printer (300 pixels per inch) the earth would be invisible, and the width of the paper would need to be 475 feet.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="475-feet-is">475 feet is about 1 and 1/2 football fields.</span></p>
   <p><span id="even-though-we">Even though we don’t really understand them, a lot can happen within these massive lengths of time and space.</span><span>&nbsp;</span> <span id="a-drop-of">A drop of water can carve out a canyon.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="an-amoeba-can">An amoeba can become a dolphin.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="a-star-can">A star can collapse on itself.</span></p>
  <p>It’s easy to disregard nothingness because there’s no thought available to encapsulate it. There’s no metaphor that fits because, by definition, once the nothingness becomes tangible, it ceases to exist.</p>
     <p><span id="its-a-good">It’s a good thing we have these tiny stars and planets, otherwise we’d have no point of reference at all.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="wed-be-surrounded">We’d be surrounded by this stuff that our minds weren’t built to understand.</span></p>
    <p>All this emptiness really could drive you nuts. For instance, if you’re in a sensory deprivation tank for too long, your brain starts to make things up. You see and hear things that aren’t there.</p>
     <p>The brain isn't built to handle "empty."</p>
   <p>"Sorry, Humanity," says Evolution. "What with all the jaguars trying to eat you, the parasites in your fur, and the never-ending need for a decent steak, I was a little busy. I didn’t exactly have time to come up with a way to conceive of vast stretches of nothingness."</p>
   <p>Neurologically speaking, we really only deal with matter of a certain size, and energy of a few select wavelengths. For everything else, we have to make up mental models and see if they match up to the tiny shreds of hard evidence that actually feel real.</p>
      <p><span id="the-mental-models">The mental models provided by mathematics are extremely helpful when trying to make sense of these vast distances, but still...</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="abstraction-is-pretty">Abstraction is pretty unsatisfying.</span></p>
      <p>When you hear people talk about how, "there’s more to this universe than our minds can conceive of" it's usually a way to get you to go along with a half-baked plot point about UFOs or super-powers in a sci-fi series that you're watching late at night when you can’t get to sleep.</p>
      <p>Even when Shakespeare wrote: "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy” – he's basically trying to give us a loophole to make the ghost in the story more believable.</p>
      <!-- Uranus 827961px-->
      <p>But all this empty space, these things of a massive scale, really are more than our minds can conceive of. The maps and metaphors fail to do them justice.</p>       
      <p>You look at one tiny dot, then you look for the next tiny dot. Everything in between is inconsequential and fairly boring.</p>
      <p>Emptiness is actually everywhere. It’s something like 99.9999999999999999999958% of the known universe.</p>
      <p>Even an atom is mostly empty space.</p>
      <p>If the proton of a hydrogen atom was the size of the sun on this map, we would need 11 more of these maps to show the average distance to the electron.</p>
      <p><span id="some-theories-say">Some theories say all this emptiness is actually full of energy or dark matter and that nothing can truly be empty...</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="but-come-on">but come on, only ordinary matter has any meaning for us.</span></p>
      <p>You could safely say the universe is a "whole lotta nothing."</p>
		<p>If so much of the universe is made up of emptiness, what does that mean to people like us, living on a tiny speck in the middle of all of it?</p>
        <p><span id="is-the-known">Is the known universe 99.9999999999999999999958% empty?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="or-is-it">Or is it 0.0000000000000000000042% full?</span></p>
        <p>With so much emptiness, aren't stars, planets, and people just glitches in an otherwise elegant and uniform nothingness, like pieces of lint on a black sweater?</p>
        <p>But without the tiny dots for it to stretch between, there would be no emptiness to measure, and for that matter, no one around to measure it.</p>
        <p><span id="you-might-say">You might say that so much emptiness makes the tiny bits of matter that much more meaningful - simply by the fact that, against all odds,  they <em>aren't</em> empty.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="if-youre-drowning">If you're drowning in the middle of the ocean, a floating piece of driftwood is a pretty big deal.</span></p>
        <p> What if trillions of stars and planets were crammed right next to each other? They wouldn't be special at all.</p>
        <p>It seems like we are both pathetically insignificant, and miraculously important at the same time.</p>
        <p><span id="whether-you-more">Whether you more strongly feel the monumental significance of tiny things or the massive void between them depends on who you are, and how your brain chemistry is balanced at a particular moment. </span><span id="we-walk-around">We walk around with miniature, emotional versions of the universe inside of us.</span></p>
        <p>It's reassuring to know that no matter how depressingly bleak or ridiculously momentous we feel, the universe, judging by its current structure, seems well aware of both extremes.</p>
  <!-- Neptune 1295901px-->
<p>The fact that you're here, in the midst of all this nothing, is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it.</p>
<p>Congratulations on making it this far.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>It’s not the first time I’ve fallen down the rabbit-hole of rendering text in real time. Every time I’ve looked into it an inkling of dissatisfaction always remained, either aliasing, large textures, slow build times, minification/magnification, smooth movement, etc.</p>

<p>Last time I landed on a solution using <a href="https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen">Multi-Channel Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)</a> which was working well. However there was still a few things that bothered me and I just needed a little excuse to jump back into the topic.</p>

<p>That excuse came in the form of getting a new monitor of all things. One of those new OLEDs that look so nice, but that have fringing issues because of their non-standard subpixel structure. I got involved in a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595">GitHub issue</a> discussing this and of course posted my <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595#issuecomment-1870511297">unrequested take</a> on how to go about it. This was the last straw I needed to go try and implement glyph rendering again, this time with subpixel anti-aliasing.</p>

<p>Just to start things off, here is a test with a bunch of fonts, trying to test the most common styles, rounded, sharp, very thin lines, etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/lorem_ipsum_high_res.png" alt="">
<em>This one is higher resolution, recommended to open in a new tab and visualize at native 100% zoom if possible</em></p>

<p>And a cheeky menu to show it in movement, along with a console and the previously show demo text.</p>



<p>An important <strong>disclaimer</strong> about showing images and videos in this post is that artifacts might show due to minification/magnification, pixel alignment, and even <a href="https://geometrian.com/resources/subpixelzoo/">subpixel structure</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-though">But Why Though?</h2>

<p>There was a few things that were bothering me about using SDFs, the main ones being:</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Certain fonts would struggle to render nicely, especially ones with thin features or lots of detail. SDFs represent “blobby” glyphs nicely, and even simple sharp glyphs if you go the multi-channel route. But at some point you need to increase resolution to get rid of the artifacts.</p>

<p>Here you can see an example of Miama switching between SDF and the new method, note how the thin features were often getting lost, as well as how the “f” was struggling due to its size.</p>



<h2 id="atlas-size">Atlas size</h2>

<p>The SDFs are generated offline then stored to an atlas. Even though SDFs require way less resolution for good output quality, you still need something. Especially for fonts with <strong>a lot</strong> of glyphs this was adding up. I even tried some fonts for Japanese and Chinese which I couldn’t realistically bake to a single atlas due to how big they would have been.</p>

<p>Here you can see the atlas for Miama, which even as a font for only Latin languages without that many special characters comes to a resolution of $4096\times1152$ with each glyph taking a $64\times64$ region.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/msdf_atlas_example_no_alpha.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Having multiple fonts available at runtime was adding a significant memory cost and getting them in and out was some significant streaming bandwidth. And the more fonts the bigger the issue.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2>

<p>In general, I found it fiddly to get around issues like minification or implementing new ideas like the subpixel anti-aliasing that kickstarted all this. For a while I also wanted to work with potentially any vector image, which would have required baking, so couldn’t be generated or edited at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<p>Working with intermediate steps that transform the source data is a raw increase in complexity of the whole system, even if some of that complexity is hidden by some library that could take the glyphs and bake them, it’s still there.</p>

<p>A solution that more directly takes the raw input in the form of the bezier curves that the glyph creator made would be conceptually simpler. Over time I’ve come to appreciate solutions that have less moving parts and where the flow from source data to the desired result is as simple and understandable as possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/what_now.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The idea is fairly simple, instead of baking anything to textures, grab the curves that define the <strong>currently visible</strong> glyphs themselves, send them to the GPU and <em>somehow</em> rasterize them. In a way you can see this as moving the necessary rasterization step that previously was offline to be done at runtime.</p>

<p>This would take much less storage compared to the cost per-glyph of a cell in an atlas, it would allow for them to look good at any resolution since we’re rendering the vector representation directly and it would play nice with things like subpixel anti-aliasing, where instead of computing coverage for a single pixel, we’d do it for each of the subpixel elements.</p>

<p>As a very short summary, the solution consist of loading the glyph curve data directly, rasterize them at runtime to an atlas and sample said atlas as required to render the visible glyphs.</p>

<p>The sauce here is keeping glyphs in the atlas as long as they keep being used in subsequent frames. This allows to accumulate and refine the rasterization results, to the extent of getting very high quality sub-pixel anti-aliasing.</p>

<p>I’ll give an overview of the whole pipeline here in execution order. From loading the raw font until they end up on the screen.</p>

<h2 id="processing-the-quadratic-bezier-curves">Processing the Quadratic Bezier Curves</h2>

<p>I’m using <a href="https://freetype.org/">FreeType</a> in an offline tool as an intermediary way to load any of the font formats they support. Then I traverse the curves of each glyph and store them in my asset format that will get passed to the GPU.</p>

<p>The glyphs may contain either <strong>lines</strong>, <strong>quadratic beziers</strong> (3 points) or <strong>cubic beziers</strong> (4 points). To allow for a simpler shader I convert all of these to quadratic beziers.</p>

<p>To transform a <strong>line</strong> to a quadratic bezier is fairly obvious, just create a new control point exactly in the middle of the two existing ones:</p>

<pre><code>// Given the two points for the line
p0 := /*...*/;
p1 := /*...*/;

// Create a new control point in the middle
m := lerp(p0, p1, 0.5);

// And create a quadratic bezier with those
new_curve(p0,m,p1);
</code></pre>

<p>Transforming a <strong>cubic bezier</strong> curve to a quadratic one implies lowering it’s order, which is necessarily a lossy process. In this case I’m choosing to always split the cubic bezier into two quadratics, which works well in all the fonts I’ve tried:</p>

<pre><code>// Given these cubic bezier points
p0 := /*...*/;
p1 := /*...*/;
p2 := /*...*/;
p3 := /*...*/;

// Calculate these extra control points
c0 := lerp(p0, p1, 0.75);
c1 := lerp(p3, p2, 0.75);
m  := lerp(c0, c1, 0.5);

// And create two quadratic bezier curves
new_curve(p0,c0,m);
new_curve(m,c1,p3);
</code></pre>

<p>Here you have a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/oxeoovjjwk">desmos graph</a> where you can move the points around and see the input cubic bezier and the resulting two quadratic ones.</p>




<p>There’s much more interesting ways to do this split that would reduce the error further, but this works fairly well for the majority of cubic beziers found in the fonts I’ve tried. It’s also possible to use offline tools to do a higher quality transformation into a format that only has quadratic beziers like TrueType (.ttf) which would avoid this transformation altogether.</p>

<p>Here’s some of the points after being loaded, the blue points being the ones that define the beginning and end of the bezier curve (or <em>on</em> points) and the red ones being the middle point of each bezier, defining how it curves (or <em>off</em> points).</p>



<h2 id="calculating-coverage">Calculating Coverage</h2>

<p>Here I’m not doing anything particularly interesting or different than what you might find elsewhere. A ray is shot horizontally, left-to-right on a per-pixel basis, testing against the curves for intersections and accumulating a winding number to see if it’s considered outside (zero) or inside (non-zero). At the end of the day is “just” solving a quadratic equation.</p>

<p>My favorite explanation of the math behind this, with some extra neat diagrams, is in the <a href="https://github.com/GreenLightning/gpu-font-rendering#method">read-me of this GitHub repository by GreenLightning</a> explaining his GPU Font Rendering approach. It would also be a <strong>crime</strong> not to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO83KQuuZvg">Sebastian Lague’s Rendering Text video</a> where he covers the principles behind glyph rasterization and his adventures making his solution better. If you’re interested in the source code as well, both of these links can sort you out.</p>

<p>Something worth mentioning is that there can be issues in this step due to inaccuracies on the intersection computation, as the links above already mention. Since I knew I would be accumulating hundreds of samples over time I chose not to do anything explicitly about that at this stage and this has proven to be the right decision so far.</p>

<p>Most of these inaccuracies happen when the samples are at a very specific height and these <em>can</em> still happen in my implementation. That said, maybe one or two samples out of a few hundreds can have incorrect coverage in the worst case but after averaging these are not visible.</p>

<p>At the time of writing I’m accumulating up to 512 samples per-glyph if it stays on screen. If a single sample goes wrong, that means that the pixel is outputting $1/512=0.00195$ or $511/512=0.99804$ instead of $0$ and $1$ respectively which is imperceptible in practice. Furthermore, you could have a threshold where you clamp to the extremes if the coverage is close, making these $0.002$ and $0.998$ be evaluated as $0$ and $1$ respectively.</p>

<p>For completeness, here’s the code to compute the coverage. It iterates over a bitset to access the relevant curves of the glyph and computes a winding number to then transform it to a coverage value. For a reference about how to compute the winding number I refer you again to <a href="https://github.com/GreenLightning/gpu-font-rendering#method">GreenLightning’s repository</a> who explains it wonderfully and provides sample code.</p>

<p>This <code><span>addend</span></code> simply gets added to the previous value on for that texel on the atlas, which will be explained later.</p>

<p>For the <code><span>quasirandom_float2</span></code> I’m using the fantastic <a href="https://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-quasirandom-sequences/">$R_2$ sequence presented in by Martin Roberts</a>. In <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dtBWH">this shadertoy</a> you can see how it distributes the sample points to provide some very good coverage over time.</p>

<h2 id="accelerating-curve-access">Accelerating Curve Access</h2>

<p>A good optimization to make here is to split the glyph in some horizontal bands and store which curves of the glyph touch each band. The rasterization code is tracing only horizontally, so with this we can massively reduce the set of curves that each texel will have to test against. To do this I have a bunch of bits per-band per-glyph that represent which local curves to the glyph are present in the band.</p>

<p>Here is a visualization of which curves are on the different bands, highlighted in yellow. You can imagine how a ray traced from left to right of the glyph can just intersect the relevant curves.</p>



<p>You get some great wins by having each texel loop over the curves relevant for that band. However, this can be made faster by accessing bands uniformly per-wave, meaning that all the code that handles iterating over curves can be scalarized, and so are the curve reads (meaning they can happen once per-wave and not once per-thread on the wave). That would look something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>this_thread_band_index</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span><span>uv_y</span> <span>*</span> <span>BAND_COUNT</span><span>)),</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>BAND_COUNT</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

<span>{</span>
    <span>/* . . . Add the curves for this band to be intersected against . . . */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And since I’m rasterizing this in compute into an atlas, I can decide which texel each thread is writing to, so I reorganize the threads to be packed horizontally, in row-major order, so the range of bands that each wave touches is minimized compared to other indexing methods like “classic” quads or Morton codes. Here is an example of how the threads are distributed. Using a $9\times11$ glyph and 16-thread waves for simplicity:</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/wave_distribution.png" alt=""></p>

<p>To distribute the threads like this would be as simple as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int2</span> <span>total_texel_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>parameters</span><span>.</span><span>texel_bottom_right</span> <span>-</span> <span>parameters</span><span>.</span><span>texel_top_left</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="atlas-packing">Atlas Packing</h2>

<p>I started by rasterizing to the screen directly, however computing high quality anti-aliasing every frame as they were being output to the final target was a significant cost.</p>

<p>Thinking about how to get around this it also became obvious that most rendered text stays on screen for many frames, with the same size and position, even as you’re reading this you’re probably not scaling the text, or smoothly scrolling.</p>

<p>Besides this, the same glyph will often appear more than once on screen at the exact same size (just look at how many “e”s there are in this sentence alone). So why bother rendering it multiple times? (Subpixel positioning is a thing and we’ll go back to that later)</p>

<p>So I grabbed the two most well-worn tools in the graphics tool belt, <em>atlases</em> and <em>temporal accumulation</em>.</p>



<p>The idea here is to have an atlas that packs the glyphs reasonably well, if a glyph we want is not on the atlas, we allocate a chunk of it and start rasterizing into it, if a glyph we want is already there, we just use it. At some point in the frame we go over al the glyphs in the atlas and decide whether we keep it (and maybe refine it with more samples) or if it’s not being used and we should free that space.</p>

<p>The atlas will keep in-use glyphs resident all the time, so if text on the screen hasn’t changed for a while, we have nothing to compute there, all the glyphs are ready and we just slap them onto the screen later. There is a cost of adding new glyphs, but we can spread this cost over many frames as we’ll discuss later.</p>

<p>Some notes about this, the inputs to the atlas do have to take a couple things into account that might not be immediately obvious. At the time of writing, if we equate this atlas to a hash-map, the “key” is the following:</p>

<pre><code>Glyph_Key :: struct
{
    font : Font;
    glyph_index : int;

    // u24.8 fixed point
    quantized_size_in_pixels_x : u32;
    quantized_size_in_pixels_y : u32;

    // u0.8 fixed point
    quantized_subpixel_offset_x : u8;
    quantized_subpixel_offset_y : u8;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The font, index of the glyph inside the font and the size are somewhat expected. We also need the subpixel offset though, which is the fractional of the pixel position (as in <code><span>frac</span><span>(</span><span>pixel_position</span><span>)</span></code>). You might want to place the glyph at any position on the screen, not necessarily aligned with the pixel grid, or you might want to smoothly move text (e.g. scrolling). If we didn’t take this into account, then all the anti-aliasing we’re doing would only be valid for a single subpixel position.</p>

<p>Note the usage of fixed point too. This helps collapsing nearby fractional positions and sizes to the same values. Using floating point directly would often generate different values bit-wise, even if mathematically they should have been the same. Using 8 bits for the fractional part offers more than enough resolution for smooth positions and sizes. If moving a single of this $1/256$ increments within the pixel changed the resulting value it would often be displayed in 8 bits per-component render targets or monitor outputs.</p>

<p>That said, you <em>could</em> decide that this is a trade-off you’re willing to make and say that all of your glyphs should be positioned on a pixel boundary. In my experience, slowly moving text looks awful this way since you see it jump from integer pixel boundary to pixel boundary. I wanted to use this as my solution for all text so it’s not something I went for.</p>

<p>Here you can see a comparison between subpixel positioning, aligned to the pixel grid and aligned to a half-resolution pixel grid to simulate seeing this in a monitor that’s half the resolution than the one you’re using.</p>



<p>Zooming into the 1-pixel aligned word makes the stepping even more obvious.</p>



<p>Where if we let the glyphs fall in subpixel positions the movement is dramatically smoother.</p>



<p>That said, it’s still possible to optimize for cases where you know you will do a lot of static text, for example, if you’re doing a text editor and want to use a monospaced font you can force the spacing between characters to be rounded to pixel boundaries. This way every glyph will have the same subpixel offset and always hit the atlas cache for the same glyph.</p>

<p>If also aligning the line breaks to the output pixel grid you get even better reuse, since the same glyphs in a monospaced font in different lines will also hit the same entry on the atlas. See how only new glyphs in the block of text allocate a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="z-order">Z-Order</h3>

<p>A great way I found to place the glyphs somewhat nicely packed at runtime was to use Z-Order Packing and a bitset for free cells within the atlas.</p>

<p>Z-Order curves (via Morton codes) allows you to think of the cells as a long 1D array, allocating a contiguous slice of this 1D array will give you a square in the resulting 2D atlas as long as you’re allocating a power of two number of cells.</p>

<p>A free bit in the bitset represents a free cell, in this case a $16\times16$ texel cell.</p>

<p>When a glyph wants to find a spot, it rounds up its size to the next power of two, so a glyph that needs a $25\times29$ will end up allocating a chunk that’s $32\times32$. This would require 4 $16\times16$ cells, so it’ll look for 4 contiguous free bits and set them, then return the 2D location of that first free cell using Morton codes to go from 1D to 2D.</p>

<p>Note that these contiguous bits also have to be aligned to the number of bits, that is, if looking for 4 free bits, those could start in index 0, 4, 8, 12, etc. If the free bits went from bit 3 to bit 6, when looking at those 4 cells they wouldn’t form a contiguous square.</p>

<p>The code would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>size := /*...*/

max_size_dimension := max(size.x, size.y);
aligned_size := max(BASE_SLOT_SIZE, align_to_next_power_of_2(max(max_size_dimension, 0)));
slot_size := aligned_size / BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
bits_needed := slot_size * slot_size;
assert(is_power_of_2(bits_needed));

index := find_free_contiguous_bits_aligned(bitset, bits_needed);

base_slot_coordinates := decode_morton2_16(xx index);
top_left_texel_coordinates := base_slot_coordinates * BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
</code></pre>

<p>And here there’s a visualization of the order the glyphs go in as well as what happens when some of they get removed and those free cells get reused for future glyphs if they fit.</p>



<h3 id="transposing-z-order">Transposing Z-Order</h3>

<p>The eagle eyed among you that have worked with Z-Order in 2D before might have noticed that this is packing in a transposed Z-Order (so… mirrored N-Order?).</p>

<p>This is because most long and thin glyphs that use the Latin alphabet are vertical, and transposing Z-Order allows to allocate two cells together to form a vertical rectangular section. This makes glyphs for stuff like “l”, “j”, “i” or “1” take half the space.</p>

<p>That said, in cases where most long and thin glyphs are horizontal, for example most of the Arabic languages, the standard Z-Order is more suited.</p>

<p>To do this the code above would be modified to not just use the maximum size of each dimension when calculating the <code><span>bits_needed</span></code>.</p>

<pre><code>aligned_size := ixy(max(cast(s32)BASE_SLOT_SIZE, align_to_next_power_of_2(max(size.x, 0))),
                    max(cast(s32)BASE_SLOT_SIZE, align_to_next_power_of_2(max(size.y, 0))));
slot_size := aligned_size / BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
slot_size.y = max(slot_size.x, slot_size.y);
slot_size.x = max(slot_size.x, slot_size.y / 2);
bits_needed := slot_size.x * slot_size.y;
assert(is_power_of_2(bits_needed));
</code></pre>

<p>And transposing the final coordinates is simply swapping the result.</p>

<pre><code>base_slot_coordinates := decode_morton2_16(xx index);
base_slot_coordinates.x, base_slot_coordinates.y = base_slot_coordinates.y, base_slot_coordinates.x;
top_left_texel_coordinates := base_slot_coordinates * BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see the same demo but allocating glyphs that are double the height.</p>



<h2 id="temporal-accumulation">Temporal Accumulation</h2>

<p>Glyphs staying in the atlas allows to keep throwing samples at them and refine the results further. This way the final result can have very high quality anti-aliasing without having to cast a significant amount of samples when the glyph just appears.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the intro video slowed down and with a full black background to better visualize the glyph output. Also using the Nacelle typeface on its ultra-light variant, to better show thin features.</p>



<p>Even in this slowed-down case it’s hard to see the glyphs visibly refining as you’re reading the text since the results are already fairly high quality. The trick here is that every glyph that first appears gets 8 samples-per-pixel on that first frame, then 4 samples next frame, then 2 and finally 1 every frame afterwards until it reaches a total of 512 samples.</p>

<p>This guarantees a pretty good quality when a glyph first shows up, which is important on smoothly moving or resizing glyphs. Since they do the equivalent of getting initialized every frame.</p>

<p>Another factor that makes this looks better is subpixel anti-aliasing, which will be touched upon in a further section.</p>

<p>When disabling this and just doing a single sample per-pixel every frame, with no subpixel anti-aliasing the slowed down results are as follows.</p>



<p>It’s more obvious how samples keep getting added. Also very interesting how the glyphs appear to shift in positioning. That’s because the initial samples are not at the center of the pixel. That’s fixed by placing the initial samples optimizing for this case, but that’d defeat part of the point of this visualization.</p>

<p>Even in this case, with a single sample and the shifting text it’s still not as dramatically visible as I would have imagined, showcasing how well the refinement idea and temporal accumulation works in principle.</p>

<p>Zooming in on a word in particular demonstrates how on the first frame the glyph has no anti-aliasing at all and the results are either black or white, then it keeps refining and shifting position until getting to a better final result with a few dozen samples.</p>



<p>And for completeness, with all the quality optimizations on, starting with 8 samples and with subpixel anti-aliasing that word looks like this.</p>



<p>This system is also easily tunable to achieve the required levels of quality and performance. Some of the knobs to twist would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many samples/rays to add every frame.</li>
  <li>Increase samples on the first few frames of a glyph or not.</li>
  <li>Having a cap of “total samples” allowed per-frame to keep cost bounded.</li>
  <li>Time-slice the update of existing glyphs, that is, adding samples every few frames instead of every frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another note is that the cost of casting a ray scales linearly with the amount of curves it’s going to have to intersect for a given glyph. So for more precise cost-gating it might be worth to use that as a metric instead. Meaning that you’d allow to do a certain number of intersected curves per-frame.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that performance hasn’t been a concern in my experience with this system so far. The full-screen of text of the intro peaks at about 0.1 milliseconds in my 9070 at 4k. And that cost quickly tapers down to zero when glyphs have reached the max number of samples (set at the time of writing to 512 but can be easily lowered).</p>

<p>Overall this system works <em>shockingly</em> well. Most text presented to users often stays on screen completely static, which lets it converge to high quality. Even as it shows up, the speed at which we look at words and read them is orders of magnitude slower that the time it takes a glyph to look very good. In general, I’ve found it imperceptible that the text is converging over time while at the same time it always looks nicely anti-aliased.</p>

<h2 id="subpixel-anti-aliasing-and-fringing">Subpixel Anti-Aliasing and Fringing</h2>

<p>The gist of subpixel anti-aliasing is start thinking of the individual red, green and blue subpixel elements that for your monitor pixel as individual sample points, or rather, sample areas. Roughly you can consider the subpixel elements to be the actual “pixels” you want to render into.</p>

<p>In a traditional RGB LCD layout like the following, your horizontal resolution effectively triples. In traditional 4k you’d go from $3840\times2160$ to $3840\times6480$.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_zoo_rgb_structure.png" alt="">
<em>Image from <a href="https://geometrian.com/resources/subpixelzoo/">Subpixel Zoo</a></em></p>

<p>Getting all this effective resolution is great! And since the light is getting mixed from neighboring pixels, there’s no reason to get bad color fringing.</p>

<p>As I’ve already hinted at though, the monitor I’m using is far from this 3 vertical stripes of red, green and blue, and looks like this instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/rtings_subpixel_layout_oled_g9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Image from <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/odyssey-oled-g9-g95sc-s49cg95">RTings Review of Oled G9</a></em></p>

<p>Which causes problematic fringing. And this is far from being the worst case out there, with monitors having wild arrangements like some of the ones you can see in <a href="https://geometrian.com/resources/subpixelzoo/">Subpixel Zoo</a>. A notorious recent one is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595#issuecomment-1512405626">LG WOLED having a red-white-blue-green</a> structure, so it has an extra white-only subpixel and has the green and blue ones swapped from the standard order.</p>

<p>To show a more direct comparison on my current monitor. A default red-green-blue subpixel structure made of equal vertical rectangles would look like this. With very visible green fringing on top and magenta at the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/text_with_fringing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Whereas if I set the subpixel structure on the solution presented in this article to match the one on my monitor it looks like this. Where even with subpixel anti-aliasing on there’s next to no fringing while keeping a very smooth result.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/text_without_fringing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The big payoff! Finally rendering good looking text with subpixel anti-aliasing and no color fringing.</p>

<p>To achieve this I’ve set up a little editor where I could play with the subpixel elements position, the inner white square is the pixel, and each of the colored quads represent where I’m sampling the results of each subpixel element. Note that it’s going out of bounds of the pixel, which I’ll touch on in the next section.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_oled.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If zooming in you can see how most of those pixels we’re sending to the monitor are not white, in fact there’s very few that are $RGB(1,1,1)$.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_zoomed.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But when they’re outputting on the monitor, light from all the subpixels blends in such a way that the result is a smooth white output. Getting the desired anti-aliasing effect and better representing the intended shape of the glyph.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_zoomed_monitor_picture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note that a lot of these features are only one to one-and-a-half pixels wide. They also often fall in-between pixel cells since I’m not doing any <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/truetype/hinting">hinting</a>. This is picked on purpose as a hard example for the renderer to handle and to show the effectiveness of good subpixel anti-aliasing.</p>

<h3 id="overlapping-subpixels">Overlapping Subpixels</h3>

<p>As I was trying to match my subpixel structure I’ve found that overlapping the subpixel elements would give more accurate results. Which intuitively makes sense since light naturally mixes and diffuses slightly from the subpixel elements, so the sampled area for a given subpixel will be larger than the subpixel itself physically is. Almost behaving like a tiny point light.</p>

<p>So naturally you might expect a setup like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_rgb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>However letting the subpixel elements overlap each other gives better results. Also here you can see two examples of a “classic” LCD subpixel arrangement. If you’re seeing this on a screen with this arrangement it’s probably the best quality anti-aliasing you’d see in this whole article. Because all the other captures have been done with my monitor’s subpixel structure arrangement.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_rgb_expanded.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note that the areas also should bleed outside the pixel itself because they are surrounded by (normally) identical pixels with identical subpixel elements. Light is not only bleeding and mixing with the light from a single pixel, but also with the neighboring subpixels.</p>

<p>As I was writing this article I found the <a href="https://medium.com/@evanwallace/easy-scalable-text-rendering-on-the-gpu-c3f4d782c5ac">Easy Scalable Text Rendering article by Evan Wallace</a> which suggests needing to blur horizontally after rendering with subpixel anti-aliasing. Interestingly this is effectively the same thing as considering the subpixel elements themselves to be bigger and overlapping.</p>

<h2 id="a-plea">A Plea</h2>

<p>I <em>really</em> wish that having access to arbitrary subpixel structures of monitors was possible, perhaps given via the common display protocols. This would enhance subpixel anti-aliasing in general and text specifically, even in monitors that have “standard” orders, since you can be more fine-grained for the specific hardware.</p>

<p>This would also give freedom to display manufacturers to not have to fear trying an otherwise better subpixel structure because of issues with text rendering. Samsung changed their subpixel structure on QD-OLED to try to minimize issues like this from G8 to G9. And still on LG’s WOLED and Samsung’s QD-OLED fringing is commonly cited as one of the most notorious problems on monitors that use them.</p>

<p>It’s is just software, we can fix this, they shouldn’t be forced to change hardware to account for the failures of software.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>

<p>Good user interfaces and especially great text is a soft spot of mine. It has the potential to carry the perceived quality of a product to an degree that’s sometimes underrated. A prime example of this is the fantastic work that Atlus consistently puts out in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d6x1CIgLSc">Persona</a> series or more recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4ypdFi8zo8">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. I also have to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhNoX5F81iw">Nier: Automata</a> as a personal favorite.</p>

<p>And it makes sense! Games will often present you with text that’s meant to grab your attention. When a text box, a menu, a title, an announcement or anything in-between shows up in a game there’s an implied focus point put on it. It looking sub-par can impact the experience as much as a badly rendered 3D scene would. So it follows that this aspect of the presentation should get their fair share of love as well.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve found this useful! I’d love to see more attempts to make glyph rendering in real time better and in this fashion I wish this comes across as a good motivator for more people to go tackle this.</p>

<p>As always, if you have any comments or there’s any questions please reach out! You can find me in most places as some variation of “osor_io” or “osor-io” as well as with the links at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Cheers! 🍻</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a> memory allocator was first conceived in early 2004, and has
been in public use for about 20 years now. Thanks to the nature of open source software licensing,
jemalloc will remain publicly available indefinitely. But active upstream development has come to an
end. This post briefly describes jemalloc’s development phases, each with some success/failure
highlights, followed by some retrospective commentary.</p>

<h2 id="phase-0-lyken">Phase 0: Lyken</h2>

<p>In 2004 I began work on the Lyken programming language in the context of scientific computing. Lyken
was an eventual dead end, but its manual memory allocator was functionally complete by May 2005.
(The garbage collector which was to leverage its features was never completed.) In September 2005 I
started integrating the allocator into FreeBSD, and in March 2006 I removed the allocator from
Lyken, in favor of thin wrappers around system allocator functionality.</p>

<p>Why remove the memory allocator from Lyken after so much effort went into it? Well, once the
allocator was integrated into FreeBSD, it became apparent that the only feature missing from the
system allocator was a mechanism for tracking allocation volume in order to trigger per thread
garbage collection. And that could be implemented via thin wrappers using thread-specific data and
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html">dlsym(3)</a>. Interestingly, many years later
jemalloc even added the statistics gathering that Lyken would have needed.</p>

<h2 id="phase-1-freebsd">Phase 1: FreeBSD</h2>

<p>Back in 2005 the transition to multi-processor computers was ongoing. FreeBSD had Poul-Henning
Kamp’s excellent phkmalloc memory allocator, but that allocator had no provisions for parallel
thread execution. Lyken’s allocator seemed like an obvious scalability improvement, and with
encouragement from friends and colleagues I integrated what quickly became known as jemalloc. Ah,
but not so fast! Shortly after integration it became apparent that jemalloc had terrible
fragmentation issues under some loads, notably those induced by <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a>
applications. Just when I thought I was mostly done, this real-world failure called jemalloc’s
viability into question.</p>

<p>In brief, the fragmentation issue arose from using a unified extent allocation approach (i.e. no
size class segregation). I had taken basic inspiration from Doug Lea’s
<a href="https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c">dlmalloc</a>, but without the intertwined battle-tested
heuristics that avoided many of the worst fragmentation issues. Much frantic research and
experimentation ensued. By the time jemalloc was part of a FreeBSD release, its layout algorithms
had completely changed to use size-segregated regions, as described in the <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf">2006 BSDCan jemalloc
paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="phase-15-firefox">Phase 1.5: Firefox</h2>

<p>In November 2007, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> 3 was nearing
release, and high fragmentation was an unresolved issue, especially on Microsoft Windows. Thus began
a year of working with Mozilla on memory allocation. Porting jemalloc to Linux was trivial, but
Windows was another matter. The canonical jemalloc sources were in the FreeBSD libc library, so we
essentially forked jemalloc and added portability code, upstreaming anything that was relevant to
FreeBSD. The entire implementation was still in one file, which reduced the friction of fork
maintenance, but the implementation complexity definitely surpassed what is reasonable in a single
file sometime during this phase of development.</p>

<p>Years later, Mozilla developers made significant contributions to the upstream jemalloc in an effort
to move away from their fork. Unfortunately, Mozilla benchmarks consistently showed that the forked
version outperformed the upstream version. I don’t know if this was due to overfitting to a local
optimum or an actual indication of performance regression, but it remains one of my biggest jemalloc
disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-facebook">Phase 2: Facebook</h2>

<p>When I started work at Facebook in 2009, I was surprised to discover that the biggest impediment to
ubiquitous jemalloc use in Facebook infrastructure was instrumentation. Critical internal services
were in the awkward situation of depending on jemalloc to keep memory fragmentation under control,
but engineers needed to debug memory leaks with <a href="https://github.com/google/tcmalloc">tcmalloc</a> and
the <code>pprof</code> heap profiling tool that is part of
<a href="https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools">gperftools</a>. <code>pprof</code>-compatible heap profiling
functionality headlined the jemalloc 1.0.0 release.</p>

<p>jemalloc development migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/">GitHub</a> and continued sporadically
for the next few years as issues and opportunities arose. Other developers started contributing
significant functionality. Version 3.0.0 introduced extensive testing infrastructure, as well as
<a href="https://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> support. The 4.x release series introduced decay-based purging and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>-formatted telemetry. The 5.x series transitioned from
“chunks” to “extents” to pave the way for better interaction with 2 MiB huge pages.</p>

<p>Somewhat more controversially, I removed Valgrind support in 5.0.0 because it was a significant
maintenance complication (numerous tendrils in subtle places), and it was unused inside Facebook;
other tools like <code>pprof</code> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">MemorySanitizer</a>
dominated. I had received very little feedback about Valgrind support, and extrapolated that it was
not being used. In retrospect, that seems not to have been the case. In particular, the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust
language</a> directly incorporated jemalloc into compiled programs, and I
think there was some overlap between Rust developers and Valgrind developers. People were angry.
jemalloc was probably booted from Rust binaries sooner than the natural course of development might
have otherwise dictated.</p>

<p>Facebook’s internal telemetry is a wonder to behold, and it is a massive boon to have performance
data from myriad services informing memory allocator development. I don’t think it’s an accident
that two of the fastest memory allocators of the past decade (tcmalloc and jemalloc) benefit from
such data. Even “simple” things like fast-path optimizations are much easier to get right when there
are aggregated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_%28Linux%29">Linux perf</a> data on hand. Harder
things like fragmentation avoidance are still hard, but if thousands of distinct workflows behave
well with no outlier regressions, then a change is probably safe. jemalloc has benefited immensely
from being integral to the Facebook infrastructure in terms of performance, resilience, and
consistent behavior. Additionally, jemalloc’s own integrated statistics reporting capabilities arose
directly in response to this ubiquitous telemetry environment, and this turned out to generally
benefit both jemalloc development and non-Facebook application tuning/debugging far in excess of the
implementation effort required.</p>

<p>During my last year at Facebook I was encouraged to build a small jemalloc team so that we could
tackle some big tasks that would have been otherwise daunting. On top of major performance
improvements, we got things like continuous integration testing and comprehensive telemetry. When I
left Facebook in 2017, the jemalloc team carried on doing excellent development and maintenance work
for several years, almost entirely without my involvement, under the leadership of my esteemed
colleague, Qi Wang, and as evidenced by the commit history, with the excellent contributions of many
others.</p>



<p>The nature of jemalloc development noticeably shifted around the time that Facebook rebranded itself
as Meta. Facebook infrastructure engineering reduced investment in core technology, instead
emphasizing <em>return</em> on investment. This is apparent in the jemalloc commit history. In particular,
the seeds for principled huge page allocation (HPA) were sown way back in 2016! HPA work continued
apace for several years, slowed, then stagnated as tweaks piled on top of each other without the
requisite refactoring that keeps a codebase healthy. This feature trajectory recently cratered. The
heartbreak for me is somewhat blunted since I have not been closely involved for years, but as a
result of recent changes within Meta we no longer have anyone shepherding long-term jemalloc
development with an eye toward general utility.</p>

<p>I don’t want to dwell on drama, but it is perhaps worth mentioning that we reached a sad end for
jemalloc in the hands of Facebook/Meta even though most of the people involved were acting in good
faith. Corporate cultures shift in compliance with both external and internal pressures. And people
find themselves in impossible situations where the main choices are 1) make poor decisions under
extreme pressure, 2) comply under extreme pressure, or 3) get routed around. As individuals we
sometimes have enough influence to slow organizational degradation, maybe even contribute to
isolated renaissances, but none of us can prevent the inevitable.</p>

<p>I remain very grateful to my former colleagues for all their excellent work on jemalloc, and
Facebook/Meta in general for investing so much, for so long.</p>

<h2 id="phase-4-stasis">Phase 4: Stasis</h2>

<p>What now? As far as I am concerned, “upstream” jemalloc development has concluded. Meta’s needs
stopped aligning well with those of external uses some time ago, and they are better off doing their
own thing. Were I to reengage, the first step would be at least hundreds of hours of refactoring to
pay off accrued technical debt. And I’m not sufficiently excited by what would come after to pay
such a high upfront cost. Perhaps others will create viable forks, whether from the <code>dev</code> branch or
from the 5.3.0 release (already three years old!).</p>

<p>In above sections I mentioned several phase-specific failures, but there were some generic failures
that surprised me despite a career focused on open source development.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned, removing Valgrind caused some bad sentiment. But the root of the problem is lack of
awareness about external uses and needs. I probably would have worked with others to preserve
Valgrind support if I’d known that it mattered to anyone. As another example, I was completely
unaware of jemalloc’s use as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> memory allocator for perhaps
two years. And years later, unaware of its replacement until after the fact.</li>
  <li>Even though jemalloc development remained completely out in the open (not siloed inside Facebook),
the project never grew to retain primary contributors from other organizations. The Mozilla effort
by Mike Hommey to move Firefox to the upstream jemalloc was a near miss. Efforts by others to
transition to a <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>-based build system stalled multiple times, and never
crossed the finish line. I knew from hard experience with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a> that internally siloed open
source projects cannot thrive (<a href="https://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a> was a repeat lesson), but jemalloc needed
more than open development to thrive as an independent project.</li>
</ul>

<p>jemalloc was an odd diversion for me, since I have been a strong proponent of garbage collection
over manual memory management for over 25 years. Personally I’m happy to be working again on
garbage-collected systems, but jemalloc was a tremendously fulfilling project. Thank you to everyone
who made this project so worthwhile, collaborators, supporters, and users alike.</p>
