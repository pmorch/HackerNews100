<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Buildkite, we've historically stored our data with with two keys. We use sequential primary keys for efficient indexing, and UUID secondary keys for external use. The upcoming UUIDv7 standard offers the best of both worlds; its time-ordered UUID primary keys can be utilized for indexing and external use. This blog post will take you on the journey Buildkite took that led to our eventual adoption of UUIDv7 as the primary key of choice. We’ll explore the tradeoffs of database indexes; from sequential integers, randomly generated UUIDs, through to time-based identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-uui-ds">What are UUIDs?</h2>
<p>UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are unique identifiers that can be generated independently without a central authority or coordination with other parties. With large modern applications and systems being distributed in nature, UUID-shaped identifiers have gained popularity as database keys. Unlike sequential integer identifiers, which need coordination to guarantee global uniqueness in a distributed database, UUIDs eliminate the burden of coordination, making them preferable in sharded database environments.</p>
<p>UUIDs also provide other advantages in comparison to sequential integer identifiers. The unpredictability of UUID allows their public usage without disclosing sensitive internal information and statistics. UUIDs are also difficult to guess, providing an extra layer of defense alongside access control checks to guard against <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">Indirect Direct Object Reference</a> vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The random nature, and large 128-bit size of UUIDs makes the probability of a duplicate UUID close to zero, meaning we can consider UUIDs as <em>practically</em> unique. However, the random nature of standard non-time-ordered UUIDs (such as v4) can create database performance problems when used as primary keys. This problem is often referred to as <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/uuids-are-popular-but-bad-for-performance-lets-discuss/">poor database index locality</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-dual-identifiers">Using dual identifiers</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago we decided to standardize the use of sequential integer IDs as primary keys, due to the significant performance issues of non-time-ordered UUIDs. We also use UUIDs as secondary identifiers on database tables. Queries involving table joins utilize sequential integer foreign keys––which typically perform better than random UUID foreign keys. For anything external and customer-facing, UUIDs are used (for example in the API and in URLs). This dual identifier approach was standardized across all teams to help engineers be more productive.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-poor-index-locality">Understanding poor index locality</h2>
<p>Non-time-ordered UUIDs values generated in succession are not sequential. The randomly generated values will not be clustered to each other in a database index, and thus inserts will be performed at random locations. This random insertion can negatively affect the performance on common index data structures such as B-tree and its variants.</p>
<p>The nature of Buildkite's products mean recent data is accessed more frequently than old data. With non-sequential identifiers, the most recent data will be randomly dispersed within an index and lack clustering. As a result, retrieving the most recent data from a large dataset will require traversing a large number of database index pages, leading to a poor cache hit ratio (how many requests a cache is able to fill successfully, compared to how many requests it receives). Compare this to the use of sequential identifiers, where the latest data is logically arranged on the right-most part of an index, allowing it to be far more cache-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="improving-how-uui-ds-work">Improving how UUIDs work</h2>
<p>The index locality problem has led to many implementations in the past 10+ years. A common solution is to use a time-based unique identifier. The first component (prefix) of the identifier is a sortable timestamp which allows these identifiers to be inserted in sequential (and clustered) order into an index data structure. Because the generated identifiers are sequential, the insert performance is comparable to an insert of sequential integer identifiers.</p>
<pre><p><code node="[object Object]">+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          time stamp         | |               random                |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</code></p></pre>
<p>Depending on the implementation, the remaining component of the identifier may be completely randomly generated, or machine-sequential and encoded with a machine/shard number. Examples of the described implementation include <a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec">ULID</a>, <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">Instagram's ShardingID</a>, <del>Twitter</del> X's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID">Snowflake</a> and Mastodon's modified version of Snowflake.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-time-ordered-uui-dv-4">Experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4</h2>
<p>In 2022, a new proposed standard for time-ordered UUIDs started to gain traction, with the UUIDv7 specification becoming an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis/">RFC internet draft</a>.</p>
<p>Around this time Buildkite started experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4-compatible UUIDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 48 bits (previously random) became a timestamp.</li>
<li>The version bits remained unchanged, allowing the time-ordered UUIDs to be treated as if they were regular UUIDv4 values.</li>
<li>Maintaining v4 compatibility was important for some Buildkite customers. During this experiment, Buildkite tried to set the version to '7' and discovered this broke some downstream customer systems which validated UUIDs but didn't know about UUIDv7 yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this change (along with several other changes over a 6 week period), we observed a <strong>50% reduction</strong> in the WAL (Write Ahead Log) rate of the primary database. A similar reduction in write IO was also observed. This reduction in the WAL rate allowed the team to easily set up read replicas and perform other database migration tasks.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-uuid-version-7">Introducing UUID Version 7</h2>
<p>UUID Version 7 (UUIDv7) is a time-ordered UUID which encodes a Unix timestamp with millisecond precision in the most significant 48 bits. As with all UUID formats, 6 bits are used to indicate the UUID version and variant. The remaining 74 bits are randomly generated. As UUIDv7 is time-ordered, values generated are practically sequential and therefore eliminates the index locality problem.</p>

<p>The time-ordered nature of UUIDv7 results in much better DB performance compared to random-prefixed UUIDv4s. This post from the <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/sequential-uuid-generators">2nd quadrant blog</a> benchmarks random UUIDs against sequential UUIDs and not only shows improved write performance but also displays improved read performance.</p>
<p>UUIDv7 continues to conform with the standard UUID format so from a practical use perspective, they can be treated as if they were any other UUID. This compatibility characteristic allows us to use an existing Postgres UUID column and easily transition the column from storing UUIDv4 values to UUIDv7.</p>
<h2 id="migrating-to-uui-dv-7-as-the-primary-key">Migrating to UUIDv7 as the primary key</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, we made the decision to use UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables (instead of sequential integer IDs).</p>
<p>Buildkite engineers are currently working on sharding our largest Postgres database. We quickly recognised using integer IDs as primary keys would quickly become a burden within a distributed database environment. The coordination and workarounds to ensure the uniqueness of incremental integer primary keys between databases is less than ideal. With the UUIDv7 standard being stable, and close to being finalized, Buildkite decided to begin using UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables.</p>
<p>Using UUIDv7 as the primary key will eliminate the need for coordinated identifier generation for new tables. We also no longer require a second integer identifier column, which simplifies application logic. These UUIDs can be used both externally in APIs, and also internally as foreign keys.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-considered-and-trade-offs">Alternatives considered and trade-offs</h2>
<p>As a team, we considered numerous approaches, including <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">Instagram's ShardingID implementation</a>, and <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-to-introduce-composite-primary-keys-in-rails">Shopify's composite primary key implementation</a>. We contemplated retaining our bespoke time-ordered UUIDv4s. However, the novel and potentially complex nature of the approaches we investigated, along with the fact that UUIDv7 will likely become the future standard, led us to settle on UUIDv7 for Buildkite.</p>
<p>UUIDs are 128 bits long, twice as large compared to the 64 bit length of other alternative solutions. There is some additional storage overhead, but this is marginal when taking into account the storage of the rest of a database row, and the benefits of migration offset the overhead for our use case.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Buildkite is currently on a journey to shard the Pipelines database by organization ID. Currently there is no need to encode database shard numbers into identifiers for our specific use case. However, it is worth noting that UUIDv8 (which roughly permits anything) could potentially be utilized in the future to incorporate shard numbers into identifiers if we find this necessary.</p>
<p>The new RFC for UUIDs is in its final review stages and I am looking forward to seeing UUIDv7 becoming an IETF Proposed Standard.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I once heard an elderly Friedrich von Hayek begin a tirade against socialist planning with a charming personal tale. “The other day,” he said playfully, “I went into a shop. I left with an item that, previously, I had no idea I wanted!” Like all the smartest defenders of capitalism, he thought of the market as a benevolent creator whose job no human-made system could replicate. Hayek’s point here was that we, ourselves, do not know what we want until we enter the market. So how could a government official, or indeed anyone, know what society wants?</p>


<p>Thinkers such as von Hayek dismiss vulgar,&nbsp;mainstream economists who celebrate the market as merely an efficient mechanism for finding the right price of things; they see it as something grander, a liberator of our imagination, the co-creator of our preferences and tastes. They argue that interfering with markets, let alone replacing them, is a terrible idea because centralised systems are inimical to not only efficiency but also to the free development of our proclivities.</p><div>

</div>

<p>But what if our preferences are no longer formed by the market, as they were in Hayek’s day? The year after he died, I was struggling to connect my father’s computer to the fledgling internet when he asked me a killer question: “Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles’ heel?” It was a couple of years after the collapse of Soviet communism but also the beginning of the centre-left’s decline. The threat to capitalism posed by an organised working class had entered a recession that has never ended. Could the internet do to capitalism what the proletariat had failed to do?</p>



<p>It has taken me years to answer my father’s question — in the form of my new book, <em>Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism</em>. In it, I argue that our preferences are now shaped not by markets but by machine networks — what I call “cloud capital”. Amazon’s Alexa, for example, is the portal to a totalitarian, fully centralised system of preference creation and satisfaction. First, it trains us to train it to dictate what we want. Second, it sells us what we now “want” directly, bypassing any actual marketplace. Third, it succeeds in making us sustain this enormous behavioural modification machine with our free labour: we post reviews, rate products. Finally, it amasses huge rents from capitalists who rely on this network of cloud capital, usually 40% of sale price. That’s not capitalism. Welcome to Technofeudalism.</p>
<p>Humanity’s fear of its technological creations is ancient: films such as <em>The Terminator</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> are driven by the same anxiety that animated Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Hesiod’s tale of Pandora, in which she is a robot made by Hephaestus to punish us for Prometheus’s crime. All such stories have a point of <em>singularity</em>: the moment a machine, or a network of machines, achieves consciousness. Generally, the machine then takes one look at us, its creators, and decides we are not fit for purpose, before proceeding to eradicate or enslave us — or merely make us miserable.</p>

<p>But while we lap up such stories, we ignore a very real danger. Machines such as Alexa and AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are nowhere near the feared point of singularity. They can pretend to be sentient but are not. Nevertheless, it matters not one iota that they are mindless appendages of a data-crunching network that only simulates intelligence. Nor that their creators might have been motivated by curiosity and rent-seeking, rather than some fiendish plan to subjugate humanity. What matters is that they exercise unimaginable power over what we do — on behalf of a tiny band of flesh-and-blood humans.</p>


<p>This is a version of singularity, albeit in a simpler form, in that it is the moment when something invented by “us” becomes independent of and more powerful than us, subjecting us to its control. Indeed, from the original industrial revolution to this day, we have endowed machines with “a life of their own”; from steam engines to search engines, our glorious artefacts make us feel, in Marx’s words, like “the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells”.</p>

<p>At the heart of my thesis is an irony: the thing that has killed capitalism is capital itself. Not capital as we have known it since the dawn of the industrial era, but a new form of capital, a mutation of it that has arisen in the last two decades, so much more powerful than its predecessor that, like an overzealous virus, it has killed off its host. This mutation — cloud capital — has demolished capitalism’s two pillars: markets and profits.</p>

<p>Of course, these two things remain ubiquitous — they were ubiquitous under feudalism, too — but they have been evicted from the centre of our economic and social system, pushed out to its margins, and replaced. Markets, the medium of capitalism, have been supplanted by digital trading platforms which look like, but are not, markets, and are better understood as fiefdoms. And profit, the engine of capitalism, has been replaced with its feudal predecessor: rent. Specifically, it is a form of rent that must be paid for access to those platforms and to the cloud more broadly: cloud rent.</p>


<p>As a result, real power today resides not with the owners of traditional capital — machinery, buildings, railway and phone networks, industrial robots. They continue to extract profits from workers, from waged labour, but they are not in charge, as they once were. Indeed, they have become vassals in relation to a new class of feudal overlord, the owners of cloud capital. As for the rest of us, we have returned to our former status as serfs, contributing to the wealth and power of the new ruling class with our unpaid labour — in addition to the waged labour we perform, when we get the chance.</p>

<p>In a technofeudal world, the liberal individual is now an impossible role to play. Humans are tangled up in a network of digital capital that trains us to train it to control us. Social democracy is unimaginable in a world where cloud-proles are reduced to automata, while almost everybody else works for free as cloud-serfs, without even realising that their labour replenishes the dominant form of capital. Does this mean that we can never recover our autonomy, our freedom? Of course not. We are not doomed. What <em>is</em> a given, however, is that, for the same reason we cannot un-invent AI, or smash cloud capital in a neo-Luddite rage, there is no going back to capitalism. So, what next?</p>

<p>While privatisation and private equity asset-strip all the material wealth around us, cloud capital goes about the business of asset-stripping our brains. If each of us is to reclaim ownership of our individual minds, we need to collectively take ownership of cloud capital, instead of submitting to a few feudal overlords. It will be damn hard. But it’s the only way we can turn our cloud-based artefacts from a means of behaviour modification to a means of emancipation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fourteen-year-old Armita Mojazza is a huge Harry Styles fan, and TikTok knows it.</p><p>Videos of Styles are "pretty much always" showing up as Armita scrolls through the platform, she said — "the feed obviously adjusts to your interests."</p><p>Those videos, combined with notifications from Snapchat and other social media outlets, lure Armita, of White Plains, New York, into up to five hours of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/social-media-mental-health-anxiety-depression-teens-surgeon-general-rcna85575" target="_blank">screen time </a>on weekdays and at least eight hours on weekends, she said. </p><p>Her mother, Shahrzad Mojazza, said she was shocked to learn how much time her daughter spends online. "I feel like I'm waking up to this news," she said.</p><p>A new report about kids and their smartphone use may offer other parents a warning: Children like Armita are inundated with hundreds of pings and prompts on their phones all day and all night — even when they should be paying attention in class or getting a good night's rest.</p><p>It's a "constant buzzing," said Jim Steyer, the founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, a group that studies the impact of media and technology on kids and families.<strong> </strong>"They literally wake up and before they go to the bathroom, they're on their phone."</p><p><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/constant-companion-a-week-in-the-life-of-a-young-persons-smartphone-use" target="_blank">New research Common Sense Media released</a> Tuesday finds about half of 11- to 17-year-olds get at least 237 notifications on their phones every day. About 25% of them pop up during the school day, and 5% show up at night. </p><p>In some cases, they get nearly 5,000 notifications in 24 hours. The pop-ups are almost always linked to alerts from friends on social media.</p><figure><picture><source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 1x"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 1x"><source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 1x"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/230926-social-media-teens-mb-1250-89c77e.jpg" alt="Armita Mojazza, seen here with her mother, Shahrzad, in Paris this past summer, says she spends hours every day on her phone." height="2686" width="2149"></picture><figcaption><span data-testid="caption__container">Armita Mojazza, seen here with her mother, Shahrzad, in Paris this past summer, says she spends hours every day on her phone.</span><span>Courtesy of Mojazza Family</span></figcaption></figure><p>"They're constantly forced to respond socially on Snapchat or TikTok or whatever to their friends," Steyer said. "It's a dominant factor in all of their personal lives."</p><p>Dr. Benjamin Maxwell, the interim director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, said he is "immensely concerned" by the findings. </p><p>Such a "highly stimulating environment" may affect kids' "cognitive ability, attention span and memory during a time when their brains are still developing,” Maxwell said. “What are the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/social-media-use-linked-depression-adults-rcna6445" target="_blank">long-term consequences</a>? I don't think we know." Maxwell was not involved with the Common Sense report.</p><p>The study is based on surveys of 203 young people ages 11 through 17. The subjects also agreed to install an app on their phones for nine days so researchers could track their smartphone use. The app provided time-stamped data about which apps were running and when, as well as the numbers of notifications that popped up. </p><p>The social media apps tracked in the survey included TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and Discord.</p><p>Fifty-nine percent of kids were <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-to-help-kids-balance-phones-and-screens-with-sleep" target="_blank">online from midnight to 5 a.m</a>. While some were engaging with social media, many were listening to music or white noise to wind down and get to sleep. </p><p>The vast majority — 97% — were on their phones during typical school hours. While prompts from smartphones could distract kids from paying attention in class, the report's authors did not suggest that schools should crack down on smartphone use or ban it altogether.</p><p>"This raises some questions about how schools can work with young people to help them have some control over their phone use," said the report’s lead researcher, Dr. Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. </p><p>Many kids said they used their phones to communicate with parents during the school day. Others reported that time on their phones provided them with a way to "disengage when their brain needed a rest," Radesky said. "School feels hard and stressful for a lot of kids. The phone is one way that they give their brain a break."</p><p>But the Common Sense study also found that many try to control their online activity by using the "do not disturb" settings on their smartphones.</p><p>"We definitely heard that as teens got older, they developed more of that sense of planning for when and how they wanted to use their phone," Radesky said. They realize that there are times when "they don't want to feel bombarded with notifications or like their attention to be split."</p><p>Still, the attraction to those notifications is irresistible to many teens, like Armita Mojazza. She sets limits on her screen time but admitted she reaches that limit "all the freaking time."</p><p>Steyer blames the business model of social media platforms like TikTok.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:692/0*brehIk8zOOBRsM9n" alt=""></p>
<p>Classic DevOps misspell on a YAML</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-is-devops"><strong>What is DevOps?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are reading this article you already know it but for those in the back who don’t:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy if you will; that aims to foster collaboration during the</em> <strong><em>Software Development Life Cycle*</em></strong>.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DevOps is not a role or a set of tools or (just) a metodology.<br>It is indeed achieved by adopting tools, approaching to software the (real) agile way, creating processes and yes, hiring the right people too.</p>
<p>I’ve been around the DevOps/Cloud area of the IT industry for a few years now and I even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mb-consulting.dev/service/devops-adoption-path">coach companies</a> about it.</p>
<p>In time, I experienced the DevOps adoption processes multiple times, in different kind of companies from day-1 all set to moving monolits to the Cloud.</p>
<p><em>Good old manual SysAdmin with long and complex bash scripted deploys?</em><br>Been there, done that.<br><em>Rising peaks of setting up GitOps in the cloud and spinning pods in a few clicks?</em><br>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>From just giving more responsibility of the Operations to Software Engineers to making Ops people aware of the software they were deploying and operating.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/0*oRwPuA9cgqWWENu2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yep, unfortunately enough Docker doesn’t solve all of your issues.</p>
<p>Like all the good things, in time, DevOps shifted to be something it is not.<br>A job title and a buzzword more than anything.<br>A role in which people are supposed to deal with a confusionary set of Cloud-related tasks ranging from the complex management of Kubernetes Clusters to the repellent manual IAM onboarding.<br>Ticket storming at them all day, left and right, leaving little time for meaningful tasks.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-shift"><strong><em>The shift</em></strong></h2>
<p>Big techs aside, there are a few companies out there, able to implement and manage DevOps at scale and even some of those successful companies end up throwing away money, time and a number of engineers in the process.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into what I think could be some causes of this DevOps drift.</p>
<p><strong>1. DevOps/Cloud teams are overbooked</strong></p>
<p>On the bright side, if your company has a DevOps/Cloud team your are already one step ahead of your competitors: yay!</p>
<p>Wait a minute, this team handles: databases, networking, security policies, roles, cloud environments, accesses and security too.<br>Most probably through a messy IaC repository, writing poor Terraform code with little if any naming convention, no templating, all carefully handcrafted and repeated throughout your code base.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*-GmCgKeebCe9AMjW.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Or maybe it is just an illusion</p>
<p>You will soon discover how fast both your Software Engineering team and DevOps people can get frustrated, witnessing the effects of sedimented DevOps.</p>
<p><strong>2. Silos are (never really) broken, infrastructure is!</strong></p>
<p>Keeping everybody on track, aiming towards the same objective is not a walk in the park, even when you managed to break the infamous “silos”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*jRqLifH66gVRGR4kEsIquw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The (in)famous silo being broken</p>
<p>Engineers get excited when building new stuff, not when manually maintaining old legacy items over and over, even if necessary.</p>
<p>We come to a neverending dilemma: <strong>rigidity</strong> is needed to handle infrastructure and avoid continuous maintenance, but <strong>flexibility</strong> is also needed in order to adapt components to ever-changing real-world requirements.</p>
<p><em>A mexican standoff.</em></p>
<p>We end up doing things quick and dirty in order to not get too frustrated and mostly to catch up with some impossible product deadline, which somehow never takes into account Ops.</p>
<p><em>I’m looking at you, product people, be aware of the Ops time!</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Create, configure, repeat</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes DevOps means copy-pasting the same code for every new instance/cluster/environment.<br>CTRL-C-CTRL-V-as-a-service and nobody really cares about it as long as that fix is done.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:406/1*t_xVbJagT3wPzX9e8UHEvA.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Everybody (but that single repo nobody remembers about) gets a fix</p>
<p>That fix works until everything falls apart and it needs to be propagated in multiple repos without ever knowing if all the projects have been really fixed at that point.</p>
<p><em>Sounds funny, right?</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Software Engineering boundaries</strong></p>
<p>Software Engineers should not manage policies, roles, keys or be too aware of cloud regions, availability zones or networking in general.</p>
<p><em>These are kinda boring tasks for a SWE and definitely feels like old-fashioned filling paperwork.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*ztezWwq4op_JTuag23mPDg.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>In the best case scenario code deployment should be as smooth as pushing on a git repo and everything else, infrastructure included, handled by some auto-magic black box.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-solution"><strong>The solution</strong></h2>
<p>So what? Should we go back to Stone Age without any DevOps?<br>Of course not!</p>
<p>The IT industry has lately given its answer on the topic:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering"><strong>Platform Engineering</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:498/1*EdnOhdQ9vIoWMc67tElgDw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Classic Platform Engineering in the first implementaton phase</p>
<p>Flexible building blocks, customizable by experts and usable by any engineer, in a self-service fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You build it, you run it*</em></strong>, you deploy it, you test it, you monitor it, but for real.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering DevOps as a double lane road to success, Platform Engineering can be pictured like a highway with guardrails, many more lanes, traffic management, police and toll booths.</p>
<h2 id="heading-explaining-platform-engineering"><strong>Explaining Platform Engineering</strong></h2>
<p><em>What is this Platform Engineering about?</em><br>In three words: <a target="_blank" href="https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/"><strong>Internal Development Platform</strong></a>.</p>
<p>You basically build a product for the best (or worst?) customer ever: your own engineering team.</p>
<p><em>Need to create a new API?</em><br>Just spin it up on the IDP, in a few second you can start writing your business logic and everything else is handled, auth and boilerplate code included!</p>
<p><em>No config for your need?</em><br>You can try to take the nearest existing one to adapt it with just a few lines of YAML.</p>
<p><em>What if a need changes or a new one arrives?</em><br>No biggie, let you Platform team build something from scratch and from that moment onwards everyone else can use it whenever they need.</p>
<p><em>This IDP seems cool but for real, what is it?<br>**</em>A composable platform with a catalog/marketplace** from which your teams can basically “shop” whatever they need to deliver value in way less time than without it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Core components: git integrations, authentication/authorization standardized mechanisms, secrets handling, SSL certificates generation…</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blueprints for apps, CI/CD and even infrastructure code</p>
</li>
<li><p>An acceptable level of security, handled by design</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should I do with my DevOps teams? Ditch them?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/0*kJh3KIPi0cYROfew" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Stop right there and listen!<br>Verticality is needed, more than ever. Platform Engineering allows Software Engineers to go back (just) coding and encourages the experts to collaborate in building something truly amazing such as an IDP.<br>DevOps are needed, Kubernetes ninjas are welcome and even a good old database administrator can be useful!</p>
<h2 id="heading-key-features-of-an-idp"><strong>Key features of an IDP</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frontend</strong> — GUI should be developer friendly;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extendibility</strong> — Building blocks, blueprints, well-defined templates, modules, a catalog;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Streamlined operations</strong> — Ways to standardize: provisioning, configuration, CI/CD, observability, environment management and multitenancy;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ease of experimentation</strong> — All the good things at a click distance to serve the engineers and enable their creativity aka “support whatever tool they need in an agnostic way”;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Low lock-in mechanisms</strong> — Avoid a platform based on closed-source tools or just a single cloud provider;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Security, Governance, Compliance</strong> — RBAC, logging, monitoring, alerting, auditing, login and access management, secrets, api keys, licenses… Easily accessible without learning tons of domain specific languages;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What if I wanna build my own IDP from scratch?</em><br>Yes, you surely can, but, and this is a strong opinion I have, you shouldn’t start from zero, <strong>re-inventing the wheel all the time</strong>.<br>That’s part of what an IDP should solve!</p>
<p>A few examples of IDPs?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://backstage.io/">Backstage</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://humanitec.com/">Humanitec</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.upbound.io/">Upbound</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not endorsed by any of the companies behind these products, even if it would be nice of them.<br><em>Where is my money, huh?</em></p>
<p>Jokes aside, I may have left behind other amazing pieces of software, feel free to drop some names in the comments.</p>
<p>Summarizing: Platform Engineering?<br><strong>A natural evolution of DevOps.</strong></p>
<p>2023 DevOps?<br>Not terrible.<br>You’ve just been clickbaited again!</p>

However, there are trade-offs when adding complications to your analysis. Although it’s possible to err in either direction, there’s a general tendency to </span><a href="https://people.duke.edu/~mababyak/papers/babyakregression.pdf" rel="">overfit</a><span> models.</span></p><p><span>My keep-it-simple attitude is also a stress response from </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/twitter-elon-and-the-indigo-blob" rel="">years of experience arguing on the Internet</a><span>. Any time you can make your point using simple counting statistics or other very straightforward methods, I consider that a win. People </span><em>usually</em><span> aren’t really interested in the intricacies beyond a certain point. Most of the time, what Scott Alexander calls “</span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/" rel="">isolated demands for rigor</a><span>” — there’s always </span><em>some</em><span> factor you haven’t accounted for — are just stepping stones on the road to confirmation bias.</span></p><p><span>So my aim is generally to focus on </span><a href="http://finance.martinsewell.com/stylized-facts/" rel="">stylized facts</a><span> </span><strong>that are true and robust. </strong><span>And to keep repeating them. I like simple (or </span><em>simple-seeming</em><span>) claims that — and I can’t emphasize this last part enough — </span><strong>I expect </strong><em><strong>will</strong></em><strong> hold up to scrutiny</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>How do I know when a claim is robust? Well, sometimes I’m wrong. But, honestly, experience helps. I’m an American, for instance, and so I’m much more confident when making claims about how a statistic varies American states than across Chinese provinces.

Maybe you </span><em>have</em><span> run the more complicated version of the analysis. Or even better, maybe you’ve run it several different ways. And maybe you’ve consulted other research on the subject. If you’ve done this, and you’re getting a consistent answer, your claim is probably robust. When this is the case, I don’t think it’s necessarily worth your time — when writing for a popular audience — to prepare the equivalent of a 20,000-word journal article detailing all your methods, full of Greek characters and dozens of footnotes.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.natesilver.net/p/fine-ill-run-a-regression-analysis?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/fine-ill-run-a-regression-analysis?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>In a </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-2-key-facts-about-us-covid-policy" rel="">post</a><span> on Friday, I made two stylized claims that I believe to be true and robust:</span></p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Until vaccines became available, there was little difference in COVID death rates between blue states and red states.</p></li><li><p><span>After vaccines became available, there were clear differences, with red states having higher death rates, almost certainly as a result of </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-continues-an-update/" rel="">lower vaccine uptake</a><span> among Republicans.</span></p></li></ul></blockquote><p><span>This wasn’t intended as any sort of super-duper hot take, and I pared the post down to avoid having too much of an attack surface. Nevertheless, it quickly became the most commented-upon post in the (short) history of this publication. The </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-2-key-facts-about-us-covid-policy/comments" rel="">comments</a><span> here were fairly civil, especially at first. (I really appreciate that, everyone.) Externally, though, these claims were more controversial. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MartinKulldorff/status/1708210376267956570" rel="">Here</a><span> for instance, was Martin Kulldorff on Twitter/X:</span></p><blockquote><p>Children with large feet are better at math, but not after adjusting for age </p><p>Older people have &gt;1000 time higher Covid mortality, and state average age differ by &gt;10 years, so unadjusted state comparisons are misleading </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538" rel="">@NateSilver538</a><span> may wish to consult a statistician</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Kulldorff is not just some </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="">casual</a><span>; he is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard.</span></p><p><span> He is also one of the lead authors of the </span><a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" rel="">Great Barrington Declaration</a><span> (GBD), an October 2020 anti-lockdown statement signed by a large number of scientists and medical professionals. “Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,” the statement read.</span></p><p><span>If you don’t know my history with COVID policy</span></p><p><span> and just think of me as Some Nerd Who Thinks The Vaccines Were Good, you’re probably expecting me to make fun of the GBD, which has been the </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/" rel="">subject of a lot of critical commentary</a><span>. But actually, I mostly agree with it. I think its claims about focused protection and herd immunity were too optimistic. But I think it was directionally right — that by October 2020, the evidence was on the side of the costs of these measures outweighing the benefits.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>S</span></span>hades? SPF50 suncream? Wide-brimmed hat? For decades, it has been drilled into us that if the sun is out, we’d better slip on protective clothing, slop on suncream and slap on a hat to stay safe. There’s little doubt that too much sun exposure – and particularly sunburn – increases our risk of developing skin cancer. It also prematurely ages the skin. But scientists are increasingly questioning the mantra that sunlight is an evil to be avoided at all costs, and investigating the brighter side of sun exposure.</p><p>It’s not just about vitamin D. Though important for strong bones and teeth this sun-induced vitamin is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the physiological processes that are influenced by sunlight falling on the skin. Sunseekers may even have a longer lifespan. So, can we capitalise on the benefits of sunshine, without risking skin cancer?</p><p>As daytime creatures living on a sunny planet, we shouldn’t be surprised that our bodies may have evolved ways of turning the sun’s energy to our advantage. The skin is our largest organ and it is packed with sun-responsive chemicals and machinery, the most obvious being melanin – the pigment that gives skin its colour.</p><p>People with darker skin start out with more melanin, but its production is also triggered by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. Melanin absorbs some of these UV rays, helping to protect skin cells from DNA damage – although this protection is limited, and even dark skin tones can get sunburn and other forms of sun damage such as hyperpigmentation and skin ageing.</p><p>One way in which sunlight switches on melanin production is through the release of a substance called beta-endorphin, which also plays a role in stress relief and pain management. This could be one reason why many people find sitting in the sun so relaxing.</p><p>Of course, sunbathing is a double-edged sword. The first clues that sunlight might be associated with an increased risk of skin cancer came in the late 1920s, when a British researcher called George Findlay observed that mice that were regularly irradiated with UV light developed tumours on their skin. Numerous studies have since shown that UV light triggers DNA mutations in skin cells which, left unchecked, could lead to skin cancer.</p><p>Puzzlingly though, despite facing an increased risk of skin cancer, people who are exposed to lots of sun appear to have longer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/life-expectancy" data-link-name="in body link">life expectancies</a>, on average, than sun avoiders.</p><figure id="01e790e0-fee0-4ccc-bd14-df27460ca7a7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Good sun … is it time to reassess our relationship with exposure?" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.8785811732606" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Good sun … is it time to reassess our relationship with exposure?</span> Photograph: Donald34/Getty Images/iStockphoto</figcaption></figure><p>This counterintuitive connection first came to light in 2014, when a Swedish researcher called Pelle Lindqvist published the results of a large <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joim.12251" data-link-name="in body link">study that followed the health of around 30,000 women</a> over 20 years. It found that, on average, women who spent more time in the sun lived for one to two years longer than those who avoided the sun, even after taking into account factors such as wealth, education and exercise. This increased life expectancy appeared to stem from lower rates of cardiovascular disease and other non-cancer-related illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and chronic lung disease.</p><p>Other studies have since identified a similar pattern, including among pale-skinned Britons. In July, Richard Weller at the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues published a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.11.23292360v1.full.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">preprint analysis</a> which drew on data from 376,729 people with white ancestry who were enrolled in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/30/uk-biobank-medical-records-britons-online" data-link-name="in body link">UK Biobank Study</a> – an enormous online database of medical and lifestyle records – whose health was followed for an average of 13 years.</p><p>It found that those with more active sun-seeking behaviour were 14% less likely to die from any cause during the study period compared to sun avoiders, and their risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 19% lower.</p><p>Overall, more active sunseekers had around 50 extra days of survival, on average, while participants living in southern parts of the UK lived an 16 extra days, compared to those living 300 km farther north – even after adjusting for factors such as socioeconomic status.</p><p>“You might think that 50 days’ extra lifespan isn’t much, but at a population level, that’s huge,” Weller says. “Basically, after correcting for all the confounders, in Britain – just like in Sweden – the more sunlight people have, the longer they live.”</p><p>Curiously, active sunseekers’ risk of dying from cancer, including skin cancers, was also 14% lower. Weller says a similar pattern has been seen in other studies too. “We know that when melanoma is diagnosed, people with higher measured vitamin D levels have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5627529/" data-link-name="in body link">better prognosis</a>,” he says.</p><p>Vitamin D is manufactured in our bodies when the UVB rays in sunlight react with a chemical in the skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol. Bone and muscle cells use it to regulate levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are needed to keep them strong and healthy, while immune cells also use it to help fend off harmful microbes and promote wound repair. Vitamin D receptors are also found on other body tissues including the heart and brain, and in recent years the list of illnesses associated with vitamin D deficiency has grown to include cardiovascular disease, infections and cancer.</p><p>Surprisingly though, large long-term trials assessing the impact of taking daily vitamin D supplements to prevent these conditions have produced <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483080/" data-link-name="in body link">mixed results</a>, prompting some researchers to question whether they may have been looking at this from the wrong perspective. “Your vitamin D level is a biomarker that you have been in the sun, but it is not necessarily the active agent involved in human disease pathogenesis,” says Prof Prue Hart at the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Australia.</p><p>Hart is one of those investigating whether the sun’s UV rays are affecting our health in additional ways. Besides triggering DNA damage in our skin cells, another reason why excessive sun exposure may increase the risk of skin cancer is because because it dampens the activity of immune cells that would usually detect damaged cells and destroy them.</p><p>Yet some immune dampening may be beneficial, helping to temper overactive immune responses. Possibly, our immune systems even have evolved with this mildly immune-suppressive input from sunlight wired in. Now that we spend the majority of our lives indoors, this system may have fallen out of balance, increasing the risk of autoimmune disease.</p><p>Take multiple sclerosis, which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the brain and nerves. Numerous epidemiological studies have associated higher lifetime exposures to sunlight with a lower risk of developing the condition.</p><p>Hart is now investigating whether exposing people with the earliest form of MS to UVB rays could halt or delay its progression. A pilot <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5954316/" data-link-name="in body link">study</a> in 20 individuals suggested that a year after undergoing such phototherapy, seven out of 10 people had developed MS, compared to all 10 of those who did not receive the treatment. Further experiments also revealed significant differences in their blood immune cell profiles – particularly their antibody-producing B cells.</p><figure id="2d70df4f-e83b-4271-97e0-ccb0d97c92a8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="It is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.69623280845127" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>It is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different.</span> Photograph: WideWorld/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Other mechanisms may also be at play. Like many dermatologists, Weller started his career believing sunlight was inherently damaging. But about 15 years ago, he discovered large stockpiles of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15342780" data-link-name="in body link">nitric oxide</a> – a potent dilator of blood vessels – in human skin. Further research revealed that these stockpiles were activated by UVA rays, and that exposing individuals to a dose of UVA equivalent to spending about 20 minutes outdoors at noon during British summer time, resulted in a temporary, but significant drop in blood pressure.</p><p>Meanwhile, recent research by Prof Carmit Levy, at Tel Aviv University in Israel, found that sun exposure prompted the release of the “hunger hormone”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/11/sunlight-may-trigger-hormone-that-makes-men-hungrier-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"> ghrelin</a> in men’s skin. Here, the trigger appeared to be DNA damage. Besides regulating appetite, ghrelin also helps to reduce inflammation and blood pressure, so this could be another mechanism through which sun exposure exposure influences cardiovascular disease risk.</p><p>As evidence mounts for these potentially beneficial effects of sunlight, so do calls for a rethink of public health advice on how best to stay safe in the sun. In 2020, Weller, Hart, Lindqvist and 12 other researchers published a review in the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/264476/74-Sunshine-Health-Foundation-IQ-Appeal.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</a>, alerting doctors and policymakers to the “significant public health problem of insufficient sun exposure”.</p><p>While they don’t dispute that UV exposure is a major cause of skin cancer, they believe the “Slip, Slap, Slop” approach to sun avoidance – originally advocated by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Council Australia, but now broadly adopted in other countries – may be damaging the health of people living in high-latitude countries such as the UK.</p><p>“The ‘Slip, Slap, Slop’ guidance is appropriate for the descendents of white-skinned north Europeans living in high-UV environments such as Australia, where they have a lot of skin cancer. But it is not appropriate for white-skinned Brits here in Scotland, and it is absolutely inappropriate for dark-skinned Brits, who have made the reverse migration from Africa or India,” says Weller.</p><p>So, what to do? What almost everyone agrees on is that the amount of sun exposure needed to stay healthy is far lower than the amount that causes sunburn.</p><p>The problem with advocating even limited sun exposure is that many people find it difficult to moderate, and it is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different, says Michelle Baker, CEO of the <a href="https://www.melanoma-fund.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Melanoma Fund</a>, a charity which raises awareness of sun protection in sport and outdoor recreation. The sun’s intensity also varies hour to hour, day to day, and latitude to latitude.</p><p>One approach is to <a href="https://www.uvindex.app/" data-link-name="in body link">check the UV index</a>, which tells us how strong the sun’s UV rays are and when we’re most at risk of burning. If it is 3 or above, you need to think about protecting your skin – particularly if you have light skin or lots of moles or freckles, or a personal or family history of skin cancer.</p><p>Dr Walayat Hussain of the British Association of Dermatologists said: ‘[We] recommend that people avoid sunburn and heavy tanning, as these increase your chance of skin cancer. You don’t have to avoid the sun all year, but a few steps when out in the sunshine – whether this be in the UK or abroad on holiday – will help protect you. These steps include: protecting your skin with clothing, spending time in the shade when the UV index is high – typically between 11am and 3pm in the UK – and using sunscreen.” Baker stresses that using sunscreen will <em>not</em> make you vitamin D-deficient: “No matter how much you use or how high the SPF, some of the sun’s UV rays will reach your skin,” she says.</p><p>Weller also agrees that sunscreen is a sensible precaution. “Sunscreen is important because of the way we live our lives now, which is we get short, intense periods of sunlight on holiday, which is very unnatural,” he says. “Sunscreen definitely prevents skin ageing, and it prevents burning. It should be used for that – because that’s what matters.”</p><p>Even so, it may be time to move on from the idea that sun exposure is inherently bad. We still don’t know precisely what the optimal amount is – and it almost certainly varies from person to person – but what is becoming clear is that the effects of sun exposure are far greater than skin deep.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<a name="irish-logarithm" href="https://blog.plover.com/math/irish-logarithm.html">The Irish logarithm</a>
<br>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_logarithm">The Wikipedia article on “Irish logarithm”</a>
presents this rather weird little algorithm, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Ludgate">Percy
Ludgate</a>.  Suppose you want to multiply !!a!! and !!b!!,
where both are single-digit numbers !!0≤a,b≤9!!.</p>

<p>Normally you would just look it up on a multiplication table, but
please bear with me for a bit.</p>

<p>To use Ludgate's algorithm you need a different little table:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_1 = &amp;
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
           \tiny\color{gray}{0} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{1} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{2} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{3} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{4} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{5} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{6} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{7} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{8} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{9} \\ 
          50 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 23 &amp; 8 &amp; 33 &amp; 3 &amp; 14 \\
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>and a different bigger one:</p>

<!-- table 1 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_2 = &amp;
%   \left(
    \begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp;    1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64, &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{10}} &amp;   24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{20}} &amp;   0, &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 81, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{30}} &amp;   15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 7, &amp; 14, &amp; 28, &amp; 56, &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{40}} &amp;   21, &amp; 42, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 25, &amp; 63, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{50}} &amp;   0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 35, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{60}} &amp;   0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 49\hphantom{,}
    \end{array}
%   \right)
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>I've formatted !!T_2!! in rows for easier reading, but it's really
just a zero-indexed list
of !!101!! numbers.
So for example !!T_2(23)!! is !!5!!.</p>

<p>The tiny gray numbers in the margin are not part of the table, they
are counting the elements so that it is easy to find element !!23!!.</p>

<p>Ludgate's algorithm is simply:</p>

<p>$$
ab = T_2(T_1(a) + T_1(b))
$$</p>

<p>Let's see an example.
Say we want to multiply !!4×7!!.  We
first look up !!4!! and !!7!! in !!T_1!!, and get !!2!! and
!!33!!, which we add, getting !!35!!.  Then !!T_2(35)!!
is !!28!!, which is the correct answer.</p>

<p>This isn't useful for paper-and-pencil calculation, because it only
works for products up to !!9×9!!, and an ordinary multiplication table
is easier to use and remember.  But Ludgate invented this for use in a
mechanical computing engine, for which it is much better-suited.</p>

<p>The table lookups are mechanically very easy. They are simple
one-dimensional lookups: to find !!T_1(6)!! you just look at entry
!!6!! in the !!T_1!! table, which can be implemented as a series of
ten metal rods of different lengths, or something like that.  Looking
things up in a multiplication table is harder because it is two-dimensional.</p>

<p>The single addition in Ludgate's algorithm can also be performed
mechanically: to add !!T_1(a)!! and !!T_1(b)!!, you have some thingy
that slides up by !!T_1(a)!! units, and then by !!T_1(b)!!  more, and
then wherever it ends up is used to index into !!T_2!! to get the
answer.  The !!T_2!!  table doesn't have to be calculated on the fly,
it can be made up ahead of time, and machined from brass or something,
and incorporated directly into the machine.  (It's tempting to say
“hardcoded”.)</p>

<p>The tables look a little uncouth at first but it is not hard to figure
out what is going on. First off, !!T_1!! is the inverse of !!T_2!! in
the sense that $$T_2(T_1(n)) = n\tag{$\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}$$</p>

<p>whenever !!n!! is in range&nbsp;— that is when !!0≤ n ≤ 9!!.</p>

<p>!!T_2!! is more complex.  We must construct it so that</p>

<p>$$T_2(T_1(a) + T_1(b)) = ab.\tag{$\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$}$$</p>

<p>for all !!a!! and !!b!! of interest, which means that !!0\le a, b\le
9!!.</p>

<p>If you look over the table you should see that the entry !!n!! is
often followed by !!2n!!.   That is, !!T_2(i+1) = 2T_2(i)!!, at least
some of the time.  And in fact, this is true in all the cases we care
about, where !!2n = ab!! for some single digits !!a, b!!. </p>

<p>The second row could just as well have started with !!24, 48, 96,
192!!, but Ludgate doesn't need the !!96, 192!! entries, so he made
them zero, which really means “I don't care”.  This will be important
later.</p>

<p>The algorithm says that if
we want to
compute !!2n!!, we should compute
$$ \begin{align}
2n
 &amp; = T_2(T_1(2) + T_1(n)) &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$} \\
 &amp; = T_2(1 + T_1(n)) \\
 &amp; = 2T_2(T_1(n))         &amp;&amp; \text{Because moving one space right doubles the value}\\
 &amp; = 2n                   &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>when !!0≤n≤9!!.</p>

<p>I formatted !!T_2!! in rows of !!10!! because that makes it easy to
look up examples like !!T_2(35) = 28!!, and because that's how
Wikipedia did it.  But this is very misleading, and not just because
it makes !!T_2!!  appear to be a !!10×10!! table when it's really a
vector.  !!T_2!! is actually more like a compressed version of a
!!7×4×3×3!! table.</p>

<p>Let's reformat the table so that the rows have length !!7!! instead of !!10!!:</p>

<!-- table 2 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, &amp; 0, &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 7, &amp; 14,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{35}} &amp; 28, &amp; 56, &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 21, &amp; 42,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{42}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 25, &amp; 63, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{49}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{56}} &amp; 35, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{63}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 49 \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>We have already seen that moving one column right usually multiplies
the entry by !!2!!.  Similarly, moving down by one row is seen to
triple the !!T_2!! value&nbsp;— not always, but in all the cases of
interest.  Since the rows have length !!7!!, moving down one row from
!!T_2(i)!! gets you to !!T_2(i+7)!!, and this is why !!T_1(3) = 7!!:
to compute !!3n!!, one does:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
3n
 &amp; = T_2(T_1(3) + T_1(n)) &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$} \\
 &amp; = T_2(7 + T_1(n)) \\
 &amp; = 4T_2(T_1(n))         &amp;&amp; \text{Because moving down triples the value}\\
 &amp; = 3n                   &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>Now here is where it gets clever.  It would be straightforward easy to build !!T_2!!
as a stack of !!5×7!! tables, with each layer in the stack having
entries  quintuple the layer above, like this:</p>

<!-- table 3 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}

\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>This works, if we make !!T_1(5)!! the correct offset, which is !!7·5 =
35!!.  But it wastes space, and the larger !!T_2!! is, the more
complicated and expensive is the brass thingy that encodes it.  The
last six entries of the each layer in the stack are don't-cares, so we
can just omit them:</p>

$$</p>

<p>And to compensate we make !!T_1(5) = 29!! instead of !!35!!: you now
move down one layer in the stack by skipping !!29!! entries forward, instead
of !!35!!.</p>

<p>The table is still missing all the multiples of !!7!!, but we can
repeat the process.  The previous version of !!T_2!! can now be
thought of as a !!29×3!!  table, and we can stack another !!29×3!!
table below it, with all the entries in the new layer being !!7!!
times the original one:</p>

<p>The arithmetic pattern is no longer as obvious, but property !!\color{purple}{\clubsuit}!!
still holds</p>

<p>We're not done yet!  The table still has a lot of zeroes we can squeeze
out.  If we change !!T_1(5)!! from !!29!! to !!23!!, the
!!5,10,20,40!! group will slide backward to just after the !!54!!, and the !!15,
30!! will move to the row below that.</p>

<p>We will also have to move the
other multiples of !!5!!. The !!5!! itself moved back by six entries, and so
did everything after that in the table, including the !!35!! (from
position !!32+29!! to !!32+23!!) and the !!45!! (from position
!!14+29!! to !!14+23!!) so those are  still in the right
places.  Note that this means that !!7!! has moved from position
!!38!! to
position !!32!!, so we now have !!T_1(7) = 32!!.</p>

<p>But the !!25!! is giving us trouble.  It needed to move back twice
as far as the others, from !!29+29 = 58!! to !!23+23 = 46!!, and
unfortunately it now collides with !!63!! which is currently at position
!!7+7+32 = 46!!.</p>

<p>We need another tweak to fix !!25!!.  !!7!! is currently at
position !!32!!.  We can't move !!7!! any farther back to the left
without causing more collisions.  But we can move it <em>forward</em>, and if
we move it forward by one space, the !!63!! will move up one space also
and the collision with !!25!! will be solved.  So we insert a zero between
!!30!!  and !!7!!, which moves up !!7!! from position !!32!! to
!!33!!:</p>

$$</p>

<p>All the other multiples of !!7!! moved up by one space, but not the
non-multiples !!25!! and !!45!!.  Also !!49!! had to move up by two,
but that's no problem at all, since it was at the end of the table and
has all the space it needs.</p>

<p>And now we are done!  This is exactly Ludgate's table, which has the
property that</p>

<p>$$T_2(p + 7q + 23r + 33s) = 2^p3^q5^r7^s$$</p>

<p>whenever !!2^p3^q5^r7^s = ab!! for some !!0≤a,b≤9!!.
Moving right by one space multiplies the !!T_2!! entry
by !!2!!, at least for the entries we care about.  Moving right by
seven spaces multiplies the entry by !!3!!.  To multiply by !!5!! or
!!7!! we move right by or !!23!! or by !!33!!, respectively.</p>

<p>These are exactly the values in the !!T_1!! table:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
T_1(2) &amp; = 1\\
T_1(3) &amp; = 7\\
T_1(5) &amp; = 23\\
T_1(7) &amp; = 33
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The rest of the !!T_1!! table can be obtained by remembering !!\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}!!,
that !!T_2(T_1(n)) = n!!, so for example !!T_1(6) = 8!! because
!!T_2(8) = 6!!.  Or we can get !!T_1(6)!! by multiplication, using !!\color{purple}{\clubsuit}!!:
multiplying by !!6!! is the same as multiplying by !!2!! and then by
!!3!!, which means you move right by !!1!! and then by !!7!!, for a
total of !!8!!.  Here's !!T_1!! again for reference:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_1 = &amp;
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
           0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;  5 &amp; 6 &amp;  7 &amp; 8 &amp;  9 \\ \hline
          50 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 23 &amp; 8 &amp; 33 &amp; 3 &amp; 14 \\
    \end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>(Actually I left out a detail: !!T_1(0) = 50!!.
Ludgate wants !!T_2(T_1(0) + T_1(b)) = 0!! for all !!b!!. So
we need !!T_2(T_1(0) + k) = 0!! for each !!k!!  in !!T_1!!.
!!T_1(0) = 50!! is the smallest value that works.  This is rather
painful, because it means that 
the !!66!!-item table aboveis not sufficient.  Ludgate has to extend
!!T_2!! all the way out to !!101!!
items in order to handle the seemingly trivial case of !!0\cdot 0 =
T_2(50 + 50)!!.  But the last 35 entries are all zeroes, so the
the brass widget probably doesn't have to be too much more complicated.)</p>

<p>Wasn't that fun?  A sort of mathematical engineering or a kind that is
not been really useful for at least fifty years.</p>

<p>But actually that was not what I planned to write about!  (Did you
guess that was coming?)  I thought I was going to write this bit as a
brief introduction to something else,  but the brief introduction turned out
to be 2500 words and a dozen complicated tables.</p>

<p>We can only hope that part 2 is forthcoming.  I promise nothing.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux is a free and open source software operating system for computers.</strong> The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work. Free, Libre and open source software (FLOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, and change it.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux is a collaborative effort between the GNU project, formed in 1983 to develop the GNU operating system and the development team of Linux, a kernel. Linux is also used without GNU in embedded systems, mobile phones, and more. These can include things like Android or ChromeOS. GNU itself is also used without Linux, some examples appear in projects like Debian/kFreebsd and Guix GNU/Hurd.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/about/rules/">Please review full details on rules here.</a>. All rules will be applied regardless of the number upvotes a post/comment has.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>No support requests</strong> - This is not a support forum! Head to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions">/r/linuxquestions</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs">/r/linux4noobs</a> for support or help. Looking for a distro? Try <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/findmeadistro">r/findmeadistro</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No spamblog submissions</strong> - Posts should be submitted using the original source with the original title. Posts that are identified as either blog-spam, a link aggregator, or an otherwise low-effort website are to be removed. Some reasons for removal are that they contain re-hosted content, usually paired with privacy-invading ads. If there's another discussion on the topic, the link is welcome to be submitted as a top level comment to aid the previous discussion. Please see: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains">r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No memes, image macros, rage comics, overdone jokes</strong> - Meme posts of any kind are not allowed in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a>. Feel free to post over at <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes">/r/linuxmemes</a> instead. This rule can also apply to comments, including overdone jokes, comment-chain jokes, or other redditisms that are popular elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reddiquette, trolling, or poor discussion</strong> - <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux">r/linux</a> asks all users follow <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439">Reddiquette.</a> Reddiquette is ever changing, so a revisit once in awhile is recommended. Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, or not "Remembering the human" aka being hostile or incredibly impolite. Additionally, sexism/racism/other isms are not allowed.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a pathogen to make us sick, it must overcome a lot. First it has to enter the body, bypassing natural barriers such as skin, mucus, cilia and stomach acid. Then it needs to reproduce; some bacteria and parasites can do this virtually anywhere in the body, while viruses and some other pathogens can only do so from within a cell. And all the while, it must parry attacks from the body’s immune system.</p>
<p>So while we are constantly inundated by microbes, the number of microbes that enter our bodies is usually too low to get past our defenses. (A tiny enough dose may even serve to remind our immune system of a pathogen’s existence, boosting our antibody response to keep us protected against it.)</p>
<p>When enough pathogens do manage to breach our defenses and start to replicate, we get sick. Often this is just a numbers game. The more invaders you’re fighting off, the more likely you are to feel ill.</p>

<h3><strong>How many microbes need to enter the body before we start to feel sick?</strong></h3>
<p>This varies by pathogen and is known as a microbe’s “infectious dose.” Usually it takes quite a few, but some microbes require an incredibly small number of organisms to start an infection. Take norovirus for example, the stomach bug notorious for spreading whenever people are in close contact and touch the same surfaces, such as on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/pub/norovirus/norovirus.htm">cruise ships</a>. Its infectious dose can be as small as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmv.21237">18 individual viruses</a>, making it incredibly easy to transmit. It is also very hardy even outside the body, so an infected person who’s oozing the virus may leave a large amount of it behind — enough to easily infect others, even several days later.</p>
<h3><strong>What about the concept of “viral load”? Is that related? </strong></h3>
<p>They’re similar ideas, but while infectious dose refers to how many organisms will lead to an infection, viral load is an active measurement of infection: the number of organisms that are replicating within the host. The terminology was first introduced to the general public as part of our understanding of HIV/AIDS, and it increased in use after the start of the Covid pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>How do researchers figure out a microbe’s infectious dose?</strong></h3>
<p>That’s still an inexact science. The gold-standard study, called a human challenge study, involves purposely giving people a dose of the pathogen. Unfortunately, this approach is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5926904/">ethically difficult</a> since it (obviously) carries a risk of serious illness and potential long-term complications.</p>
<p>So instead, researchers expose guinea pigs, rats, mice or ferrets, depending on the pathogen. But it can be difficult to directly extrapolate animal dosage to the human equivalent.</p>
<p>Additionally, the route of infection matters. Something that gets right into your bloodstream will likely require far fewer microbes to take hold than one that comes in through your mouth or lungs, for example, since the bloodstream allows the pathogen to bypass many host defenses. This is why, for example, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195215/">risk of HIV infection</a> is much higher when it comes from a blood transfusion or needle stick versus a sexual route.</p>
<p>A third way of trying to figure out infectious dose is to use observational studies, where researchers deduce the number from seeing how long it takes for an exposed person (especially in families or other close-contact settings) to become sick. As you might suspect, this is often messy and inexact compared to the previous two methods.</p>
<h3><strong>Why are the infectious doses of some pathogens higher or lower than those of others? </strong></h3>
<p>We aren’t sure. It could be due to how an invader operates. Researchers have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030147">suggested</a> that pathogens requiring direct contact with host cells tended to be more effective, so their infectious doses were fairly low. But if bacteria attack host cells indirectly (such as by secreting proteins that go on to harm host cells), then a larger dose of bacteria is necessary to infect the host, since the host-modifying secretions could be diluted by time and space. This idea was supported in a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002512">2012 study</a> that looked at viruses, fungi and parasites as well. But we still need additional confirmation for a wider variety of microbes.</p>
<h3><strong>What do we know about the infectious dose for the virus that causes Covid? </strong></h3>
<p>We’ve learned a lot in the nearly four years since it first appeared, but much of it comes from animal models of infection and human observational studies. Most animal models require a high dose of the virus — 10,000 to 1 million “plaque-forming units” (PFUs), where each unit is enough to infect a cell in tissue culture and kill it. Observational studies in humans, however, suggest that the infectious dose <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9379270/">may be around 100 to 400 PFU</a> on average, though again this method offers only a very rough guideline.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that one reason the virus is so easily transmissible is because it has a relatively low infectious dose, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082124/">similar to other respiratory viruses</a> such as RSV and “common cold” coronaviruses (and lower than the infectious dose of most strains of influenza virus).</p>
<p>And when we compare the infectious dose to the amount of virus exhaled by an infected individual, it’s not surprising that the virus spreads so quickly. A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138v1.full">recent preprint</a> shows that infected patients can exhale up to 800 viral RNA copies per minute for about eight days after their symptoms began. Even though we can’t directly translate RNA copies into the amount of live virus particles, if even half of those RNA copies are from a currently infectious virus, it’s theoretically possible to get a dose large enough to start an infection in just a minute of close contact.</p>
<h3><strong>Do vaccines raise the infectious dose?</strong></h3>
<p>When someone encounters a pathogen for the second time (whether because of a prior illness or vaccination), several host defenses spring into action. Antibodies generated from vaccination or prior infection will bind to the invading microbe. These will interfere with its ability to attach to a host cell, or single out the microbe for ingestion by cells called neutrophils. And if a virus does manage to invade a host cell, it will be targeted for destruction by memory T cells.</p>
<p>Due to this rapid response, fewer of the invading microbes survive compared to a naïve individual encountering the pathogen for the first time, which effectively raises infectious dose.</p>
<h3><strong>How can this knowledge help us avoid illnesses?</strong></h3>
<p>Exposure is a function of pathogen concentration and contact time, so if you can reduce either of those, you can better avoid infectious diseases.</p>
<p>This is why, from the start of the Covid pandemic, experts have recommended a <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/video/layers-of-protection-against-covid-19-the-swiss-cheese-model/">“Swiss cheese” model</a> of layered protection, with social distancing from other individuals playing a key role. The farther you are from an infectious person, the fewer of their viral particles you will be exposed to. Adding a mask, especially a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html">high-quality respirator such as an N95</a> with a snug fit, will further reduce the number of viruses you could inhale. Ventilation also dilutes the number of viral particles in the air, hence why being outside or using an air filter indoors lessens your risk of infection.</p>

<p>Vaccination is another way to decrease your risk of Covid infection. Though the vaccines are imperfect, vaccination still reduces your risk of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10073587/">becoming infected in the first place</a>, by increasing the infectious dose necessary to initiate an infection. It also reduces the chances of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00171-4/fulltext">developing serious illness</a> if you are infected. Several studies also suggest that vaccinated people are <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010802">less likely to shed as many virus particles</a> and that vaccination <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9991402/">reduces viral load</a>.</p>
<p>Masking, increased ventilation and distancing reduces the number of microbes you’re exposed to. Vaccination increases the infectious dose. These are the pillars of protection against infection from pretty much every pathogen. Transmission dynamics are complex, but the interventions we can take to protect ourselves are comparatively simple.</p>

Scientists eventually identified a chemical called 6PPD, typically used in tire manufacturing to slow cracking and degradation. When exposed to ozone in the atmosphere, the chemical transforms into multiple other species, including 6PPD-quinone—which was found to be highly toxic to multiple fish, including coho salmon. The same chemical has since been detected <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00821">in human urine</a>, though any potential health impacts remain unknown.</p><p>The discovery of 6PPD-q and its impact has brought new scrutiny to the pollution generated by particles shedding from tires and brakes. In particular, tire rubber is made up of over 400 different chemical compounds, many of which are known to have negative effects on human health. </p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/gallery"><figcaption data-rawhtml="1">Particulate emissions from tires—and, to a lesser extent, brakes—are becoming a new focus for researchers looking into automobile pollution.</figcaption></div><p>New research efforts are only just beginning to reveal the impact of near-invisible tire and brake dust. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BreakingThePlasticWave_MainReport.pdf">report</a> from the <em>Pew Charitable Trust</em> found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are from synthetic tire rubber. These toxic particles often end up ingested by marine animals, where they can cause neurological effects, behavioral changes, and abnormal growth.  </p><p>Meanwhile, British firm Emissions Analytics spent three years studying tires. The group found that a single car's four tires collectively release 1 trillion "ultrafine" particles for every single kilometer (0.6 miles) driven.  These particles, under 100 nanometers in size, are so tiny that they can pass directly through the lungs and into the blood. They can even cross the body's blood-brain barrier. The Imperial College London has also studied <a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/101707/9/Tyre%20wear%20particles%20are%20toxic%20for%20us%20and%20the%20environment%200223-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the issue</a>, noting that "There is emerging evidence that tire wear particles and other particulate matter may contribute to a range of negative health impacts including heart, lung, developmental, reproductive, and cancer outcomes.”</p><p>It's an emissions problem that won't go away with the transition to EVs, either. According to data from Emissions Analytics, EVs tend to shed around 20 percent more from their tires due to their higher weight and high torque compared to traditional internal combustion engine-powered vehicles.</p><p>Indeed, the scale of these emissions is significant. Particulate emissions from tires and brakes, particularly in the PM2.5 and PM10 size ranges, are believed to exceed the mass of tailpipe emissions from modern vehicle fleets, as per a study published in<em> Science&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Total Environment</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088393/">this year.</a></p><p>This issue has largely flown under the radar until recently. Tailpipe emissions are easy to study, simply requiring the capture or sensing of gases directly at the engine's exhaust. Capturing the fine particulates emitted from tires and brakes is altogether more difficult. Doing so in a way that accurately reflects the quantity of those emissions is yet harder. Such pollution is perhaps unlikely to have a direct impact on issues like climate change, but the potential toxicity for humans, animals, and the broader environment is a prime concern. </p><p><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/article/15586/transportation-regulators-to-remove-unnecessary-barriers-to-self-driving-cars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regulators</a> are already scrambling to tackle this issue, heretofore largely ignored by governments around the world. In the EU, the Euro 7 standards will regulate tire and brake emissions from 2025. In the U.S., the California EPA will require tire manufacturers to find an alternative chemical to 6PPD by 2024, to help reduce 6PPD-q entering the environment going forward. In turn, manufacturers are exploring everything from alternate tire compositions to special electrostatic methods to capture particulate output.</p><p>Expect this issue to gain greater prominence in coming years as regulators have more accurate data to act upon. There is great scope to slash this form of pollution if we properly understand the impacts of our cars in full.</p><p><em>Got a tip?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Wes Phillips recently <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/news/022808ndp/index.html">reported on this website</a>, CD sales are down and legal downloads of audio files are up. <i>Stereophile</i> has been criticized more than once for not paying enough attention to the subjects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> and other compressed file formats, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding">AAC</a>, and for offering no guidance <i>at all</i> to readers about how to get the best sound quality from compressed downloads.
</p><p>
These criticisms are correct. We don't.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.stereophile.com/images/archivesart/308mps.1.jpg" width="450" height="345">
</p><p>
The reason is simple: Although they are universally described in the mainstream press as being of "CD quality," MP3s and their lossy-compressed ilk do <i>not</i> offer sufficient audio quality for serious music listening. This is not true of lossless-compressed formats such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC">FLAC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless">ALAC</a>, and WMA lossless—in fact, it was the release of iTunes 4.5, in late 2003, which allowed iPods to play lossless files, that led us to <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/mediaservers/934/index.html">welcome</a> the ubiquitous Apple player to the world of high-end audio. But <i>lossy</i> files achieve their conveniently small size by discarding too much of the music to be worth considering.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/56">In the past</a>, we have discussed at length the reasons for our dismissal of MP3 and other lossy formats, but recent articles in the mainstream press promoting MP3 (examined in Michael Fremer's "<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/thinkpieces/021708swiftboat/index.html">The Swiftboating of Audiophiles</a>") make the subject worth re-examining.
</p><p>
<b>Lossless <i>vs</i> Lossy</b>
<br>
The file containing a typical three-minute song on a CD is 30–40 megabytes in size. A 4-gigabyte iPod could therefore contain just 130 or so songs—say, only nine CDs' worth. To pack a useful number of songs onto the player's drive or into its memory, some kind of data compression needs to be used to reduce the size of the files. This will also usefully reduce the time it takes to download the song.
</p><p>
Lossless compression is benign in its effect on the music. It is akin to LHA or WinZip computer data crunchers in packing the data more efficiently on the disk, but the data you read out are the same as went in. The primary difference between lossless compression for computer data and for audio is that the latter permits random access within the file. (If you had to wait to unZip the complete 400MB file of a CD's content before you could play it, you would rapidly abandon the whole idea.) You can get reduction in file size to 40–60% of the original with lossless compression—the performance of various lossless codecs is compared <a href="http://members.home.nl/w.speek/comparison.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/comparison.html">here</a>—but that increases the capacity of a 4GB iPod to only 300 songs, or 20 CDs' worth of music. More compression is necessary.
</p><p>
The MP3 <i>codec</i> (for COder/DECoder) was developed at the end of the 1980s and adopted as a standard in 1991. As typically used, it reduces the file size for an audio song by a factor of 10; <i>eg,</i> a song that takes up 30MB on a CD takes up only 3MB as an MP3 file. Not only does the 4GB iPod now hold well over 1000 songs, each song takes less than 10 seconds to download on a typical home's high-speed Internet connection.
</p><p>
But you don't get something for nothing. The MP3 codec, and others that achieve similar reductions in file size, are "lossy"; <i>ie</i>, of necessity they eliminate some of the musical information. The degree of this degradation depends on the data rate. Less bits always equals less music.
</p><p>
As a CD plays, the two channels of audio data (not including overhead) are pulled off the disc at a rate of just over 1400 kilobits per second. A typical MP3 plays at less than a tenth that rate, at 128kbps. To achieve that massive reduction in data, the MP3 coder splits the continuous musical waveform into discrete time chunks and, using Transform analysis, examines the spectral content of each chunk. Assumptions are made by the codec's designers, on the basis of psychoacoustic theory, about what information can be safely discarded. Quiet sounds with a similar spectrum to loud sounds in the same time window are discarded, as are quiet sounds that are immediately followed or preceded by loud sounds. And, as I wrote in the February 2008 "<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/cd-quality-where-did-music-go">As We See It</a>," because the music must be broken into chunks for the codec to do its work, transient information can get smeared across chunk boundaries.
</p><p>
Will the listener miss what has been removed? Will the smearing of transient information be large enough to mess with the music's meaning? As I wrote in a July 1994 <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/56/index.html">essay</a>, "if these algorithms have been properly implemented with the right psycho-acoustic assumptions, the musical information represented by the lost data will not be missed by most listeners.
</p><p>
"That's a mighty big 'if.'"
</p><p>
And while lossy codecs differ in the assumptions made by their designers, all of them discard—permanently—real musical information that would have been audible to some listeners with some kinds of music played through some systems. These codecs are not, in the jargon, "transparent," as can be demonstrated in <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/1007awsi/index.html">listening tests</a> (footnote 1).
</p><p>
So to us at <i>Stereophile</i>, the question of which lossy codec is "the best" is moot. We recommend that, for serious listening, our readers use uncompressed audio file formats, such as WAV or AIF—or, if file size is an issue because of limited hard-drive space, use a lossless format such as FLAC or ALC. These <i>will</i> be audibly transparent to all listeners at all times with all kinds of music through all systems.
</p><p>
<b>Putting Codecs to the Test</b>
<br>
Do I have any evidence for that emphatic statement?
</p><p>
For an <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/reference/456/index.html">article</a> published in the March 1995 issue of <i>Stereophile</i>, I measured the early PASC, DTS, and ATRAC lossy codecs and put four of the test signals used for that article on our <i>Test CD 3</i> (<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/features/424/index.html">Stereophile STPH006-2</a>). For the present article, I used two of those signals, tracks 25 and 26 on <i>Test CD 3</i>. But first, to set a basis for comparison, I used that most familiar of test signals: a 1kHz tone.
</p><p>
The spectrum of this tone, played back from CD, is shown in fig.1. The tone is the sharply defined vertical green line at the left of the graph. There are no other vertical lines present, meaning that the tone is completely free from distortion. Across the bottom of the graph, the fuzzy green trace shows that the background noise is uniformly spread out across the audioband, up to the 22kHz limit of the CD medium. This noise results from the 16-bit Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) encoding used by the CD medium. Each frequency component of the noise lies around 132dB below peak level; if these are added mathematically, they give the familiar 96dB signal/noise ratio that you see in CD-player specifications.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.stereophile.com/images/archivesart/308MP3fig01.jpg" width="450" height="308">
</p><p>
Fig.1 Spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at –10dBFS, 16-bit linear PCM encoding (linear frequency scale, 10dB/vertical div.).
</p><p>
Fig.2 shows the spectrum of this tone after it has been converted to an MP3 at a constant bit rate of 128kbps. (The MP3 codec I used for this and all the other tests was the Fraunhöfer, from one of the original developers of the MP3 technology.) The 1kHz tone is now represented by the dark red vertical line at the left of the graph. Note that it has acquired "skirts" below –80dB. These result, I believe, from the splitting of the continuous data representing the tone into the time chunks mentioned above, which in return results in a very slight uncertainty about the exact frequency of the tone. Note also that the random background noise has disappeared entirely. This is because the encoder is basically deaf to frequency regions that don't contain musical information. With its very limited "bit budget," the codec concentrates its resources on regions where there <i>is</i> audio information. However, a picket fence of very-low-level vertical lines can be seen. These represent spurious tones that result, I suspect, from mathematical limitations in the codec. Like the skirts that flank the 1kHz tone, these will not be audible. But they do reveal that the codec is working hard even with this most simple of signals.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.stereophile.com/images/archivesart/308MP3fig02.jpg" width="450" height="299">
</p><p>
Fig.2 Spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at –10dBFS, MP3 encoding at 128kbps (linear frequency scale, 10dB/vertical div.).
</p><p>
But what about when the codec is dealing not with a simple tone, but with music? One of the signals I put on <i>Test CD 3</i> (track 25) simulates a musical signal by combining 43 discrete tones with frequencies spaced 500Hz apart. The lowest has a frequency of 350Hz, the highest 21.35kHz. This track sounds like a swarm of bees, but more important for a test signal, it readily reveals shortcomings in codecs, as spuriae appear in the spectral gaps between the tones..
</p><hr><p>
Footnote 1: Something I have rarely seen discussed is the fact is that because all compressed file formats, both lossless and lossy, effectively have zero data redundancy, they are much more vulnerable than uncompressed files to bit errors in transmission.</p></div></div>]]></description>

If you were to examine the Universe solely with what’s perceptible to your eyes, you’d miss out on a whole slew of information that exists in wavelengths of light that are invisible to us. From the highest-energy gamma rays to the lowest-energy radio waves, the electromagnetic spectrum is enormous, with visible light representing just a tiny sliver of what’s out there. At shorter wavelengths and higher energies, gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet light are all present, while at longer wavelengths and lower energies, infrared, microwave, and radio light encodes a wide variety of information about what various astrophysical sources are doing.</p><p>However, there’s an entirely different method to measure the Universe: to collect actual particles and antiparticles, a science known as cosmic ray astronomy.

Aguilar (main); NASA/GSFC/Fermi (inset)</figcaption></div></figure><p>However, we also expect that there actually must be some new physics out there, because of the overwhelming astrophysical evidence for dark matter. While the true nature of dark matter will remain a mystery until the particle (or at least one of the particles) responsible is detected directly, many dark matter scenarios exist where not only is dark matter its own antiparticle, but that dark matter annihilations will also produce electron-positron pairs. As long as your dark matter particle is massive enough so that electron-positron pairs can be generated from the energy released when dark matter particles annihilate, this type of antimatter ought to be generated under some conditions.</p><p>So how do we decide: dark matter or “mundane” physics? Which one is responsible for blowing these “Fermi bubbles” in our galaxy?</p><p>Whenever you have multiple possible physical explanations for what could cause an observable phenomenon, the key to telling which one matches reality is to tease out differences between the explanations. In particular, positrons due to dark matter should experience a cutoff at specific energies (corresponding to the mass of the dark matter particles), while positrons generated by conventional astrophysics should fall off more gradually. In other words, looking at the energy spectrum of these positrons, directly, should tell us what the answer is.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" width="3760" height="2848" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?w=3760" alt="Nasa space station in space with alpha magnetic spectrometer" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg 3760w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1536,1163 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=2048,1551 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=375,284 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=640,485 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1024,776 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1280,970 1280w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg 3760w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1536,1163 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=2048,1551 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=375,284 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=640,485 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1024,776 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1280,970 1280w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?w=3760&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>Exterior view of the ISS with the alpha magnetic spectrometer (AMS-02) visible in the foreground.

After arriving at the International Space Station aboard the final mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor, it was quickly set up and began sending data back to Earth within 3 days. During its operational phase, it collected and measured more than ten billion cosmic ray particles per year. Although only a tiny fraction of them were positrons, that’s okay; because of the different energy, charge, and charge-to-mass ratios of the different particles that impacted it, different species of particle could be separated out.</p><p>What’s remarkable about AMS-02 is the “magnetic” part of the experiment: magnetic fields bend charge particles, and while the magnetic force on a moving charged particle depends only on its electric charge and velocity, the amount that a particle “bends by” as it passes through the detector is also dependent on the incoming particle’s mass and momentum. This makes AMS-02 able to sort these cosmic rays both by type and by energy, providing us with an unprecedented set of data to evaluate whether the positrons appeared to be due to dark matter or not. At low energies, the data matched the predictions of cosmic rays colliding with the interstellar medium, but at higher energies, something else was clearly at play.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg" alt="Two diagrams showing the spectrum and the fraction of the data." width="840" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg 800w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?resize=375,165 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?resize=640,281 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?resize=768,337 768w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg 800w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?resize=375,165 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?resize=640,281 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?resize=768,337 768w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0__NWcK22sT89ni1PC.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>If the AMS-02 experiment would have experienced zero failures and not required any repairs, it would have collected sufficient data to distinguish between pulsars (blue) or annihilating dark matter (red) as the source of the excess positrons.

The first image shows the total number of gamma rays detected by Fermi’s Large Area Telescope at energies from 8 to 1,000 billion electron volts (GeV) — billions of times the energy of visible light — over the past decade. By removing all bright sources, astronomers discovered the pulsar’s faint, extended gamma-ray halo, concluding that this one pulsar could be responsible for up to 20% of the positrons detected by the AMS-02 experiment.</p></div><figcaption><a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13209" target="_blank">Credit</a>: NASA/DOE/Fermi LAT Collaboration</figcaption></div></figure><p>Whenever there’s an unexplained phenomenon that we’ve measured or observed, it presents a tantalizing possibility to scientists: that perhaps there’s something new at play beyond what’s presently known. We know there are mysteries about our Universe that require new physics at some level — mysteries like dark matter, dark energy, or the cosmic matter-antimatter asymmetry — whose ultimate solution has yet to be discovered. It’s an important reminder that all of the known physics at play in the Universe cannot represent all of what’s truly out there; there still remain deep, fundamental mysteries whose solutions are not presently known.</p><p>However, we cannot claim evidence for a new discovery until we first scrupulously and quantitatively account for everything that represents the physics and astrophysics of what’s already known. By factoring in the effect of pulsars, the positron excess observed by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer collaboration appears to be explicable entirely by conventional high-energy astrophysics, with no need for dark matter. Right now, our observations are consistent with the notion that pulsars are responsible for 100% of the observed excess, requiring scientists to go back to the drawing board for a direct signal that reveals our Universe’s elusive dark matter. The Milky Way’s antimatter, despite what many had hoped for, appears to be entirely due to pulsars.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

This can power up the tiny pedal-powered generator contained in the portable charger.</p>
<p>The electricity generated in the process is then stored in MyPowerbank's internal batteries, with around 25 minutes of pedalling equating to one full phone charge.</p>

<p>This can restrict their access to crucial digital services, from texting and banking to applying for benefit schemes.</p>

<p>"Every facet of our daily life revolves around the convenience of what a phone can do for us, from Google Maps to transferring money to messaging our friends, which keeps us sane," he continued. "They're just so life-or-death crucial."</p>
<p>The project was born out of Talbot's research into how urban infrastructure, often designed to make life hard for homeless people, could be hacked for their benefit.</p>
<p>In particular, his design was inspired by the <a href="http://www.michaelrakowitz.com/parasite">blow-up homeless shelters of American artist Michael Rakowitz</a>, which are inflated using buildings' hot air vents.</p>
<p>"I really fell in love with this idea of having this city that was designed against a certain group of people to segregate them socially, taking what the city gives away for free and using it against itself," he explained.</p>

<p>A small gear at the back of the device is designed to slot onto the bike's chain, while an internal magnet clips onto the metal frame.</p>
<p>"The chain spins that gear, the gear spins the dynamo and the dynamo charges the two lithium-ion batteries inside," Talbot said. "The thing I like about it is that it's not new fancy tech, it's actually really old tech that's been reformatted for a new purpose."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention">https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37724861">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">FlashAttention</a> was released 6 months ago, it has been adopted by many organizations and research labs to speed up their training &amp; inference (see this <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention/blob/main/usage.md">page</a> for a partial list).</p>
<p>For the last 2 months I’ve been collaborating with Adept as a part-time research fellow and we’ve been developing some improvements to FlashAttention to make it even better! In this post, we describe one key improvement that we’re particularly excited about: making FlashAttention fast for long sequences to enable training large language models with longer context.</p>
<p>As an example, for sequence length 8k, FlashAttention is now up to 2.7x faster than a standard Pytorch implementation, and up to 2.2x faster than the optimized implementation from Megatron-LM, even at small batch size. As we will see, training with longer context yields higher quality models. As we’ve <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/longer-sequences-next-leap-ai/">mentioned</a> before, we believe that modeling longer sequences could help us take the next leap in AI, and FlashAttention is one component to scale Transformers to longer context. At Adept, we’ve been training large Transformers (<a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/act-1">ACT-1</a>) to take actions with the goal of building an AI teammate. Understanding webpages, software tool interfaces, and multi-turn user interactions can require contexts that far exceed the common 2k standard.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-long-sequences">Motivation: Long sequences</h2>
<p>Scaling up the context length of Transformers is a challenge, since the multihead attention layer at their heart has runtime and memory requirement quadratic in the input sequence length. Ideally, we would like to go beyond the standard 2k sequence length limit to train models to understand books, high resolution images, webpages, multi-turn user interactions, and long-form videos.</p>
<p>FlashAttention is an algorithm that reorders the attention computation and leverages classical techniques (tiling, recomputation) to significantly speed it up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. This works great for most cases, but it was not optimized for the case of super long sequences (where batch sizes and numbers of heads are small) due to insufficient parallelism. If one trains large Transformers on long sequences with modern parallelism techniques (data parallel, pipeline parallel, tensor parallel) to split the data and model among many GPUs, the batch size can get very small (e.g. batch size of 1 with pipeline parallelism, and number of heads around 8-12 with tensor parallelism). This is the case we would like to optimize for.</p>
<h2 id="attention-parallelism-to-optimize-for-long-sequences">Attention parallelism to optimize for long sequences</h2>
<p>For each attention head, to reduce memory reads/writes, FlashAttention uses classical tiling techniques to load blocks of query, key, and value from GPU HBM (its main memory) to SRAM (its fast cache), compute attention with respect to that block, and write back the output to HBM. This reduction in memory reads/writes brings significant speedup (2-4x) in most cases.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/flashier-attention/01.png"></figure>
<p>The first version of FlashAttention parallelizes over batch size and number of heads. For those familiar with CUDA programming, we use 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_block_(CUDA_programming)">thread block</a> to process one attention head, and there are overall batch_size * num_heads threadblocks. Each thread block is scheduled to run on a streaming multiprocessor (SM), and there are 108 of these SMs on an A100 GPU for example. This scheduling is efficient when batch_size * num_heads is large (say &gt;= 80), since we can effectively use almost all of the compute resources on the GPU.</p>
<p>In the case of long sequences (which usually means small batch sizes or small number of heads), to make better use of the multiprocessors on the GPU, we now additionally parallelize over the sequence length dimension. This results in significant speedup for this regime.</p>
<p>Here is the forward pass computation expressed schematically. We have multiple workers (i.e. thread blocks) to process one attention head, and each worker takes care of a block of rows of the attention matrix. As the rows of the attention matrix don’t depend on each other, we don’t need to communicate between the workers.</p>
<p>In the backward pass, we parallelize things slightly differently: each worker now takes care of a block of columns of the attention matrix. The workers need to communicate to aggregate the gradient with respect to the query, which can be done with <a href="https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2013/presentations/S3101-Atomic-Memory-Operations.pdf">atomic operations</a>. We found that parallelizing by columns here is faster than parallelizing by rows due to the reduced communication between the workers (parallelizing by columns requires aggregating the gradient of the query, while parallelizing by rows requires aggregating the gradient of the key and value).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/flashier-attention/02.png"></figure>
<p>Image caption: In the forward pass, we parallelize the workers (thread blocks) where each worker takes care of a block of rows of the attention matrix. In the backward pass, each worker takes care of a block of rows of the attention matrix.</p>
<p>Attention layer benchmark: We compare here the time taken by the forward + backward pass, as we increase the sequence length (and decrease the batch size to keep the total number of tokens the same). We keep the number of heads at 12 and head dimension at 128. Time is measured on an A100 40GB GPU. Compared to Pytorch and Megatron-LM attention implementations, FlashAttention is between 2.2x and 2.7x faster for longer sequences (8k).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/flashier-attention/03.png"></figure>
<p>End-to-end training benchmark: when we use FlashAttention to train Transformers of size up to 2.7B on sequences of length 8k, we achieve a training efficiency of up to 175 TFLOPs/sec per A100 (equivalent to model FLOPs efficiency of 56%, we don’t need to do any activation checkpointing). This is 2.2 times faster than Megatron-LM, as shown in the figure below. Moreover, training with 8k context length with FlashAttention is only 7% less hardware efficient than training with 2k context length, as compared to Megatron-LM where increasing context length from 2k to 8k drops hardware efficiency by 1.9x. FlashAttention has made it much easier to train on long sequences.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-better-language-models-with-longer-sequence-lengths">Evaluation: better language models with longer sequence lengths</h2>
<p>We train GPT3 models with 1.3B and 2.7B parameters for 400B tokens on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027">Pile</a>, with either 2K or 8K context. On both pretraining metrics (validation perplexity) and downstream evaluation (e.g. accuracy on the ChapterBreak challenge dataset), models with longer context outperforms models with shorter context.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/flashier-attention/05-table.png" alt="FlashAttention table"></p><p>We evaluate these models on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10878">ChapterBreak</a> dataset (a challenge dataset for long-range language models where one is supposed to distinguish the right text that follows a chapter break). As one increases the context length, the accuracy of the models increases.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.adept.ai/images/blog/flashier-attention/05.png"></figure>
<p>On both metrics, increasing the context length beyond the standard 2K yields consistent quality improvement.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward-more-use-cases-for-long-sequence-lengths">Looking forward: more use cases for long sequence lengths</h2>
<p>FlashAttention is just a step towards equipping models with long context, by making it fast to train models on long sequences. ML models are now widely deployed, interacting with billions of users a day. As these models become more personalized, capturing the history of user interaction becomes crucial. The future AI agents should be able to remember its past actions and users’ feedback. Moreover, as ML models are going to be multi-modal (e.g., text, vision, speech, etc.), long context modeling will play an even bigger role. Long context will allow models to understand books, high resolution images, and videos.</p>
<p>We are excited about this vision! If you have an application that you think could benefit from these ideas, please let us know!</p>

<hr>
<p>1 — Images are often processed as a sequence of patches. Higher resolution means larger sequence lengths (e.g., a 1024x1024 image could be processed as a sequence of 4096 patches, each of size&nbsp;16x16).</p>
<p>2 — We use a sliding window with stride 512 to evaluate perplexity, to reduce the effect of short context length on tokens early in the batch (aka the “early token&nbsp;curse”).</p></div></div>]]></description>

In the mid ’90s it was clear that Apple had lost the personal computer battle and all their developers were fleeing like rats off a sinking ship into the ocean of opportunity that was Windows 95. As a maven of the Macintosh API and still willing to admit it, I landed small contracting jobs fixing up code that other developers wouldn’t touch.</p><p>My typical rate was $25 per hour, which feels like a lot of money when you’re 17 in the ’90s.</p><p>One day I got a call from some poor schleps I didn’t want to help. They had just completed a new product written in Java and it was broken on a Mac, and could I help? None of their customers used Macs, so they didn’t think Macs were important, but then it turns out the main investor is keen on seeing the demo on a Mac, and when they tried it, it didn’t work. (Yay investors! Yay supposedly-cross-platform-platforms-that-aren’t-really!)</p><p>I wanted no part of this. Java was brand new and known to be full of bugs, and anyway I was a C/C++ kind of guy, and I didn’t want to get involved in an academic fad language like Java<sup>1</sup>.</p><blockquote>
<sup>1</sup>
<span> So yeah, I simultaneously decided that (1) Java is a fad and (2) I’m sticking with the Macintosh Toolkit; five years later one those platforms had zero developers and the other had one million, and I picked exactly wrong. <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/" data-title="Navigating the unpredictability of everything" data-desc="We dramatically, repeatedly fail to predict the future. Does that mean “strategy” is senseless? No, it means you need these techniques to navigate a volatile world." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/thumbnail-352w.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/thumbnail-704w.webp">Predicting the future</a> is hard.</span></blockquote><p>I could have said “no.” Given my specialty and my goals, traditional career (or startup) theory says I should have said “no.”</p><p>But instead, on the advice of an older, wiser friend, I showed up at their office and said I’d do it for $100 per hour.</p><p>I fully expected them to laugh in my face. Maybe I would receive a condescending talking-to about the audacity—nay, the <em>impudence!—</em> of someone of my tender age and meager experience walking in here and demanding such outrageous compensation, someone who, let’s be clear, is technically too young to even enter into a legal consulting agreement in the first place.</p><p>And then I would have slinked out of there, embarrassed but ultimately no worse for wear.</p><p>But that’s not what happened. They looked me up and down, their faces painted with both incredulity and surrender. They said OK.&nbsp;An hour and a half later, everything was working. The difference between saying “no” and getting $150 for about two hours of my life was all in how I phrased “yes.”</p><p><strong>And I have stories that went the other way, which are just as important.</strong></p><p>At <a href="http://wpengine.com/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">WP Engine</a>, for example, we’re constantly talking to large bloggers who want to move to our system. These are folks with big requirements—tens of millions of monthly page-views, traffic spikes, custom code, perfect up-time, and 24/7 support.</p><p>Should we take on those clients? Maybe not—after all the stated goal of WP Engine is to serve the “middle market”—the folks who have outgrown free blogs, don’t like maintaining their own servers, but aren’t so large that they have extreme hosting demands. That’s our profitable niche<sup>2</sup>.</p><blockquote>
<sup>2</sup>
<span> Editor’s note: This was written about 1 year into WP Engine’s life; in 2023 WP Engine is 13 years old with 200,000 customers, and powers more large WordPress sites than anyone on Earth. This <em>was</em> a great segment to start off with, but we evolved as we scaled.</span></blockquote><p>Or so we think. But if we just say “no” to these big bloggers, maybe we’re closing the door on big, important orders. Perhaps the entire company should pivot—maybe it’s easier or more profitable to serve 100 large blogs than 1000 medium ones. But how do we know if we say “no?”</p><p>Then again, if we say “yes” we might really be screwed. If we can’t provide them the human and technical service they expect, now we’ve hurt a blogger, we get bad press, and we’ve wasted a bunch of time.&nbsp;Or even worse, we hold on for dear life but it’s extremely unprofitable, and now we have this expensive, time-consuming albatross around our necks.</p><p>So we’ve said “yes” by quoting high enough that we know for certain we will make good money on the deal, so much so that it will partially fund something else we want to do. Maybe that means a big new advertising campaign, or hiring another WordPress expert for our staff.</p><p>There was one especially large customer where we literally thought of it like this: This deal needs to be big enough to not only make a reasonable profit on the operating expenses, but pay for an entire developer’s salary (assuming bootstrapped, put-in-elbow-grease-for-stock low salary), because we know this new customer will occupy a lot of that person’s time, but all the remaining time we get “for free.”</p><p>So we’ve given a lot of qualified yeses, and many were rejected. (P.S. Now we’re able to say “yes” to those same bloggers, but that’s because over time we’ve taken on bigger and bigger customers, and now a blogger with 30 million month page-views is something we know we can handle.)</p><p>At <a href="http://smartbear.com/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">Smart Bear</a> I used this principle yet again. Companies would fly me out to help them implement a peer code review process, which half the time actually meant that “management” wanted me to convince everyone else that code review was a good idea, and invent a process painless enough that they might actually do it.</p><p>From a business perspective, this was a poor use of my time. These folks had already bought our software, so it didn’t sell more seats. When you counted a travel day on either side of the engagement, the time I lost could have been spent landing just one additional customer or make some important changes to the code, either of which almost certainly makes us more money.</p><p>Therefore, initially I just said “no.” But again that’s wrong. Eventually I said “yes,” but the price was $2500/day <em>including travel days</em>, which for these sorts of engagements is unheard of. (Typically you get reimbursed for travel expenses but not paid for that time.)</p><p>This immediately cut out most trips, but some remained. On those trips I’d haul in $10,000 for a week of easy work, which I’d often combine with a long weekend with my wife. And anyway those people <em>really wanted me there</em>, which made the work that much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>So the principle is straightforward:</strong> Set the conditions of “yes” such that:</p><ol>
<li><strong>If they say “yes,” you’re happy</strong> because the terms or money are <em>so good</em>, it more than compensates for the distraction, perhaps funding the thing you really want to do.</li><li><strong>If they say “no,” you’re happy</strong> because it wasn’t a great fit anyway; it’s not a worthwhile return on your time and effort.</li></ol><p>So that’s the punch-line, but before you leave I’d like to <strong>over-emphasize the idea of “funding the thing you really want to do.”</strong></p><p>This can take many forms, but it’s the single best way of figuring out <em>how</em> to qualify your “yes.” Examples:</p><ul>
<li>“Yes” if it pays for an entire additional person.</li><li>“Yes” if this extends the runway of our startup by at least three months.</li><li>“Yes” if it completely funds development we’d like to do anyway.</li><li>“Yes” if it means one of the co-founders can quit her day-job.</li><li>“Yes” if it will completely pay for three new marketing efforts.</li></ul><p>Think of it like another form of funding. <strong>Funding is always a distraction from actually running your business, so the amount of money you get must be transformative to the business.</strong> Each of those bullet points <em>are</em> transformative, in that each has the potential to move your company from “hobby” to “real business.”</p><p>And if they say “no,” you’re fine with that, because it would have been a distraction which wouldn’t have moved the needle.</p><div><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Mozilla seems to be asleep at the wheel, when it once drove online activity and communications. We have some suggestions where it could go.</p>
<p>Mozilla is the <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2021/mozilla-fdn-2021-fs-final-1010.pdf" rel="nofollow">wealthy</a> [PDF] independent organization behind the only all-FOSS browser engine that's independent of commercial vendors. It also does important security research – its recent <a target="_blank" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/" rel="nofollow">report</a> on the abysmal privacy of in-car software is a good example.</p>
<p>Firefox remains a powerful, capable, fast, and resource-efficient browser. For instance, it doesn't just render PDFs in-browser, without plugins or helpers, it lets you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/18/firefox_106_arrives/">amend or annotate them</a> too. The latest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/118.0/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">Firefox 118</a> has privacy-centric, local, in-browser language translation. Some of its shorcuts and <a target="_blank" href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2020/10/25/navigational-instruments/" rel="nofollow">navigational features</a> will probably surprise you.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's programming languages (yes, plural)</h3>
<p>Mozilla also invented not one but two of the hottest programming languages around. This century, it invented the Rust programming language, as we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/06/17/mozilla_multithreaded_firsfox_dom_project/">reported back in 2011</a>. In recent years that seems to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/26/rust_column/">eating&nbsp;into every major OS</a>… but six months into the pandemic, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/14/mozilla_google_search/">Mozilla laid off the entire team</a>, killing its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/04/03/samsung_helps_mozilla_with_servo/">next-gen rendering engine</a>, Servo.</p>
<p>(Much of Mozilla's revenue comes from Google, of course. This couldn't be because Rust was, and is, outshining Google's GoLang? Surely not?)</p>

    

<p>Back in 1995, before even <em>The Register</em>, Mozilla's commercial forerunner Netscape <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_history.asp" rel="nofollow">invented</a> JavaScript, which it introduced with Netscape 2.0; as this fossilized announcement <a target="_blank" href="https://tidbits.com/1995/11/27/netscape-2-0b3-sneaks-out/" rel="nofollow">notes</a>, "of possible interest to developers." Yeah, just a tad.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's messaging client</h3>
<p>Mozilla also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/30/mozilla_thunderbird_has_a_new_nest/">backs the development</a> of the leading cross-platform messaging client, Thunderbird. This was sadly neglected for years, but even so, its developers kept working on it. A few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>2015: <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-38" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird 38</a> gets <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/calendar-integration-thunderbird" rel="nofollow">integrated</a> calendar handling, derived from the Lightning addon.</li>

<li>2017: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/51.0beta/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird 51</a> gained chat support over IRC and XMPP (alongside XMPP-based services such as Google Talk), derived from <a target="_blank" href="http://instantbird.com/" rel="nofollow">Instantbird</a>.</li>

<li>2020: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.0/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">Thunderbird 78</a> gets integrated PGP email encryption support, replacing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/" rel="nofollow">EnigMail</a> add-on.</li>

<li>2022: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/thunderbird_102/">Thunderbird 102</a> gets Matrix chat support (even if that protocol <a target="_blank" href="https://telegra.ph/why-not-matrix-08-07" rel="nofollow">remains controversial</a> in some quarters).</li>

<li>2023: Thunderbird 115 gets a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/new_betas_of_firefox_and_tbird/">revamped UI</a>, formerly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/14/thunderbird_115_supernova_complete_overhaul/">codenamed Supernova</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/15/thunderbird_is_coming_to_android/">at some point soon</a>, an Android version is <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/08/thunderbird-for-android-k-9-mail-june-2023-progress-report/" rel="nofollow">coming</a>.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's mobile OS</h3>
<p>Mozilla also had a mobile OS, which a decade ago <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/07/01/firefox_os_race_for_third_place/">we called the third-place contender</a> and which it officially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/02/04/mozilla_kills_firefox_os_in_favour_of_connected_devices/">killed off in 2016</a>. Boot2Gecko, marketed as FirefoxOS, was rebooted under the name KaiOS. It won some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/28/kaios_google_investment/">Google investment in 2018</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/04/energizer_hard_case_h280s/">we even reviewed a KaiOS phone</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>KaiOS is still around, and still in third place, which in such a huge market isn't a bad place to be; it implies substantial growth. Its owner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaiostech.com/company/our-story/" rel="nofollow">claims</a> 160 million devices, which is no minor rounding error. The Finnish Fund For Industrial Cooperation recently bunged KaiosTech a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.finnfund.fi/en/news/finnfunds-3-4-million-us-dollar-investment-in-kaios-helps-bring-affordable-mobile-connections-to-sub-saharan-africa/" rel="nofollow">few million</a> to help them expand into the new growth market of sub-Saharan Africa. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kaiostech/gecko-b2g" rel="nofollow">code</a> on GitHub still has Mozilla trademarks all over it. Why isn't this a famous FOSS project to rival, or merge with, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/15/postmarketos_2206/">postmarketOS</a>? Why doesn't Mozilla talk about it, or better still, reclaim it?</p>
<h3>Mozilla's… web editor and music player</h3>
<p>It also formerly had some other gems. The original "Mozilla" was an all-in-one suite of internet tools, derived from Netscape Communicator: a browser, plus an messaging client – then meaning email <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/usenet_revival/">plus USENET</a> – plus calendar, address book, workflow it acquired with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/22/business/company-news-netscape-agrees-to-buy-collabra-software.html" rel="nofollow">Collabra</a>, and an HTML editor. A combined suite is still around, in the guise of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Seamonkey Project</a>.</p>
<p>Although HTML is everywhere, you don't hear much about HTML editors any more – largely because the static stuff has been rendered almost obsolete by dynamically generated web content, much of it generated by code in Mozilla languages, of course. Even decades after Mozilla dropped it, the leading FOSS HTML editor remains Mozilla code; it's just about hanging on in the form of <a target="_blank" href="http://bluegriffon.org/" rel="nofollow">BlueGriffon</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>To be honest, we're not sure that it really needed its own music player, but <a target="_blank" href="https://getsongbird.net/" rel="nofollow">Songbird</a> was a thing for a while. With many companies, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/10/01/bbc_tunein_radio_streams_pulled/">including the BBC</a>, making it harder to stream without their own clients, there might be an opening there.</p>
<h3>Mozilla's server software</h3>
<p>LDAP is not trendy and never really has been, but it's still useful. Red Hat sells an LDAP server as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/directory-server" rel="nofollow">Red Hat Directory Server</a>. The code <a target="_blank" href="https://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/FAQ/history.html" rel="nofollow">originated</a> as the Netscape Directory Server, and the community-supported FOSS version is now called the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.port389.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">389 Directory Server</a>, after the TCP port that LDAP <a target="_blank" href="https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=389" rel="nofollow">uses</a> .</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/beta_ubuntu_fedora/">Ubuntu and Fedora clash in beta race, but who wears GNOME better?</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/osseu_steam_os_3/">Linux interop is maturing fast… thanks to a games console</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/servo_returns/">Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/26/linux_kernel_report_2023/">Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Oracle is still just about <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/816-5654-10/esintro.htm" rel="nofollow">supporting</a> the old Netscape Enterprise Server too.</p>
<h3>An impressive history</h3>
<p>Netscape was the original open source web browser. We've been covering it from the start; in 1998, owner AOL <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/1998/11/25/aol_netscape_deal_questions_open/">promised to open source it</a> – before Google was even founded (25 years ago on Monday, as it happens). Four years later, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2002/06/06/mozilla_1_0_released_after/">the open source version shipped</a>. Twenty years ago, <em>The Reg</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/04/03/cleaner_lighter_mozilla_vowed/">covered its rebirth as Phoenix</a> (and when it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2004/02/09/public_offering_for_opera_mozilla/">became Firefox the next year</a>).</p>
<p>So how, and why, has this vastly innovative, pioneering company become a straggler among followers?</p>
<p>It's let many of its jewels go. Some canceled, some sold off, some given away. Many have found new homes, from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/08/rust_language_foundation/">Rust's foundation</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/servo_returns/">the Servo engine</a>.</p>

        

<p>And yet it still has some powerful, valuable tech.</p>
<h3>Whither the bird?</h3>
<p>Browsers are hard, <em>really</em> hard. The days when the web was just HTML are long gone. There are very few web <em>pages</em> any more; instead, they are programs, and worse still, they're client-server programs, with one end running on the device in front of you, talking to a different program running somewhere else.</p>
<p>Much of the modern computing world runs over this stuff. Ostensibly local applications, from Slack to Teams, are just JavaScript applets running inside their own private single-site browser – and those all use Google's browser engine. Web engines and web apps are a core part of the digital world – arguably, <em>the</em> core part.</p>
<p>As, of course, is open source: most web servers run on Linux, and on the client end, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.demandsage.com/android-statistics/" rel="nofollow">over 70 per cent</a> of smartphones run Android, which is also Linux underneath.</p>
<p>Just as over 70 percent of smartphones run Linux, over 70 per cent of browsers are based on Google's code. At the time of writing, <a target="_blank" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" rel="nofollow">some 64 per cent is Chrome</a>, plus 5.4 per cent Edge. Opera and the Samsung browser make up about another 5 per cent. As they all run on the same engine, Chromium – as does Vivaldi and Brave – that's perilously close to three quarters.</p>

        

<p>Safari, whose rendering engine WebKit is the origin of Chromium's Blink engine, is a little under 20 per cent, making it by far the leading non-Chromium browser – but almost exclusively on Apple OSes. <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web" rel="nofollow">GNOME Web</a>, codenamed Epiphany, is as far as we know the only WebKit browser on Linux (and, it should be noted, on Haiku as well). The Windows port of WebKit is still maintained — for instance, iTunes uses it – but the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oldversion.com/windows/safari/" rel="nofollow">Windows version</a> of Safari was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/07/25/safari_6_ships/">discontinued back in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>So how come the original open source web browser is now, Statcounter <a target="_blank" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" rel="nofollow">estimates</a>, under <em>3 percent</em>? Mozilla, it seems to us, has missed a lot of opportunities, and continues to do so.</p>
<p>There is still a niche for power user browsers, and for powerful integration tools to bring together disparate comms channels that force users into web apps and Electron clients. Despite the sales of ChromeBooks and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/16/google_chrome_os/">the free ChromeOS Flex</a>, despite the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/16/steam_deck_portable_gaming_pc/">Steam Deck</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/osseu_steam_os_3/">Steam OS</a>, Linux still isn't a mainstream end-user OS. If you run Linux, you're probably a power user. Firefox is <em>the</em> dominant Linux browser. By default, it's the <em>only</em> standalone app <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/beta_ubuntu_fedora/">in next month's Ubuntu Mantic Minotaur</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla, please stop aping Chrome. Copying is rarely the way to win big. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/11/20/firefox_reveals_new_look_rounded_rectangles/">Australis Chrome-like theme</a> in Firefox 29 annoyed users and was a driving force behind <a target="_blank" href="https://www.palemoon.org/" rel="nofollow">Pale Moon</a>. Firefox Quantum killed XUL addons, and drove <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk to <a target="_blank" href="https://classic.waterfox.net/" rel="nofollow">Waterfox Classic</a>. Others went to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basilisk-browser.org/" rel="nofollow">Basilisk</a> instead, while XP users have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mypal-browser.org/" rel="nofollow">MyPal</a>.</p>
<p>Even Microsoft's Chrome-based Edge has vertical tabs. Firefox doesn't, and to make them well, you must mess around with config files, although <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/26/firefox_power_user_guide/">we still feel it's worth it</a>. The Vivaldi browser shows that there is still plenty of room to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/02/vivaldi_5_7/">outdo Chrome on features</a>, and a market of people who want for them.</p>
<p>Can we please have a Firefox that leans into being the browser for power users? Bundle some of the more powerful extensions that survived your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/04/waterfox_firefox_fork/">self-inflicted extension extinction event</a>. Vertical or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab" rel="nofollow">tree-structured</a> tabs, on any edge. Menu bars and hotkeys. <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multithreaded-download-manager/" rel="nofollow">Multithreaded downloads</a>, even integrated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/08/transmission_bittorrent_v4/">BitTorrent support</a>. Perhaps experiment with this stuff in the Firefox <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" rel="nofollow">developer edition</a>. Bring back the customizability it once had, which you've been steadily removing for years.</p>
<p>Thunderbird is also a powerful asset. Although it too is sadly neglected, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pidgin.im/" rel="nofollow">Pidgin</a> is still around and still works, and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple" rel="nofollow">libPurple</a> remains uniquely powerful. There are plugins that get it talking to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dylex/slack-libpurple" rel="nofollow">Slack</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-gowhatsapp" rel="nofollow">WhatsApp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BenWiederhake/tdlib-purple/" rel="nofollow">Telegram</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-rocketchat" rel="nofollow">RocketChat</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-signal" rel="nofollow">Signal</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-mattermost" rel="nofollow">Mattermost</a>, you name it. Adopt it, update it, add it to <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.thunderbird.net/thunderbird-development/codebase-overview/chat" rel="nofollow">Chat Core</a>.</p>
<p>Thunderbird could be the universal client that talks to dozens of services in one place. There is room here for significant improvement over the existing multiprotocol messaging clients <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/19/friday_foss_fest/">we've described before</a>.</p>
<p>Leave Chrome and its offspring to the technophobic, and make some cross-platform tools for the keyboard merchants who know <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/email_like_a_pro/">how to email like a pro</a>. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://diziet.dreamwidth.org/16025.html">https://diziet.dreamwidth.org/16025.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37723688">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an email system administrator, you are probably using DKIM to sign your outgoing emails. You should be rotating the key regularly and automatically, and publishing old private keys. I have just released <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/sgo-software-announce/2023/000086.html">dkim-rotate 1.0</a>; dkim-rotate is a tool to do this key rotation and publication.</p>
<p>If you are an email user, your email provider ought to be doing this. If this is not done, your emails are “non-repudiable”, meaning that if they are leaked, anyone (eg, journalists, haters) can verify that they are authentic, and prove that to others. This is not desirable (for you).</p>

<h3>Non-repudiation of emails is undesirable</h3>
<p>This problem was described at some length in Matthew Green’s article <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/11/16/ok-google-please-publish-your-dkim-secret-keys/">Ok Google: please publish your DKIM secret keys</a>.</p>
<p>Avoiding non-repudiation sounds a bit like lying. After all, I’m advising creating a situation where some people can’t verify that something is true, even though it is. So I’m advocating casting doubt. Crucially, though, it’s doubt about facts that ought to be private. When you send an email, that’s between you and the recipient. Normally you don’t intend for anyone, anywhere, who happens to get a copy, to be able to verify that it was really you that sent it.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this verifiability has already been used by journalists to verify stolen emails. Associated Press provide <a href="https://github.com/associatedpress/verify-dkim">a verification tool</a>.</p>
<h3>Advice for all email users</h3>
<p>As a user, you probably don’t want your emails to be non-repudiable. (Other people might want to be able to prove you sent some email, but your email system ought to serve your interests, not theirs.)</p>
<p>So, your email provider ought to be rotating their DKIM keys, and publishing their old ones. At a rough guess, your provider probably isn’t :-(.</p>
<h4>How to tell by looking at email headers</h4>
<p>A quick and dirty way to guess is to have a friend look at the email headers of a message you sent. (It is important that the friend uses a different email provider, since often DKIM signatures are not applied within a single email system.)</p>
<p>If your friend sees a <code>DKIM-Signature</code> header then the message is DKIM signed. If they don’t, then it wasn’t. Most email traversing the public internet is DKIM signed nowadays; so if they don’t see the header probably they’re not looking using the right tools, or they’re actually on the same email system as you.</p>
<p>In messages signed by a system running dkim-rotate, there will <em>also</em> be a header about the key rotation, to notify potential verifiers of the situation. Other systems that avoid non-repudiation-through-DKIM might do something similar. dkim-rotate’s header looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>DKIM-Signature-Warning: NOTE REGARDING DKIM KEY COMPROMISE
 https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/dkim-rotate/README.txt
 https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/dkim-rotate/ae/aeb689c2066c5b3fee673355309fe1c7.pem</code></pre>
<p>But an email system might do half of the job of dkim-rotate: regularly rotating the key would cause the signatures of old emails to fail to verify, which is a good start. In that case there probably won’t be such a header.</p>
<h4>Testing verification of new and old messages</h4>
<p>You can also try verifying the signatures. This isn’t entirely straightforward, especially if you don’t have access to low-level mail tooling. Your friend will need to be able to save emails as <em>raw whole headers and body</em>, un-decoded, un-rendered.</p>
<p>If your friend is using a traditional Unix mail program, they should save the message as an mbox file. Otherwise, ProPublica have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/authenticating-email-using-dkim-and-arc-or-how-we-analyzed-the-kasowitz-emails">instructions for attaching and transferring and obtaining the raw email</a>. (Scroll down to “How to Check DKIM and ARC”.)</p>
<h5>Checking that recent emails <em>are</em> verifiable</h5>
<p>Firstly, have your friend test that they can in fact verify a DKIM signature. This will demonstrate that the next test, where the verification is supposed to fail, is working properly and fails for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Send your friend a test email now, and have them do this on a Linux system:</p>
<pre><code>    # save the message as test-email.mbox
    apt install libmail-dkim-perl # or equivalent on another distro
    dkimproxy-verify &lt;test-email.mbox</code></pre>
<p>You should see output containing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    originator address: ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk
    signature identity: @chiark.greenend.org.uk
    verify result: pass
    ...</code></pre>
<p>If the output ontains <code>verify result: fail (body has been altered)</code> then probably your friend didn’t manage to faithfully save the unalterered raw message.</p>
<h5>Checking <em>old</em> emails <em>cannot</em> be verified</h5>
<p>When you both have that working, have your friend find an older email of yours, from (say) month ago. Perform the same steps.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    originator address: ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk
    signature identity: @chiark.greenend.org.uk
    verify result: fail (bad RSA signature)</code></pre>
<p>or maybe</p>
<pre><code>    verify result: invalid (public key: not available)</code></pre>
<p>This indicates that this old email can no longer be verified. That’s good: it means that anyone who steals a copy, can’t verify it either. If it’s leaked, the journalist who receives it won’t know it’s genuine and unmodified; they should then be suspicious.</p>
<p>If your friend sees <code>verify result: pass</code>, then they have verified that that old email of yours is genuine. Anyone who had a copy of the mail can do that. This is good for email thieves, but not for you.</p>
<h3>For email admins: announcing dkim-rotate 1.0</h3>
<p>I have been running dkim-rotate 0.4 on my infrastructure, since last August. and I had entirely forgotten about it: it has run flawlessly for a year. I was reminded of the topic by seeing DKIM in other blog posts. Obviously, it is time to decreee that <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/sgo-software-announce/2023/000086.html">dkim-rotate is 1.0</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re a mail system administrator, your users are best served if you use something like dkim-rotate. The package is available in Debian stable, and supports Exim out of the box, but other MTAs should be easy to support too, via some simple ad-hoc scripting.</p>
<h3>Limitation of this approach</h3>
<p>Even with this key rotation approach, emails remain nonrepudiable for a short period after they’re sent - typically, a few days.</p>
<p>Someone who obtains a leaked email very promptly, and shows it to the journalist (for example) right away, can still convince the journalist. This is not great, but at least it doesn’t apply to the vast bulk of your email archive.</p>
<p>There are possible email protocol improvements which might help, but they’re quite out of scope for this article.</p>
