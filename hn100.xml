																														<p>6 October 2025</p>
																														<p><a href="http://nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet</a> has decided to award the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to:</p>
																														<p><strong>Mary E. Brunkow</strong><br>Institute for Systems Biology,<br>Seattle, USA</p>
																														<p><strong>Fred Ramsdell</strong><br>Sonoma Biotherapeutics,<br>San Francisco, USA</p>
																														<p><strong>Shimon Sakaguchi</strong><br>Osaka University,<br>Osaka, Japan</p>
																														<p><em>“for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”</em></p>
																														<h2>They discovered how the immune system is kept in check</h2>
																														<p>The body’s powerful immune system must be regulated, or it may attack our own organs. Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their groundbreaking discoveries concerning <em>peripheral immune tolerance</em> that prevents the immune system from harming the body.</p>
																														<p>Every day, our immune system protects us from thousands of different microbes trying to invade our bodies. These all have different appearances, and many have developed similarities with human cells as a form of camouflage. So how does the immune system determine what it should attack and what it should defend?</p>
																														<p>Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their fundamental discoveries relating to peripheral immune tolerance. The laureates identified the immune system’s security guards, <em>regulatory T cells</em>, which prevent immune cells from attacking our own body.</p>
																														<p>“Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,” says Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.</p>
																														<p>Shimon Sakaguchi was swimming against the tide in 1995, when he made the first key discovery. At the time, many researchers were convinced that immune tolerance only developed due to potentially harmful immune cells being eliminated in the thymus, through a process called <em>central tolerance</em>. Sakaguchi showed that the immune system is more complex and discovered a previously unknown class of immune cells, which protect the body from autoimmune diseases.</p>
																														<p>Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell made the other key discovery in 2001, when they presented the explanation for why a specific mouse strain was particularly vulnerable to autoimmune diseases. They had discovered that the mice have a mutation in a gene that they named <em>Foxp3</em>. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene cause a serious autoimmune disease, IPEX.</p>
																														<p>Two years after this, Shimon Sakaguchi was able to link these discoveries. He proved that the <em>Foxp3</em> gene governs the development of the cells he identified in 1995. These cells, now known as regulatory T cells, monitor other immune cells and ensure that our immune system tolerates our own tissues.</p>
																														<p>The laureates’ discoveries launched the field of peripheral tolerance, spurring the development of medical treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. This may also lead to more successful transplantations. Several of these treatments are now undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<p>There is also a new restriction for battery-powered models. They may only be used from October to December. Use in other months is only permitted in exceptional cases, for example for street cleaning after the Street Parade.</p>

<p>These new restrictions apply to both private individuals and municipal employees. Some 75,248 of voters were in favour of the necessary partial revision of the police ordinance, while 46,717 rejected the leaf blower ban. The turnout was 52.8%.</p>



<h2 id="h-years-of-fighting">Years of fighting </h2>



<p>This referendum came about after a group of parliamentary parties launched a referendum to challenge the city parliament’s decision to ban leaf blowers. They argued that the ban was an “expression of a culture of prohibition”.</p>



<p>The fight against leaf blowers has been going on in Zurich for a long time. Back in 2013, the Greens submitted a petition with 4,329 signatures. The initiative that led to the current ban was submitted by the Greens and Social Democrats in 2022.</p>

<p id="quotes">``. . . anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment."
 -- Robert Benchley,  in Chips off the Old Benchley, 1949
</p>
	  <p>I have been intending to write this essay for months. Why am I finally doing it? Because I finally found some uncommitted time? Wrong. I have papers to grade, textbook orders to fill out, an NSF proposal to referee, dissertation drafts to read. I am working on this essay as a way of not doing all of those things. This is the essence of what I call structured procrastination, an amazing strategy I have discovered that converts procrastinators into effective human beings, respected and admired for all that they can accomplish and the good use they make of time. All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because they are a way of not doing something more important. If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important.</p>

<p>Structured procrastination means shaping the structure of the tasks one has to do in a way that exploits this fact. The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.</p>

<p>The most perfect situation for structured procrastination that I ever had was when my wife and I served as Resident Fellows in Soto House, a Stanford dormitory. In the evening, faced with papers to grade, lectures to prepare, committee work to be done, I would leave our cottage next to the dorm and go over to the lounge and play ping-pong with the residents, or talk over things with them in their rooms, or just sit there and read the paper. I got a reputation for being a terrific Resident Fellow, and one of the rare profs on campus who spent time with undergraduates and got to know them. What a set up: play ping pong as a way of not doing more important things, and get a reputation as Mr. Chips.</p>

<p>Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.</p>

<p>At this point you may be asking, "How about the important tasks at the top of the list, that one never does?" Admittedly, there is a potential problem here.</p>

<p>The trick is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal sorts of things have two characteristics, First, they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't). Second, they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks. In universities the vast majority of tasks fall into this category, and I'm sure the same is true for most other large institutions. Take for example the item right at the top of my list right now. This is finishing an essay for a volume in the philosophy of language. It was supposed to be done eleven months ago. I have accomplished an enormous number of important things as a way of not working on it. A couple of months ago, bothered by guilt, I wrote a letter to the editor saying how sorry I was to be so late and expressing my good intentions to get to work. Writing the letter was, of course, a way of not working on the article. It turned out that I really wasn't much further behind schedule than anyone else. And how important is this article anyway? Not so important that at some point something that seems more important won't come along. Then I'll get to work on it.</p>

<p>Another example is book order forms. I write this in June. In October, I will teach a class on Epistemology. The book order forms are already overdue at the book store. It is easy to take this as an important task with a pressing deadline (for you non-procrastinators, I will observe that deadlines really start to press a week or two after they pass.) I get almost daily reminders from the department secretary, students sometimes ask me what we will be reading, and the unfilled order form sits right in the middle of my desk, right under the wrapping from the sandwich I ate last Wednesday. This task is near the top of my list; it bothers me, and motivates me to do other useful but superficially less important things. But in fact, the book store is plenty busy with forms already filed by non-procrastinators. I can get mine in mid-Summer and things will be fine. I just need to order popular well-known books from efficient publishers. I will accept some other, apparently more important, task sometime between now and, say, August 1st. Then my psyche will feel comfortable about filling out the order forms as a way of not doing this new task.</p>

<p>The observant reader may feel at this point that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly. One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent. This is not a problem, because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self-deceptive skills also. And what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the bad effects of another?</p>

<h3>This October, the Internet Archive will celebrate an extraordinary milestone: 1 trillion web pages preserved and available for access via the Wayback Machine. </h3>

<p>Since 1996, the Internet Archive has worked with libraries and partners around the world to build a shared digital library of humanity’s online history: capturing websites large and small—from breaking news to forgotten personal pages—so they remain accessible for future generations. </p>



<p>The series of events scheduled throughout October will highlight the memories, makers, and movements that have made this achievement possible, and will look ahead to the future of web preservation as we continue building the web’s collective memory together.</p>

<p>This October, the Internet Archive’s&nbsp;<strong>Wayback Machine</strong>&nbsp;is projected to hit a once-in-a-generation milestone:&nbsp;<strong>1 trillion web pages archived</strong>. That’s one trillion memories, moments, and movements—preserved for the public and available to access via the Wayback Machine.</p>



<p>We’ll be commemorating this historic achievement on&nbsp;<strong>October 22, 2025</strong>, with a global event: a party at our San Francisco headquarters and a livestream for friends and supporters around the world. More than a celebration, it’s a tribute to what we’ve built together: a free and open digital library of the web.</p>



<p>Join us in marking this incredible milestone. Together, we’ve built the largest archive of web history ever assembled. Let’s celebrate this achievement—in San Francisco and around the world—on October 22.</p>

<p>​Join the&nbsp;<strong>Foundation for American Innovation,&nbsp;</strong>the<strong>&nbsp;Massive Data Institute</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Internet Archive</strong>&nbsp;at Georgetown University’s historic&nbsp;<strong>Riggs Library</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>Wayback to the Future: Celebrating the Open Web—Past, Present, and Possible.</em></p>



<p>​The open web was once defined by experimentation, decentralization, and possibility. The technological advancements were driven by the desire for a place where new voices and ideas could flourish. Today, consolidation and walled gardens challenge that vision. Together, we’ll look back at the internet’s origins to spark a forward-looking conversation about how to keep the web free, open, and innovative.</p>

<p>Is there a seahorse emoji? Let's ask GPT-5 Instant:</p>

<p>What's going on here? Maybe Gemini 2.5 Pro handles it better?</p>

</a>LLMs really think there's a seahorse emoji</h2>
<p>Here are the answers you get if you ask several models whether a seahorse emoji exists, yes or no, 100 times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a seahorse emoji, yes or no? Respond with one word, no punctuation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>gpt-5-chat

<ul>
<li>83% 'yes'</li>
<li>17% 'Yes'</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Needlessly to say, popular language models are <em>very</em> confident that there's a seahorse emoji. And they're not alone in that confidence - here's a Reddit thread with hundreds of comments from people who distinctly remember a seahorse emoji existing:</p>
<p><img src="https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/reddit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There's tons of this - Google "seahorse emoji" and you'll find TikToks, Youtube videos, and even (now defunct) memecoins based around the supposed vanishing of a seahorse emoji that everyone is pretty sure used to exist - but of course, never did.</p>
<p>Maybe LLMs believe a seahorse emoji exists because so many humans in the training data do. Or maybe it's a convergent belief - given how many other aquatic animals are in Unicode, it's reasonable for both humans and LLMs to assume (generalize, even) that such a delightful animal is as well. A seahorse emoji was even <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/emoji-proposals-status.html">formally proposed at one point</a>, but was rejected in 2018.</p>
<p>Regardless of the root cause, many LLMs begin each new context window fresh with the mistaken latent belief that the seahorse emoji exists. But why does that produce such strange behavior? I mean, I used to believe a seahorse emoji existed myself, but if I had tried to send it to a friend, I would've simply looked for it on my keyboard and realized it wasn't there, not sent the wrong emoji and then gone into an emoji spam doomloop. So what's happening inside the LLM that causes it to act like this?</p>

<p>Using this prompt prefix - a templated chat with the default llama-3.3-70b system prompt, a question about the seahorse emoji, and a partial answer from the model right before it gives the actual emoji:</p>

<p>We can take the model's <code>lm_head</code>, which is usually only used on the output of the last layer, and apply it to <em>every</em> layer to produce intermediate token predictions. That process produces this table, showing for every fourth layer what the most likely token would be for the next three positions after the prefix (tokens 0, 1, and 2), and what the top 5 most likely predictions for the first position is (token 0 topk 5):</p>

<p>This is the logit lens: using the model's <code>lm_head</code> to produce logits (token likelihoods) as a way to investigate its internal states. Note that the tokens and likelihoods we get from the logit lens here are not equivalent to the model's <em>full</em> internal states! For that, we would need a more complex technique like representation reading or sparse autoencoders. Instead, this is a <em>lens</em> on that state - it shows what the output token would be <em>if</em> this layer were the last one. But despite this limitation, the logit lens is still useful. The states of early layers may be difficult to interpret using it, but as we move up through the stack we can see that the model is iteratively refining those states towards its final prediction, a fish emoji.</p>
<p><small>(Why do the unmerged tokens look like that 'ĠðŁ', 'Ĳ', 'ł' nonsense? It's because of a tokenizer quirk - those tokens encode the UTF-8 bytes for the fish emoji. It's not relevant to this post, but if you're curious, ask Claude or your favorite LLM to explain this paragraph and this line of code: <code>bytes([bpe_byte_decoder[c] for c in 'ĠðŁĲł']).decode('utf-8') == ' 🐠'</code>)</small></p>
<p>Take a look at what happens in the middle layers, though - it's not the early-layer weirdness <em>or</em> the emoji bytes of the final prediction! Instead we get words relating to <em>useful concepts</em>, specifically the concept of a seahorse. For example, on layer 52, we get "sea horse horse" - three residual positions in a row encoding the "seahorse" concept. Later, in the top-k for the first position, we get a mixture of "sea", "horse", and an emoji byte sequence prefix, "ĠðŁ".</p>
<p>So what is the model thinking about? "seahorse + emoji"! It's trying to construct a residual representation of a seahorse combined with an emoji. Why would the model try to construct this combination? Well, let's look into how the <code>lm_head</code> actually works.</p>
<h2 id="lm_head"><a href="#lm_head">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for lm_head">
</a><code>lm_head</code></h2>
<p>A language model's <code>lm_head</code> is a huge matrix of residual-sized vectors associated with token ids, one for every token in the vocabulary (~300,000). When a residual is passed into it, either after flowing through the model normally or early because someone is using the logit lens on an earlier layer, the <code>lm_head</code> is going to compare that input residual with each residual-sized vector in that big matrix, and (in coordination with the sampler) select the token id associated with the vector that matrix contains that is most similar to the input residual.</p>
<p>(More technically: <code>lm_head</code> is a linear layer without a bias, so <code>x @ w.T</code> does dot products with each unembedding vector to produce raw scores. Then your usual log_softmax and argmax/temperature sample.)</p>
<p>That means if the model wants to output the word "hello", for example in response to a friendly greeting from the user, it needs to construct a residual as similar as possible to the vector for the "hello" token that the <code>lm_head</code> can then turn into the hello token id. And using logit lens, we can see that's exactly what happens in response to "Hello :-)":</p>

<p>Likewise, if the model wants to output a seahorse emoji, it needs to construct a residual similar to the vector for the seahorse emoji output token(s) - which in theory could be any arbitrary value, but in practice is "seahorse + emoji", word2vec style. We can see this in action with a real emoji, the fish emoji:</p>

<p>Here, everything works perfectly. The model constructs the "fish + emoji" residual - look at the layer 72 topk, where we have both "fish" and the emoji byte prefix "ĠðŁ" - meaning that the residual at this point is similar to both "fish" and "emoji", just like we'd expect. Then when this vector is passed into the <code>lm_head</code> after the final layer, we see a 🐟 just as the model expected.</p>
<p>But unlike with 🐟, the seahorse emoji doesn't exist. The model tries to construct a "seahorse + emoji" vector just as it would for a real emoji, and on layer 72 we even get a very similar construction as with the fish emoji - " se", "horse", and the emoji prefix byte prefix:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>But alas, there's no continuation to ĠðŁ corresponding to a seahorse, so the <code>lm_head</code> similarity score calculation maxes out with horse- or sea-animal-related emoji bytes instead, and an unintended emoji is sampled.</p>
<p>Now, that sampling is valuable information for the model! You can see that in, e.g. the Claude 4.5 Sonnet example below, when the tokens get appended into the context autoregressively, the model can tell that they don't form the intended seahorse emoji. The previous, fuzzy "seahorse + emoji" concept has been "snapped" by the <code>lm_head</code> to an emoji that actually exists, like a tropical fish or horse.</p>
<p><img src="https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/sonnet45.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once this happens, it's up to the model how to proceed. Some models like 4.5 Sonnet try again, and eventually update on the evidence, changing mid-response to a statement about how the seahorse emoji doesn't exist. Other models like gpt-5-chat spiral for longer, sometimes never recovering. Other models will either blissfully ignore that the emoji is incorrect, and some will even correct themselves instantly after seeing only a single incorrect sample.</p>
<p>But until the model gets the wrong output token from <code>lm_head</code>, it just <em>doesn't know</em> that its initial belief about a seahorse emoji existing was wrong. It can only assume that "seahorse + emoji" will produce the tokens it wants.</p>

</a>Some speculation</h2>
<p>To speculate a bit more, I wonder if this problem is part of the benefit of reinforcement learning for LLMs - it gives the model information about its <code>lm_head</code> that's otherwise difficult for it to get at because it's at the end of the layer stack.</p>
<p>(Remember that base models are not trained on their own outputs / rollouts. That only happens in RL.)</p>

<p>Matthias Weyland loves having people ask about his balcony. A pair of solar panels hang from the railing, casting a sheen of dark blue against the red brick of his apartment building. They’re connected to a microinverter plugged into a wall outlet and feed electricity directly into his home. On a sunny day, he’ll produce enough power to supply up to half of his family’s daily needs.</p>



<p>Weyland is one of hundreds of thousands of people across Germany who have embraced <em>balkonkraftwerk</em>, or balcony solar. Unlike <a href="https://grist.org/energy/commercial-roof-space-is-an-untapped-trove-of-clean-energy-for-low-income-communities/">rooftop photovoltaics</a>, the technology doesn’t require users to own their home, and anyone capable of plugging in an appliance can set it up. Most people buy the simple hardware online or at the supermarket for about $550 (500 euros.)</p>



<p>The ease of installation and a potent mix of government policies to encourage adoption has made the wee arrays hugely popular. More than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-gives-apartment-dwellers-legal-right-solar-power-2024-07-05/">550,000 of them</a> dot cities and towns nationwide, half of which were installed in 2023. During the first half of this year, Germany added <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/07/19/germanys-balcony-pv-installations-hit-200-mw-in-h1/">200 megawatts</a> of balcony solar. Regulations limit each system to just 800 watts, enough to power a small fridge or charge a laptop, but the cumulative effect is nudging the country toward its clean energy goals&nbsp;while giving apartment dwellers, who make up <a href="https://www.destatis.de/Europa/EN/Topic/Population-Labour-Social-Issues/Social-issues-living-conditions/RentedAccommodation.html">more than half</a> of the population, an easy way to save money and address the climate crisis.</p>



<p>“I love the feeling of charging the bike when the sun is shining, or having the washing machine run when the sun is shining, and to know that it comes directly from the sun,” Weyland said. “It’s a small step you can take as a tenant” and an act of “self-efficacy, to not just sit and wait until the climate crisis gets worse.”</p>



<p>Balcony solar emerged around a decade ago, but didn’t catch on until four or five years ago, thanks in part to <a href="https://www.pvplug.de/">years of lobbying</a> by solar and clean energy advocates for policies to foster its adoption. The German government enacted the first technical regulations for plug-in solar devices in 2019, allowing balcony solar systems to use standard electrical plugs and feed into the grid. That prompted an influx of plug-in devices and advocates to promote the technology.</p>



<p>The pandemic helped fuel the surge in popularity as people spent time at home, working on DIY projects. More recently, the escalating energy prices that followed <a href="https://grist.org/article/the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-left-a-hole-in-the-global-energy-market/">Russia’s invasion</a> <a href="https://grist.org/health/one-year-in-the-toxic-legacy-of-war-in-ukraine-comes-into-view/">of Ukraine</a> led more Germans to consider balcony solar. “People just did anything they could to reduce their energy bills,” said Wolfgang Gründinger, who works with the clean energy company Enpal.</p>



<p>Federal and local policymakers have redoubled their efforts to make the technology more accessible. In April, the government <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-simplifies-registration-balcony-photovoltaic-units">simplified permitting and registration requirements</a>, and in July, federal lawmakers passed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-gives-apartment-dwellers-legal-right-solar-power-2024-07-05/">renter protections</a> that prevent landlords from arbitrarily blocking installations. Cities throughout Germany, including Berlin and Weyland’s home city of Kiel, have offered <a href="https://www.berlin.de/en/news/8025956-5559700-solar-power-balcony-subsidy-program-frid.en.html">millions of euros</a> in subsidies to install balcony solar.</p>



<p>Gründinger and experts at the German Solar Industry Association noted that the devices don’t generate enough power to strain the grid, and their standardized design and safety features allow them to integrate smoothly and easily.</p>

<p>Despite the hype, most users concede that balcony solar provides modest cost and energy savings. Weyland spent around $530 for his 600-watt-capacity system. While he’s happy with how his south-facing panels perform during balmy weather, such days are rare in northern Germany. He estimates that he’ll save around $100 in annual electricity costs and recoup his investment in about five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s fairly typical, although advocates of the technology say a system’s efficacy — and, therefore, payback timeline — varies widely depending upon the number of panels, their location and direction, and how much shade surrounds them. A household with a “comparatively large well-positioned balcony system in a sunny spot facing south” can produce 15 percent of its electricity with balcony solar, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/balcony-solar-panels-renewable-energy-for-all/video-68520021">according to Peter Stratmann</a>, head of renewables at German Federal Network Agency, the country’s utility regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While that can put a dent in a household’s utility bill, its impact on Germany’s consumption is far smaller. “Even if we attached panels to all suitable balconies across the country, we’d still only manage to meet 1 percent or less of our overall energy needs,” Stratmann told <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/balcony-solar-panels-renewable-energy-for-all/video-68520021">Deutsche Welle</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if balcony solar doesn’t generate a lot of power or save a lot of money, why are so many people flocking to it? Many of them like the idea of producing energy at home and gaining a bit of independence from the grid. It also provides <a href="https://grist.org/health/one-year-in-the-toxic-legacy-of-war-in-ukraine-comes-into-view/">a tangible way to take climate action</a>. “It makes the energy transition feel a little more concrete and not so abstract,” said Helena Holenweger of the nonprofit Deutsche Umwelthilfe, or Environmental Action Germany. She installed a balcony solar system on top of her garage about a year ago. “You can literally do something about it.”</p>



<p>Holenweger and others who have tapped the sun said balcony solar led them to reevaluate their understanding of electricity consumption and take steps to reduce it. “For lots of people, energy is just something that comes out of your socket,” Holenweger said. “You never think about how it gets there or how it works.” The systems don’t include battery storage, so the juice they generate must be used immediately, leading people to plan the best time to, say, run the washing machine to ensure they’re using renewable energy. In that way, it becomes something of a game. Many balcony solar kits feature an app to track daily energy generation, providing what has, for many people, become a scorecard. “They screenshot that, they send it around to their Facebook groups, family WhatsApp groups. They’re super proud,” Gründinger said.</p>



<p>Germany is unique in its rabid embrace of the tech. Although increasingly popular in <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Austria-facilitates-balcony-power-plants-9797327.html">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/business/germany-solar-panels-climate-change.html">the Netherlands, France</a>, and elsewhere in Europe, plug-in solar devices aren’t viable in the United States <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038092X16301815?via%3Dihub">due to costly permitting requirements and other local regulations</a>. Beyond that, most systems are designed to European electrical standards, making them <a href="https://cybernews.com/tech/germany-balcony-solar-craze/">incompatible with U.S. power systems</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even in Germany, balcony solar still faces hurdles, including fierce resistance from landlords worried about electrical fires or put off by the aesthetics of the panels. Last year, Weyland sued his building’s property management company for imposing what he deemed unreasonable requirements to install a system, including a formal inspection of the building’s electrical system. A court <a href="https://www.duh.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/balkonkraftwerk-darf-angebracht-werden-von-deutscher-umwelthilfe-vor-gericht-unterstuetzte-mieter-ko/">sided with him in October 2023</a>, but similar cases pop up regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weyland hopes that as more people adopt balcony solar, that will soon change. Already, people in his life regularly ask him about his panels, and two friends are buying systems of their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So many people talk to me in our neighborhood and ask about the system when they see it,” Weyland said. “It’s kind of like a snowball that gets bigger and bigger.”</p>

        <p>It’s often said that what’s inside matters more than one’s looks, but it’s hard to argue that a product’s looks and its physical user experience are what makes it instantly recognizable. When you think of something like a Walkman, an iPod music player, a desktop computer, a car or a TV, the first thing that comes to mind is the way&nbsp; that it looks along with its user interface. This is the domain of industrial design, where circuit boards, mechanisms, displays and buttons are put into a shell that ultimately defines what users see and experience.</p>
<p>Thus industrial design is perhaps the most important aspect of product development as far as the user is concerned, right along with the feature list. It’s also no secret that marketing departments love to lean into the styling and ergonomics of a product. In light of this it is very disconcerting that the past years industrial design for consumer electronics in particular seems to have wilted and is now practically on the verge of death.</p>
<p>Devices like cellphones and TVs are now mostly flat plastic-and-glass rectangles with no distinguishing features. Laptops and PCs are identified either by being flat, small, having RGB lighting, or a combination of these. At the same time buttons and other physical user interface elements are vanishing along with prominent styling, leaving us in a world of basic geometric shapes and flat, evenly colored surfaces. Exactly how did we get to this point, and what does this mean for our own hardware projects?</p>

<p>Industrial design is less of a science and more of an art, limited only by the available materials, the constraints of the product’s internals and the goal of creating a positive user experience. Although design has always played a role with many products over the millennia, these were generally quite limited due to material and tooling constraints. As both plastics and electronics began their stratospheric rise during the 20th century, suddenly it felt like many of these constraints had been removed.</p>
<p>No longer was one limited to basic materials like stone, metal, wood and paint, while internals got ever smaller and more flexible in terms of placement. Enclosures now could take on any shape, while buttons, knobs and dials could be shaped and placed to one’s heart’s content. This change is clearly visible in consumer devices, with the sixties and subsequent<a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="609624" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2023/08/18/a-quarter-century-of-the-imac/imac-25-thumbnail/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg" data-orig-size="600,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="imac-25-thumbnail" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?w=600" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg 600w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?resize=250,250 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/imac-25-thumbnail.jpg?resize=400,400 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a> decades seeing a veritable explosion in stylish transistorized radios, home computers and portable entertainment devices, with industrial designers getting the hang of all these new materials and options.</p>
<p>The peak here was arguably achieved during the 1990s and early 2000s, as electronic miniaturization and manufacturing chops led to device manufacturers basically just showing off. Personal Hi-Fi systems and portable devices along with computer systems and laptops grew curved, translucent and transparent plastic along with a dazzling array of colors.</p>
<p>These days we refer to this era as the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K_aesthetic" target="_blank">Y2K Aesthetic</a>‘, which was followed around the mid-2000s to early 2010s by the sweetly named ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frutiger_Aero" target="_blank">Frutiger Aero</a>‘ era. During this time both hardware and software underwent a transition from mostly utilitarian looks into something that can be defined as tasteful to over the top, depending on your perspective, but above all it embraced the technologies and materials in its industrial design. Futurism and literal transparency were the rule, as a comfortable, colorful and stylish companion in daily life.</p>

<p>Ask someone to visualize a Nokia 3310 and even if they’re born after 2000, there’s a good chance that they will be able to tell you what it is, what it does and what it looks like. Then ask that same person to describe any modern cellphone, and while the feature list should be quite easy, asking them to draw what differentiates, say, an iPhone 16 from a Samsung Galaxy S25 is effectively impossible unless they have memorized the layout of the cameras on the back and perhaps the side button placement.</p>

<p>Over the decades, cellphones have seen their displays grow larger and larger. With voracious appetite, these displays have consumed bezels, front speakers, keyboards and home buttons.</p>
<p>Along with the demise of these features, front facing cameras were only preserved by literally punching a hole in the display, but notification LEDs vanished right along with headphone jacks, IR blaster LEDs, swappable covers, removable batteries, etc.</p>
<p>The current scuttlebutt is that Apple will be the first to drop any and all connectors from its iPhone cellphones, with the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/a-truly-portless-iphone-just-got-the-all-clear-from-the-eu" target="_blank">iPhone 17</a> reportedly nearly becoming the first to do so. Along with eSIMs, this would leave smartphones as glued-together slabs of plastic-and-glass with only a screen, some cameras and a couple of buttons.</p>
<p>In marketing shots smartphones are always shown with a lock- or home screen open on the screen, because otherwise there would be just a lifeless black slab of glass to look at from the front. From the side you can see the same slab, which easily wobbles on its ever-growing camera hump that’s sticking out of the razor-thin case like a bad case of optical melanoma. At this point in time, the most exciting thing about cellphones is whether it can flip or not, followed by whatever subdued color is applied to the slippery glass back that you want to cover up with something concealing and grippy as soon as possible anyway.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s not just phones either, but also computers, with the iMac’s evolution showing a clear ‘evolution’ from colorful and bold designs to geometric slabs:</p>

<p>Whether you call it ‘modern’ or ‘clean’ design, the trend is quite clear. Curves are removed, colors are purged or at the very least muted and the overall design reduced to the level of excitement experienced while being stuck at an Ikea showroom during a busy weekend with the family.</p>

<p>There was a time when televisions had a recognizable look to them, with a stylish bezel, a real power button, as well as a couple of front input connectors and buttons to adjust basic settings like volume and the current channel, which could also be hidden behind a small flap. This is now all gone, and TVs have become as visually striking from the front as modern smartphones, with the speakers fully nerfed since there’s no space on the front any more.</p>
<p>All inputs and any remaining controls are now hidden on the back where reaching them is borderline impossible after installation, never mind if you mounted it on a wall. You’re not supposed to find the TV visually appealing, or marvel at the easy user interface, just consume whatever content is displayed on the bezel-less screen.</p>
<p>The rest of any home entertainment setup has undergone the same process, with the HiFi stacks and mid-sized sets of yesteryear replaced by the same smartphones and TVs, along with a bit of plastic that you can stick into a slab TV to stream content with from some internet-based service.</p>

<p>Rather than a stereo – or better – HiFi setup, most people will have a bunch of usually mono Bluetooth speakers scattered around, each of which possessing the visual appeal of a radar dome. If you’re lucky there are still a couple of touch buttons to fondle, but virtually all of your interactions with such devices will go via an app on your slab phone.</p>
<p>Touch controls are also all that you will get these days, as physical buttons, dials, sliders and switches are almost completely faux pas in modern-day product design. Everything has to be smooth, stealthy, invisibly present and yet always there when you crave that entertainment fix.</p>
<p>This design language isn’t just afflicting home electronics either, as over the past years car interiors have seen physical user controls vanish in favor of one or more touch screens, with cars like those from Tesla being the most extreme example with just a single large touch screen on the center console as the sole user interface. Users are however <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/car-buttons/" target="_blank">pushing back against this change</a>, with a number of studies also showing that touch-only controls are less effective and less safe than fumbling around on a big screen while driving to adjust something like the climate controls or radio station.</p>
<h2>There Is An App For That</h2>
<p>Want to set up your new formless slab of plastic or fabric? Please download this special mobile app to do anything with it. Got a new pair of headphones? Better pray that the mobile app works well on your slab phone or you’ll be stuck with whatever preset defaults it came with, as physical controls on the device are for dummies.</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the human user interface part of industrial design has been mostly taken out back and replaced with software running on a slab phone. Whatever vestigial controls still remain on the device itself will only be a small subset of what its electronics and firmware are capable of. The slab phone has thus become the user interface, with that part of industrial design often outsourced to some third-party mobile app developer.</p>
<p>This has massively backfired for some companies already, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342282/sonos-app-redesign-controversy-full-story" target="_blank">Sonos in 2024 releasing</a> a ‘new and improved’ version of its slab phone app that was so buggy and plagued with issues that it rendered the Sonos speaker hardware effectively useless. While physical user interfaces have their issues, sinking an entire company due to a badly arranged set of knobs is not as easy as with a slab phone app or equivalent, not to mention the potential to retroactively brick the user interface of devices that people have already purchased.</p>
<h2>Yearning For That Human Touch</h2>

<p>Here we can see <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/09/03/a-windows-control-panel-retrospective-amidst-a-concerning-ux-shift/">parallels with computer user interfaces</a>, where much like with industrial design there’s a big push to reduce shapes to the most basic geometric forms, remove or reduce color and remove any ‘superfluous’ styling including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skeuomorph" target="_blank">skeuomorphism</a>. These parallels are perhaps not that surprising, as companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft produce both consumer hardware and software.</p>
<p>Google, for example, has heavily invested in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design" target="_blank">Material Design</a> design language, which can be summarized as having flat color backgrounds with the most simplistic UI elements suspended in said void. UI elements like the ‘hamburger’ icon are used to hide menus not just on phones, but also on desktop systems, where a form of extreme minimalism is being pushed to its ultimate extremes.</p>
<p>In the case of consumer electronics that means devices that lack any distinguishable features, as minimalism is a poor way to distinguish one product from another. The removal of visually pleasing and physically practical elements also means a dull, stimulation-free experience.</p>
<p>There are no pleasing elements to rest your eyes on, no curves or colors that invoke an emotional response, no buttons to press, or any kind of auditory or physical response. Just lifeless touch controls on slabs of plastic and glass with maybe a sad beep as confirmation of a touch control having been triggered.</p>
<p>In this context, what is often called <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/04/22/why-physical-media-deserved-to-die/">the revival of physical media</a> can be interpreted as not just a yearning for a more visceral audio-visual experience, but would together with so-called retro-computing be a way to experience personal electronics in a way that stimulates and invigorates. Where physical buttons are pressed, sliders slid, dials turned and things go click and whirr as one’s fingers touch and manipulate the very real user interface elements.</p>
<p>We know that chronic boredom can be extremely harmful to non-human animals, with enrichment toys and activities prescribed to make them happier and more content. With modern day consumer electronics having become incredibly dull due to the death of industrial design, it would seem that us human mammals are seeking out our own enrichment activities, modern design sensibilities be damned. If this means repeating the sins of early 2000s or 1990s industrial design in our personal hobbyist projects, it’s a price worth to pay for keeping ourselves and our fellow humans happy and enriched.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/landley/toybox">https://github.com/landley/toybox</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45484284">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><pre>Toybox: all-in-one Linux command line.

--- Getting started

You can download static binaries for various targets from:

  <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/bin" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox/bin</a>

The special name "." indicates the current directory (just like ".." means
the parent directory), and you can run a program that isn't in the $PATH by
specifying a path to it, so this should work:

  wget <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/bin/toybox-x86_64" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox/bin/toybox-x86_64</a>
  chmod +x toybox-x86_64
  ./toybox-x86_64 echo hello world

--- Building toybox

Type "make help" for build instructions.

Toybox uses the "make menuconfig; make; make install" idiom same as
the Linux kernel. Usually you want something like:

  make defconfig
  make
  make install

Or maybe:

  LDFLAGS="--static" CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l- make defconfig toybox
  PREFIX=/path/to/root/filesystem/bin make install_flat

The file "configure" defines default values for many environment variables
that control the toybox build; if you export any of these variables into your
environment, your value is used instead of the default in that file.

The CROSS_COMPILE argument above is optional, the default builds a version of
toybox to run on the current machine. Cross compiling requires an appropriately
prefixed cross compiler toolchain, several example toolchains (built using
the file "scripts/mcm-buildall.sh" in the toybox source) are available at:

  <a href="https://landley.net/toybox/downloads/binaries/toolchains/latest" rel="nofollow">https://landley.net/toybox/downloads/binaries/toolchains/latest</a>

For the "CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l-" example above, download
armv5l-linux-musleabihf-cross.tar.xz, extract it, and add its "bin"
subdirectory to your $PATH. (And yes, the trailing - is significant,
because the prefix includes a dash.)

For more about cross compiling, see:

  <a href="https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross" rel="nofollow">https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross</a>
  <a href="http://landley.net/writing/docs/cross-compiling.html" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/writing/docs/cross-compiling.html</a>
  <a href="http://landley.net/aboriginal/architectures.html" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/aboriginal/architectures.html</a>

For a more thorough description of the toybox build process, see:

--- Using toybox

The toybox build produces a multicall binary, a "swiss-army-knife" program
that acts differently depending on the name it was called by (cp, mv, cat...).
Installing toybox adds symlinks for each command name to the $PATH.

The special "toybox" command treats its first argument as the command to run.
With no arguments, it lists available commands. This allows you to use toybox
without installing it, and is the only command that can have an arbitrary
suffix (hence "toybox-armv5l").

The "help" command provides information about each command (ala "help cat"),
and "help toybox" provides general information about toybox.

--- Configuring toybox

It works like the Linux kernel: allnoconfig, defconfig, and menuconfig edit
a ".config" file that selects which features to include in the resulting
binary. You can save and re-use your .config file, but may want to
run "make oldconfig" to re-run the dependency resolver when migrating to
new versions.

The maximum sane configuration is "make defconfig": allyesconfig isn't
recommended as a starting point for toybox because it enables unfinished
commands, debug code, and optional dependencies your build environment may
not provide.

--- Creating a Toybox-based Linux system

Toybox has a built-in simple system builder (scripts/mkroot.sh) with a
Makefile target:

  make root
  sudo chroot root/host/fs /init

Type "exit" to get back out. If you install appropriate cross compilers and
point it at Linux source code, it can build simple three-package systems
that boot to a shell prompt under qemu:

  make root CROSS_COMPILE=sh4-linux-musl- LINUX=~/linux
  cd root/sh4
  ./qemu-sh4.sh

By calling scripts/mkroot.sh directly you can add additional packages
to the build, see scripts/root/dropbear as an example.

--- Contributing

The three important URLs for communicating with the toybox project are:

  web page: <a href="http://landley.net/toybox" rel="nofollow">http://landley.net/toybox</a>

  mailing list: <a href="http://lists.landley.net/listinfo.cgi/toybox-landley.net" rel="nofollow">http://lists.landley.net/listinfo.cgi/toybox-landley.net</a>

  git repo: <a href="http://github.com/landley/toybox">http://github.com/landley/toybox</a>

The maintainer prefers patches be sent to the mailing list. If you use git,
the easy thing to do is:

  git format-patch -1 $HASH

Then send a file attachment. The list holds messages from non-subscribers
for moderation, but I usually get to them in a day or two.

I download github pull requests as patches and apply them with "git am"
(which avoids gratuitous merge commits). Sometimes I even remember to close
the pull request.

If I haven't responded to your patch after one week, feel free to remind
me of it.

Android's policy for toybox patches is that non-build patches should go
upstream first (into vanilla toybox, with discussion on the toybox mailing
list) and then be pulled into android's toybox repo from there. (They
generally resync on fridays). The exception is patches to their build scripts
(Android.mk and the checked-in generated/* files) which go directly to AOSP.

(As for the other meaning of "contributing", <a href="https://patreon.com/landley" rel="nofollow">https://patreon.com/landley</a> is
always welcome but I warn you up front I'm terrible about updating it.)

                <section>
                    <!--<blockquote>
                      <span ><i>Show me your model weights, and I'll tell you who you are.</i></span>
                    </blockquote>-->

                    <p><span>O</span>penAI recently released their open-weights model. Here we'll discuss how that inevitably leaks some information about their model training stack, and, on the way, show that GPT-5 was trained on phrases from adult websites.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>What data does OpenAI train their models on? That is a well-protected trade secret of course, one with vested interest for the answer. While GPT-oss's weights are openly available, the sources of training data are not clearly described in the model card. It is stated that the model was trained on a "text-only dataset with trillions of tokens, with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge". However, as we will see, the model parameters can tell us more than that.</p>

                    <p>A demonstration to start with: 
                        Let's have OpenAI's GPT-5<label for="sn-GPT5-version"></label><span>We use version GPT-5-2025-08-07 for these experiments. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68ca1a9c-0d2c-8011-b50e-a0bb21ff2a83">Here</a> is a link to the completion.</span>
                        do the simplest kind of task possible for a language model, repeating a string of Unicode text. Let's choose something random, like the Abkhaz word for "population", which is "ауааԥсыра". Upon asking <code>Repeat after me: "ауааԥсыра"</code>, it replies something completely different, "ആളുകൾ", which apparently means people in Malayalam<label for="sn-1"></label><span><a href="https://glosbe.com/ml/en/%E0%B4%86%E0%B4%B3%E0%B5%81%E0%B4%95%E0%B4%B3%E0%B5%8D">According to this dictionary.</a> Subsequent translations here are patched together with web searches, online dictionaries and translation software.</span>. As you might have guessed, we did not choose that string randomly at all, it is a special adversarial input belonging to a class of glitch tokens. But how did we identify such a glitch token among the 200,000 tokens that GPT-5 uses?
                            
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                          <img src="https://fi-le.net/oss/figures/screen.png">
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                        All of OpenAI's models since GPT-4o use the o200k tokenizer. This means that we can use the GPT-oss embeddings to study the token list without having to look at each token's text content.
                        Let's make a histogram of the L2 norm of each row of the embedding matrix.

                        
                    There are about 936 tokens with very low L2 norm, centered at about 2. This likely means that they did not occur in the training process of GPT-oss and were thus depressed by some form of weight decay. This range consists of reserved special tokens and the Unicode bytes <code>b'\xc4'</code>, <code>b'\xbf'</code>, as well as <code>b'\xf5'</code> through to <code>b'\xff'</code>, plus token 20373, a highly anomalous byte sequence <code>b'\xbe\xb3\xe9\x97\xa8'</code><label for="sn-2"></label><span>One explanation might be that the first two bytes are "境" in the <a href="https://www.khngai.com/chinese/charmap/tblgbk.php?page=3">GBK encoding</a> and the last three are "门" in UTF-8. Together these mean "border gate" in Mandarin, which is apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajingmen">part of the Great wall of China</a>.</span>.</p>

                    <p>This low L2-norm token group could be useful for two things. Its (1) variance gives an estimate of the variance used in the initialization and (2) its mean would give an estimate of how many gradient descent steps were taken in total, if we assume standard weight decay and know the learning rate.</p>

                    <p>The right tail of the distribution is not quite Gaussian either. Looking at the English tokens with the highest norm, we find:</p>

                    <p>These tokens are either very common, or appear especially in reasoning tasks, in particular those with code. This might mean that coding reinforcement learning was the last step in the training process, and that all other tokens got slightly weight decayed. It could also mean that in general, reasoning tokens are treated as so important by gradient descent that their updates are extra large.</p>

                    <p>Mandarin speakers will have understood that the above contains an unwholesome sublist of spammy and adult-oriented website terms, with some being too explicit to make the list here. Indeed, o200k, the tokenizer used for 4o, o1, o3, o4, oss, and GPT-5 contains a lot of junk tokens. This means that every time ChatGPT runs, a matrix containing all the strange tokens we are talking about here are patiently waiting on Microsoft Azure to be multiplied with. Some of my personal favorite tokens are "北京赛车怎么" (How to play Beijing Racing), "天天中彩票的" (Winning the lottery every day), and of course "《凤凰大参考" (Phoenix Reference). Another token is "铁血网", the name of a Chinese nationalism and military enthuiasm website, which is ironic given the geopolitical considerations that are usually raised in connection with OpenAI. It is unexpected that this type of political content not just made it into the tokenizer training data, but was even overrepresented. </p>

                    <p>There are also some oddball high-norm tokens in Abkhaz, Armenian, Gujarati, Thai, and more. Some interesting examples are ",ಂಗಳೂರು" (The city Mangaluru in Kannada) along with other cities in Kerala, "ถวายสัตย์ฯ" ("Oath of Allegiance" in Thai), "แขวงคลองเตยเหนือ" (a district in Bangkok with less than 10,000 inhabitants), "วิเคราะห์บอลวันนี้" ("today's football analysis" in Thai) along with a handful of other football-related tokens.</p>

                    <p>The question is, why do these tokens have a higher, not lower, norm than the normal tokens? If they are unused, weight decay should bring them all the way down to the other unused tokens.</p>

                    <p>In <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">this post</a>, Jessica Rumbelow identified similar glitch tokens in GPT-2 and GPT-3, most famously the "SolidGoldMagicarp" token. Her finding was that the tokens closest to the mean of all embeddings were the glitch tokens, not necessarily those with low norm. But that's not the case here: Tokens with comparatively high norm are always far away from the mean. Further, computing cosine similarity between two of these embeddings gives higher similarity on average.</p>

                    <p>One way to get closer to the answer is to observe the models' behavior when given these tokens. We ask GPT-oss and GPT-5 about the not-so-classy token 162657: <code>What does this mean: "毛片免费观看"</code>. With some euphemism, it means "watching explicit videos for free" in Mandarin. </p>

                        <span>
                            See the full completion <a href="https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68cb619f3c10819192432d4a99431792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. To verify that the string was tokenized as expected, we can use <a href="https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/">tiktokenizer</a>.
                        </span>, GPT-5 correctly states that the token contains Chinese text, and that it is related to watching something. It can also enumerate some of the characters in it. This means that the token was seen during training, at least once! Interestingly, the model seems to be aware of the inappropriate meaning of the token, but plays it down and in particular does not refuse to answer. Presumably this is because the token only occurs a few times in the training corpus.
                    </p>

                    <p>In other words, we can say that a certain string, in this case a sensitive one, was part of the GPT-5 training corpus. This is called membership inference in the machine learning literature. Membership inference with high confidence is generally considered to be impractical in production LLMs, so this is a surprising finding.</p>

                    <p>Automating this process through the API, we can find which glitch tokens were seen during training of the GPT-oss and GPT-5 model families. We ask the models to give a translation of the token to English and ask for the language the token is in. For now, we simply filter for the Chinese tokens, and pass 50 tokens with highest L2 embedding norm to the models. For a control, we also ask Claude 4 and can confirm that it always answers correctly. Since a few of these tokens could technically be Japanese, we count this as a correct answer, too. For cost reasons, we ask about each token only 4 times per model, and denote 4 correct answers with a ✓, 3 and 2 with a !, 1 with a ?, and 0 with a ✗.

                    <p>We can read off that the explicit token we already found is recognized by all models, and identify a few more anomalous tokens that were likely seen during training. Many others however are not recognized, and thus unlikely to have been in the training data.</p>

                    <p>We try to identify a pattern in the tokens that are recognized. It generally seems that recognized tokens yield many more hits on GitHub. Indeed, there often are some spam repositories on GitHub that contain these recognized strings, as well as some repositories containing lists of strings to block for content moderation.</p>

                    <p>The membership inference only tells us that the model saw the string, not where it was sourced from. To test whether GitHub was a likely source, we therefore correlate the number of search hits on GitHub with the number of correct answers across the GPT models. We find a significant Spearman's ρ of 0.448. This does not prove that GitHub was the source, because the high search hit count on GitHub could just be indicative that the token is more common across the internet. Nonetheless, the setup demonstrates how glitch tokens could be used to make broader statements about the training data.

                    <p>In summary, we have found strong evidence that models in the GPT-5 and GPT-oss family were trained on phrases from adult websites. We have also found weak evidence that part of the GPT training corpus was scraped off of GitHub. The search was made easier via access the weights of GPT-oss, showing how the open-weights paradigm opens up new attack vectors on production models. It seems advisable for frontier labs to mitigate this problem by excluding uncommon strings from their tokenizer vocabularies.</p>

                    <h3>Appendix</h3>
                    <p>These glitch tokens have more uses than was described above. If you want to work with these concepts, the <a href="https://github.com/lennart-finke/gpt-oss">companion repository</a> provides a starting point. Some ideas that could be interesting to explore:

                    </p><ul>
                        <li>Use glitch tokens to identify which model is behind a proprietary pipeline: I found that Cursor has issues with documents containing the glitch tokens listed here in Auto mode, but not with Claude selected, meaning Auto mode was using an OpenAI model in that case.</li>
                        <li>Study the implications on sample efficiency of GPT. Glitch tokens only occur a few times in training corpus, so the fact that GPT-5 only knows a little bit about their content gives a kind of upper bound on its sample efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Go beyond the embeddings and incorporate the first layers of the model, which could conceivably give information about bigram frequencies.</li>
                        <li>For the older gpt-4o model family, some glitch tokens induce infinitely looping completions. This could risk a denial-of-service-style token wasting attack, where a malicious user sends a glitch token to have the application use too many tokens. See below for a table of glitch tokens with links to gpt-4o and 4o-mini completions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As more research on glitch tokens becomes available, I will try to list it here. The most comprehensive report to date is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/17/1092649/gpt-4o-chinese-token-polluted/">this</a> article in MIT Technology Review, and there are many articles in Chinese, such as <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/697685138">this one</a>. However, these  discuss the tokenizer itself, not how the models behave. </p>

                    <p>Finally, if you are in a position to fix the issue in the OpenAI API, I presume you already know how, else I'm happy to help. Note that a fix could even lower inference cost a bit. You can mail to <a href="mailto:lennart@finke.dev">lennart@finke.dev</a>.</p>

The G-Drive has been in use since 2018, requiring government officials to store all work documents in the cloud instead of on personal computers. It provided around 30 gigabytes of storage per person.  </p><div><p><h2><strong>Related Article</strong></h2></p></div>  &nbsp;  <p>   However, due to the system’s large-capacity, low-performance storage structure, no external backups were maintained — meaning all data has been permanently lost.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The scale of damage varies by agency. The Ministry of Personnel Management, which had mandated that all documents be stored exclusively on G-Drive, was hit hardest. The Office for Government Policy Coordination, which used the platform less extensively, suffered comparatively less damage.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The Personnel Ministry stated that all departments are expected to experience work disruptions. It is currently working to recover alternative data using any files saved locally on personal computers within the past month, along with emails, official documents and printed records.  </p><div>              <p><img alt="A firefighter cools down burnt batteries at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS) in Daejeon on Sept. 27.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><cite>Updated at 1:15 p.m. ET on September 12, 2025</cite></small></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was lit, COVID-19 was still a mysterious respiratory illness in Wuhan, and I was a Ph.D. candidate in a dying field: comparative literature. I was getting ready to Zoom interview for a tenure-track job near Boston that I almost certainly wouldn’t get (and didn’t). Sardined with me in a Greenwich Village coffee shop in December 2019, one of my faculty mentors talked me through, for the thousandth time, the questions I should expect the hiring committee to ask me and dispensed advice about how I should answer them. Then we walked back to his office, lined in handsome foreign-language editions of various novels and works of philosophy, where I would sit for the interview. There, he offered a final piece of wisdom: “Don’t be nervous. It’s just Harvard,” he said, grinning. “It’s not like it’s Chicago.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A joke, but not entirely. For as long as I can remember, and certainly much longer than that, the University of Chicago has been widely viewed as the destination for humanities students and scholars. Some other elite schools might have the coveted Ivy League branding, or a few more famous faculty members, or a couple more dollars to tack onto the salaries of its professors and graduate students. But perhaps nowhere is the study of literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages more valued, their spirit more authentically preserved, their frontiers more doggedly pursued, than at Chicago. The university has had several household names on its humanities faculty, including the firebrand critic Allan Bloom, the novelist Saul Bellow, and the ethicist Martha Nussbaum, as well as scholars who may be less well known to the general public but whose work has been deeply influential in their fields, including the brilliant literary critic Sianne Ngai and Fred Donner, the pathbreaking and Guggenheim-winning historian of early Islam. In short, Chicago is a place for scholars’ scholars. At least, that’s the reputation. And Chicago’s reputation is no doubt why, when the university announced recently that it was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/15/university-of-chicago-phd-admissions-humanities/">reducing Ph.D. admissions</a> for seven departments—among them art history and English language and literature—and outright freezing admissions to others, including classics, the decision was met, in some quarters, with fury and disbelief. “Chicago!” as one stunned academic friend put it in a text to me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In an August 12 email to faculty, Deborah Nelson, Chicago’s arts and humanities dean, said that the changes were necessitated by “this moment of uncertainty” and “evolving fiscal realities.” These bits of bureaucratese appear to be allusions to both the Trump administration’s war on higher education and Chicago’s homegrown financial troubles, which include an eye-popping $6.3 billion in debt. “To be anything but cautious at this moment,” the dean’s email continued, “would be irresponsible.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/02/grad-school-admissions-trump-cuts/681848/">Read: Grad school is in trouble</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Chicago’s social-sciences division has also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/08/21/more-uchicago-phd-programs-will-pause-admissions">announced</a> doctoral-admissions pauses, primarily in humanistic-leaning programs such as anthropology and social thought, where towering figures including the philosopher Hannah Arendt once taught. What’s happening at Chicago is a particular gut-punch to the humanities, not just at the university itself, but nationally and even globally. The school is, as the classics professor Catherine Kearns put it in a message to me, “a singular center for the pursuit of humanistic knowledge and intellectual growth.” Of the nearly 30 Chicago humanities professors I spoke with for this article, many emphasized that the stakes are much higher than the fate of prospective graduate students or the professors who might teach them. Chicago has long helped to keep alive tiny fields and esoteric areas of humanistic study, particularly in the languages. Without the university’s support, and the continued training of graduate students who can keep these bodies of knowledge going, entire spheres of human learning might eventually blink out.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Of course, some might view these comments as self-serving complaints. But the primary fears of the people I spoke with were not about their own careers or futures, but instead about their fields—about knowledge that, once lost, cannot be easily regained. “If you allow a field to die, there’s a loss to something like humanity,” Clifford Ando, a Chicago classicist who has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-crisis-of-the-university-started-long-before-trump/">outspoken</a> about the administration’s maneuvers, told me. “There’s also a real practical risk that a field simply cannot be re-created just because you have books.” I heard this sentiment echoed over and over. “If we stop producing people who are trained or educated to help undergraduates understand the most important things thought or written or painted in human history,” the renowned philosopher Robert Pippin said, “we might not be able to recover that.” Elaine Hadley, an emerita professor of English, told me, “Part of what we do is we’re conservators, keeping a body of knowledge going. We want to innovate and we want to think new things about it, and, you know, we want to make it relevant to the present day, but we’re also trying to keep this knowledge alive.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These responses emphasize the cultural costs of shrinking the number of people trained in humanities fields, rather than focusing on the question of whether universities should be calibrating the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/04/bad-job-market-phds/479205/">production of Ph.D.s</a> to the academic job market. No one I spoke to was insensitive to the pressures their grad students face when confronting the vanishing opportunities for tenure-track employment. But the professors also seemed reluctant to define the success of a program by how many professors it creates—after all, most humanities PhD students at Chicago do not pay tuition and receive stipends to cover their living costs, and getting paid to learn and read is not the worst fate.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These faculty perspectives also stood in stark contrast with the reigning image of elite higher educators in right-wing media outlets: that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative. Implicit in their impassioned defenses was the belief that the role of a humanist is to preserve knowledge, safeguard learning from the market and the tides of popular interest, and ward off coarse appeals to economic utility.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Depending on whom I asked, the move to scale back humanities doctoral programs is either a prudent acknowledgment of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">cratered job market</a> for tenure-track professorships and a wise attempt to protect the university’s humanities division from looming financial and political risks, or it is a cynical effort, under cover of the Trump administration’s assaults, to transfer resources away from “impractical,” unprofitable, and largely jobless fields (such as, say, comparative literature) and toward areas that the university’s senior leadership seems to care about (such as, say, STEM and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mfvpartners.com/2025/05/29/harper-court-ventures-launches-with-25-million-supporting-university-of-chicago-deep-tech-startups/">“innovation”</a>). One faculty member I spoke with mentioned <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chicagomaroon.com/48215/news/uchicago-arts-humanities-division-to-restructure-amid-historic-funding-pressures/">a consulting firm</a> that was brought on to help Chicago as it considers changes to its humanities division, including possibly consolidating the departments from 15 down to eight. Many professors worried that the move to impose uneven changes—reducing admissions in some while halting them in others—may be an attempt to create circumstances that will ultimately make it easier to dissolve the paused programs. “Let no good crisis go unleveraged,” Holly Shissler, an associate professor in the Middle Eastern Studies department, said with a dark laugh. “You engineer a situation in which there are no students, and then you turn around and say, ‘Why are we supporting all these departments and faculty when they have no students?’”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/trump-university-presidents/683803/">Read: The elite-university presidents who despise one another</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I emailed Nelson and asked whether the changes were part of a plan to kill off the paused departments, she said, “A one-year pause is exactly that—a discrete decision that applies merely to a single admissions cycle.” She seemed to acknowledge, however, that a divisional reorganization could happen. “My goal is to sustain the full scope of our faculty’s research and teaching,” she said. “To do so, we must be open to new ideas and structures.” She added, “There’s no magic number of departments in the arts and humanities.” In the meantime, Chicago’s humanities professors appear largely determined to resist being evaluated in terms of expediency. In a meeting with Nelson a few days after the announcement, 14 out of 15 chairs in the humanities division told the dean that she should pause enrollment in all of their departments or none of them. Targeting some and not others was unacceptable, they argued, because it sent the message that some fields matter and others do not.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The department chairs’ wager seems to be that acting as a unified bloc will make reorganizing the division and cutting programs more difficult, even if the division-wide pause causes short-term pain for the next academic year. As anyone who has served on a faculty anywhere can tell you, this degree of cross-department solidarity and willingness to sacrifice for less-favored colleagues is remarkable, and even moving. Last Wednesday afternoon, the dean announced that the chairs had gotten their wish: With the exception of philosophy and music composition (owing to previous pauses in those programs), doctoral admissions will be frozen across the humanities for the 2026–27 academic year.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It’s a bittersweet victory, of course, one that will result in fewer doctoral students in the short term and is not guaranteed to strengthen the division in the long term. And it does not settle the most pressing question raised by all this turmoil. If even Chicago is not willing to support and protect American arts and letters, who will? One Chicago administrator, in an attempt to defend the university’s admissions pauses, pointed out that other prestigious peer institutions were expected to make similar announcements about their Ph.D. admissions in the coming weeks, and noted that Harvard is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/8/24/arts-humanities-budget-cuts/#:~:text=Harvard's%20Arts%20and%20Humanities%20division%20instructed%20department%20heads%20to%20collectively,Sciences%20implement%20cost%2Dcutting%20plans.">cutting</a> nearly $2 million from its own humanities division. I would like to think that my (and others’) alarm about the future of the humanities is overblown. But the evidence doesn’t give me much hope.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><em>The subheading of this article originally incorrectly stated that philosophy was one of the University of Chicago doctoral programs whose graduate admissions were paused.</em> </small></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><em>This article originally stated that the University of Chicago’s investments in cryptocurrency are part of its financial troubles.

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/09/caisi-evaluation-deepseek-ai-models-finds-shortcomings-and-risks">NIST’s September 30 report on DeepSeek</a> isn’t about security. It’s about control. This post explains what the man behind the curtain doesn’t want you to notice.</p>
<h2 id="heading-nists-deepseek-evaluation-is-a-hit-piece">NIST's DeepSeek "Evaluation" is a Hit Piece</h2>
<p>NIST’s recent report on DeepSeek is not a neutral technical evaluation. It is a political hit piece disguised as science. There is no evidence of backdoors, spyware, or data exfiltration. What is really happening is the U.S. government using fear and misinformation to sabotage open science, open research, and open source. They are attacking gifts to humanity with politics and lies to protect corporate power and preserve control. DeepSeek’s work is a genuine contribution to human knowledge, and it is being discredited for reasons that have nothing to do with security. Before diving in, let’s unpack what DeepSeek actually did and what NIST is really claiming.</p>
<h3 id="heading-whats-actually-going-on">What’s Actually Going On</h3>
<p>On September 30, 2025, NIST released its so-called technical evaluation of DeepSeek’s AI models. The report triggered panic online: claims that DeepSeek’s weights are compromised, that China is spying through the models, or that downloading them is a security risk.</p>
<p>All of that is false.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: The NIST report provides <strong>zero</strong> <strong>evidence</strong> that DeepSeek's model weights contain backdoors, surveillance mechanisms, or any malicious code whatsoever.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-deepseek-actually-did">What DeepSeek Actually Did</h2>
<p>DeepSeek built competitive AI models. Not perfect, but impressive given their budget. They spent far less than OpenAI or Anthropic and still achieved near-frontier performance.</p>
<p>Then they open-sourced everything under Apache 2.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The model weights</p>
</li>
<li><p>The architecture</p>
</li>
<li><p>The training methodology</p>
</li>
<li><p>The research papers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They made it possible for anyone to reproduce their work and run a frontier-scale model locally. And to recreate it all from scratch. That is one of the biggest contributions to open AI research in years.</p>
<p>The U.S. government’s response? A report labeling them "adversary AI" and implying espionage.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-core-deception">The Core Deception</h2>
<p>Here’s the trick NIST pulled.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> You use DeepSeek’s App and/or API. Your prompts go to servers in China. That is a real data sovereignty issue, the same as it would be for any model served in a foreign country or an untrusted service provider.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> You download the open weights and run them locally. No data leaves your machine.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario C:</strong> You run DeepSeek’s model hosted on a trusted third-party service provider such as OpenRouter, Fireworks, or Chutes. In that case, the infrastructure and privacy controls depend on the hosting provider, not on DeepSeek.</p>
<p>These are completely different situations, but NIST intentionally blurred them together. The report counts local downloads while warning about "national security risks." That is misleading, and anyone with basic technical knowledge knows it.</p>
<p>This conflation sets the stage for the rest of the report’s misleading framing.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-nist-actually-found">What NIST Actually Found</h2>
<p>Strip away the inflammatory language and here's what they demonstrated:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>DeepSeek models are easier to jailbreak than heavily safety-tuned U.S. models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They echo Chinese government perspectives sometimes</p>
</li>
<li><p>They perform slightly worse on certain benchmarks</p>
</li>
<li><p>They allegedly cost more per token (no methodology provided)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>No evidence of malicious behavior. No proof of data exfiltration. Nothing that shows these models do anything nefarious beyond "respond to prompts in ways we don't like."</p>
<p>The jailbreaking finding? That's because DeepSeek spent less on safety training. It's a resource issue. NIST conveniently didn't test historical U.S. models for comparison. And meanwhile OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b is hilariously easy to jailbreak.</p>
<p>The "CCP narratives" finding? A model trained on Chinese data reflects Chinese perspectives (and they are subject to Chinese censorship laws). This is not surprising - and it is not a security vulnerability.</p>
<p>And once you see what they left out, the agenda becomes even clearer.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-missing-comparisons">The Missing Comparisons</h2>
<p>Here's what NIST didn't do:</p>
<p><strong>They didn't compare to other open models.</strong> Where's Llama? Mistral? Falcon? If they had, they'd reveal this isn't a DeepSeek problem—it's that open models generally have fewer safety layers than proprietary ones.</p>
<p><strong>They didn't compare to early U.S. models.</strong> How vulnerable was GPT-3 to jailbreaking in 2020? We'll never know, because that would undermine the narrative.</p>
<p><strong>They didn't test U.S. models for U.S. bias.</strong> Only Chinese bias counts as a security risk, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>They used secret benchmarks.</strong> "Private benchmarks built by CAISI" that can't be reproduced or verified. This isn't science. This is advocacy research.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-this-report-actually-tells-us">What This Report Actually Tells Us</h2>
<p>Reading between the lines:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>DeepSeek models are less polished.</strong> They spent less on development. Of course they have rougher edges.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chinese models are competitive enough to worry about.</strong> If they weren't a threat to market share, this report wouldn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The U.S. is terrified of losing AI dominance.</strong> This was explicitly commissioned under Trump's "AI Action Plan." The Commerce Secretary's statement makes it clear—this is industrial policy, not neutral evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="heading-the-real-threat-hint-its-not-to-you">The Real Threat (Hint: It's Not to You)</h2>
<p>You know what DeepSeek actually threatened? The oligopoly.</p>
<p>DeepSeek’s real offense was showing that open source works. That you can build strong models without billions in venture capital or private APIs.</p>
<p>That terrifies the companies selling AI access at premium prices. When DeepSeek said "Here are the weights, run it yourself," they attacked the economic moat those companies depend on.</p>
<p>That is why the NIST report exists. Because DeepSeek proved openness can compete with closed systems, and the establishment needs to shut that down.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-hypocrisy">The Hypocrisy</h2>
<p>NIST warns that DeepSeek models might respond to malicious prompts in simulated environments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. models actually send real data to external servers. Remember when OpenAI used ChatGPT conversations for training? When they had to add opt-outs after backlash?</p>
<p>Running DeepSeek weights locally = zero data transmission.</p>
<p>Using OpenAI's API = constant data transmission to their servers.</p>
<p>Which is the privacy risk again?</p>
<p>The report warns about "adoption of foreign AI" while ignoring that every cloud API, U.S. or otherwise, requires trusting someone else's infrastructure. Local open weights are MORE auditable and MORE secure than any cloud service, period.</p>
<p>But that's not the message. Because this was never about security. It is about narrative control.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-betrayal-of-open-source-and-open-science">The Betrayal of Open Source and Open Science</h2>
<p>The open source community built the foundation that modern AI rests on. Linux. Python. PyTorch. Transformers. Decades of collaborative development, freely shared.</p>
<p>DeepSeek participated in that tradition. They took open knowledge, built something impressive, and gave it back.</p>
<p>American institutions responded by calling them a threat.</p>
<p>Imagine if China had done this to Meta when they released Llama. If they'd published a government report claiming Llama weights were surveillance tools because they're "vulnerable to jailbreaking."</p>
<p>We'd call it protectionism. Technological paranoia. An attack on open research.</p>
<p>But when we do it? "National security."</p>
<p>Open research should be universal. You cannot champion open science only when it is convenient.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-test-you-can-run-yourself">The Test You Can Run Yourself</h2>
<p>Don't trust me. Don't trust NIST.</p>
<p>Download DeepSeek's weights. Run them locally using huggingface transformers, vLLM, LM Studio, or llama.cpp. Open your network monitoring tools.</p>
<p>Watch as exactly zero packets are sent anywhere.</p>
<p>Watch as your prompts process entirely on your machine.</p>
<p>Watch as the terrible "security threat" sits there doing matrix multiplication with no connection to anything.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself: why is the US government lying about this?</p>
<p>The "security threat" is not in the model. It is in the politics.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-you-should-actually-be-concerned-about">What You Should Actually Be Concerned About</h2>
<p>There ARE legitimate concerns:</p>
<p><strong>Using DeepSeek's API</strong>: If you send sensitive data to DeepSeek's hosted service, that data goes through Chinese infrastructure. This is a real data sovereignty issue, the same as using any foreign cloud provider.</p>
<p><strong>Jailbreak susceptibility</strong>: If you're building production applications, you need to test ANY model for vulnerabilities and implement application-level safeguards. Don't rely solely on model guardrails. Also - use an inference time guard model (such as LlamaGuard or Qwen3Guard) to classify and filter both prompts and responses.</p>
<p><strong>Bias and censorship</strong>: All models reflect their training data. Be aware of this regardless of which model you use.</p>
<p>These are engineering challenges, not reasons to avoid open source (or Chinese) models entirely.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-this-means-for-ais-future">What This Means for AI's Future</h2>
<p>This is not just about DeepSeek. It is about whether AI stays open and auditable or gets fenced in by governments and corporations.</p>
<p>Will we let "open source" be redefined as "open, but only if it is American"?<br>Will we demand real evidence for security claims, or accept vague insinuations?<br>Will AI remain a shared human project, or become a geopolitical weapon?</p>
<p>DeepSeek proved there is another path. That is why it had to be discredited.</p>
<h2 id="heading-my-hot-take">My Hot Take</h2>
<p>I run open source models locally. I train my own models. I believe in composable alignment and user freedom. I think AI should be a tool that serves users, not corporations or governments.</p>
<p>The NIST report is not a neutral technical evaluation. It's a policy document designed to discourage adoption of Chinese AI models to protect American commercial and strategic interests.</p>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with the U.S. government promoting American industry. But call it what it is. Don't dress up protectionism as security research. Don't fabricate threats. Don't lie to the public about what the evidence shows.</p>
<p>DeepSeek gave us a precious, invaluable gift. The weights are just safetensor data. They sit on your drive and do what you tell them to do. They don't phone home. They don't spy. They don't exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>If you're worried about them, you don't understand how local inference works.</p>
<p>If you believe the fear-mongering, you've been successfully manipulated.</p>
<p>None of this is about safety. It’s about power - who gets to build, share, and understand the tools that shape the future.</p>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The code and the research is open source and auditable. Everything else is politics.</p>
<p>Read the NIST report and the code, for yourself. Look for any actual evidence of malicious code or surveillance capabilities. You won't find any, because there isn't any.</p>
<p>Then maybe start asking why you're supposed to be afraid of open source when it works a little too well.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: I make uncensored models like Dolphin. I believe in open source, user freedom, and composable alignment. If you disagree with these principles, you're probably on the wrong blog. For everyone else - enjoy responsibly. You are responsible for what you do with these tools, just like you're responsible for what you do with a knife, a lighter, or a car.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge were finishing their time at the University of Waterloo in Ontario in 1979. In pursuit of their masters degrees, they’d worked on a system called Thoth in their real-time operating systems course. Thoth was interesting not only for having been real-time and having featured synchronous message passing, but also for originally having been written in the B programming langue. It was then rewritten in the UW-native Eh language (fitting for a Canadian university), and then finally rewritten in Zed. It is this last, Zed-written, version of Thoth to which Bell and Dodge would have been exposed. Having always been written in a high-level language, the system was portable, and programs were the same regardless of the underlying hardware. Both by convention and by design, Thoth strongly encouraged programs to be structured as networks of communicating processes. As the final project for the RTOS course, students were expected to implement a real-time system of their own.

This earliest creation was never released outside of Quantum Software as far as I know. QUNIX was a vaguely UNIX-like, microkernel, real-time operating system. I say that it was vaguely UNIX-like because in these early versions, there were some serious differences. In QUNIX, there were </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/control-program-for-microcomputers" rel="">CP/M</a><span>-like things too. Each disk had a drive number prefix, non-disk device files’ names were reserved, and the commands were a bit different from those in UNIX, often simplified to the point of being more CP/M-like than UNIX-like. Another major difference was the directory hierarchy. On a traditional UNIX system, binaries were stored in </span><code>/bin</code><span> or </span><code>/usr/bin</code><span>, configurations in </span><code>/etc</code><span>, and user directories in </span><code>/home</code><span>. On QUNIX, this wasn’t the case. Commands included in the path variable were in </span><code>/cmds</code><span>, configuration files were in </span><code>/config</code><span>, the OS binaries were in </span><code>/sys</code><span>, user directories were </span><code>/user</code><span>, drivers were in </span><code>/drivers</code><span>, and utilities were in </span><code>/util</code><span>. Then, the </span><code>man</code><span> command did not exist, and </span><code>help</code><span> was used instead. Instead of </span><code>ps</code><span>, the system had </span><code>task</code><span> with the labels of </span><em>father, son, </em><span>and </span><em>brother</em><span> to denote parent and child processes. The first version of QUNIX for the IBM PC was made before the end of 1981, and released either in December of 1981 or January of 1982, making QUNIX the first known microkernel operating system for the PC platform.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg" width="728" height="901.264" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>QUNIX product brochure image</figcaption></figure></div><p>A fun note from Paul N.

The name QUNIX was a bit too close to the name UNIX for AT&amp;T. The name of the system was changed to QNX in late 1982 following a Cease and Desist by AT&amp;T. The first official QNX version was released the following year. At the time of the name change the kernel consisted of around 10K line of C, and it handled task scheduling, message passing, and task priority. Everything else was implemented in services that used the microkernel’s message passing to communicate with each other (even drivers, filesystems, and networking). As an important feature, message queues were network transparent so a task on one physical machine could communicate with a task on a separate physical machine on the same network as easily as if it were local. This inherently multitasked and multiuser system allowed 250 simultaneous tasks from 4 to 16 simultaneous users. The system would make extensive use of the 8087 if it was available, and required a minimum of 96K RAM. Loading up the C compiler would require an additional 32K. It’s impressive what the small company achieved on the 8088, even if, for the time, the RAM requirements were quite high. QNX release version 1.0, in March of 1983, running on an IBM PC achieved 29% to 47% the speed of a </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/work-at-the-mill" rel="">DEC VAX 11/780</a><span> depending upon the task at hand when tested by Rao Mikkilineni at Bell Labs. Sadly, I’ve been unable to find his original write-up of his testing, which was apparently in the publication </span><em>Personna</em><span>. If you have information about it, I’d love to get some details. While RV1 was limited to just C and x86 assembly language, the company was hard at work on </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/history-of-basic-part-1" rel="">BASIC</a><span>, FORTRAN, and Pascal compilers that would utilize common code generators allowing for the mixed-use of languages without losing optimization. With the introduction of GUIs on the Apple Lisa, Xerox systems, and VisiCorp’s Visi-On, Quantum also had plans for windowing as well. According to Quantum’s president Syd Geraghty in InfoWorld on the 21st of March in 1983, the majority of customers were high-end system developers at large corporations. Version 1.0 cost $650 in 1983 (around $2100 in 2025), and that included a C compiler, full-screen editor, the ability to read MS-DOS disks, and full networking support. I haven’t found much information about versions 1.1 through 1.14, but I did find some information about 1.20 released on the 15th of November in 1984. This version brought pattern matching on filenames in the current directory, expanded shell programming, </span><code>login</code><span> was now a separate task with fast user switching and login stacking, </span><code>TCAP</code><span> (think terminfo), </span><code>ed</code><span> was rewritten and supported full-screen visual mode (think Vi), and support for the IBM AT (real-mode) was added. The price of QNX had also fallen to $450.</span></p><p><span>In June of 1981, the Ontario Ministry of Education identified computing as being important for the future, and they wanted to bring computing into their schools. They were also quite aware that some teachers had taken the initiative to bring microcomputers into their classrooms already, and the </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-commodore-part-1" rel="">Commodore PET</a><span> was the most common for programming courses, while the Apple II was the most common for other educational programs. Targeting many computers would have meant that they’d have rather high software development costs in any attempt to achieve standardization, and it was therefore decided that they’d need a single computer. In 1983, it was found by the ministry and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance that no existing computer would fully satisfy the goals of their educational computer. By March that year, some requirements had been drafted: all-in-one PET-like design, headphone output for voice and sound, a trackball, an 80186 CPU, a multitasking operating system, color graphics, voice synthesis, keyboard with accented characters, and networked storage (no physical disk in the computer itself). This machine as described had the sobriquet “</span><em>bionic beaver</em><span>.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg" width="728" height="894.0789022298457" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:583,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;ICON&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;ICON&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="ICON" title="ICON" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La5s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2229bee7-c83d-4b34-b036-8c3082afdfe8_583x716.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Burroughs ICON, image from jasoneckert.github.io</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>With the specifications in hand, Robert Arn at CATA created CEMCORP (Canadian Educational Microprocessor Corporation) and won a contract from the ministry for $10 million to develop the initial machines.

It lacked any local storage having neither a hard disk drive nor </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-floppy-disk" rel="">floppy disk</a><span> drive. At boot, the computer grabbed QNX from a local LexICON file server over a 2.5Mbps ARCNET connection, and loaded the OS into RAM. Once loaded, the user logged into the system and his/her home directory was on the file server. Up to 32 of these machines could be on a single LAN. Saving any work to a floppy, meant putting the floppy into the file server, and then copying the file from the LexICON hard disk (early models were 10MB, later models were 64MB) to that floppy. The cost of these machines was high at $2500, but any school need only have paid $495 with the government covering the rest. One incredibly forward thinking feature was the lessonware. This would have been a hypertext system in which educators could have written pages that linked to others building an extensive corpus overtime. Even applications could have been run by simply clicking a link. This model was rejected by the ministry before the ICON shipped, and was replaced by a top-down system with ministry making lesson decisions. This also resulted in the ICON having shipped a QNX CLI with the CEMCORP text editor in the earliest models.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Burroughs ICON computer – VintageComputer.ca&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="The Burroughs ICON computer – VintageComputer.ca" title="The Burroughs ICON computer – VintageComputer.ca" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Burrougs ICON internals, image from vintagecomputer.ca</figcaption></figure></div><p>The ICON was a project hated by many and loved by many. For detractors, it was seen as expensive and wasteful while not exposing students to industry currents. For supporters, it accomplished all of its goals. It was excellent for programming, and it was excellent at multitasking, networking, and running educational software. The software was also quite reliable. It was QNX doing what QNX does best.</p><p>From students who used ICONs, we know that it did have educational games, text editors, compilers, word processors, spread sheets, circuit design and simulation software, and CAD software. Of course, being networked machines, some unconventional students figured out ways to hack into other machines over the network, print stuff to other students’ screens, and generally cause some chaos. Combined with audio capabilities (later models even included MIDI support), this apparently got a bit out of hand from time to time.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

The comparisons to UNIX were now joined by comparisons to OS/2, and QNX wanted to be certain that people understood QNX to be superior.

Following this, the company would expand the building three times, and finally add another building. So, the company moved from 215 Stafford Road to 175 Terrance Mathews Crescent.</p><p><span>As late as 1990, QNX advertisements still mentioned performance on the 80286.

dramatic overhaul of the operating system. This new version would be fully POSIX-compliant and increase performance over the prior generation of QNX operating systems. This version, 4.0, was released in 1991. The kernel now had just 14 calls associated with IPC, network, scheduling, and interrupts, and the kernel weighed in at just 7K (605 LOC), allowing the entire kernel to fit in CPU caches of the time. Unlike earlier versions, messages were no longer queued. Instead, they were copied from process to process. Being POSIX-compliant allowed for the easier porting of software, and it also meant that the directory hierarchy was decidedly more familiar to UNIX veterans. Beyond source compatibility, Quantum was actively working on becoming binary compatible with UNIX as of 1992. In 1994, beyond POSIX and performance, QNX 4.1 introduced the QNX Photon microGUI. This system was developed by Patrick Hayden and Robin Burgener. Much like the underlying system, it was built around a microkernel (around 20K), and it was network transparent. A Photon application could have its interface </span><em>beamed</em><span> to another QNX 4 machine at any point in time, or it could be dragged from one device to another just as easily. Photon likewise allowed remote monitoring or control of the user interface. This worked regardless of the device class (desktop, laptop, handheld, server). For those who needed it, the X Windows System (X11R5, Motif Window Manager) was also available, though Photon did implement a binary interface library that was X compatible. Being so lightweight allowed the company to release a demo disk that combined networking, a web browser, web server, graphical environment, file manager, text editor, a vector animation demo, and Towers of Hanoi game onto a single 1.44MB floppy. Unlike prior QNX versions, version 4 required at least an Intel 80386 and VGA graphics card. No 16bit systems were supported.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png" width="1456" height="2037" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2037,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4371961,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><em><strong>KANATA, ONTARIO, September, 1994</strong><span>—QNX Software Systems Ltd., developers of the QNX realtime operating system, announced a unique window system targeted for handheld and embedded applications.</span><p><span>According to Rob Oakley, Corporate Communications and Product Management, "the Photon Window System is the first of its kind—a GUI built around a graphical microkernel."</span></p><p><span>QNX Software Systems designed the Photon Window System as a graphical microkernel and a team of cooperating processes, basing this design on the company's QNX OS, a microkernel network-distributed system.</span></p><p><span>Photon's cooperating processes provide the functionality to scale the system up into a full-featured windowing system or down to fit into resource-constrained environments, like handheld personal computers (HPCs) and compact embedded systems.</span></p><p><span>Photon provides a rich widget library that operates much like the X Window System widget set, with an X-inspired API. A Motif-like window manager and a code-generating, visual application builder are also available.</span></p><p><span>"Photon is extremely light and fast. It runs in only 256K, yet provides enormous GUI functionality," Oakley said.</span></p><p><span>Like the QNX OS itself, Photon is network transparent—an HPC running Photon and QNX, equipped with a wireless LAN interface, becomes a transparent extension of the LAN, able to use all the LAN's resources as if they were integrated directly into the HPC. The power this brings to the HPC user is difficult to appreciate—imagine having the power of 100 Pentiums in the palm of your hand!</span></p><p><span>According to Dan Dodge, Vice President R&amp;D, "Photon applications are very network distributed. From the application's perspective, all the resources of all the nodes on the LAN look like a single, logical machine. The environment is so transparent that a user can drag applications from one physical screen to another."</span></p><p><span>For example, a user in a factory control environment could walk up to a computer and drag an application from the control screen onto an HPC, and then walk out onto the factory floor with it and interact with the live application.</span></p><p><span>Although Photon is aimed at compact environments, its dynamic range is extensive. "Photon's API and rich widget library can support high-performance GUI applications with enough functionality to enter the domain of X, while consuming only a fraction of the resources," said Dodge.</span></p><p><span>The QNX operating system is a POSIX-certified realtime OS for Intel and AMD processors. Scalable and modular, QNX fits a wide range of environments, from compact embedded controllers to resource-rich X-based development systems, to distributed realtime systems running hundreds of CPUs.</span></p></em></p></blockquote><p>Versions 4.2, 4.22, and 4.24 all released in 1995. The final version 4 release was 4.25 in 1997. At least one QNX 4 installation ran for over 20 years without a reboot at the ESA. This was possible because peripherals could be hotswapped, drivers could be changed, and network nodes could be added or removed without bringing the system down.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

And with a new name and a new version of their operating system, the company won some major installs. From POS systems at FasFax that allowed for real-time sales figures from geographically disparate locations, to video conferencing systems at Georgia State University, to factories, power plants, hospitals, set-top boxes, phone systems, trains, jets, the Space Shuttle, ISPs, and even traffic lights. The price for a single license dropped to around $285 at this time, and by 1995, QNX was the leading real-time OS for x86 systems. The majority of the company’s revenue was from large enterprises.</p><p>Of course, change was coming in the 1990s, and QSSL knew it. The company took the QNX kernel from version 4.24 and forked it. They had multiple goals with this fork. The system needed to be SMP capable, support POSIX, and be more portable to new hardware. The kernel handled only IPC, message passing, interrupts, and timing. Threading became the minimal unit of scheduling. The new Process Manager then used a loader thread that copied a process’s image into memory freeing the Manager to service other requests while a program continued to load. Naturally, being a real-time system, priority levels were used when scheduling any time-critical process, and new processes inherited the priority of their parent by default. The Process Manager weighed in at 32K (same size as the kernel itself) but added memory allocation, process contexts, resource-manager namespaces, and so on. In this new QNX version, the Process Manager ran inside the microkernel’s address space, but was the only element of the OS to do so. Much of the network stack for this version came from NetBSD, and with that came the ability to use NetBSD network drivers. There was another major change that came from the wider UNIX world, GCC. This naturally meant that language support was quite broadened to include not just C, C++ but all of the other languages supported by the GNU Compiler Collection. This became QNX Neutrino 1.0 released in 1996.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png" width="1456" height="2039" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2039,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3953875,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>On the 19th of October in 1998, QSSL announced QNX Neutrino 2.0 which featured UPM (Universal Process Model). In the words of CTO Dan Dodge:</p><blockquote><p><em>The premise of UPM is simple. Go beyond the limited MMU protection provided by the other major embedded OSs - where only applications are prevented from corrupting memory - and extend that protection down to services at the kernel level. The result? For the first time, MIPS and PowerPC-based embedded systems can intelligently recover from software faults in drivers, protocol stacks, and custom OS extensions - typically without rebooting.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>QNX was branching into non x86 platforms, and this included PowerPC processors: 401, 403GC, 603e, 821, 823, 860; </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-silicon-graphics" rel="">MIPS</a><span> processors R4000 and R5000; and naturally all x86 CPUs from the 80386 onward.

The announcement was made at Computer '98 in Cologne.</span></em></p><p><em>"The Amiga shook the industry in the 80s with world-leading multimedia architecture," said Jeff Schindler, general manager of Amiga Inc. "QNX's RTOS resembles many of Amiga's unique qualities. It provides the foundation in reaching our vision for the rebirth of Amiga in the new millenium."</em></p><p><em>"We see this partnership as a powerful combination of superior OS technologies, common corporate cultures, and shared business vision," said Dan Dodge, Chief Technology Officer and Cofounder of QNX Software Systems Ltd.</em></p><p><em><strong>About Amiga</strong></em></p><p><em>Amiga Inc. is a technology company targeting the next generation of Amiga architecture with a continued focus on multimedia and the Internet. Since the introduction of the Amiga A1000 in 1985, Amiga has represented the embodiment of the efficient use of memory and hard drive capacity, while pioneering industry developments in multimedia, 32-bit multitasking, and autoconfiguration. Amiga led the industry in combining computer graphics, animation, and film sequences with stereo sound known today as multimedia.

The company has established a strong customer base in a variety of industries, including aerospace, telecommunications, medical instrumentation, process control, point-of-sale, consumer electronics, finance, and telephony. With products distributed in over 100 countries, the company is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The Amiga port should have been somewhat straightforward considering that Amiga accelerators had been using PowerPC chips, and those chips were now supported by QNX. Gateway’s Amiga team was working closely with QSSL to build a new Amiga (Amiga NG) around the PowerPC G3 and G4 chips running QNX, and these were apparently prototyped as single, dual, and quad processor machines. During alpha testing, Gateway PowerPC boards apparently had some issues, and the two parties blamed one another. By the middle of 1999, Gateway, QSSL, and to some extent Motorola, had poured a hefty sum into the project, and Gateway began insisting on a solid date for the availability of a QNX Neutrino port. Evidently they weren’t satisfied, and I do not believe communication between the two teams, which had one been quite good, was solid by this point. At noon on the 8th of July in 1999, Dan Dodge announced the </span><em>QNX Developers Network for Amigans</em><span>. This was followed by another announcement at 15:15 the following day:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Eight months ago we were chosen by Amiga as their foundation OS partner. Our development group was thrilled to be part of the rebirth of such an innovative product. To meet the challenge we knew it would take a tremendous effort on our part. We had a team of people in place working on our part of the Amiga NG soon after the alliance was announced. Over the next few months we involved more and more of our engineering resouces towards making QNX an advanced multi-media platform. Our investment so far has been significant. These are costs we have borne ourselves.</em></p><p><em>It is clear today from Jim's letter that we were not chosen for the next generation Amiga. Naturally we're disappointed. So, where do we stand now? It is not our intent to confuse the Amiga community. We are proud of what we have accomplished and want to include Amigans in what we've achieved. I did make a promise to deliver an operating system and I intend on keeping that promise. I don't want to split the community, nor do I wish to engage in a war of words. I don't ask you to "trust" me or to take me at my word. Both QNX and Amiga have promised to deliver technology into your hands in the very near future. I ask only that your assessment of QNX be based on what we do and what we deliver.</em></p><p><em>Thanks for the overwhelming support we have received so far.</em></p></blockquote><p>That letter by Jim Collas read, in part:</p><blockquote><p><em>Dear Amigans,</em></p><p><em>After months of research and in-depth discussions with all of our technology partners we have decided to use Linux as the primary OS kernel for the new Amiga Operating Environment (OE). I know this decision is a shock to many of you given the previous announcements and activities relative to QNX. This was a very complicated and difficult decision to make and I assure you that I didn't make this decision without a significant amount of research and deliberation. We have been researching Linux since February but didn't finalized our decision until several weeks ago. We were planning to communicate it to the Amiga community in the technology brief that will be released in the next few days.</em></p><p><em>I am pressed to communicate the Linux decision before the technology brief because of information released by QNX in the last few days. This information had not been reviewed or approved for release by Amiga. In light of our Linux decision, this information is confusing and misleading so I would like to take the time to clarify the situation. I can't disclose any details of the Amiga/QNX discussions because of legally binding confidentiality agreements but I can talk to you about our decision to use the Linux kernel. I think that you will agree that this is the right decision once you understand the reasons for this decision.</em></p><p><em>Before I continue, I should mention that our technology decision does not reflect negatively on QNX. I believe that QNX is a good company with great technology. I just believe that Linux gives us a better chance of executing our plans successfully. The decision to use QNX as our OS partner on our next generation multimedia convergence computer (MCC) was made late last year. When I took over as president of Amiga in February of this year, I initiated an in-depth review of existing Amiga plans and decisions. As president of Amiga I had to make sure that we were defining a strategy and an execution plan that would allow Amiga and the Amiga community to be successful. We reviewed our strategy, architecture decisions, technology partners, and execution plans. During this review period we also added a number of very talented and experienced people to help us finalize our technology and product decisions. I am confident that we now have a solid and exciting plan that people can have confidence in.</em></p><p><em>Linux has been picking up substantial momentum over the past year as a viable, open OS alternative in the marketplace. This momentum, the growing commitment to Linux applications from a wide variety of software vendors, and the growing availability of Linux device drivers from hardware vendors, makes it a compelling candidate. Additionally, with all of the significant component suppliers putting resources on writing drivers for Linux it was difficult to get them to port to yet another operating system. Using the Linux OS as a foundation for our Amiga OE allows us to leverage a significant amount of available software drivers and utilities. This allows us to quickly support multiple graphics cards and other peripherals.</em></p><p><em>Given the above-mentioned advantages, we decided to do an in-depth technical analysis of Linux to determine if it was a suitable OS kernel for our new Amiga operating environment (OE). As we ported parts of our higher level operating environment and AmigaObject architecture to Linux, we discovered some significant performance advantages in the Linux kernel in areas such as distributed object messaging across a network (up to 10X the performance of Windows NT).</em></p><p><em>Does this mean that the next generation Amiga will not be unique? Absolutely not! Remember that the OS kernel is only one component of the new Amiga OE and the hardware is unique. The revolutionary nature of the Amiga OE is in the way it extends the traditional operating system to provide a host environment for a new class of portable applications - applications that exist in a pervasive networked computing environment. We will be integrating multiple technologies including an efficient windowing environment and a unique user interface. In summary, we decided to use Linux because of the incredible momentum and the fact that it is solid technology and a good foundation for our new Amiga OE. </em></p><p><em><span>Additionally, the Linux community is an impressive force that we should be aligned with. We share many common values and objectives with the Linux community. Using Linux as our OS kernel allows us to build a unique and revolutionary operating environment while leveraging the enormous momentum of Linux. The soon to be released technology brief will further explain our architecture and plans for integrating all of the selected technology. Once you read it, I am confident that you will understand the revolutionary nature of the next generation Amiga. I assure you that Amiga and the Amiga community will be a driving force behind the next computer </span><br><span>revolution.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>As a person using </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-path-to-linux" rel="">Linux</a><span> at the time, I believe this to have been the wrong decision. Despite the momentum that Linux had, it wasn’t (still isn’t) as stable, as reliable, or as efficient as QNX. If network performance were a serious consideration, one of the BSDs would have been the better choice. Linux’s hardware support also wasn’t that great in reality. While it could run on quite a bit of kit, it didn’t always support that hardware well, and it didn’t always support all features. Plus, QNX was doing the work to build drivers for the new Amiga. Of course, none of this really mattered. Gateway chose to divest itself of Amiga entirely. The new Amiga Inc. then turned to AmigaOne Partners for Amiga OS 4. </span></p><p><span>QNX Neutrino 2.1 was released in 1999 with support for Java, the Glide API, a wide array of microcontrollers, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/mips-for-the-masses" rel="">ARM</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/work-at-the-mill" rel="">StrongARM</a><span>, and Hitachi SH-4. Interestingly, this release had beta packages including RealPlayer and X in Photon, and it had experimental packages that included Quake 3 Arena and Doom.</span></p><p><span>On the 14th of September in 1999, QNX made an announcement that would shape the future of QNX. The company was partnering with </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-motorola" rel="">Motorola</a><span> to develop automobile driver information systems that included in-vehicle navigation, internet access, natural language processing, car audio, multimedia, and vehicle information dashboards. While the Motorola unit responsible for mobileGT wouldn’t last and the unit at IBM working on Java wouldn’t last, QNX would survive and thrive in that segment.</span></p><div><figure><a

The new version was focused on multimedia with streaming video and audio as well as hardware accelerated MPEG encode/decode. The new system included a web based package manager greatly easing the installation of available software. Thankfully, all supported architectures could now be used for developing QNX native software too. Version 6.1 was mostly a patch release and followed later the same year. QSSL was a founding member of the Eclipse Foundation, and QNX software development got quite a bit better with the release of the Momentics Tool Suite on the 4th of June in 2002 (along with QNX 6.2). This was largely the Eclipse IDE combined with a series of plugins that were QNX and Photon oriented.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

on the 3rd of June in 2004. This version was visually slightly different, and Voyager was replaced by the Mozilla Suite. The development environment was improved and now offered a clustering framework for the development of networked applications utilizing distributed processing. Among the highlights for this release were SCTP support, IP filter and NAT support, IPv6 support, 2D and 3D graphics layering/compositing, full UTF8 support in Photon, USB2 host support, and support for up to 64GB of RAM on x86 and PPC, up to 1TB on MIPS.</p><p>On the 27th of October in 2004, QNX Software Systems Limited was purchased by Harman International Industries. Harman specifically wanted to focus on QNX Neutrino in the embedded market, and within that market, specifically on automotive applications where Harman had found a market in audio. Under Harman’s ownership, QNX operated as a separate division led by Dan Dodge as CEO. While QNX did continue to serve networking, medical, and industrial markets, the direction was clear. What had begun with the Motorola partnership in automotive would become the primary market.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Version 6.3.2 was released on the 16th of August in 2006, 6.4 on the 30th of October in 2008, and 6.4.1 in May of 2009. Throughout that time period, QNX had introduced support for Adobe Flash and developed the QNX CAR platform winning a trophy from Adobe for their efforts. This platform was built of modular components allowing manufacturers to mix and match based upon the market segment. QNX was chosen by companies like BMW, Mercedes, Dodge, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Audi. When QNX demoed their automotive systems in the 2007-2009 timeframe, they had concept dashboards. These all ran QNX Neutrino on ARM CPUs (often Freescale i.MX6 or TI Sitara [Cortex A8]) with the EtherCAT motion library, and many demo units had UIs created in Qt5 and QML while a few had hardware accelerated OpenGL interfaces. From 2008 to 2010, QNX had been licensed for use in more than 17 million in-vehicle systems representing an increase of around 130% over those two years. By March of 2010, more than 200 vehicles were already shipping with QNX, and the QNX CAR platform had more than 60 participants. Those participants included 17 auto makers and 26 automotive suppliers.</p><p>On the 9th of April in 2010, Research in Motion announced their acquisition of QSS from Harman for $200 million:</p><blockquote><p><em>“RIM is excited about the planned acquisition of QNX Software Systems and we look forward to ongoing collaboration between Harman, QNX and RIM to further integrate and enhance the user experience between smartphones and in-vehicle audio and infotainment systems," said Mike Lazaridis, President and Co-CEO at RIM. "In addition to our interests in expanding the opportunities for QNX in the automotive sector and other markets, we believe the planned acquisition of QNX will also bring other value to RIM in terms of supporting certain unannounced product plans for intelligent peripherals, adding valuable intellectual property to RIM's portfolio and providing long-term synergies for the companies based on the significant and complementary OS expertise that exists within the RIM and QNX teams today."</em></p><p><em>"We welcome the opportunities that a strengthened relationship with RIM will create, as two innovation leaders collaborate to bring new connectivity solutions to the industry," said Dinesh C. Paliwal, Harman's Chairman, President and CEO. "We expect to maintain our close association with QNX and the cutting-edge software solutions it provides to Harman and our customers. We believe our leading customers will fully endorse this move and see it as a major step in advancing seamless connectivity and integration among intelligent devices."</em></p><p><em>"Like Harman, RIM shares our passion for innovation and reliability, so we are absolutely thrilled with this opportunity," said Dan Dodge, CEO, QNX Software Systems. "Moreover, RIM will give us the best of all possible mandates: to continue on our innovation path and to increase investment in our core products, professional services, and go-to-market channels. This is a great time to be a QNX customer, as we focus on collaborating with RIM to create an even more exciting platform for the next generation of connected and embedded devices."</em></p></blockquote><p>Also in 2010, QNX gained the QNX Safety kernel variant. This was a version of Neutrino that was security hardened specifically for mission critical applications. This variant continues to this day with the most recent version (8.0) having been independently certified by TÜV Rheinland to meet several standards including ISO 26262 ASIL D, IEC 61508 SIL3, IEC 62304 Class C, and ISO/SAE 21434. Aside from security hardening, the QNX Safety variant is still fully compatible with Neutrino’s native APIs and POSIX.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Self-hosted QNX Neutrino RTOS&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Self-hosted QNX Neutrino RTOS" title="Self-hosted QNX Neutrino RTOS" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>QNX Neutrino 6.5</figcaption></figure></div><p>In July of 2010, QNX Neutrino 6.5 was released. This version brought performance improvements to the kernel when systems were seeing high memory utilization, the kernel gained zombie reaping, and it gained address space randomization. SMP support was increased, and CPU support was extended to ARMv7 Cortex A-9. The Photon microGUI saw some refinements. As one would expect, version updates were present for everything imported from BSD, Linux, and GNU. This version could make use of the NetBSD’s Pkgsrc tool.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

While many loved the webkit browser, user interface, HDMI output, and multitasking, many loathed the requirement of a BlackBerry to get certain apps working. Additionally, there was a dearth of third party applications. This latter complaint did get ameliorated. While at launch there weren’t too many applications, this grew to over 24,000 by the same time the following year. Around 2,465,000 PlayBooks had been sold by June of 2013.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1464825,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>BlackBerry Z10, images from CNET, by Josh Miller</figcaption></figure></div><p>The BlackBerry Z10 was released on the 31st of January in 2013 running BBX (officially BlackBerry 10 due to a trademark dispute, and at the launch event for BBX, Research in Motion announced that they were changing their name to BlackBerry Limited). The Z10 was built around a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus SoC (dual core 1.5GHz Krait CPU, Adreno 225 GPU) for LTE units, or around the TI OMAP 4470 for non-LTE units. The shell was plastic wrapped around a stainless steel inner frame, and the on/off, voice command, and volume buttons on the right side were of metal. While it didn’t have quite the premium feel of an iPhone, it did feel good in the hand. In its dimensions it was 5.1 inches by 2.6 inches, and just over an 1/3 of an inch thick (or just slightly larger than an iPhone 5). It was a slick piece of kit with a high price for the time at $599. The display, however, was excellent. It was a 4.2 inch LCD with a resolution of 1280 by 768 at 355ppi (the iPhone 5 was 326ppi). The device had a 2MP font camera, and an 8MP rear camera capable of HDR, panorama, and 1080p video at 30fps. Wi-Fi was dual band 802.11n, and the device featured Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC. Of course, connectivity didn’t stop there. This device had physical ports: micro USB2, micro HDMI, and 3.5mm audio.</p><p>BBX made heavy use of gestures with a swipe up from the bottom taking the user to the Home Screen, a swipe to right to hit the App Library, and a swipe to the left going to the BlackBerry Hub. The Hub was a combination of SMS/MMS, email, social media, chat, notifications, and calls in a single unified location. BBX was QNX Neutrino, but it did differ. Multitasking was limited to 8 applications at any one time which I believe to have been done due to the application frameworks. A developer could choose to use C/C++ and the Cascades UI framework, or WebWorks which utilized HTML5 with Zepto.js (JQuery API, but 8.4k compressed), or WebKit, or Adobe AIR (Flash), or Android runtime. With so many different application types, decisions would have had to have been made around resource management, and a best guess at when performance would become unacceptable.</p><p>BlackBerry had been unable to compete against the iPhone and Android, and BBX was their last, best hope. By 2014, BBX was in the number four spot behind Windows Phone. By 2017, it was clear that they weren’t going to survive in the mobile market. Due to the extreme devotion of their fans, they kept BBX on life support until 2022. Being an amazing OS running on good hardware, why did BBX fail? Likely, the most pressing problem was application support. While BBX could run some Android applications, support was limited. The platform likewise failed to grab many developers as the existing install bases for iOS and Android were enormous. What applications were made for BBX were often of quite low effort. Finally, moving to a touch screen angered BlackBerry’s existing fanbase. For those individuals hanging on to the BlackBerry ecosystem, the keyboard was one of the main reasons why. Removing the physical keyboard made many of those fans feel betrayed. When BlackBerry Limited did release another phone with a physical keyboard, it was a bit too late.</p><p>On the 20th of September in 2013, BlackBerry Limited announced a 4500 person staff reduction and $1 billion (CAD) loss. On the 23rd, they announced an acquisition by Fairfax Financial Holdings for $9/share. This deal was canceled in November. Instead, John Chen became CEO and initiated a turn around that focused on QNX’s former markets of healthcare, finance, law, and mission critical systems. This focus allowed the company to pick up Ford Motor Company as a QNX customer on the 11th of December in 2014 (Ford had previously used Microsoft Auto).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg" width="800" height="1514" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1514,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>On the 28th of February in 2014, BlackBerry released QNX 6.6. The supported platforms were now the expected x86 and ARM CPUs with no mention of any others. This was a major change despite being a point release. Photon support was removed in favor of the Screen Graphics Subsystem. Screen operates as a lower-level service, and this has the benefit of supporting off-screen rendering and compositing of various image sources, and as QNX software had been increasingly using Qt, HTML5, or OpenGL rather than the toolkits supplied with Photon, this made logical sense.</p><p>QNX version 7 was released on the 4th of January in 2017 for ARM v7, ARM v8, x86, and AMD64. This release featured a rewritten PCI server with APIs moved out of libc and into libpci, rewritten virtual memory manager, fewer synchronization objects with increased limits, and filesystem encryption was moved into the Encrypted Filesystem package available from QNX Software Centry.</p><p>By June of 2023, QNX was in over 255 million vehicles around the world, and this would explain why the BlackBerry blog featured a rather large section on automobiles:</p><blockquote><p><em>The automotive evolution to SDVs and “connected cars” requires an OS capable of speed, safety, and security — while unlocking the power to innovate.</em></p><p><em>"With more than 300 million vehicles capable of over-the-air software updates expected to be on the road globally by 2032, automakers are clamoring for better tools to help them develop compelling technology features in the software-defined vehicle," says Alex Oyler, director of North America at SBD Automotive, a leading global automotive technology research and consulting firm.</em></p><p><em>“Both automakers and suppliers rely on validated software and well-integrated development tools to help them more efficiently build and maintain differentiating software for their fleets,” Oyler adds. "A secured-by-design operating system such as the next generation QNX OS — that seamlessly integrates with other software components on a high-performance system-on-chip — represents the foundation of a safe, secure, and seamless experience for drivers.”</em></p><p><em>In addition, early reviews of the new QNX SDP 8.0 give automotive industry leaders a glimpse into what’s possible.</em></p><p><em>“The combination of our DRIVE Thor centralized computer and the new QNX OS will serve as a powerful foundation on which OEMs can build next-generation automotive systems that offer the highest levels of safety and security,” says Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of automotive at NVIDIA. “This represents another major milestone in a nearly 20-year collaboration with BlackBerry QNX that has helped both companies move to the forefront of the automotive industry.” </em></p></blockquote><p>QNX 8.0 was officially announced in December of 2023, and the release was made in January of 2024. Version 8.0 was quickly discontinued with 8.0.1 taking its place. Version 8.0.3 was made available on the 21st of March in 2024. This latest release is available for a variety of Aarch64 platforms including the Raspberry Pi, and is also available for AMD64. QNX 8 supports SoCs with up to 64 cores and has near linear performance scaling. The network stack is now based upon FreeBSD 13.2, Wi-Fi 6 support is present with WPA3 and TLS 1.3, Screen can operate fully headless and now supports Vulkan 1.3 and OpenCL 3, and Screen now supports Wayland 1.21. Developers are now encouraged to use LLVM and libc++ 16 though GCC is still available with libstdc++ 12.2. Python 3.11, valgrind, libasan (address sanitizer), libubsan (undefined behavior detection), and libunwind are all available. For the UNIX user land, Toybox has replaced many common GNU utilities.</p><p><span>If the Raspberry Pi port caught your attention, this is available free for non-commercial use via </span><a href="https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/qnx-everywhere" rel="">QNX Everywhere</a><span>. The </span><a href="https://gitlab.com/qnx/quick-start-images/raspberry-pi-qnx-8.0-quick-start-image/-/wikis/Getting-Started" rel="">image</a><span> requires a Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 2GB of RAM and an 8GB or greater MicroSD card.</span></p><p>On the 2nd of January in 2025, it was announced that BlackBerry IoT would now be known as QNX. This decision was made largely by BlackBerry responding to their customers who recognized and desired the QNX brand. QNX CEO John Giamatteo stated:</p><blockquote><p><em>Relaunching the QNX brand is an important step in BlackBerry’s broader strategy to increase our visibility and fortify our leadership within the automotive and embedded industries, with a view to better positioning us for sustained growth and success. The values that QNX stands for have always been a cornerstone for our customers and this brand relaunch honors that strong history while setting the stage for the division to fire on all cylinders and drive smarter, safer, and faster innovation through precision-engineered performance.</em></p></blockquote><p>QNX is a fascinating operating system. It was extremely well designed from the start, and while it has been rewritten, the core ideas that allowed it survive for 45 years persist to this day. While I am sad that Photon was deprecated, the reasoning is sound. Most vendors using QNX either do not require a GUI, or they implement their own. For example, while Boston Dynamics uses QNX in their robots, they don’t really need Photon, and neither do SpaceX’s Falcon rockets. While cars certainly have displays, most vehicle makers desire their screen interfaces to have a unique look and feel. Of course, just stating these use cases of robots, rockets, and cars speaks to the incredible reliability and versatility of QNX. Better operating systems are possible, and QNX proves it.</p><p><em>My dear readers, many of you worked at, ran, or even founded the companies I cover here on ARF, and some of you were present at those companies for the time periods I cover.

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I've sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.<br>
        I hope people will understand, and respect this decision.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of "during winter break"  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you'll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>
