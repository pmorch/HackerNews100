  <p><strong>(2005–2024)</strong></p><p>Established in 2005, initially for a 3-year period, the Future of Humanity Institute was a multidisciplinary research group at Oxford University.&nbsp; It was founded by Prof Nick Bostrom and brought together a select set of researchers from disciplines such as philosophy, computer science, mathematics, and economics to study big-picture questions for human civilization, attempting to shield them from ordinary academic pressures and create an organizational culture conducive to creativity and intellectual progress.</p><p>During its 19-year existence, the team at FHI made a series of research contributions that helped change our conversation about the future and contributed to the creation of several new fields and paradigms.&nbsp; FHI was involved in the germination of a wide range of ideas including existential risk, effective altruism, longtermism, AI alignment, AI governance, global catastrophic risk, grand futures, information hazards, the unilateralist’s curse, and moral uncertainty.&nbsp; It also did significant work on anthropics, human enhancement ethics, systemic risk modeling, forecasting and prediction markets, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and on the attributes and strategic implications of key future technologies.&nbsp; One major contribution was in showing that it was even possible to do rigorous research on big picture questions about humanity’s future.</p><p>Over time FHI faced increasing administrative headwinds within the Faculty of Philosophy (the Institute’s organizational home).&nbsp; Starting in 2020, the Faculty imposed a freeze on fundraising and hiring.&nbsp; In late 2023, the Faculty of Philosophy decided that the contracts of the remaining FHI staff would not be renewed.&nbsp; On 16 April 2024, the Institute was closed down.</p><p>Over the course of its nineteen years, FHI inspired the emergence of a vibrant ecosystem of organizations where the kinds of questions that FHI investigated can be explored.&nbsp; FHI alumni will continue to research these questions both within Oxford and at other places around the world.&nbsp; Topics that once struggled to eke out a precarious existence at the margins of a single philosophy department are now pursued by leading AI labs, government agencies, nonprofits, and specialized academic research centers (with many more in the process of creation).</p>

Many people do not enjoy the privilege of fading into the background and are subject to much more scrutiny, stress, gaslighting, and doubt.)</em></p><p>Let's explore an example of a prototypical skilled pragmatist to make this real.</p><p>It is very clear to Maria that her team is spinning in circles. She watches with mild amusement as managers struggle in vain to push back on reactive feature requests. She's skilled and makes decent progress with the spaghetti codebase the team inherited, but she knows she could be a lot more productive.</p><p><span>At standups, Maria doesn't waste energy calling out things beyond her (and the team's) immediate control. Yes, software engineering is her passion, but she's not about to burn a lot of social capital by rocking the boat—she sees what happens to&nbsp;</span><em>those&nbsp;</em><span>people. She has some co-workers who have extremely strong careerist tendencies. In some cases, they game the performance management system to the Nth degree to the detriment of customer outcomes. She knows moving up takes a bit longer, but she has also had good luck shifting companies every couple of years to get a raise and promotion. It's almost like new hiring managers sense she has been under-utilized.</span></p><p>Maria is a skilled pragmatist. She is not a pushover or an underperformer. She is a human navigating the weird sociotechnical systems we call "Companies."</p><p>Here's the problem, however. Instead of figuring out how to tap into the incredible potential of the Maria's, companies:</p><ul><li><p>Hear the loud voices in the room, with strong opinions about what is broken. You are missing out on a whole source of information about how to fix the problem.</p></li><li><p>Focus on the obvious "poor performers". This is funny because you might have ~5% of employees who are low performers. Yet have 60-80% Marias.</p></li><li><p>Focus on rewarding 10x heroics and the cutthroat careerists</p></li><li><p>Incorrectly see the issue as an "engagement" problem.</p></li><li><p>Blame front-line managers for not engaging Maria when the issues exist elsewhere. Maria becomes a “management problem” vs. a leadership problem.</p></li><li><p>Diminish Maria's contributions because they are less visible and showy.</p></li><li><p>Promote people who actively poke and prod the system OR who are politically savvy enough to navigate the system—which has the byproduct of perpetuating whatever dysfunctions exist. Why change things when the people in power positions are adept at navigating things?</p></li></ul><p>Companies are doing layoffs when they are sitting on a goldmine of talent, motivation, and people who want to be challenged but aren't being challenged!</p><p>If you want a Part 2 here on how to solve this. Here are some closing thoughts for now.</p><p>I was thinking about what drew me to tech in the first place. Fun! How incredible is it to be paid to be a problem/puzzle solver and build/make things with other similarly curious people that can impact humans? That's incredible. Sometimes I have to pinch myself.</p><p>I've realized that one of my big triggers is incoherence, dissonance, and waste. Many companies are filled with talented people who love to solve problems, yet we're only scratching the surface regarding harnessing their potential.</p><p>And we make it SO HARD on ourselves. It is like we sabotage ourselves. I'm not sure why—maybe humans will be human, maybe it is power and money, maybe it is the natural entropy of companies and products—but many of the problems we face at work are very addressable. Yet, for whatever reason, it has to be difficult.</p><p>Or does it?</p><p>And with that…consider the untapped Maria potential in your company.</p><p><span>Update: I’ve written </span><a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-272-the-biggest-opportunity-part" rel="">Part 2</a><span>.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="14pvo7lhbrk6">
		
<p>This week we announced the retirement of our hydraulic Atlas and unveiled what comes next—a fully electric Atlas robot designed for real-world applications. The next generation of the Atlas program builds on decades of research and furthers our commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots solving the toughest challenges in industry today: with Spot, with Stretch, and now with Atlas.</p>



<p>A decade ago, we were one of the only companies putting real R&amp;D effort into <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas">humanoid robots</a>. Now the landscape in the robotics industry is very different. Our customers have seen success with Spot and Stretch and they are eager to tackle the next challenge with Atlas. Given our track record of successful commercialization, we are confident in our plan to not just create an impressive R&amp;D project, but to deliver a valuable solution. </p>



<p>This journey will start with Hyundai—in addition to investing in us, the Hyundai team is building the next generation of automotive manufacturing capabilities, and it will serve as a perfect testing ground for new Atlas applications. In the months and years ahead, we’re excited to show what the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot can really do—in the lab, in the factory, and in our lives.</p>











<h2>The Journey with Atlas</h2>



<p>Having a meaningful impact outside of the lab requires collaboration beyond our walls. Following the commercial deployment of both Spot and Stretch, we know how to deliver real value for customers. Similar to our Stretch rollout, we will be partnering with a small group of innovative customers, beginning with Hyundai, to test and iterate Atlas applications over the next few years. This is the first look at a real product, but it certainly isn’t the last.</p>



<p>The electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of motion than any of our previous generations. For example, our last generation hydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of heavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those existing capabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to meet a diverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.</p>











<p>Moreover, a capable robot is only one of the pieces required for a successful commercial solution. Scaled <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/webinars/how-to-deploy-mobile-robots-for-industrial-inspection/">autonomous mobile robot deployments</a> are part of the broader digital transformation ecosystem, requiring IT infrastructure, employee buy-in, connectivity, workflows, safety standards, and operational processes for the robots and the data they generate and rely on. With over 1,500 deployments, Spot is already teaching hundreds of companies how to work alongside autonomous mobile robots. We believe that humanoids will be most effective if they are deployed with in-depth models of a facility and lots and lots of data about how it operates. You can start creating these types of digital twins with Spot today, using Spot, Stretch, and Boston Dynamics to facilitate this operational sea change for your organization.</p>



<p>And we are not just delivering industry-leading hardware. Some of our most exciting progress over the past couple of years has been in software. In addition to our decades of expertise in simulation and model predictive control, we have equipped our robots with new AI and machine learning tools, like <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/starting-on-the-right-foot-with-reinforcement-learning/">reinforcement learning</a> and computer vision to ensure they can operate and adapt efficiently to complex real-world situations.</p>



<p>We also recently launched our <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/products/orbit/">Orbit™</a> software, which provides a centralized platform to manage your entire robot fleet, site maps, and digital transformation data. Today it’s available for Spot, but Stretch and Atlas will also be integrated into this enterprise solution. With a robust team of ML experts shaping our products, we are prepared to bring impactful AI to market immediately—we’ve already started with Spot, and it will get even better and faster with Atlas.</p>



<h2>The Role of a Humanoid Robot</h2>



<p>This latest iteration of the Atlas robot builds on a long <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/legacy">history of innovation</a> and R&amp;D pushing the limits of whole-body mobility and bimanual manipulation. From PETMAN testing protective clothing to the recently retired HD Atlas performing parkour, we have spent over a decade moving the state of the art forward with humanoid robotics.</p>



<p>Traditionally, we have focused on legged robots because we wanted to build robots that could balance and move dynamically—robots that could navigate unstructured, unknown, or antagonistic terrain with ease. The humanoid form factor is a useful design for robots working in a world designed for people.</p>



<p>However, that form factor doesn’t limit our vision of how a bipedal robot can move, what tools it needs to succeed, and how it can help people accomplish more. We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more dexterous, and more agile. Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are equipping the robot to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a task, rather than being constrained by a human range of motion. Atlas will move in ways that exceed human capabilities. Combining decades of practical experience with first principles thinking, we are confident in our ability to deliver a robot uniquely capable of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks in real applications.</p>



<p>Commercialization takes great engineering, but it also takes patience, imagination, and collaboration. Boston Dynamics has proven that we can deliver the full package with both industry-leading robotics and a complete ecosystem of software, services, and support to make robotics useful in the real world.</p>

<p>The LXQt team announces the release of LXQt 2.0.0, the Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
  <li>LXQt 2.0.0 is based on Qt ≥ 6.6. For supporting styling and LXQt File Dialog with Qt5-based apps, <code>libqtxdg-3.12.0</code>, <code>lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1</code> and <code>libfm-qt-1.4.0</code> can be installed alongside their Qt6-based versions in LXQt 2.0.0.</li>
  <li>PCManFM-Qt’s desktop module, LXQt Runner and LXQt Desktop Notifications are completely ready to be used under Wayland compositors which support the “layer shell protocol”, like LabWC, Wayfire, kwin_wayland, Hyprland, Sway,…</li>
  <li>Wayland will be the main target for LXQt 2.1.0, as Qt6 was for LXQt 2.0.0. The components which are <em>not</em> ready for Wayland yet include ScreenGrab, LXQt Global Shortcuts, LXQt Panel’s task-bar and keyboard indicator (but LXQt Panel can be used under Wayland without those plugins), some input settings, and settings of monitor, power button, and screen locker. However, most Wayland compositors have tools that can be used instead of them, such that an LXQt-Wayland session is already possible for advanced users.</li>
  <li>LXQt Panel has a new default application menu called Fancy Menu, featuring “Favorites”, “All Applications”, and an improved search.</li>
  <li>QTerminal is the only app whose Qt6 port will be released separately – complications were encountered due to the removal of legacy encodings from Qt6. Until then, its Qt5 version 1.4.0 could be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE for Distros:</strong> For having Qt5 styling and Qt5 file dialog with LXQt 2.0.0, the installable packages of Qt5-based <code>lxqt-build-tools</code>, <code>libqtxdg</code>, <code>lxqt-qtplugin</code> and <code>libfm-qt</code> may need to be renamed, such that they can be installed in parallel with their Qt6 versions. Also, the point release of the Qt5-based <code>lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1</code> is needed for a correct Qt5 font setting (see its release note).</p>

<h3 id="libfm-qt--pcmanfm-qt">LibFM-Qt / PCManFM-Qt</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The desktop module is completely ready for Wayland, thanks to <code>layer-shell-qt6</code>. Now, PCManFM-Qt can give you a real desktop not only with desktop-agnostic X11 windows managers, but also with Wayland compositors which implement “layer shell protocol”, like those based on <code>wlroots</code> or KWin. Also, see <a href="https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/wiki#using-desktop-under-wayland">Using Desktop under Wayland</a> in Wiki.</li>
  <li>The MIME types of LXQt Archiver and Arqiver are updated in LibFM-Qt.</li>
  <li>Some menu icons are added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-panel">LXQt Panel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fancy Menu is added as the new default application menu. (The old menu is kept, but it is not the default menu anymore.)</li>
  <li>Wayland support is added for positioning the panel by using layer shell.</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-runner">LXQt Runner</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Full Wayland support is added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-desktop-notifications">LXQt Desktop Notifications</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Full Wayland support is added.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h2>

<p>Please see the release page of each LXQt component for its release note.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“A contract is only as good as the people who sign it,” was a saying often quoted by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my practice and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and smiled as if agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than there were months in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and business world in which the entire community knew one another and knew who to trust.</p>

<p>That world is long gone, with our population quadrupled in terms of business people and multiplied by ten in terms of attorneys practicing. The odds are good you now deal with strangers, know little about them, and simply cannot trust that the influence of the community will direct their actions.</p>

<p>But even in his smaller, kinder, world, I wondered how accurate his quotation was. Why bother with a contract, then, I always thought.&nbsp; Simply rely on people to do “the right thing.”&nbsp; Since that lawyer had written thousands of contracts, his actions belied his words.</p>

<p>When people are angels perhaps contracts will not be needed. That time is not now and any business which does not have its battery of contracts is not long for this world.</p>

<p>But it’s not just the contract that is useful for business-the very process of getting a contract can teach you a great deal about the person who you are thinking about joining in a business venture. Indeed, if done correctly, before you sign on the dotted line, the negotiation itself will tell you what is likely to happen.</p>

<p>As I saw with a doctor who now lives in Tuscany, in part because he and I learned all we needed to know about a man waving a million dollars in his face and begging him to take it.</p>

<p>The doctor turned him down cold and it was “the best deal he never made,” as he told me a year later.</p>

<p>Doctors are notoriously difficult for lawyers to work with…at least according to lawyers…who find that the doctor’s &nbsp;scientific background gives them little patience for the maneuvers and subtleties that mark the usual business negotiation. To many doctors, the answer to a legal or business question should be as straight forward as a simple diagnosis.</p>

<p>And as more and more doctors are forced to become business people, they confront more and more “grey” areas of business and employment law which are imposed upon their consciousness whether they like it or not. That doctor called it being forced to slide into the “…mire of complex chemical bonding of inarticulate and unintelligible legal jargon.” &nbsp;I didn’t argue when he said that because he was a genius and I had learned not to argue with a genius.</p>

<p>He was a research scientist who had invented a device that measured some microscopic part of one’s intestine that somehow was going to make him and his partners rich. At least that’s what he thought and since one of his partners knew a big time venture capitalist (“VC”) with a lot of successes to his name, that might just happen since he would have the capital to bring it to market.</p>

<p>But the problem was we had to negotiate how to get that VC into the company without giving the company away and the VC had a reputation for coming in with lots of money…then suing everyone in sight long enough that, broke and distraught, they threw the asset in his direction and gave up control of the product. One of my law partners called him the “’poison pill” of VCs since once you took him in, it was only a matter of time until your control of your company died. &nbsp;We needed his money and my task was to find a way to have the money but not the turmoil.</p>

<p>“You think he is trying to trap us like he did the others?” asked my doctor client.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. VCs get a bad rap no matter what they do. Inventors like you always blame them for coming in and trying to protect their investment by putting controls into the company. VCs always blame the inventors for thinking that because they can invent something, they can run a business. It’s hard to know what the guy is really all about.”</p>

<p>He was annoyed that I had hinted he was bad at business.&nbsp; He paused, then snapped, “So…test him.”</p>

<p>He had that exasperated look on his face he got whenever he was forced to say something that he considered self evident to us mere mortals. That always annoyed me and since we were old friends I let him see that.</p>

<p>“Right. &nbsp;Good idea. Written or oral?”</p>

<p>“Anything can be tested. That’s the nature of reality.&nbsp; There must be a relatively objective method available.”</p>

<p>Of course he had a point but I was curious to see what he thought would work.&nbsp; “Lie detector test? Perhaps we can torture him to get him to admit his motivations? I’m sure…”</p>

<p>“Not scientific,” broke in the doctor, not smiling. “Polygraphs seldom are reliable and torture is useless to find the truth. The subject merely tells you whatever you want to hear to stop the torture. No, use a scientific test for good faith. After. what, a thousand, five thousand contracts, you must have one. Use it.”</p>

<p>I stared at him and he stared right back. &nbsp;A long moment of silence. “You still don’t get that law is not medical research. There are no sure fire tests…No patented devices for honesty and integrity. Perhaps that could be your next invention…”</p>

<p>He pressed. “I do not believe that you have not developed a series of questions or methods by which to accurately gauge the good faith of a prospective investor and I suspect you are teasing me because you are annoyed with me.”&nbsp; He would talk like that, you see.&nbsp; Then he grinned.&nbsp; “I am told you are brilliant at this. This should give you an excellent opportunity to demonstrate it.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Anyone calling me brilliant can mollify me so I explained, “There are some methods, some pretty good ones. &nbsp;But they are not objective, I suppose. We don’t put it into a test matrix, doctor. Besides, we have little bargaining position you tell me. We need his money. You only have one source now available. What do you do if he fails my test?”</p>

<p>He stood up, all five feet six of him, one finger in the air. “You find out if he is interested in working in good faith as a team or not. If the latter, the money I lose in rejecting him is trivial compared to the trouble I would have in accepting him. There are other sources of money out there…” He paused for effect “…but only one product that can do what this does.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course he was wrong in that, several other competing products came out a few years later….but he was dead right in that there are some pretty good tests that anyone can use to determine if a potential business partner is more interested in seizing power than sharing profits, as can be seen by what happened in this negotiation.</p>

<p>The VC never used a lawyer for the initial negotiations, only when it was time to close the deal and after ten minutes in the room, I could see why. This was during &nbsp;the High Tech boom times when wearing a suit and tie was considered an antique fashion and most of the young brilliants wore “Banana Republican” Khakis and pastel shirts, no tie, loafers. That is what I expected but he appeared in a conservative three piece business suit, horn rimmed glasses and reminded me of Clark Kent on a mission. Soft spoken, almost shy but clearly with an agenda.</p>

<p>And he knew his stuff. He had a scientific background, a sharp mind, and had done his homework. He had signed all the confidentiality agreements I had insisted upon without demur, without change, even agreeing to clauses prohibiting him from entering the particular medical field we were servicing if our deal did not go through. That surprised me. VCs don’t like to be restricted in such a broad fashion. But as I watched him work the doctor, I realized why. He had no intention of not buying the product and was convinced we would sell it to him since he was the only game in town.</p>

<p>The doctor liked him. They were both tech nerds, both loved the elegant simplicity of the device, both were happy it was going to make a huge difference in medicine, and neither was only in it for the money. I might as well have been in another building as they poured over the specs and discussed the European market. I let it go on for an hour then threw my monkey wrench into the love fest with my first question.</p>

<p>“How much will you put in for how much interest, Mr. Oswald (not his real name)?”</p>

<p>They both looked at me as if I had uttered a profanity. &nbsp;I smiled.&nbsp; “Sorry, but that’s what my job is, you know. Money and power. Unpleasant things but necessary to consider.”</p>

<p>Oswald paused a moment, then opened another file. “Our firm has standard criteria for determining how much to invest and when.”</p>

<p>“And those criteria indicate that you will put in a little money now, and only be obligated to invest more if certain milestones are met in a timely manner and if they are not met, you gain control of the company?”</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment, then smiled. “Of course. We do not write blank checks. But we are reasonable in those criteria. I can see your client owns a very valuable product and has done a great deal by taking it this far on the business plan. I am very impressed.” He looked at the doctor to show him he was impressed. The doctor looked back to show him he liked that.</p>

<p>“We are delighted you agree that we are well along in our plan,” I said, fiddling with my own papers, “and, of course, we need to know specific amounts and specific criteria in some detail. We are not interested in losing control because we are a few weeks late in the implementation of the business plan.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. You will find we are reasonable and I am talking about a million dollars upfront money right now…within two days of our execution of the documents…with an additional two million upon prototype being finished within six months and a final three million upon approval by governmental authorities. &nbsp;For twenty percent. That is quite reasonable, I believe. &nbsp;One seat on the board unless criteria are not met. Three seats on the board if criteria is not met after ninety additional days. And you will find our timelines are more conservative than yours. And the doctor remains CEO.”</p>

<p>I nodded but thought, “Until we blow a deadline. Which we will, business being what it is…and you get the control of the company ninety one days after that happens.” But what I said was, “That seems something we can use to start our discussions, certainly.”&nbsp; He nodded, realizing that the Dance of Negotiations had begun and waited for our counter. Instead, I used my first test.</p>

<p>“It is unusual to begin at the enforcement of contracts end of our discussions, I realize, but it is important for us to know if the document we eventually create is practical from our point of view.”&nbsp; He was a bit surprised and raised his eyebrows. I went on. “The best contract in the world is of no use to us if the expense to enforce it is beyond our capacity. And dangerous to us if our adversary has funds to enforce it and we do not.&nbsp; We like efficient and inexpensive methods for enforcement.”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, considering. “You are speaking of arbitration, perhaps? Avoiding formal court and discovery and all that for a private judge?”</p>

<p>“Smart boy, “ I thought, and wondered how he would turn it down. I nodded.</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly. “We once thought that would be an excellent alternative to the law courts. It certainly had its advantages. Without depositions, without the need for long court law and motion matters, we did save tens of thousands.” He looked at the doctor, very sincere. “But we discovered why discovery and those formal court procedures exist. They exist for a reason, you know. That’s how you discover the truth.”</p>

<p>The doctor had immediately understood that he was witnessing the “test” he had asked for and, like any good scientist, did not interfere with the test in progress. He merely looked back, interested but noncommittal. Oswald saw that and turned back to me.</p>

<p>“We like to know what the other side is going to present and not be surprised at the hearing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could agree with you…but that is a moot point. We can always agree in our arbitration agreement to allow depositions or other forms of discovery. Limit them to save expense, but allow critical discovery. So that’s no real problem, is it?”</p>

<p>He tried another approach. “No appeal. And the arbitrator is not even bound to follow the law. Is that not true?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat true. The Courts are lenient in overturning their decisions. Give the arbitrators great latitude.”</p>

<p>“Yes. &nbsp;Such laxity that in our case, despite the appellate court knowing that the arbitrator was wrong on the law, he still upheld the award. We were outraged.”</p>

<p>I bet you were, I thought. “That seems most unfortunate. But I have been in hundreds of arbitrations and that has never happened. Most arbitrators do their best to follow the law and apply it. I know of no exceptions. You must have been very unlucky.”</p>

<p>He said nothing, just watched me do my stuff.</p>

<p>I went on. “It’s simple, really, &nbsp;A small contract case will take two to three years and cost at least a hundred thousand dollars to try and there can be two more years of appeal. That same matter in arbitration would cost half as much and take six months. The odds of a bad arbitrator are really not much worse than the odds of a bad judge or jury, are they?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but we get full appeal rights in court. Almost none in arbitration. We just won’t go along with taking that chance again. That is a deal killer.” He watched me to see what I would do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I paused and did nothing waiting to see if he was firm. He said nothing, I still said nothing and the doctor looked at me to see if this test was enough to kill the deal.</p>

<p>It was not. Oswald had a good point and I knew plenty of very good attorneys and business people who hated arbitration, figuring that arbitrators, largely unafraid of the appellate courts, could be tyrants and dangerous and who wanted unlimited discovery so they would not be surprised by evidence at the arbitration.</p>

<p>But one could always put discovery into the arbitration clause if that was important and most arbitrators, including myself, were pretty good at following the law. Arbitration is not perfect. Neither are the courts. But we could afford arbitration and it was a real question if we could afford a real fight against such a well funded opponent if push came to shove. A contract without power to enforce it…is not worth the paper it is written on. I smiled as I thought that and the VC wondered what was going through my head.</p>

<p>What was going through my head was the real test I was planning to use now. And this test was the important one, the “acid test” and I went to it immediately.&nbsp; “Well, if we cannot use relatively inexpensive methods of enforcement, we can still avoid some of the problem by simply providing that the winning party in any dispute gets attorney fees from the losing party. Simple as that. It stops fights before they begin since both sides only go to court if they are convinced they will win.&nbsp; No insincere fights since if you lose you pay for your opponent’s attorney fees as well.”</p>

<p>And was the great equalizer as well.&nbsp; To win a fight and get a million dollars but spend two million to get it means you lost even if you won. A big budget opponent knows that and can destroy your case by simply forcing you to spend money. But if the winning side can get attorney fees from the other side…well, the cost benefit ratio then allows even the party with less money to take on a giant…if they are convinced they will win.</p>

<p>He tapped his fingers, face blank. I went on. “That’s the law in Germany and in quite a few European nations, you know. That’s one reason they have so little litigation. No nuisance suits. Here, as I am sure you know, in most cases you don’t get awarded attorneys fees if you win unless &nbsp;you put it in the contract. We almost always do that in our contracts.”</p>

<p>He sighed, glanced at the doctor, then answered, eyes on his file. “Well, that has not been our experience at all. Indeed, not. Indeed, attorney’s fees being awarded to the winning party encourages litigation in our experience.”</p>

<p>I leaned back in the chair. “Really? We seem to have a very different history. What would be the rationale for people starting nuisance actions if they knew they would not only pay their attorney but yours as well? One would expect that to be…a disincentive, no?”&nbsp; I wondered what nonsense he would develop.</p>

<p>“One would think so, but people are irrational. They think it will give them more when they win.”</p>

<p>“As it would. And if both sides think they will win, that is a fight that should go forward and the one that is right will be made whole. That seems only right to us.”</p>

<p>Another silence. In reality, we both knew what the real issue was. If he had a lot of money and our client did not, an attorneys fees clause such as we proposed would allow us to fight him if he started a suit just to force us to capitulate because the fees were so high. Any party really intending to work in good faith should have no hesitation in such an obviously useful clause-a clause that truly makes the wronged party whole if there is litigation.</p>

<p>“Anything that makes it easier to go to court hurts business relationships, “ he said to the doctor, “and this clause encourages people to take their chance in court rather than work out their differences.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at me, saw my expression, and turned back to the VC. “Utter nonsense, Mr. Oswald, and I am upset that you think such weak arguments would sway me. Of course we must have an attorney fee shifting clause or I could never approach your litigation budget and you could use your in house staff of attack dogs to force me to accept any position you take.”</p>

<p>“Attack dogs? “ I asked, a little upset.</p>

<p>“Attack dogs?” Oswald said, equally upset.</p>

<p>“Present company excepted, of course,” went on the doctor, not even looking at me. “Mr. Oswald, I am not a nincompoop. I am aware that if you have a hand gun with bullets and I have a hand gun without bullets, that all your expressions of good will and interest in my project mean little for if we have a falling out, you will win. I see this clause as loading my gun…which neither will hopefully ever use. Please do not insult me by pretending otherwise.”</p>

<p>The doctor was outwardly calm but I could see he was inwardly furious. He felt he was being played for a fool, had been set up by the interest in his project shown by Oswald who was simply pulling a con job on him.&nbsp; I was not upset…this is all part of the game and any VC who did not bargain in this manner was not much of a VC. The doctor was new to this and still emotionally involved.</p>

<p>Oswald also saw the dynamics and tried to save the day. “Doctor we have a difference of opinion. This is not an insult, merely what allows fruitful negotiations.”</p>

<p>“Again, &nbsp;nonsense. If you treat me as a man of above average intelligence, you would have honestly stated that you, with more funds, wish to be able to bludgeon me into submission if we have a legal fight, knowing that I will never get back the fees I spend for my own legal counsel and that my only hope is to meet all criteria religiously. That is your actual position, is it not?”</p>

<p>Oswald was getting angry and I was seeing this negotiation collapse and was looking for a way to break into their argument. Oswald leaned forward. “Doctor, you invented a fine device. You know I like it. It is not proof of business acumen or negotiation skill.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly true, “I interjected, and gave the doctor a look telling him to shut up before Oswald walked.</p>

<p>The doctor leaned back in his chair, seeing that I wanted him to calm down, but before I could say something, looked at me and simply asked, “That is your test, correct?”</p>

<p>Silence in the room. Oswald, looking confused, was staring at me.</p>

<p>“Well…yes.”</p>

<p>“Then this is a waste of time since he has failed it. Let us end this now.”</p>

<p>Oswald could not believe it. &nbsp;He held up his file. “I have a million dollars in an account ready to be deposited into your company the moment we agree. Our terms are certainly within the range of your thinking are they not?</p>

<p>The doctor was already packing his briefcase. “Yes, they are. Not where we want them, but close enough.” Then he looked hard at Oswald. “But you are not, Mr. Oswald. In two ways. Counsel had one test to see if you wished power rather than cooperation and you failed that. But I had my own test. Would you equivocate why? I perhaps could work with a man of power interested in power if he was honest with me and we set the rules up clearly. But a man of power who does not tell me his true motivations? That is too much.”</p>

<p>And he left the room.</p>

<p>Oswald shook his head at me, slowly. “Your client is being very foolish, you know. I see it all the time. These scientists…”</p>

<p>Was he? Well, Oswald crushed the next two inventors he worked with…tossing them some money after he had pushed them out the door of their own companies. The doctor…well, he’s in Tuscany, though it took him an extra two years to raise the money. Two years in which his competitors almost beat him out.</p>

<p>And during that time I often asked him if he had second thoughts. He did not. “I may fail, but I will fail because my product or my business thinking is not good enough. I will not fail because my own backer stabs me in the back. I have no regrets.”</p>

<p>Well, he’s in Tuscany. I’m still here.</p>

<p>Doing my acid tests…</p>

      <section>
        <p>Gretchen shared with me an absolutely fascinating post on Reddit today: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fossils/comments/1c4hldl/found_a_mandible_in_the_travertin_floor_at_my/?ref=johnhawks.net" rel="noreferrer">“Found a mandible in the travertin floor at my parents house”</a>. The poster is a dentist and visited his parents house to see the new travertine they installed. It's no surprise that he recognized something right away: </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg" alt="A polished section of travertine rock with an obvious cross-section of a jawbone" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1674" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w2400/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>This travertine would get the notice of any anthropologist. Photo: Reddit user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net"><span>Kidipadeli75</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>A section cut at a slight angle through a very humanlike jaw! I'm working in South Africa currently and I showed the image to some of our fossil preparation specialists today. Everybody agreed it is pretty cool! </p><p>The Reddit user who posted the story (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net">Kidipadeli75</a>) has followed up with some updates over the course of the day. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and a close search of some of the other installed panels revealed some other interesting possible fossils, although none are as strikingly identifiable as the mandible. A number of professionals have reached out to offer assistance and I have no doubt that they will be able to learn a lot about the ancient person whose jaw ended up in this rock. </p><p>This naturally raises a broader question: How many other people have installed travertine with hominin fossils inside? </p><p>Travertine is a limestone that forms near natural springs. Spring water that emerges from lime-rich bedrock often carries a high concentration of dissolved calcium carbonate. When the water evaporates or cools—especially near hot springs—this calcium carbonate precipitates as rock and may form very large deposits around the spring. Travertine has an interesting internal texture when polished, and often has color bands and inclusions of calcite crystals, which make it an appealing choice for decorative flooring or wall covering. </p><p>Travertine also commonly includes fossils. Many are fossil inclusions of algae, plants, and small animals—especially molluscs and crustaceans—that live within the spring water. Much larger animals may be found and humans are no exceptions: Several well-known hominin fossil discoveries are from travertine deposits. Most of these discoveries have happened because of quarrying of the travertine deposits for use in construction. </p><p>For example, the Steinrinne site is on a terrace of the Wipper River near Bilzingsleben, Germany. The site was quarried from the Middle Ages onward into the twentieth century. Naturalists took notice of the fossils there in the nineteenth century, and straight-tusked elephants, woolly rhinos, and macaques all occur in great numbers, dating to an interglacial period sometime between 470,000 and 280,000 years ago. Many of the archaeological discoveries at the site were made by Dietrich Mania starting in 1969. Excavations since then have identified stone tools and many animal bones with cutmarks from ancient humans who butchered them—even stone handaxes made from elephant bone. </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1756" height="1042" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1756w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Bilzingsleben cranial reconstructions by Vlček. Photo from Landesmuseum fur Vorgeschichte Halle (Saale), Germany</span></figcaption></figure><p>Parts of at least two hominin skulls and a mandible were uncovered in the travertine during Mania's excavations. The remains were first studied by Emanuel Vlček, who created reconstructions of the two skulls. They have many similarities with <em>Homo erectus</em>, as Vlček emphasized, including the thick cranial bone, thick and pronounced browridges, and highly angled occipital bone at the back of the skull. Today's scientists, while recognizing these aspects, more often consider the skulls as representatives of an early Neandertal or related population, which sometimes is known as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. </p><p>Another fossil human was discovered in an even more dramatic way. In 2002, Mehmet Cihat Alcicek was examining fossils recovered from travertine quarries of the Denizli Basin of southwestern Turkey when he identified a cross-section of a hominin cranium. The upper and lower surfaces where the fossil was cut are well preserved, suggesting that more of the skull had likely been present but no more was found. Dating of the travertine by Anne-Marie Lebatard and collaborators in 2014 suggests that the individual lived sometime between 1.6 million and 1.2 million years ago. The quarry that produced the fossil is near the village of Kocabaş, and that is the name by which the fossil has been designated. </p><blockquote>“Given the nature of its discovery in a factory workshop, the hominin was unfortunately reduced to a standard rough-cut tile thickness of about 35 mm…” —John Kappelman and coworkers&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The shape of this portion of the Kocabaş skull and its thick supraorbital torus have led most researchers to identify it as a <em>Homo erectus</em> individual. The endocranial surface of the frontal bone has granular impressions that were initially suggested as possible evidence of tuberculosis infection. While this is still possible, later work suggested that these impressions may rather reflect a common condition in which the cranial bone remodels due to arachnoid cell growth.</p><p>The Kocabaş skull points to the most obvious question that Reddit posters shared: Why didn't anybody notice a human jaw in the travertine before it was installed in someone's house? </p><p>This question isn't so hard to answer. Quarries rough-cut travertine and other decorative stone into large panels, doing basic quality checks for gaps and large defects on the rough stone before polishing. Small defects and inclusions are the reason why people want travertine in the first place, so they don't merit special attention. Consumers who buy travertine usually browse samples in a showroom to choose the type of rock, and they don't see the actual panels or tile until installation. Tile or panels that are polished by machine and stacked in a workshop or factory for shipping are handled pretty quickly. </p><p>What this means is that there may be lots more hominin bones in people's floors and showers. </p><p>Most will be hard to recognize. Random cross-sections of hominin bones are tough to make out from other kinds of fossils without a lot of training. Noticing a fossil is not so hard, but I have to say that I've often been surprised at what the rest of a fossil looks like after skilled preparators painstakingly extract it from the surrounding rock. The ways that either nature or a masonry saw may slice a fossil don't correspond to an anatomy book, and a cross-section through part of a bone doesn't usually resemble an X-ray image of a whole bone. </p><p>Believe me, anthropologists don't want to hear about every blob of bone in your tile. Bones from other kinds of animals <strong>massively</strong> outnumber hominin bones in  large travertine deposits. Most tile and panels are cut thin enough that if a fossil not clearly identifiable from its exposed surface, the thin portion beneath the surface is not likely to identify it either. Nobody wants to drill into your shower wall on a wild goose chase. </p><p>But certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible from the Reddit post, and more pieces of the Kocabaş individual are probably installed in hotel bathrooms all across Europe. If you take another look at your shower wall and suspect an ancient human is looking back at you, it might actually be one. </p><p>The broader point is that a lot of the archaeological and fossil record has emerged as a result of industrial processes and construction. Paleontologists are in an uneasy symbiosis with quarries. The work of the rockcutters exposes underground sections that scientists would never know for centuries, yet at the same time it destroys evidence that might be recovered with enough paleontological labor. It helps for workers to have some training to notice potentially interesting finds as they encounter them, and for paleontologists and archaeologists to be engaged with the industries and construction projects that often encounter ancient remains. </p><p>And if you do happen find a jawbone in your bathroom, my suggestion is first to contact the local authorities. Sure, a fossil in travertine likely comes from hundreds of thousands of years ago. It isn't a crime scene. But depending on your state or nation of residence, laws governing discovery of human remains on your property may be complicated and having the paperwork in order with the police, sheriff, or coroner is the first step for most investigations. </p><p>For myself, I'll be following the Reddit story with interest—I expect there will be many twists and turns in the story of this jawbone.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the latest draft text of the controversial <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-11-conseil-csam-compromis-9-avril.pdf">EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation proposal </a>leaked by the French news organization Contexte, <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/179658/imfname_11360113.pdf">which the EU member states discussed</a>, the EU interior ministers want to exempt professional accounts of staff of intelligence agencies, police and military from the envisaged scanning of chats and messages (Article 1 (2a)). The regulation should also not apply to “confidential information” such as professional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea that the new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention of child sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives (Article 43(8)).</p>
<p>“The fact that the EU interior ministers want to exempt police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning proves that they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping algorithms are that they want to unleash on us citizens,” commented Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer. “They seem to fear that even military secrets without any link to child sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The confidentiality of government communications is certainly important, but the same must apply to the protection of business and of course citizens communications, including the spaces that victims of abuse themselves need for secure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of the chats leaked by today’s voluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance to the police, for example family photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous that the EU interior ministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences of the destruction of digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption that they are imposing on us.”</p>
<p>“The promise that professional secrets should not be affected by chat control is a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or determine whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers, defence lawyers, etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control inevitably threatens to leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and trial documents sent for defending abuse victims.”</p>
<p>“It makes a mockery of the official goal of child protection that the EU interior ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing child sexual abuse. It couldn’t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-style mass surveillance and not better protecting our children. Real child protection would require a systematic scientific evaluation and implementation of multidisciplinary prevention programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards and guidelines for criminal investigations into child abuse, including the identification of victims and the necessary technical means. None of this is planned by the EU interior ministers.”</p>
<p>The EU governments want to adopt the chat control bill by the beginning of June.</p>

<p><span><strong>Quick Note: I’m Going to CES and SPIE AR/VR/MR 2024</strong></span></p>



<p><span>Before getting to the article, I wanted my readers to know that I plan to attend CES from January 9th through the 12th. My schedule is just forming up as of this writing, so I currently have many time slots available. Most AR/VR/MR-specific companies exhibiting publicly will be in LVCC Central Hall or the Venetian like last year. While I am primarily there to meet with companies and see products, I always have some time to meet with blog fans.   </span></p>



<p><span>I will also attend the SPIE AR/MR/VR conference from January 29th through the 31st. It is much easier to meet at this conference as everything is in one building for the conference and exhibits. </span></p>



<p><span>If you want to meet up with me at either event, please email me at <strong>meet@kgontech.com</strong> </span></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Humane AI (<strong>Humane</strong>, hereafter) combines the mid-2010s failed concept of using a laser projector to project on the body with the early 2000s failed projector phone (something <a href="https://kguttag.com/2013/08/04/whatever-happened-to-pico-projectors-embedding-in-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote about in 2013</a>), only they left out the phone’s flat panel display and have more feeble processing than a good smartphone. Rational people wonder what this does that a good smartphone can’t do much better, and you can count me as one of these people. </p>

<p>This blog has been written about various laser projector scams since the beginning of 2011. Scammers like to associate “laser” with near-mystic powers that violate all the laws of physics and rational thought. The other favorite word to deceive people is “Hologram” (when they are not). The new favorite buzzword is “AI .” </p>



<p>It looks like Humane started with an abysmally poor-quality laser projector in a phone-like device, and by saying it does “AI,” it is magically something new. Their picture was good enough to raise $230 million from SK Networks (Korea), Microsoft, LG, Volvo, Qualcomm, Open AI founder Sam Alman, and others. Granted, with so many big-name companies, the stakes were chump change for each giant company giant, but it does show foolishness on a grand scale. </p>



<h2>Humane Adds AI to the Laser Projection (Hype Squared)</h2>



<p>At first glance, Human AI looks like it started with a monochrome laser projector, and realizing that that wouldn’t sell venture capital companies (VCs), they wrapped it in the current hype surrounding AI. Humane co-founders Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri (left) have the “Steve Jobs” black shirt costume down like other famous Silicon Valley scammers, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, Sam Bankman-Fried founder of FTX, and Ronnie Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap. I have learned to be suspicious of the Steve Jobs pretender look through the years; it’s not a complete tell, but it should make you suspicious. </p>

<p>This blog has <a href="https://kguttag.com/?s=Laser+Projection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented for over 12 years</a> how <strong>laser scanning is a terrible way to generate a display image</strong>. In short, <strong>the scanning process is too slow and inaccurate to generate a high-resolution image</strong>, and the lasers can’t be controlled fast and accurately enough to give good color depth, not to mention the poor power efficiency. </p>

<h3>The fundamental problems with pico projection include:</h3>



<p>1. <strong>Where will you project from?</strong> Humane’s “big concept” is that they will magnetically pin the projector to your shirt or jacket,  ignoring that it will sag a normal shirt and flop around as one moves. For the Humane’s introduction video, they pinned it on a heavy leather (or leather-like) jacket to give support (what do you do in the summer?).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="518" data-attachment-id="12515" data-permalink="https://kguttag.com/2023/12/06/humane-ai-pico-laser-projection-230m-ai-twist-on-an-old-scam/humane-showing-crack/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Humane-showing-crack.jpg?fit=509%2C518&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="509,518" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Humane-showing-crack" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Humane-showing-crack.jpg?fit=295%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Humane-showing-crack.jpg?fit=509%2C518&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Humane-showing-crack.jpg?resize=509%2C518&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Humane-showing-crack.jpg?w=509&amp;ssl=1 509w, https://i0.wp.com/kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Humane-showing-crack.jpg?resize=295%2C300&amp;ssl=1 295w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>2. <strong>What and where will you project on?</strong> Humane’s “big concept,” taken from laser projector scams of the past (more on this later), is to project on the skin. But the skin is a lousy, non-smooth projection screen with crevices and poor reflective qualities.  Worse yet, it <strong>requires a person to hold their hand up wherever the projector happens to be pointing</strong> as it flops around hanging on your “shirt.” Unlike a phone display, you can hold where you want or sit down. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Ambient light is the biggest killer for pico projectors due to the loss of contrast</strong>. Humane has not specified the projector’s brightness (in lumens), but it has a class 2 laser, so it can’t be that bright when projecting an image compared to the brightness of daylight. Humane demonstration videos are “staged” to put the hand’s projection surface in shadow or a dark environment. The Humane display is guaranteed to be invisible in outdoor daylight, about 100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. Unlike flat panel displays that absorb ambient light, projection displays directly compete with it.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Humane’s projector lacks color and grayscale depth.</strong> Humane’s display a monochrome cyan (blue-green). There is no ability to even highly anything with color. Secondly, they demonstrated very limited grayscale depth; they showed just “on,” “off,” and a half-level. Even if grayscale is theoretically possible with the Humane projector, the ability fo see a grayscale image is severely hampered by using skin as a screen and the lack of contrast due to ambient light.  </p>



<p>5. <strong>Laser projection’s focus-free is a double-edged sword</strong>. While using laser scanning allows the projected image to be “focus-free,” it also means that the smallest objects blocking the projected image cast a harsh shadow blocking part of the image. </p>

<h3>Humane’s Poor Image Quality &amp; 720p Resolution Lie</h3>



<p>Human claims to have a 720p (1280 x 720 pixel) <strong>monochrome</strong> resolution. <strong>All laser projector resolution claims I have seen through the years lie about their resolution</strong>, typically by about 2x horizontally and vertically. But <strong>Humane seems to have topped them by claiming about 4x of the horizontal and vertical resolution they can deliver</strong>. A picture of a 502- x 410-pixel Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on the right. Humane’s image quality is worse than a cheap 1960s B&amp;W TV (see the series of pictures below).  </p>



<p>Humane’s website and other promotional material have a series of <strong>fake still images </strong>(“Photoshopped” images overlayed on hands). While even these pictures are pretty low-resolution (much less than a true 720p image), they turn out to be much better than what is seen in the videos of the Humane projector. I fear that AI will soon make it easy to make fake images and videos that are less obvious, but these fakes from Humane did not use its “AI” technology. </p>

<p>The images below are still frames from the Humane Introduction Video, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the Humane Ai Pin</a>.” In addition to the lower resolution and contrast than the fake stills above. Notice how the crevices in the skin break up the image and don’t just darken it. In the the third from the left still below, the hand has been turned upward, catching more light (but nothing compared to a bright room or sunlight); notice how the image looks even more faded due to the ambient light.</p>

<h3>But, but, but, it is all about voice recognition and speech.</h3>



<p>Voice recognition has been on smartphones for about a decade with Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). People have all experienced the good and bad of voice input and output. Certainly, voice can be a good adjunct input, but it can also be very frustrating and difficult to correct when it does not understand you correctly. AI will likely improve the recognition, but it will not be perfect. In many situations, voice input is insecure, disruptive, and/or impractical (due to, say, noise or wind). What is one supposed to do with the Humane device in such situations? </p>



<p>Humane’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk">introduction video</a> was a fiasco in that it highlighted the combined voice and image recognition problems. The founders looked stilted, trying to time everything and speaking slowly with preplanned questions to the “AI engine,” and sometimes the device gave erroneous answers. When asked about the best place to see the next solar eclipse, it gave a location too far south, and when asked to estimate how much protein is in a small number of almonds, it said that “half a cup has 15 grams.” A spokesperson for Humane has responded that it got the date correct on the eclipse but that the location was a “bug” and that while the “AI” missed the question’s intent on the almonds, the answer was technically correct on the grams per cup. </p>



<p>The AI answered like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Clavin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cliff Clavin</a> (bar know-it-all from the TV series Cheers who constantly gave erroneous information but showed full confidence in what he was saying – <a href="https://youtu.be/k6GTZrcoWEM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example, video clip</a>). Apple uses “Siri” to trigger their audio response; maybe Humane could use “Cliff.” </p>

<p>Just for fun, I asked my iPhone’s Siri, “Where is the best place to watch the next solar eclipse?” and it came back with a series of links to articles (that included color pictures and maps) that I could scroll through on my phone but would never be able to read on Humane’s terrible display or would want read back to me. </p>



<p>In the real world, speech recognition is much more complex than Humane’s simplistic examples. The environment is going to be more complex and often noisy. When speaking, people are not careful to say each word clearly, particularly when they have to whisper to avoid disturbing the people around them too much. As has been widely discussed, AI will often answer questions with wrong information. </p>



<h2>Old Scam with Slightly New Twist</h2>



<p>Back in the days before Streaming, DVDs, and VHS tapes, the Disney company found they could rerelease their animated features every seven years, and a new generation of kids would think they were new. Disney then followed a similar pattern and put their VHS and later DVD releases in the “Disney Vault” between rereleases.</p>



<p>This pattern of letting memories fade away before reintroducing them as “new” also holds in high-tech. In 2016, this blog wrote about eyeHand in <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/">Wrist Projector Scams – Ritot, Cicret, the new eyeHand</a>. These companies showed some comically bad fake images that included “projecting black,” violating all laws of physics. </p>

<p>The scams by the small companies got big companies like Dell and Hilton to buy into the scammer’s marketing hype, and they released several “concept videos” seemingly based on these scams (see below from that <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same article</a>).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Once you get past the contrived demonstrations and crappy displays, Humane’s problem is convincing real people that what they have is better than a smartphone. A modern smartphone has a better onboard processor and, orders of magnitude, a better display, supports audio and video input, and can communicate with the internet for AI or related speech recognition and answers. A phone does not force one to wear clothes that will be able to support it or make me hold my hand out to see a crappy image. </p>



<p>Few will believe a startup company has better speech recognition and information database technology than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other giant companies. If Humane really had better technology, why didn’t they release it as a software application rather than developing this terrible device? </p>



<p>Humane has no advantages and massive disadvantages compared to a smartphone, and it seems most people in technology have come to the same conclusion based on my reading of the responses. There are a few “everyone gets a trophy” and “anything is possible” people who have an open (or empty?) mind to this concept. </p>



<p>How so many business people could get their companies to fork over a combined $230M confounds me. I’m waiting for the AI program that can explain it . . . Not really; it is probably a combination of ego, unwillingness to do good due diligence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), all very human problems. These same “businesspeople” will run most startups through the wringer for a few million in VC money and then hold a cash bonfire with Humane AI and Magic Leap (<a href="https://kguttag.com/2020/05/03/magic-leap-starts-to-auger-in-with-3-7x-the-money-as-theranos-i-tried-to-warn-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another company that originally told investors that a key technology was laser projection</a>). Thankfully, at least this time, they are not stealing money from individuals on Kickstarter or Indigogo like Ritot, Cicret, and eyeHand did, even if the amount is two orders of magnitude higher. </p>

One of the most puzzling symptoms in those early days was something called "brain fog"&nbsp;— cognitive issues like confusion, forgetfulness, and trouble focusing.</p><div dir="ltr"><p>And while other symptoms have changed as the virus mutated, brain fog is still a common complaint of COVID sufferers not only during the initial illness, but&nbsp;extending for months or even&nbsp;years afterwards.&nbsp;Several recent studies have been trying to understand exactly what this virus is doing to our brains — and how to stop it.</p><p>  Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly,&nbsp;the chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System,&nbsp;spoke with <em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em> host Bob McDonald about what he's seeing in his research on COVID and the brain.

A lot of people come back to the clinic with tingling of the extremities, tingling in the legs or sometimes in the arms. In rare cases, seizure disorders.

And we also don't really know whether those cognitive losses that I just described, that three-point IQ loss, we don't really know how permanent that is.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What about brain aging?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's very, very clear that in some individuals they do experience structural abnormalities and some other abnormalities of imaging that are commensurate with what normal people experience with about <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217232120" target="_blank">seven years of brain aging</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Now the hope is that those effects are not are not long lasting and then the brain with neuroplasticity and other other sort of mechanisms will be able to restore itself back to normal health. But I think that really remains to be characterized and seen in studies.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is the virus that&nbsp;comes in through the lungs affecting the brain so much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5" target="_blank">induces inflammation of the brain</a>. One of the clear signals from the studies that we've done and a lot of other people have done over the past several years is that&nbsp;clearly in some people it can provoke inflammatory reactions in the brain or neuroinflammation and that may explain some of the symptoms that are&nbsp;experienced by some individuals.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A hand points to brain scans." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>In one study, researchers found that the protective blood-brain barrier was leaky after a COVID infection, which could drive changes in neural function.<!-- --> <!-- -->(sfam_photo / Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">It can affect multiple substances on which the brain really depends to function normally. One of them is cortisol. So <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y#:~:" target="_blank">people have studied this out of Yale University</a> and have shown that people with long COVID or people after SARS-CoV-2 infection can experience inappropriately low level of cortisol and that's actually an important hormone&nbsp;for a lot of certain normal physiologic processes, including cognitive performance, and a lower cortisol level than where it should be can explain some of the cognitive dysfunction&nbsp;that is seen in some people after SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are some studies also done on <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2811556" target="_blank">showing low serotonin levels</a>&nbsp;and that can also explain some of the symptoms.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>But doesn't the brain have a protective mechanism, the so-called blood brain barrier?&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">By inducing that inflammation of the brain, that actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9" target="_blank">makes that barrier leaky</a>, so it starts leaking things into the brain that shouldn't be there. And things from the brain to outside the brain that also should not exit outside the brain. So a leaky blood brain barrier can also explain, you know, some of the manifestations that we see after COVID-19 infection.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is this changing over time as the virus mutates?&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We're in a different phase of the pandemic now than what we all experienced in March 2020. We have a different virus. We have availability of vaccines now. We have antivirals. So all of these drivers&nbsp;have now sort of reduced overall the burden of long COVID.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Woman rests her hands on handle bars of an exercise bike used to strengthen muscle tone for fatigue after COVID-19." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/long-covid.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/long-covid.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/long-covid.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/long-covid.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/long-covid.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/long-covid.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>A woman rides on an exercise bike to strengthen muscle tone for fatigue related to long COVID at the Department of Rehabilitative Cardiology in Genoa, Italy.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean that SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign, is inconsequential. We still see people in the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we still see people with strokes and heart attacks and, you know, brain fog and all other manifestations. But overall, I think the risk has sort of declined over the course of the pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How unique are these other effects on the body and the brain and the heart to COVID?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The big revelation or the big aha moment in this pandemic was the realization that SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce this really large basket of long-term adverse health effects. When we went back and started thinking about what happened to people after the Spanish flu, we found historical accounts that sort of resemble, to a large degree, what we described now after SARS-CoV-2 infection, people having increased risk of Parkinson's disease, headaches, brain fog etcetera.</p><p dir="ltr">I think one of the major lessons that I learned from this pandemic is that there are long tails to pandemics. And yes, we can focus all we want on the acute phase, or the tip of the iceberg, but the reality is that there is a really much larger chunk of disability and disease beneath that tip of the iceberg.</p><hr><p><em>Q&amp;A edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><div><h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_300/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_460/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 258pxpx) 258pxpx" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg" data-cy="author-image-img"></p></figure></div><p>Amanda Buckiewicz is an award-winning science journalist with CBC Radio's legendary science show, Quirks &amp; Quarks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re thrilled to announce that <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/ssh">Tailscale SSH</a> is now Generally Available. Tailscale SSH allows Tailscale to manage the authentication and authorization of SSH connections on your tailnet. From the user’s perspective, you use SSH as normal—authenticating with Tailscale according to configurable rules—and we handle SSO, MFA, and key rotation, and allow you to enforce precise permissions in ACLs. Combined with other enterprise features like user and group provisioning with SCIM, you can use Tailscale SSH to craft a fully zero-trust remote access solution.</p><p>Thanks to that flexibility and strong security-by-default, Tailscale SSH has already become a key component of many of our users’ workflows, including as a foundational piece of enterprise ZTNA strategies. With no additional hardware or firewall rules to manage, it’s basically a drop-in upgrade for ubiquitous—and sometimes somewhat fiddly—SSH processes.</p><p>We’ve got more conceptual background on how Tailscale SSH works, and what motivated us to release it, in <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/tailscale-ssh">its original launch post</a>. You may also be interested in the tutorial video we recently published as part of our Tailscale Explained video series:</p><p>We’ve learned a lot from the Beta period of Tailscale SSH, and built up features alongside it, so today it’s entering a much more robust ecosystem of tooling than when we first launched in 2022. Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>We released the Tailscale SSH Console, allowing designated users to create browser-based SSH sessions to nodes on their tailnet</li><li>We added support for remote port forwarding and SELinux</li><li>We launched <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1246/tailscale-ssh-session-recording">session recording for Tailscale SSH</a>, enabling teams to meet compliance requirements and monitor SSH sessions across their tailnet without needing to trust a third party with their session data—including us.</li><li>We built our <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tailscale.vscode-tailscale">VS Code extension</a>, which allows you to edit remote files on nodes across your tailnet, on top of Tailscale SSH</li></ul><p>If you’re already using SSH for remote access, but haven’t yet gotten started with Tailscale SSH, <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh">there’s no time like the present</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/8">https://csvbase.com/blog/8</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40060728">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There is no hard limit on table size in csvbase.  Within reason, they can be as
big as you like.  And if you go off and run your own instance you can do
whatever you want.  Big Data isn't always Better Data, but it's nice to have
the option.</p>
<p>That said, wouldn't it be nice to have those tables cached, so that if you read
it twice you don't have to fully download it again the second time?</p>
<h2>Cache-control header - with max-age</h2>
<p>Perhaps this HTTP server header?:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Cache-Control: max-age</span><span>=</span><span>86400</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The above header says "keep using this file for a day [86400 seconds] before
re-downloading it".  Great!</p>
<p>Hang on though.  If someone changes that table you'd be stuck looking at the
old version for up to 24 hours.  Being <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1435417.1435432">eventually
consistent</a> was once very trendy.
But it's no longer hip - even Amazon S3 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/">no longer returns stale
data</a>.
So serving stale data just won't do for csvbase.</p>
<h2>HTTP/1.1 has a lot of caching features</h2>
<p>The elden ones <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2000.839382">thought deeply about
caching</a>.  DNS <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/2012/07/23/why-does-net-still-work-christmas-paul-mockapetris/">is a
cache</a>.
<a href="https://www.linuxatemyram.com/">Virtual memory</a> is a cache.  And if you've
ever wondered why HTTP/1.0 got a patch release (HTTP/1.1) less than a year
after it came out: more caching.</p>
<p>HTTP/1.0 had almost nothing in the way of caching.  In HTTP/1.1, a whole new
top-level section on the subject was added to the standard.  This was essential
because, back in the day, the repeated re-downloading of unchanged files was a
real headache.</p>
<p>This needless re-downloading was especially bad for popular sites, whose pages
would be massively re-downloaded over and over - even though they hadn't
changed - by many, many people.  Enough to start cause problems for the
internet as a whole.</p>
<p>One of the <em>cool new features</em> in HTTP/1.1 (implemented in Netscape Navigator 4.0,
available from all reputable software stockists) is the <code>ETag</code> header.  It
works like this:</p>
<p>The HTTP server generates a unique id for each version of a file.  'Version' in
this context means not just revision but also format, so CSV files get
different ids from Parquet files even if served from the same URL (csvbase
<a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/2">does this</a>).  The HTTP server returns this id in
the <code>ETag</code> header.</p>
<p>When an HTTP client requests the file again, it provides that same id in the
<code>If-None-Match</code> header.</p>
<p>If that ETag is up-to-date, the server just sets the status to <code>304 Not Modified</code> and returns absolutely nothing.  The client then knows that it should
use the file it already has.</p>
<p>This is a way to both keep a cache <em>and</em> avoid stale data.</p>
<h2>Generating the ETag</h2>
<p>How should the ETag be generated?  That is up to the server - up to csvbase.
csvbase could just md5sum the file and put that in the header.  That would be
valid and it would work.</p>
<p>Well, except.  Except, csvbase is not actually a database of CSV files.  The
name is a bit of a trick.  csvbase doesn't keep the CSV files on some
filesystem (or in an <a href="https://calpaterson.com/s3.html">object store</a> for that
matter).  Instead, uploaded CSV files are fully parsed and then put into a SQL
database.  When csvbase returns you a CSV file it's being generated <em>on the
fly</em>.  That's how csvbase returns other formats like Parquet, JSONlines, JSON, etc.</p>
<p>It would be quicker for csvbase not to have to regenerate the CSV file (or
Parquet file) each time, just in order to check whether the md5sum of that file
matched the <code>If-None-Match</code> header.</p>
<p>So instead of hashing the contents of the file, we'll create the ETag by
hashing a key:</p>
<p><code>(table id, last change time, file format, page number [if any])</code></p>
<p>That key represents both the version of the file plus what page is being looked
it (the JSON and HTML formats are paginated).  And if your table is changed,
last change time is different and the ETag changes too.  Fab.</p>
<h2>How long to cache for?</h2>
<p>At this point we have a caching system that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Spares the client downloading the file<ul>
<li>though they must make a tiny request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also avoids the server regenerating the file</li>
<li>Prevents any stale results (ie: avoids <a href="https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html">"TTL
hell"</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only question now is how long we tell clients to cache stuff.  How long?</p>
<p>The answer is forever.  csvbase sets no <code>max-age</code>.  Clients can cache stuff as
long as they like, <strong>providing that they revalidate each time</strong> the use that
data.</p>
<p>Here's what csvbase's response looks like</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>HTTP/1.1</span><span></span>
<span>content-type: text/csv</span><span></span>
<span>etag: &lt;some gobbledegook string&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate</span><span></span>
<span>[ then loads of CSV data ]</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The operative bit here is the <code>no-cache</code> pragma.  Despite the misleading name,
this tells clients that they can in fact cache this file, <em>but</em> that they must
revalidate each time they use it.  Here's how
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#response_directives">MDN</a>
describes it (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The no-cache response directive indicates that the <strong>response can be stored in
caches</strong>, but the response must be validated with the origin server before each
reuse, even when the cache is disconnected from the origin server."</em></p>
<p><em>"If you want caches to always check for content updates while reusing stored
content, no-cache is the directive to use. It does this by requiring caches
to revalidate each request with the origin server."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>must-revalidate</code> is probably not necessary but the original RFC suggests that
maybe caches might choose, in exceptional circumstances, yadda yadda yadda, to
actually serve stale data anyway.  <code>must-revalidate</code> bans that.
<code>must-revalidate</code>'s name actually makes sense so I probably don't need to quote
chapter and verse, but here, anyway, again from MDN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>HTTP allows caches to reuse stale responses when they are disconnected from
the origin server. must-revalidate is a way to prevent this from happening -
either the stored response is revalidated with the origin server or a 504
(Gateway Timeout) response is generated.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No TTL necessary.  And browsers really support this stuff.  It all works.</p>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/csvbase-client/"><code>csvbase-client</code></a> also supports
this.  You can test it out this way:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

<span># read the table</span>
<span>df1</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>"csvbase://calpaterson/opcodes-6502"</span><span>)</span>

<span># read it again (this came from your local cache)</span>
<span>df2</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>"csvbase://calpaterson/opcodes-6502"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And if you prefer just to use <code>curl</code>, here's how to test it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl <span>\</span>
--etag-compare opcodes-6502-etag.txt <span>\</span>
--etag-save opcodes-6502-etag.txt <span>\</span>
https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/opcodes-6502.parquet
<span>\-</span>O
</pre></div>
<h2>What else is possible with ETags?</h2>
<p>A bit more.  Join me next time when I use ETags as an effective form of
concurrency control.  Until then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try out csvbase and, really, really, importantly: <a href="mailto:cal@calpaterson.com">send me your
feedback</a></li>
<li>
Join the underground conspiracy on the <a href="https://discord.gg/zXHZNvv22N">csvbase discord
server</a><ul>
<li>memes to be kept to a socially acceptable level of dankness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leaf through <a href="https://github.com/calpaterson/csvbase">the source code</a></li>
<li>Or come and meet me in person at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/helpy-meetups/events/300305921/">Helsinki Python's May
meetup</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>See also</h2>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html">another article on caching</a> a
couple of years ago.  The subject bit different but the aim is the same: caching but
without correctness problems.</p>
<p>I loved Eric's Brewer's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E91oEn1bnXM">2004 lecture on
Inktomi</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inktomi">Inktomi</a> was effectively a primordial
Google who tried white-labelling instead of running the search engine
themselves.  They later changed to being a content distribution network and at
<a href="https://youtu.be/E91oEn1bnXM?si=zt5vj1TPSBOMkKzG&amp;t=3434">around 57 minutes</a>
Brewer relays the story of the release of the Starr report which vindicated
much of the effort put into web caching since HTTP/1.1 was released.  He is
very emotional throughout as Inktomi had gone spectacularly bust a couple of
years before.</p>
<p>One wrinkle I have not discussed is that many caching reverse proxies don't
have exactly have spectacular support for cache revalidation.  The going advice
on Varnish is to use some <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/">quite complicated
config</a>.
Cloudflare <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#origin-cache-control-behavior">do the wrong thing with
<code>no-cache</code></a>
but it's possible to work around it.  What can't be worked around, for csvbase,
is their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/20/cloudflare-does-not-consider-vary-values-in-caching-decisions/">lack of support for
<code>Vary</code></a>.
This is all HTTP/1.1 stuff - from 1997 - and browsers overwhelmingly support
it.  But reverse proxies don't, for some reason.</p>

  <p>12 Apr 2024</p>
  <p>As a query optimization researcher, I’ve spent the last 10 years of my life playing with, learning from, and building on top of the most sophisticated open source query optimizer out there, <a href="https://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I recently wondered how much PostgreSQL had improved over the decade since I started working on databases. While changelogs and opinion pieces were plentiful, I couldn’t find any strong empirical comparisons, so I decided to run the <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol9/p204-leis.pdf">join order benchmark</a> (JOB)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on PostgreSQL 8 through 16. I recorded the 90th percentile query latency for each database version.</p>

<p><img src="https://rmarcus.info/blog/assets/pg_over_time/job.svg" alt="Graph of P90 tail latency for different PostgreSQL versions. Speed improves drastically over time."></p>

<p>I built each version<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of PostgreSQL using GCC 13.2 inside a Docker container with Arch Linux. Since I wanted to measure the quality of the query optimizer, and not index/IO performance, I set <code>shared_buffers</code> to 8GB (large enough to hold the entire database). I also set <code>work_mem</code> to 8MB for all versions. Each query is executed once to warm the cache, then the median latency of 5 additional runs in recorded.</p>

<p>Overall, <strong>PostgreSQL’s tail performance has improved drastically</strong>, although versions 13 through 16 have been mostly stable. Comparing version 8 to version 16, <strong>PostgreSQL’s optimizer has dropped tail latency by nearly half in the last 10 years!</strong></p>

<p>We can also investigate the entire query distribution (note the log scale):</p>

<p><img src="https://rmarcus.info/blog/assets/pg_over_time/box.svg" alt="Box plots of query latency for each major version. There is a slight slope downwards."></p>

<p>We can use regression analysis to (1) confirm that the downward slope in latency is significant, and (2) quantify how much improvement is brought by each version of PostgreSQL. If we regress the PostgreSQL major version number against query latency, we see that each new major version of PostgreSQL brings, on average, a <strong>15% performance improvement</strong> on the Join Order Benchmark (<span id="il180"></span>). However, a linear model is arguably a poor measure of the change (<span id="il181"></span>).</p>

<p>Of course, not all of these improvements are attributable to the query optimizer. Improvements to the execution engine – from parallel workers to just-in-time (JIT) compilation – also play a role. It would be interesting to investigate how each query plan in JOB has changed over the year… maybe next time!</p>

<p>Quantifying the improvement aside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upgrade your database! Going from PostgreSQL 8 to 16 has the potential to massively improve your workload’s tail latency.</li>
  <li>Researchers should note that PostgreSQL is a bit of a moving target. Learned query optimization research has compared with different versions of PostgreSQL over time (e.g., Neo and Bao compare with version 11, whereas newer work compare with version 14, 15, or 16.) So just because an older technique improves on PostgreSQL by 30%, and a newer technique only improves on PostgreSQL by 25%, the newer technique may be comparing against a stronger PostgreSQL.</li>
</ul>

      <p><a href="https://ajkprojects.com/">Home</a></p>
      
      <p>Advice for myself around leisure activities.</p>
      <p>You aren’t famous. Anything you do or create will probably receive little to no attention, so stop optimizing for a non-existent audience and instead focus on what makes you enjoy the activity. </p>
      <p>Want to try a craft or artistic hobby? Focus on mastering the skill and enjoy the variety it can provide. You don’t need to build a personal style. No one will care. Want to do photography and think black and white photos are cool? Great! You don’t need to create an Instagram branded all around your moody black and white photos. Most likely you’ll get bored of it and want to try a different type of photography, and that’s great. You aren’t Ansel Adams, no one will care if your “style” is all over the place.</p>
      <p>Do you want to build an app or website but don’t enjoy the process of designing? Then make it ugly. Who cares! Design is for an audience and you don’t have one. Functionality is more important right now. Maybe a designer will notice and want to improve it for you, but until then take pride in your crappy UI. </p>
      <p>Blogging is fun and therapeutic. Grammar and editing aren’t. As long as your thoughts are coherent, don’t worry too much about writing mistakes or filtering yourself. Just use Grammarly to fix elementary-level errors and move on. It’s more about the writing process than the final product.</p>
      <p>The most egregious thing you can do with any activity is daydream about how you can make money off of it. That’s the quickest way to optimize for the wrong things and suck the fun right out of it. Most likely you will stop doing the activity almost immediately, so save the money-making schemes for work.</p>
      <p>In the end, find something you enjoy doing and just do it because you enjoy it. If you have to, make some goals for yourself, but never for your “audience”.</p>

		<p>Anniversaries are strange: no one but those involved have any reason to even know they exist, which makes them easy to skip; for example, last year I mostly ignored the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">10 year anniversary of starting Stratechery</a> because I was more eager to write about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Getting a Computer</a>. That leaves today, April 16, as my last chance to mark a tin anniversary: ten years ago Stratechery <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/welcome-stratechery-20/">added a subscription option</a>, making this my full-time job.</p>
<p>It was, for the record, a miserable day: I had a convoluted plan to offer different site experiences for subscribers and non-subscribers: the former would receive daily linked-list updates (a la <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>) while the latter would still have access to longer-form Articles; I scrapped the concept <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/free-stratechery-daily-email/">two days later</a> in favor of simply sending subscribers a daily email, and so the paid newsletter model was born.</p>
<p>That accident of history ended up being why this anniversary is actually more meaningful to me: while I am most well-known for Stratechery, I am equally proud of the paid newsletter model — services like Substack <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/platform-profiles/substack-newsletter-platform/">were based on Stratechery</a> — and gratified that so many writers are making a living connecting directly with readers.</p>
<p>Of course newsletters aren’t the only medium where this happens (and, in fact, I’ve never viewed Stratechery as a newsletter; it’s a blog that you can read via email); there are also podcasts (which <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">Stratechery has expanded into</a>) and YouTube (like and subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Stratechery">Stratechery</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SharpTechPodcast">Sharp Tech</a> channels!). The king of the latter, at least when it comes to tech, is Marques Brownlee, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/mkbhd">MKBHD</a>.</p>
<h3>The Humane AI Pin</h3>
<p>Humane introduced the wearable AI Pin at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ">a TED Talk 11 months ago</a>,  painting the vision of a future without screens, powered by AI. I was, for the record, pretty skeptical: most new tech categories layer on top of what came before, as opposed to outright replacing them; Humane’s proposal of a wearable device that was completely independent of the phone in your pocket seemed unlikely to succeed. Still, I was cheering for them: I applaud any company trying to build something new, and AI provides the opening for new experimentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, last week the reviews of the AI Pin came out and they were universally terrible; The Verge’s headline summed up the sentiment: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">Humane AI Pin review: not even close</a>. David Pierce wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I came into this review with two big questions about the AI Pin. The first is the big-picture one: is this thing… anything? In just shy of two weeks of testing, I’ve come to realize that there are, in fact, a lot of things for which my phone actually sucks. Often, all I want to do is check the time or write something down or text my wife, and I end up sucked in by TikTok or my email or whatever unwanted notification is sitting there on my screen. Plus, have you ever thought about how often your hands are occupied with groceries / clothes / leashes / children / steering wheels, and how annoying / unsafe it is to try to balance your phone at the same time? I’ve learned I do lots of things on my phone that I might like to do somewhere else. So, yeah, this is something. Maybe something big. AI models aren’t good enough to handle everything yet, but I’ve seen enough glimmers of what’s coming that I’m optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>  That raises the second question: should you buy this thing? That one’s easy. Nope. Nuh-uh. No way. The AI Pin is an interesting idea that is so thoroughly unfinished and so totally broken in so many unacceptable ways that I can’t think of anyone to whom I’d recommend spending the $699 for the device and the $24 monthly subscription.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brownlee agreed; he said at the start of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&amp;t=18s">YouTube review</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  So this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product in a really interesting new form factor of an ultra-futuristic wearable computer. In a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro and wearable glasses, it’s so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately it’s also the new worst product I think I’ve ever reviewed in its current state. There’s just so many things bad about it. It’s so bad, in fact, that I actually think it’s kind of distracting to understand what the point of the device is as we go through it, so I’m going to have to separate it out for this video. First, I’m going to tell you what it is and what it’s supposed to do, and then I’ll tell you what my experience has actually been using it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brownlee proceeded to do just that: he presented Humane’s vision, detailed how poorly it lived up to it (including the probably fatal flaw inherent in its decision to pretend smartphones don’t exist), and granted that future software updates might improve the experience. I thought it was a fair,<sup id="rf1-12783"><a href="#fn1-12783" title="Actually, the deference Brownlee gave the vision and the potential of future upgrades was arguably generous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> if brutal, review, but what had some people up in arms was the title and thumbnail:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I find it distasteful, almost unethical, to say this when you have 18 million subscribers.</p>

</div>
<p>I don’t tweet much these days — if you want one of my tips for lasting over a decade, that is one of them, for my own peace of mind more than anything —&nbsp;but Vassallo’s sentiment bothered me enough to fire off a response:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marques’ reach is a function of telling the truth. He didn’t always have 18 million subscribers, but he had his integrity from the beginning.

</div>
<p>I honestly think I had this anniversary on my mind: I remember when I first started, with only a few hundred followers on Twitter, armed with nothing but my honest takes about tech; my only hope was that those takes would be original enough and valuable enough to build an audience. That they were didn’t diminish the desire to be honest; indeed, one of the biggest challenges creators face as they grow is retaining their edge even when they know people are actually paying attention to what they have to say.</p>
<h3>MKBHD’s Responsibility</h3>
<p>The more interesting Vassallo tweet, though, and the one that inspired this Article, was this exchange in response to his original tweet:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MKBHD is not the market. He *significantly* influences the market.</p>
<p>If a single person can affect the stock price of a company, we usually restrict what they can say or when. MK should be cognizant of the unconstrained power he has (for now).</p>
<p>— Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1779785621760069810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ignore the vaguely threatening “for now” ; Vassallo is touching on something profound about Brownlee, that I myself understand intimately: what the Internet has made uniquely possible is total loyalty to your customers, and that is threatening.</p>
<p>Let me start with myself: every dollar of income I have comes from my subscribers,<sup id="rf2-12783"><a href="#fn2-12783" title="I previously spoke for pay, and even more previously offered consulting, and even more previously than that had ads; however, I ended ads in 2014, consulting in 2015, and haven’t accepted any paid speaking opportunities since 2017. This is all covered on <a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/about/&quot;>my about page</a>." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> all of whom pay the same price.<sup id="rf3-12783"><a href="#fn3-12783" title="$12/month or $120/year for the last five years, increasing to $15/month and $150/year on April 22" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> If someone doesn’t like what I write, I make it easy to unsubscribe; if they accuse me of writing for favor or illegitimate profit I am happy to unsubscribe them myself, and refund their money. After all, to use Brownlee’s reponse to Vassallo:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We disagree on what my job is</p>
<p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1779928058746617912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>My job is to make my subscribers happy, and the best way I’ve found to do that is to stay as true as I can to what I set out to do in the beginning: write things that are original and valuable. When I succeed I’m happy, and the numbers take care of themselves; when I publish something I’m not happy with, I have trouble sleeping. When tech companies or investors or anyone else is mad, I am free to not pay them any attention.</p>
<p>Brownlee, though, is, to Vassallo’s point, something else entirely: 18 million subscribers is an incredible number, even if only — “only” — 3.5 million people have viewed his Humane video. If Humane’s AI Pin wasn’t already dead in the water, it’s fair to say that <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1779842724771893524">@levelsio</a> is right:</p>

<p>Who, though, is to blame, and who benefited? Surely the responsibility for the Humane AI Pin lies with Humane; the people who benefited from Brownlee’s honesty were his viewers, the only people to whom Brownlee owes anything. To think of this review — or even just the title — as “distasteful” or “unethical” is to view Humane — a recognizable entity, to be sure — as of more worth than the 3.5 million individuals who watched Brownlee’s review.</p>
<p>This is one of the challenges of scale: Brownlee has so many viewers that it is almost easier to pretend like they are some unimportant blob. Brownlee, though, is successful because he remembers his job is not to go easy on individual companies, but inform individual viewers who will make individual decisions about spending $700 on a product that doesn’t work. Thanks to the Internet he has absolutely no responsibility or incentive to do anything but.</p>
<h3>Media and the Internet</h3>
<p>While Stratechery mostly covers tech, I also spend a lot of time on media; in the early days of Stratechery, this mostly meant newspapers, and my argument was that was in fact a particularly useful angle on the impact of technology broadly: the fact that newspapers were text meant that they felt the impact of the Internet almost immediately, effects that would, as devices became more powerful and ubiquitous, and broadband faster and more reliable, impact everything. And, of course, Stratechery was a written product, so I had a stake in the game.</p>
<p>To that end, I wrote a series of Articles in the run-up to April 16, 2014, laying the groundwork for why I thought my subscription offering would work. The last of these was entitled <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/newspapers-are-dead-long-live-journalism/">Newspapers Are Dead; Long Live Journalism</a>, where I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember how the New York Times was started as&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.org/stream/historyofnewyork00davi/historyofnewyork00davi_djvu.txt">a means of making money</a>? After the first year the paper had a circulation of 26,000 in a city of over half a million, but had incurred up-front capital costs of $50,000, and first-year expenses of $78,000 (In 1851 dollars; the modern equivalent would be $1.4 million and $2.2 million respectively). Compare that to this blog (which, by happy coincidence, turns&nbsp;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">one year old</a>&nbsp;tomorrow, making this comparison timely):&nbsp;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/">FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average</a>, the first article in this series, has been read by over 30,000 people; meanwhile, I’ve spent less than $2,000. More readers, way less money.</p>
<p>  You may consider the comparison unfair — an entire newsroom putting out a daily edition as compared to a solo blogger posting one Article — but&nbsp;<em>the unfairness is the point</em>. No one shared my article because it was from Stratechery, but then again, no one shares an article today just because it’s from the New York Times; all that matters is the individual article and its worth to the reader and potential sharer. As a writer,&nbsp;<em>this is amazing.</em>&nbsp;When it comes to reader attention, I am competing on an equal footing with The New York Freaking Times! Unfortunately for The New York Times, when it comes to making money they’re competing with Google and Facebook. Most distressingly, though, when it comes to costs, they’re competing with the last 150 years. Everything from printing presses to sales and marketing is deadweight if advertising is not a sustainable model.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The New York Times has, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-new-york-times-ai-opportunity/">to its immense credit</a>, figured out how to go direct to readers; most other newspapers have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-local-news-business-model/">struggled</a>: cost structures that were predicated on owning printing presses and delivery trucks simply don’t make sense in a world where <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/economic-power-age-abundance/">distribution is free</a>.</p>
<p>Free distribution, meanwhile, made Stratechery possible: I just needed to write compelling content on my own website. Brownlee, meanwhile, got his free distribution from YouTube (and, to the extent you want to complain about his accurate but attention-grabbing headline, the realities of the YouTube algorithm, the one non-viewer incentive Brownlee needs to respond to, looms large). The key point is that he could do everything else on his own, starting with the webcam on his HP Pavilion laptop that he used to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gk_rl3y_SU">his first video</a>:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9gk_rl3y_SU?si=hlgLhuPF1LAqLXUw&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today Brownlee has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz_qFyTrS8w">top-of-the-line studio</a> and a staff, but the fundamental principle remains: in media one person can do it all, and build a thriving business that makes everyone from Humane to Apple care deeply about what he or she has to say — far more than they care about any traditional publication.</p>
<h3>AI and Intelligence</h3>
<p>I mentioned at the beginning that last year I wrote about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Gets a Computer</a> in lieu of an anniversary post; that Article, which was built around OpenAI’s announcement of (now-discontinued) ChatGPT plugins, was about the nature of the brain and how large learning models did or did not compare.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Computers are deterministic: if circuit X is open, then the proposition represented by X is true; 1 plus 1 is always 2; clicking “back” on your browser will exit this page. There are, of course, a huge number of abstractions and massive amounts of logic between an individual transistor and any action we might take with a computer — and an effectively infinite number of places for bugs — but the appropriate mental model for a computer is that they do exactly what they are told (indeed, a bug is not the computer making a mistake, but rather a manifestation of the programmer telling the computer to do the wrong thing).</p>
<p>  I’ve already mentioned Bing Chat and ChatGPT; on March 14 Anthropic released another AI assistant named Claude: while the announcement doesn’t say so explicitly, I assume the name is in honor of the aforementioned Claude Shannon. This is certainly a noble sentiment — Shannon’s contributions to information theory broadly extend far beyond what Dixon laid out above — but it also feels misplaced: while technically speaking everything an AI assistant is doing is ultimately composed of 1s and 0s, the manner in which they operate is emergent from their training, not proscribed, which leads to the experience feeling fundamentally different from logical computers — something nearly human — which takes us back to hallucinations; Sydney was interesting, but what about homework?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I added in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-enterprise-connectors-and-small-businesses-nvidia-competitors/">an August Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The point of that Article was that ChatGPT’s plugin architecture gave hallucinating creative LLMs access to determinative computers to ascertain truth, not dissimilar to the way a creative being like you or I might use a calculator to solve a math problem. In other words, the LLM is the interface to the source of truth, not the source of truth itself.</p>
<p>  That is exactly what this “coming soon” feature is all about: you don’t make an LLM useful for your business by adding your business’s data to the LLM; that is simply a bit more text in a sea of it. Rather, you leverage the LLM as an interface to “computers” that deterministically give you the right answer. In this case, those computers will be “connecting the applications you already have”, which sounds to me an awful lot like enterprise-specific plug-ins.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The specifics of product implementations are not the point, but rather the distinction between a natural language interface based on probabilities and computers based on deterministic calculations; I think using the former to access the latter will remain one of the most important applications of large language models.</p>
<p>There is, though, one more piece: who actually tells the AI what to do, such that it needs access to a computer of its own? In <em>ChatGPT Gets a Computer</em>, which analogized large language models to Jeff Hawkin’s theory of the brain, I expressed hope that the beliefs he expressed about the nature of intelligence in <a href="https://www.numenta.com/resources/books/a-thousand-brains-by-jeff-hawkins/">A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence</a> extended to large language models. Hawkins writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Intelligence is the ability of a system to learn a model of the world. However, the resulting model by itself is valueless, emotionless, and has no goals. Goals and values are provided by whatever system is using the model. It’s similar to how the explorers of the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries worked to create an accurate map of Earth. A ruthless military general might use the map to plan the best way to surround and murder an opposing army. A trader could use the exact same map to peacefully exchange goods. The map itself does not dictate these uses, nor does it impart any value to how it is used. It is just a map, neither murderous nor peaceful. Of course, maps vary in detail and in what they cover. Therefore, some maps might be better for war and others better for trade. But the desire to wage war or trade comes from the person using the map.</p>
<p>  Similarly, the neocortex learns a model of the world, which by itself has no goals or values. The emotions that direct our behaviors are determined by the old brain. If one human’s old brain is aggressive, then it will use the model in the neocortex to better execute aggressive behavior. If another person’s old brain is benevolent, then it will use the model in the neocortex to better achieve its benevolent goals. As with maps, one person’s model of the world might be better suited for a particular set of aims, but the neocortex does not create the goals.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To the extent this is an analogy to AI, large language models are intelligent, but they do not have goals or values or drive. They are tools to be used by, well, anyone who is willing and able to take the initiative to use them.</p>
<h3>AI and the Sovereign Individual</h3>
<p>I don’t think either Brownlee or I particularly need AI, or, to put it another way, are overly threatened by it. Yes, ChatGPT would have written several thousands words far more quickly than the hours it took me to write this Article, but I am (perhaps foolishly) confident that they would not be original and valuable enough to take away my audience; I think it’s the same for Brownlee.</p>
<p>The connection between us and AI, though, is precisely the fact that we haven’t needed it: the nature of media is such that we could already create text and video on our own, and take advantage of the Internet to — at least in the case of Brownlee — deliver finishing blows to $230 million startups.</p>
<p>How many industries, though, are not media, in that they still need a team to implement the vision of one person? How many apps or services are there that haven’t been built, not because one person can’t imagine them or create them in their mind, but because they haven’t had the resources or team or coordination capabilities to actually ship them?</p>
<p>This gets at the vector through which AI impacts the world above and beyond cost savings in customer support, or whatever other obvious low-hanging fruit there may be: as the ability of large language models to understand and execute complex commands — with deterministic computing as needed — increases, so too does the potential power of the sovereign individual telling AI what to do. The Internet removed the necessity — and inherent defensibility — of complex cost structures for media; AI has the potential to do the same for a far greater host of industries.</p>
<hr>
<p>Brownlee’s 2nd most popular video is only two months old: it’s his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak">overview of the Apple Vision Pro</a>; it’s not, if fiction is our guide, an accident that Meta is developing the Quest and Apple has released the Vision Pro just as AI seems poised to threaten an ever-increasing number of jobs. This was the world painted by Pixar’s Wall-E:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/walle"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=640%2C268&amp;ssl=1" alt="Humans in Pixar's Wall-E" width="640" height="268" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=1024%2C428&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=768%2C321&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=1200%2C502&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>It’s funny, because before I looked up this photo, I could have sworn the humans in the film, lulled to insouciance by an AI that addressed all of their physical needs, were wearing headsets; I guess Pixar overestimated our ability to build space-faring cruise ships and underestimated the relentless progression of consumer electronics.</p>
<p>My suspicion, however, is that Pixar got it wrong, and this famous photo of Mark Zuckerberg at Mobile World Congress in 2016 is closer to the truth of the matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10102665120179591&amp;set=pcb.10102665126861201"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="Mark Zuckerberg at Mobile World Congress" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=946%2C630&amp;ssl=1 946w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Wall-E erred by assuming that every human was the same, all gleefully enslaved by AUTO, the ships AI. In fact, though, I suspect humanity will be distributed bi-modally, with the vast majority of people happily wearing their Vision Pros or watching their streaming service or viewing their TikTok videos, while increasingly sovereign individuals, aided by AI, pilot the ship.</p>
<p>That may sound extreme, but again, this is why it is useful to look to media first: Brownlee — one man, who started out by reviewing a media center remote on his HP laptop — does in fact hold the fate of entire companies and products in his hand. My bet is not that AI replaces Brownlee, but that AI means Brownlee’s for everything, not just media.</p>
<p>As for me, I plan on documenting it every step of the way, thanks to every person who has supported Stratechery over the last 10 years, and to whom I alone owe accountability, and gratitude.</p>

            April 15th, 2024</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>Every so often, somebody rediscovers my story of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050824-11/?p=34463"> buying an entire Egghead Software store</a>. One question that comes up is the issue of taxes. (You can never avoid taxes. Taxes are due today for most people in the United States.)</p>
<p>If the employees were allowed to keep the software provided they tested the program and filed bugs against it, did that count as work compensation that became taxable income?</p>
<p>The thing is, nobody ever checked whether you tested the program you took, and it was obvious to everybody participating in the activity, seeing as you just picked up the software and walked out of the room without filling out any paperwork. You were assumed to be a well-meaning member of the team who wouldn’t show up for an activity without any intention of doing it. The expectation that you test the program was just that: An expectation. It wasn’t a condition.</p>
<p>My understanding is that this makes the software count as a gift that falls under the <i>de minimis</i> rule of the United States tax code. This was a one-time thing, so the frequency criterion is met. The value of the software was well under $100, so that requirement was met. And since nobody actually kept track of who took which software, the administrative impracticality requirement was also satisfied.</p>
<p>But really, this was just a development manager taking it upon himself to do some unconventional application compatibility test coverage and to instill camaraderie at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: During one of the many iterations of this story being retold, someone remarked that they got a copy of the video game <i>Wing Commander III</i> through this exercise. I immediately remembered that they fulfilled their expectation by filing a bug against Windows 95: When you earned the cloaking device on level 58 or something, you couldn’t activate it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they provided a save-game at level 58, so I didn’t have to play all the way to level 58 by myself.</p>
<p>The problem was that the hotkey for activating the cloaking device was <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, and that conflicted with the use of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to cancel an active clipboard paste operation into an MS-DOS session. Normally, Windows 95 realized that there was no active paste active and replayed the hotkey into the MS-DOS session. However, the replay of the hotkey was apparently too fast for this game to recognize, so it never activated the cloaking device.</p>
<p>I fixed it by changing Windows 95 so that it installed the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> hotkey handler only when a clipboard paste operation was active, and removed it when the paste operation completed. That way, when you hit it outside of a paste operation, the keys were visible to the game at human speeds, and this allowed it to engage the cloaking device.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.maggieslepian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maggie Slepian</a> | Longreads | April 2, 2024 | 5,423 words</em></p>



<p>Spring in Montana is a season of waiting, trapped in a limbo of rotten snow and inaccessible trails. It makes me feel desperate: a rare warm day followed by another sleet storm, the high-octane days of summer still impossibly far away.</p>



<p>In May 2019, I was crawling out of my skin. The high-elevation north-facing trails were still sheets of ice and the south-facing trails were shoe-sucking mud. I was so sick of my gym routine that I’d sit in the parking lot for 20 minutes, willing myself to go inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d moved to Montana from the northeast nearly a decade before, drawn to lofty mountains to reinvent my tame life in suburban New Hampshire. I immediately began compiling a résumé of outdoor activities: I learned to mountain bike, became a strong climber, checked peaks off my list, and worked as a horseback guide. Backcountry recreation was the social currency and my value hinged on accepting every invitation, so I did my best to learn everything.</p>



<p>But no matter how many skills I picked up, my struggles with asthma meant I often fell behind. I was the last one to the top of the switchbacks, watching my lean, muscled friends vanish over the ridge as I sucked air through a windpipe that felt like a crumpled straw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I made up for those cardio challenges with an uncanny ability to reject fear. I volunteered to go first on intimidating climbing routes, humming to stay calm as I gripped miniscule edges and pressed my feet against glassy slabs of rock. I fell often, once catching my leg behind the rope and flipping upside down, my head ringing as I smashed into the wall. My belayer called up in a panic and offered to lower me, but I was already pulling myself up the rope before I’d stopped swinging. My self-worth banked on being the most fearless, camping in winter storms, grabbing the reins of the horse who had thrown me, pulling pebbles out of my knees and joking about how hard I’d hit the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>That frenetic activity level of summer and winter made spring’s dullness harder to bear. I craved movement in the backcountry and the social life that came with it. Kadin texted me one of those afternoons when I was flopping around the climbing gym mats delaying my workout. He was a climbing partner, decently good friend, river guide, and enough of an enigma that I wasn’t sure whether I had a crush or he just had enough mystique to seem appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He asked if I had a kayak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I responded right away. <em>Yeah, an old river runner. You looking to get out this week?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>My kayak was a 15-year-old Wave Sport Frankenstein I’d picked up at a pawn shop the year before. I’d spent that summer paddling the reservoir south of town, occasionally running a calm section of the Madison River. The boat was narrow and prone to tipping. I planned to take a roll clinic the following summer, as I was determined to gain aptitude in yet another outdoor sport—just enough to feel confident on beginner whitewater.</p>



<p>The section of the Gallatin River that Kadin wanted to run was near my house, easily accessible and less intimidating than anything in the canyon. Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the invitation immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the invitation immediately.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t consider whether or not I was comfortable paddling that stretch. Along with the desire to keep up with my peers, my ability to assess risk was skewed after years of narrow backcountry escapes, a well-documented phenomenon where your risk perception shifts after successfully navigating unpredictable situations. From outrunning lightning storms to losing the trail to tackling climbs well above my grade, I’d encountered plenty of tenuous scenarios and always figured it out, scraping by without too much damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://simonpriest.altervista.org/DOWNLOADS/ChangesPerceivedRCADVENTURE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adventure Experience Paradigm</a> describes this well; it uses a simple line graphic to show the interplay of risk and competence. When the risk is low and the skills are high, the person is toward the bottom of the chart in the “realm of exploration and experimentation.” When competence and risk are balanced, the participant is in the middle, and when risk exceeds competence, the outcome can be catastrophic. The more experience someone has with navigating risky situations, the more confident they become, skewing the variables. My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>None of this was on my mind a few days later as I grabbed my kayaking gloves and neoprene booties and dragged my boat out of the garage. I raked a finger through the cobwebs stretching across the seat as Kadin’s truck rumbled into my driveway. We crammed both boats in the bed of my truck, shuttled his truck to the takeout, and I drove us back to the start.</p>



<p>The wind was brisk as we unloaded the boats, whipping my hair against my face and pushing puffy white clouds across the sky. I inched down the embankment toward the blown-out river, swollen from snowmelt and moving faster than I thought. Icy water splashed my toes and I slipped in the slick mud.</p>



<p>“I’m glad I brought the booties,” I shouted over the water. Kadin gave me a thumbs up and tossed his spare spray skirt in my direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The river at this time would have been around 40 degrees, frigid with snowmelt and choked with trees and other obstacles lodged in the current. These lodged obstacles, called “strainers,” make normally moderate sections extremely dangerous, allowing water through but not a boat. Getting pinned underwater against a wall of debris is just one of the ways you can die on a river. It didn’t occur to me to be scared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To a casual observer, the fact that I owned a boat and a few kayaking accessories gave the appearance I knew what I was doing. But technical boating is a far cry from my mellow paddling experience. I lacked the reflexes and skills to navigate faster water, plus my boat was outdated and difficult to stabilize. But the excitement of finally getting outside, the relative rarity of an invitation from Kadin, plus my other narrow escapes pushed out any seed of doubt. I lowered myself into my kayak.</p>



<p>Kadin’s spare spray skirt barely fit over the cockpit and I couldn’t get enough leverage to secure it. He crouched over my boat, wrestling with the neoprene until it strained across the opening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can you pull that off if you have to?” He secured his own spray skirt and pushed himself toward the water.</p>



<p>“I don’t know,” I answered honestly. “It’s kind of tight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He paused. “Do you want to practice?”</p>



<p>His hesitancy annoyed me.</p>



<p>I knew I should make sure I could release it, but my brain raced through two scenarios: if I couldn’t pull the spray skirt, it would be clear we shouldn’t run this section—I’d be trapped underwater if I flipped my boat and couldn’t roll. But if I pulled it on shore and couldn’t put it back on, Kadin would have to help me again and I’d look silly and inexperienced. I shook my head and dug my paddle into the embankment.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, let’s go. I’m not going to flip my boat.”</p>



<p>My boat wasn’t cooperating the instant I dropped into the river. The water was too fast and&nbsp;unpredictable. Every time I tried to adjust course, I was buffeted by the current. I scolded myself to paddle like I knew how, but this wasn’t the type of kayaking I was used to—my reflexes were slow and instincts incorrect. My boat’s slim bow dipped and rose, and I flexed my legs against the thigh braces in an attempt to stabilize. An icy splash of water streamed down my jacket. I knew I shouldn’t be on the water.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I knew I shouldn’t be on the water.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I was desperate to be off the river but I also wasn’t in control. That realization turned into panic as I was catapulted forward in the current, glancing sidelong at the bank rushing by and knowing I didn’t have the skills to eddy out. Too much was happening too quickly. The spray skirt felt like a vise around my waist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wave hit me in the face and I gasped, swiping a hand across my eyes as I heard Kadin yell behind me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stay to the left! Maggie, the left!” he shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I turned to hear him better, and when I looked forward I had dropped into a trough and the current swept me to the right.</p>



<p>I blinked to clear water from my eyes and saw why Kadin had yelled to stay left. I was heading right toward a massive strainer, topped by a downed tree at head height. It was as thick as my torso, the gnarled root ball creating a dam for a jagged pile of broken logs.</p>



<p>I threw my arm out and collided with the tree with a sickening whack. Before I could take a breath, my boat flipped and I was underwater.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Oh no, </em>I thought. <em>I am in so much trouble.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It was silent underwater, yellowish-green and brighter than I would have thought. Fist-sized rocks bouncing next to my head were the only indication of how fast I was moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>You’re moving, which means you’re not pinned against the strainer. Get air. You have to roll.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I’d never practiced rolling a kayak—the roll clinic was still on my long list of goals—but I knew to snap my hips into the side of the boat and leverage with the paddle. My boat was built to roll, but I had no muscle memory to draw from to actually execute the move. I also had no paddle—it had been ripped from my hands when I hit the tree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I threw my hips into the side of my boat. It rocked a few inches, then settled back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I fought panic. <em>Try again</em>, <em>you need to get air.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I threw my hips harder into the side of the boat. Nothing. The effort took energy and energy took oxygen. A countdown started in my head. I only had a few minutes to get out of the boat. How long had I been underwater?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Wet exit</em>. <em>Pull the spray skirt.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I frantically felt for the grab loop, but I was upside down and disoriented. When I found it after wasting more precious seconds, I leaned back and pulled as hard as I could. It didn’t budge. More seconds went by. My heart started thudding more rapidly and I felt that familiar aching burn when you stay underwater too long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thought came into my head, momentarily paralyzing me: <em>these might be your last few minutes</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My clumsy gloved hands scrabbled uselessly at the edges of the neoprene trapping me in the boat. As I realized I couldn’t release the spray skirt that way either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>As I realized I couldn’t release the spray skirt that way either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><em>Please no. Please don’t let it end like this.</em></p>



<p>This is where my brain split into two tracks running at the same time: a sadness track and an action track.</p>



<p>The sadness track focused on my family. My parents and three younger siblings all still lived in the Northeast. They supported me but didn’t understand my drive to keep pushing, and they continuously begged me to be careful. I thought about my mother, wracked with nerves whenever I’d casually recount another close call. I thought about my dad. His cancer had just relapsed; my family was already suffering. My drowning would destroy them.</p>



<p><em>I’m sorry.</em> <em>I’m so sorry for my family, I made a mistake and I wish I hadn’t come here and I’m sorry.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The action track said: <em>keep trying until it’s over.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I smashed my hip into the side of my boat again, and this time I rocked it enough to hear the roar of the water and feel air on one side of my face. I sucked in a half-breath, half-mouthful-of-water before rolling under again, buying myself incrementally more time. I wondered if Kadin had seen me roll, if he knew what was happening.</p>



<p>My heart sped up even more and I felt a new sensation in my chest: a dark hole with a deep burn around the edges. Still being pulled downriver, I watched my hourglass run out as I tried one last time to roll, but I was too tired and barely moved the boat.</p>



<p>I knew then that I didn’t want my last few minutes to be full of sadness and regret. If I wasn’t going to survive this, I didn’t want my final thoughts to be berating myself for a bad choice.</p>



<p><em>It’s OK, </em>I thought<em>. You didn’t mean for this to happen. You are going to die and you should just be grateful for the time you had.</em></p>



<p>The heavy, black ache in my chest fully replaced the burn. I forced myself to keep my eyes open and watch the sunbeams like I’d seen a thousand times before, when I’d been underwater by choice and could come up for air when I wanted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My vision spotted and wavered. I thought about my family one more time, trying to send a message through the river and into the air I couldn’t reach: <em>I’m so sorry, I love you, I didn’t mean to hurt you.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I read somewhere that we’re all unreliable narrators, even for our own stories. It’s impossible to remember fully accurate details and our brain fills the gaps where our memories fail.</p>

<p>This means I can’t tell you what order in which things happened: whether I felt Kadin collide with my boat or whether I was still unconscious when he dragged me to the surface. I just know I opened my eyes to the blue sky studded with clouds I thought I’d never see again, and that I felt the spring air whipping against my face. He told me I made a noise, a choking moan that sounded like a dying animal. He thought: <em>she still might not make it</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things came into focus one at a time: Kadin’s arm across my chest, the bruising strike of his legs as he lifeguard-dragged me to an eddy, my head propped out of the water on his shoulder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once I fully came to, I thrashed away from him, swimming an adrenaline-fueled freestyle to the bank and digging my hands into the mud to pull myself out. I collapsed in a heap, threw up river water, tried to stand, fell down. Kadin leaned over me and pressed my shoulders down, his eyes darting over my face, his own hollow with fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m OK, I’m fine.” My voice sounded like it was run through a grater. Once I started shivering, I couldn’t stop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mags, I thought you were a goner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What happened,” I asked, “how did you get to me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told it like this: he saw me collide with the strainer and flip my boat. He paddled after me as fast as possible, watching my upside-down kayak, waiting for me to roll. He kept a countdown in his head, and when I didn’t surface, he beached his boat on a sandbar, ripped off his spray skirt, and dove into the current, swimming as hard as he could until he reached me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He grabbed my boat as it flew downriver with my unconscious body dangling underneath. He tried to roll me, but my dead weight made it impossible, so he hung on the rounded hull until he found the grab loop to release the spray skirt and rip me out upside down.</p>



<p>I didn’t know how long I was underwater. You can suffer irreversible brain damage after five minutes without oxygen, but my half-breath had bought me more time. If Kadin hadn’t seen me flip, missed my boat in the current, or taken another minute to reach me, it would have been over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We staggered along a dirt road, cut through a field, then followed another road to where we’d dropped his truck. We didn’t talk.</p>



<p>“Do you need me to go home with you?” he asked when we got back to my truck. His hands trembled on the steering wheel. We were both freezing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, go home. I’m fine,” I said. I was always fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took three tries to get the key into the ignition. The sound of the engine made me jump.</p>



<p>Foot on brake. Reverse. Drive. Gas. My leg trembled so hard on the pedal the truck shuddered.</p>



<p>I drove home with both hands on the wheel; I left my drenched clothes in a heap in the entryway. I turned the shower on, but the sound of the water sent shock waves through my body and I slapped the knob back off. Reeking of river water, I crawled into bed and willed the shaking to stop.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>The next few days passed in a blur. I emptied the trash, checked the mail. Fed my cat in the morning and evening, responded to the most basic work emails. Dazedly coordinated an upcoming potluck dinner that I didn’t think to cancel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I told friends what happened, I called it “the kayak accident” and kept it flippant. I told them that yes I’d nearly drowned, but no they shouldn’t worry, care, or ask about it. When they did worry, care, and ask about it, I snapped like a cornered dog. <em>No questions. I said I didn’t want to talk about it.</em></p>



<p>I maintained this barbed facade, but inside I was coming apart. I woke up each night gasping for air. Sometimes my face was buried in my pillow and sometimes I’d been holding my breath. <em>How</em> <em>do our bodies know to keep breathing? </em>I wondered. <em>Is it safe to fall asleep?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Bruises blossomed from my thighs to my shins. My hips ached from slamming into the boat, and I was so tired I had to hold onto the wall walking upstairs. When I showered, I huddled terrified against the wall, trying to wash my hair without the water hitting my face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hosted the dinner party a week later. To cancel would have meant I was exhausted and scared, and if I was exhausted and scared, I was weak. If I was weak, I was worthless. So instead of calling Kadin and telling him I wasn’t OK, or asking him if he also wasn’t OK, or talking to my family, or writing in a journal, I opened my front door to a dozen friends and drifted through the warm noise of music and conversation. <em>Where are the serving bowls? Do you want me to put this in the oven? Does Maggie have an ice maker?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Halfway through the night I grabbed a bowl of food scraps to toss in the compost. The din dulled to near-silence as I stepped into my backyard and pulled the slider shut. Loud to quiet. Above water to under water. OK to not OK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like dripping wax, the patio and window glow melted together, and a muted thrumming pounded in my ears. I slid down the side of my house as pinpricks spotted my vision and my breathing went ragged and gasping. It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn’t be my last.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn’t be my last.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It got worse after that. I was haunted by a newfound fear of consequences, made worse by a desperation to maintain my fearlessness, the basis of my self-worth. I still went outside, but I was terrified. A creak overhead meant a branch was about to crush me, clouds gathering over a distant peak meant a lightning strike. I camped at an alpine lake and lie awake in my tent, picturing yellow eyes watching from the trees. I never got back in my kayak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More distressing than this new timidness were the dissociative episodes that started shortly after the accident. Multiple times each day I would find myself drifting out of reality, wondering how everyone was coping after my death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My final thought before losing consciousness had been accepting my own death, and part of my brain still existed in the space where I never woke up. I’d stare at my hands in yoga, splayed like pale starfish on the mat, and wonder what flowers my mom had chosen for my memorial. A stab of anguish as I walked to the mailbox: had my little cat been brought back to the animal shelter, or had one of my friends taken him in? Then I’d blink and be back in yoga class or standing in front of my mailbox with the key held limply in my hand.</p>



<p>These flashes of dissociation became more frequent. I had to remind myself every day that I hadn’t died—I still lived in my house with the flowering perennial bed and mismatched thrift-store furniture. My family hadn’t gathered in Montana to sort out the accumulation of debris that made up my life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seemed too dramatic to call it PTSD. Was I so fragile that a few minutes underwater had such an impact?&nbsp; I didn’t even know if the accident could be classified as a near-death experience. I hadn’t seen the light at the end of a tunnel or felt myself leaving my body. I hadn’t even needed to be resuscitated—hypoxia caused me to plummet into unconsciousness, but as soon as I reoxygenated, my body started to function and I could breathe on my own. I felt weak and fragile, unable to quantify what was happening and too ashamed to confront the poor decisions that led me there.</p>



<p>Despite my denial, what was happening to my brain <em>was</em> a form of dissociation from the traumatic event, and a noted element of PTSD. People who have come close to death report more dissociative responses than other trauma survivors, and while the episodes typically do eventually fade, the more I tried to pretend I was OK, the longer they would last.</p>



<hr>



<p>It took weeks to tell my family what had happened, and I did it in a rush through the crackly Bluetooth connection on my way to the grocery store.</p>



<p>“I had a close call kayaking a few weeks ago,” I told my mom, rattling through the bullet points before she could interject. <em>Hit a downed log, flipped my boat, trapped underwater, my friend got to me in time, it was fine.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>She responded, slowly, but I wasn’t listening. The words I wanted to say felt lodged in my throat, and I ran them through my head like dialogue with the mic cut off.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<em>I don’t kno</em><em>w if I’m dead or alive. Every night I wake up feeling like I’m suffocating and if a loud room goes quiet I have a panic attack. I’m sad and scared and I don’t know why I didn’t die or if there’s a reason I survived and why I ignored all of the risk and almost killed myself.</em></p>



<p>I didn’t say any of that, but I did surprise myself by blurting out an apology before I hung up.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry,” I said, horrified as I got choked up. “I love you guys and I won’t do anything stupid like that again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kadin was the only one I thought I trusted to talk about it, though when he finally called me one evening a few weeks later, I still couldn’t drop my veneer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just think . . . you know . . . you could have died, and I’m sorry,” he said. “It really scared me seeing you not come up for air, and I don’t know how to talk about it and I’m sorry I brought you out there.” I paced around in my kitchen, holding my phone at arm’s length like I could be electrocuted through the speaker.</p>



<p>I fumbled a response, still managing not to say anything honest or raw. <em>I’ll thank him later, </em>I told myself, <em>when I tell him what’s been going on in my brain. Maybe he’s going through the same thing.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>After that conversation we settled into a quiet understanding: two guarded people who had narrowly escaped a serious consequence.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once we established a different rapport, I saw a lot of Kadin. What would have thrilled me before (acceptance) was now a relief (someone who understood).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We climbed together and took long drives into the mountains. We hiked picnic food up to a remote lake, and once we recovered the kayaks from the river, I stored them both in my garage. I felt deeply connected to him, though I fought the idea since he was still the enigma that kept me chasing the end of a string, picking at the knot to see if it could be unraveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No one else heard the noise I made as the air came back into my lungs. No one else had beached their boat and swam toward me as alpine runoff deadened their limbs. No one else kept their eyes on my upside-down boat and no one else risked the current and strainers to drag an unconscious girl out of a kayak. If he’d waited another few beats, missed the sandbar, not connected with my boat as the current carried him past, I would have died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You two have some sort of weird bond,” my friend muttered as I slide-tackled Kadin on the gym mats one day that fall.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I mean, he saved my life.” At that point, she knew to nod and not ask me to elaborate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was still Kadin, though, trauma bonded or not. He’d disappear for a month at a time, not return my calls, skip our planned yoga classes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My brain had reached more of an equilibrium by then. I still drifted in and out of reality, wondering who had taken over my house and which one of my friends had my cat. But I’d just smile apologetically to whoever I was with as I startled back to reality.</p>



<p>“Sorry, can you repeat that? I was spacing out.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>Fall rolled into winter and our boats hadn’t left my garage. I brushed off the cobwebs and hung them on hooks, telling myself I’d talk to Kadin in the spring and confront the accident, possibly ask if he wanted to take the roll clinic with me. I’d feel safer with him there. Maybe it would close the gap and allow me to move on.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I spent that winter trying to understand the event from a clinical perspective.</p>



<p>I replayed the accident obsessively in my head, ashamed at my choices while trying to understand where they’d come from. I blamed my personality, I blamed living in a mountain town, I blamed incorrect risk perception after too many close calls, I blamed wanting to impress Kadin. If I could create a flowchart of decisions and personality traits that led me to the river that day, I would guarantee that it never happened again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I knew my reduced risk inhibition came from too many narrow escapes, and having a more experienced partner had created an “expert halo” that tipped the adventure-experience scale to a dangerous imbalance. At the same time, I hadn’t been looking to push my limits like the sensation-seeking personalities I kept reading about, people who needed big thrills to feel things. Those people often have lower trait anxiety, which means they feel less anxious in day-to-day life. While I loved being outside and did seek certain types of adventure, I have always had high anxiety and didn’t <em>enjoy</em> the feeling of fear. I’d just learned to ignore it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I talked to Jerry Johnson, a professor in town who researches backcountry risk assessment. Nothing about my story seemed to surprise him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You wonder how these accidents don’t happen more frequently in towns like this, where the bar is so high,” he said. “You’re responding to social cues. How you perform in these sports contributes to your self-worth and value. You want to be able to keep up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I nodded, slowly. He was so matter-of-fact. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear, but it was the truth. I wasn’t a thrill seeker; I was someone who wanted to fit in and was scared of being left behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain split was the other major element I wanted to untangle. The dissociative episodes were still part of my life on a near-daily basis, but that winter, no one I spoke to had any idea what I was talking about.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” a counselor said over the phone. “I’ve never heard of anything like that.”</p>



<p>Eventually, long after my initial outreach, I heard back from another counselor I reached out to. Not for therapy, but for more information about this split. Parker Schneider specializes in acute and complex trauma, and has a background in adventure-based programming. They offered precise, pertinent feedback about what I was describing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Near-death experiences are almost always traumatic and can be incredibly profound,” Schneider said. “[They leave] the nervous system grappling with processing the intense emotions and sensations involved in the experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schneider seemed familiar with what I had been experiencing, and told me that dissociation can be a way for someone to get through during the near-death experience (NDE), as well as a way to cope afterward while the brain works to integrate the experience.</p>



<p>“After an NDE, dissociation might manifest as the mind alternating between different perceptions of reality,” Schneider told me. “This could involve oscillating between a reality in which an individual survived the event and one in which they died.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between this measured explanation of my lapses in reality, and Johnson’s quiet understanding of my need to keep up, I felt more tethered to reality. I also felt like I could begin to forgive myself.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>It was January, eight months after the accident, and Kadin had bailed on another yoga class. I was bristling, tired of his flakiness and though I didn’t want to admit it, stung by the perceived rejection.</p>



<p>I had just gotten home when a mutual friend called.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mags, you’re going to want to go to the hospital. It’s Kadin. I thought you’d want to know.”</p>



<p>I wasn’t part of Kadin’s primary friend group, so I wasn’t included in the communications from the past few days. The only thing I knew was that he was in the hospital and he wasn’t going to make it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I drove across town in a hysterical frenzy, racing through wing after wing until I found the right room. I grabbed his hand in the hospital bed, dissolving into despair and guilt. He was in front of me—his curly sandy-colored hair and climbers’ forearms and calf tattoo—but inaccessible. I sobbed and thanked him and apologized for not saying it enough. I said everything I’d wanted to say since May but it was too late, he couldn’t hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I pictured him swimming the current to my boat, releasing the spray skirt and grabbing me under the arms to pull me out, the countdown clock also running through his head. <em>How long has she been underwater?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had been inches from him, unconscious in my boat in that liminal space between life and death. And now, here he was in front of me, in between but already gone. There was no current to swim and I couldn’t pull him out of a boat and bring him to the surface. My time stretches into the future but his is over.</p>



<p>This is what he knew: he knew he saved me from drowning, that I cared about him, that we were trauma bonded and that maybe I loved him for saving me. But I was too mired in regret and terror to tell him that when I woke up suffocating in my sleep, then realized I could breathe, the panic gave way to gratitude for being alive.</p>



<p>I am sorry for my choices and grateful for my second chances. I’ve never gone back on that river and I’ve never truly untangled the web of decisions that made me agree to go boating that day. Maybe someday I’ll be able to face it. Until then, I accept that fear helps protect me and I appreciate every day for being one I didn’t think I’d have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been five years. Both of our boats still hang from hooks in my garage. Every few months I clear off the cobwebs.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><time datetime="2024-04-16T19:21:08-0400">Tuesday April 16, 2024</time> <span>[<a href="https://jerry.wtf/tags/blog">blog</a>]</span></p>
  <p><img src="https://jerry.wtf/img/potions.jpg" alt="Potions"></p>
<p>I find that when I play RPG games, I often hoard single-use items like potions and scrolls, saving them for some future critical moment. I finish games like Skyrim with a backpack full of unspent resources, reserved for a crisis that never actually arrives. What’s the point, then, of all these items?</p>
<p>Just like I save items in games, in real life I too am reluctant to ask for favors or promote my own projects. (Sometimes I even save all my favourite treats and I never eat the last one). I treated these social and professional resources as if they were single-use “magical items”, not to be wasted but reserved for some important-yet-undefined future magnum opus event.</p>
<p>Recently I played Baldur’s Gate 3 and I decided to try something new: I would actually <em>gasp</em> use my items as needed, as they were intended, without undue reservation. Not only was it actually <em>fun</em> to use my fireball scrolls and blow stuff up, but I also discovered new layers and hidden quests. For instance, using a ‘Speak with the Dead’ scroll on a certain suspicious corpse unveiled a questline I would have otherwise missed.</p>
<p>With the same mindset, I’ve been trying to adjust in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>To my surprise, these actions didn’t exhaust my social or professional capital; instead, they allowed me to derive benefits and opened new avenues, much like in the game. A friend forwarded my resume within their network, and my posts connected me with others who shared my interests.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s far more important in life that you use the resources available to you, because you’re on a clock. You need to optimize for your gains wherever you can take them, before you or your resources expire.</p>
<p>And remember, people in your life actually want to help you. They also stand to benefit, and any sort of social capital isn’t necessarily “single-use”, more like “on a cooldown”, able to be requested again after a suitable delay or returning a favor.</p>
<p>Resources, whether in games or in life, are meant to be utilized. Hoarding them out of fear of depletion prevents us from discovering new opportunities and connections. That’s a scarcity mindset that we don’t need to employ. Life thrives not on conservation but on strategic and bold usage of what we do have.</p>
<p>We should not view our capabilities and opportunities as limited-use potions to be saved for the perfect moment. Instead, we should see them as tools (sometimes with a cooldown) and aptly use them to unblock ourselves and move ahead whenever possible, in the very short time that we have on Earth.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="bEWGdV">If you’re a millennial, you may remember that specific moment in time around the late 2000s when streaming video technology had just gotten good but there weren’t that many legitimate streaming platforms available yet. So if you were a student without a TV and you wanted to watch a show, you would go to a website that aggregated lists of illegal streams. </p>
<p id="L5SnQB">It would be covered in banner ads and autoplaying video ads decorated with little play button arrows, and in order to watch your show, you would have to solve the puzzle of figuring out which play button to click that would actually get you to your show instead of spiriting you away to a website that sold upsetting porn or amateurish video games. It could be done, but you had to be paying attention, and you had to have the barest modicum of web savvy to do it right.</p>
<p id="RJPlOm">Right now, navigating the ebook and audiobook marketplaces is like being back on those sites. There are a thousand banner ads larded with keywords, and they’re all trying to get your clicks.</p>
<p id="qwH07V">Take, for example, when tech journalist Kara Swisher’s <em>Burn Book</em> came out this February. A host of other books hit the Kindle store along with it. They all had bizarre, SEO-streamlined titles, like those new businesses that are named <a href="https://searchengineland.com/near-me-searches-local-seo-optimize-or-avoid-385227">Plumbing Near Me</a> to game the <a href="https://www.vox.com/google" data-source="encore">Google</a> algorithm. </p>
<p id="cHXibO">“I found ‘Kara Swisher: Silicon Valley’s Bulldog,’ and ‘Kara Swisher Book: How She Became Silicon Valley’s Most Influential Journalist,’ and ‘Kara Swisher Biography: Unraveling the Life and Legacy,’ by a ‘guy’ who ‘wrote’ four biographies this month,” <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/03/2024/semaforum-kara-swisher?utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=intel&amp;utm_source=newslettercta">said Ben Smith when he interviewed Swisher for Semaforum</a>. </p>
<p id="hsA8kl">Swisher was less than flattered by the biographies. “I wrote [<a href="https://www.vox.com/amazon" data-source="encore">Amazon</a> CEO] <a href="https://www.vox.com/andy-jassy" data-source="encore">Andy Jassy</a> and I said, ‘You’re stealing my IP! What is going on?’” <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/03/2024/semaforum-kara-swisher?utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=intel&amp;utm_source=newslettercta">she told Smith</a>. (Disclosure: Swisher works for <a href="https://corp.voxmedia.com/" data-source="encore">Vox Media</a>.) </p>
<p id="E7KAS5">Here is almost certainly what was going on: “Kara Swisher book” started trending on the Kindle storefront as buzz built up for Swisher’s book. Keyword scrapers that exist for the sole purpose of finding such search terms delivered the phrase “Kara Swisher book” to the so-called biographer, who used a combination of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/28/23702644/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-technology" data-source="encore">AI</a> and crimes-against-humanity-level cheap ghostwriters to generate a series of books they could plausibly title and sell using her name. </p>
<p id="nRgNut">The biographer in question was just one in a vast, hidden ecosystem centered on the production and distribution of very cheap, low-quality ebooks about increasingly esoteric subjects. Many of them gleefully share misinformation or repackage basic facts from WikiHow behind a title that’s been search-engine-optimized to hell and back again. Some of them even <a href="https://janefriedman.com/i-would-rather-see-my-books-pirated/">steal the names of well-established existing authors</a> and masquerade as new releases from those writers. According to the Authors Guild, it would be impossible for anyone but Amazon to quantify these books — and that’s not information Amazon is sharing.</p>
<p id="OOWtfd">All of this means that to buy the book you want — to buy Kara Swisher’s <em>Burn Book</em> instead of <em>Kara Swisher Book: How She Became Silicon Valley’s Most Influential Journalist</em> — you have to know what you’re looking for and pay a modicum of attention to your purchase. </p>
<p id="Se5L2w">Who wants to do that? Especially in a marketplace like Amazon, where we are trained to buy quickly and thoughtlessly with a single click and where writers have been trained to send their wares without even thinking about it because where else are you going to sell an ebook.</p>
<p id="xa5P1k">It’s so <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a45751827/make-a-living-as-a-writer/">difficult for most authors to make a living from their writing</a> that we sometimes lose track of how much money there is to be made from books, if only we could save costs on the laborious, time-consuming process of writing them. </p>
<p id="pAsCtu">The internet, though, has always been a safe harbor for those with plans to innovate that pesky writing part out of the actual book publishing. On the internet, it’s possible to <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet-books/2010/04/retyping-an-entire-book-is-one-thing-cutting-pasting-an-entire-book-is-another">copy text from one platform</a> and paste it into another seamlessly, to <a href="https://bookriot.com/how-easy-is-it-to-pirate-books/">share text files</a>, to build <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/books3-ai-meta-llama-pirated-books/675063/">vast databases of stolen books</a>. If you wanted to design a place specifically to pirate and sleazily monetize books, it would be hard to do better than the internet as it has long existed. </p>
<p id="AkXCaQ">Now, generative AI has made it possible to create cover images, outlines, and even text at the click of a button. </p>
<p id="2eQMx7">If, as they used to say, everyone has a book in them, AI has created a world where tech utopianists dream openly about excising the human part of writing a book — any amount of artistry or craft or even just sheer effort — and replacing it with machine-generated streams of text; as though putting in the labor of writing is a sucker’s game; as though caring whether or not what you’re reading is nonsense is only for elitists. The future is now, and it is filled with trash books that no one bothered to really write and that certainly no one wants to read. </p>
<p id="a5tdKa">The saddest part about it, though, is that the garbage books don’t actually make that much money either. It’s even possible to lose money generating your low-quality ebook to sell on Kindle for $0.99. The way people make money these days is by teaching students the process of making a garbage ebook. It’s grift and garbage all the way down — and the people who ultimately lose out are the readers and writers who love books.</p>
<p id="B4z57j">None of this is happening through any willful malice, per se, on the part of the platforms that now run publishing and book-selling. It’s happening more because the platforms are set up to incentivize everything to cost as little as possible, even if it’s garbage. </p>
<p id="sIe1Uj">In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Ashley Vanicek said, “We aim to provide the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience, and we are constantly evaluating developments that impact that experience, which includes the rapid evolution and expansion of generative AI tools.” </p>
<p id="lxPBZv">Yet the garbage books predate the problem of AI. Here’s how they get made in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="nmmNPM">The scammy underbelly of online self-publishing</h3>
<p id="t3KgBi">These days, the trash ebook publishing landscape is fully saturated with grifters. There are blogs that talk about the industry, but they tend to be <a href="https://www.scamrisk.com/publishing-life-reviews/">clickbait sites</a> riddled with SEO keywords and affiliate links back and forth between each other. Virtually every single part of the self-publishing grift world that can be automated or monetized has been automated and monetized.</p>
<p id="cwMsmw">If you look a few years back, however, you find a very different landscape. In the internet of the early 2010s, lots of people were excited about making money with trash ebooks and trash audiobooks, but they weren’t yet all trying to scam one another on top of their eventual readers. They wrote real blogs about the process of the grift with their real human voices. They distinguished between schemes that were “white hat” (following the rules) and “black hat” (violating some terms of service). They compared strategies and teachers of strategies.</p>
<p id="NkivTh">According to the blogs of the era, one of the most infamous teachers was a man who went by Luca de Stefani, or Big Luca. <a href="http://www.leveluplifestyle.net/self-publishing-revolution-by-luca-de-stefani-review/">Legend had it</a> he held the world record for making the most money using Kindle Publishing in a single day. What set Big Luca’s Self Publishing Revolution course apart from the rest — Big Luca’s “black hat breadwinner video lesson,” <a href="https://www.freedomboundbusiness.com/self-publishing-revolution-review/">per one review</a> — was that he gave his students access to a secret Facebook group where self-publishers organized review swaps and buys.</p>
<p id="ekPspX">For the self-publishing grift, good reviews are crucial. The more five-star reviews a book has, the more likely Amazon’s algorithm is to push it toward readers. If you’re mostly publishing trash books, you’re not going to get tons of five-star reviews organically. Big Luca’s Facebook group gave grifters a place to offer to swap five-star reviews or sell five-star reviews for $0.99 a pop. As far as Amazon’s algorithm was concerned, there was no difference between that kind of review and the one a real reader might leave. The results were extremely lucrative.</p>
<p id="6XGe05">Luca didn’t invent this formula. He learned it from the OG <a href="https://www.freedomboundbusiness.com/self-publishing-revolution-review/">self-publishing grift course K Money Mastery</a>, now apparently defunct, where he excelled. </p>
<p id="DHSExt">Eventually, Big Luca had wrung all the money he could from the self-publishing hustle. He climbed up to the next level of the pyramid and became a teacher, and in 2016, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/8ykdse/has_anyone_tried_the_self_publishing_revolution/">the lore goes</a>, a man named Christian Mikkelsen enrolled in Big Luca’s Self Publishing Revolution.</p>
<p id="y5Whhu">The Mikkelsen twins are named Christian and Rasmus, and they are 28 years old. They have dark blond hair and blue eyes and meticulously groomed facial hair, and they always seem to be posting to <a href="https://www.vox.com/instagram-news" data-source="encore">Instagram</a> from luxurious private pools that are also somehow exotic beaches. They have managed, in what must be fairly acknowledged as a feat of branding wizardry, to hold on to the domain Publishing.com, and there they peddle their wares: a course they say can help students make a lifetime of easy cash off the revenue from books they don’t even have to bother to write themselves. If they happen to land a student who wants to write a book in good faith and just doesn’t understand how to sell their book on their own, well, they’re happy to take money from that student, too. </p>
<p id="9yRxdA"><a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/eric-hagerman/how-mikkelsen-twins-built-a-50-million-a-year-business-around-one-product.html">According to a profile in Inc.</a>, Christian found his way into the self-publishing world by googling “how to make money online.” His first book was a brief ebook titled <em>How to Be a 4.0 Student in College, Like Me</em>. Big Luca’s method apparently served him well enough that he thought it would be worthwhile to bring his twin Rasmus into the fold. </p>
<p id="TYdZXS">Together, the <a href="https://youtu.be/biYciU1uiUw?t=1295">Mikkelsens published trash book after trash book</a>, guides to keto and sex and crystals. Then they started running their manuscripts through Google Translate to start selling foreign language editions, an innovation on the old grift that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PhoenixFire144/">bumped their income into six figures</a> and, after a few months, got Amazon to block their publishing account. The time had come, <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/eric-hagerman/how-mikkelsen-twins-built-a-50-million-a-year-business-around-one-product.html">as Inc. would put it</a>, to “do what entrepreneurs do”: pivot. They started a <a href="https://www.vox.com/youtube" data-source="encore">YouTube</a> channel so they could teach the business of self-publishing to anyone else who wanted to learn. Six months and 1,000 subscribers later, they launched their first paywalled online course. </p>
<p id="uZVSzg">First it was called Audiobook Impact Academy. Then it was Publishing Life. Now, with AI an ever-more-fashionable buzzword, it’s AI Publishing Academy. It’s always more or less the same method, with a few new tweaks in every new iteration. But the method doesn’t change as much as you might think.</p>
<h3 id="sOnZ0D">How the garbage books get made: A case study</h3>
<p id="tXzRNS">If you want to take the Mikkelsen course, the first thing you do is sit through their sales pitch. It runs for two hours, and it’s just a video of Christian sitting in a dark room, drinking thirstily from a water bottle as he shows you screencaps of his students’ royalty checks and repeats that he is already rich; he doesn’t have to show you how to make this kind of money. He’s doing it for fun. </p>
<p id="hkTYi7">Christian’s offer is, he says, unbeatable. He will show you how to produce a book without having to write it. “What used to be the hardest part in the process — which was creating that book that you upload onto Amazon — is now the easiest part, and the most fun,” Christian explains. “Because AI can help do that for you.”</p>
<p id="fzo6Zk">Specifically, AI will write your outline for you. The twins feel that the quality isn’t there on purely AI-generated books yet; they demand better for their readers than AI prose. Still, they say using AI to outline saves their students weeks of researching their own manuscripts.</p>
<p id="LgZahW">That AI is part of but not central to the process is a helpful talking point for the Mikkelsens as Amazon strengthens its regulations against purely AI-generated text for sale. </p>
<p id="QXdsiA">“Last year we began requiring all publishers using our Kindle Direct Publishing service to provide information about whether their content is AI-generated and further reduced the total number of titles that can be published in a day,” said Amazon spokesperson Vanicek. Vanicek added that they have “a robust set of methods” to detect content that violates their guidelines, and they regularly remove those books and sometimes suspend the publishing accounts of repeat offenders.</p>
<p id="u6iVKv">“The thought of human creativity being overshadowed by <a href="https://www.vox.com/robots" data-source="encore">robots</a> isn’t exactly the prettiest picture,” Christian wrote in a (suspiciously ChatGPT-sounding) <a href="https://www.publishing.com/blog/how-does-ai-writing-work?">blog post</a> in March. “But we’re here to set the record straight. There are two camps of AI use out there: AI-generated and AI-assisted. They are completely different.” </p>
<p id="rZCp4A">In April, however, the Mikkelsens announced that they were preparing to launch a new proprietary AI program, Publishing.ai, that they promise will write a manuscript for you, “Soooo much faster than a ghostwriter!” </p>
<p id="XAtWaJ">Under the Mikkelsen model, you also don’t have to pick your own topic. They give you access to keyword scrapers that have pulled trending topics off Kindle and Audible.  And once AI is finished with your outline, you can send it over to a ghostwriter to turn into a book for a mere $500. For a 30,000-word book, that works out to a fee of $0.016667 per word. (The Mikkelsens work with a ghostwriting company developed by two former students. There, ghostwriters get hired on a freelance basis and are kept anonymous.) </p>
<p id="wKsgHj">Once you have your manuscript, Christian promises, the twins will show you how to hire audiobook narrators for a flat $20 fee by haggling their prices down. They’ll introduce you to a network of people who are generous with their five-star ratings and will push your book up the algorithmic Amazon rankings for you. All you have to do is sit back and collect your royalty checks as you rake in month after month of passive income. </p>
<p id="vcHlhB">As Christian talks, he seems to cast a kind of hypnotic spell. You start to wonder: “Am I stupid for not having invested in ebook publishing before now?” You see five-figure check after five-figure check. A ticking clock turns on. Christian wants to give you a special rate for the course. The course is worth $15,500. The regular price is $6,000. But he’s willing to give it to you for just $1,995 as long as you’re one of the first people to sign up after the webinar ends!</p>
<p id="14W5uD">None of what the Mikkelsens are describing here is illegal, but if you know the norms of publishing, you know it’s unethical. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biYciU1uiUw">documentarian Dan Olson</a> lays out in a lengthy 2022 deep dive into the Mikkelsens, their method of publishing means developing a book you’re probably not qualified to write. It used to mean paying a ghostwriter starvation-level wages to churn out a manuscript; now it means creating a book likely riddled with misinformation and minimal means of correcting it. It means deceiving readers with fake reviews. (That one can get you kicked off Amazon if you get caught.)</p>
<p id="NEiyDk">If you aren’t versed in publishing’s industry standards, however, the Mikkelsen model can seem incredibly attractive.</p>
<p id="yABemr">“I was like, ‘Yup, this would be great.’ I was totally vibing with it,” recalls Jennifer (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy), a 37-year-old in Virginia, who signed up for the twins’ course in September. She had recently written and self-published her own book on Amazon, but she wasn’t sure what to do to start promoting it. </p>
<p id="U1wPsB">The twins’ sales pitch struck her as the perfect solution: She could provide her ideas, people who were good with words could rewrite her draft and polish the whole thing up into a sales-ready package, and everyone would get paid. “I was like, ‘Okay, I’m ready to invest and make this a better thing.”</p>
<p id="nyKJmv">“It was a very efficient, friendly, interactive webinar,” recalls Cecilia (also not her real name), a Seattle-based 50-year-old who works in the health space. She signed up for the twins’ seminar in September, and she remembers being pleasantly won over by that two-hour sales pitch. It seemed to be so transparent. “It promoted trustworthiness,” she says. </p>
<p id="EWDAck">Once Jennifer and Cecilia had turned over their money for the course, both of them changed their minds fast.</p>
<p id="XtGKCh">“I started listening to the modules,” Jennifer says. “And I don’t know how else to describe them” — there is a long, expressive pause — “but as a jet stream of bullshit.”</p>
<p id="fjZmmh">“All it does is tell you to buy different products,” Jennifer recalls of the Mikkelsen course. “It’s like there’s nothing that they actually provide themselves, other than ‘Go buy other people’s products’ — and I’m sure they own those too, right?” (We can’t confirm that the Mikkelsens do own the products they recommend, but the ghostwriting company they work with <em>is</em> run by former Mikkelsen students.)</p>
<p id="soVflw">The course cost $2,000, but that wasn’t enough. To get a Mikkelsen-approved topic for your book, you had to pay for access to the software that analyzed Amazon keywords to tell you what was trending. To create the perfect outline, you had to pay for access to the AI that outlined and drafted your book for you. You had to pay for the cover design and for the reviewers. The $2,000 fee was supposed to guarantee you frequent one-on-one calls with a publishing coach, but the coaching calls were mostly about upselling to the premium $7,800 course, Jennifer says.</p>
<p id="9W4XoB">After a few weeks of phone calls, Cecilia decided she had had enough of the program and asked for her money back. She didn’t expect it would be a problem, since the course was advertised as fully refundable. Customer service reps then told her that, to qualify for a refund, she had to prove she’d sat through the whole course, published a book, and failed to make her money back. She says she had to threaten to call the attorney general before they sent her money back without such proof. </p>
<p id="C4J2sn">Jennifer wrote off her $2,000 as the cost of learning a bad lesson, but she wanted to warn other people against making the same mistake. She posted a negative review of Publishing.com on the user review site TrustPilot, where it has a 4.7 rating. So did Cecilia. Both of them found their reviews queried by TrustPilot, which required them to submit proof of going through the course in order to keep their reviews up. Most of the course’s five-star reviews, however, remain unverified. I reached out to some of the five-star TrustPilot reviewers to get their take on the Mikkelsens’ course, but I never heard back from any of them.</p>
<p id="fOFJnm">After the Mikkelsens’ course got big,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/gh23d7/mikkelsen_twins_scam/"> the rumors on Reddit say</a> Big Luca was furious that they’d ripped off his business model. He used to brag that he was going to drag them into court. Instead, he got out of the self-publishing game. </p>
<p id="QIbhsr">Now he runs a program called Big Luca International or, more informally, School for the Rich, <a href="https://www.biglucainternational.com/en/company/">self-described as</a> “the world’s leading company in online marketing training.” It’s supposed to teach you how to monetize any online business — the self-publishing black hat breadwinning tricks, extrapolated out to all the other industries of the internet. With the advent of AI, it’s easier than ever to flood the whole digital ecosystem with trash in pursuit of passive income.</p>
<h3 id="q4uV2N">The neverending grift</h3>
<p id="p8ZToN">“It sucks that I did this,” Jennifer says of her experience at AI Publishing Academy. “But I mean, it’s put some fire under my butt to do it [marketing] myself for my own books.” </p>
<p id="ZnUyKr">Jennifer didn’t set out to make a quick buck with a garbage ebook. She did the work of writing a book because she believed in it. The Mikkelsens got her because she couldn’t figure out how to sell her book on her own, and part of the reason she couldn’t sell it is because the marketplace is already so flooded with books. Many of which are garbage books.</p>
<p id="Vz0oQp">The Mikkelsens are not the chief villains of this story. They are small-time operators working one level of a very big grift industry. The grift is that technology and retail platforms have incentivized a race to the bottom when it comes to selling books. Together, without ever caring enough about the issue to deliberately try to do so, they have built a landscape in which it’s hard to trust what you read and hard to sell what you write.</p>
<p id="IvzxfT">The incentives of the modern book-selling economy for writers are to keep your costs low, low, low and your volume high, high, high, and definitely put your book on Amazon because where else are you going to sell an ebook? The incentive of the modern book-buying economy for readers is to go onto Amazon and lazily click around with a few search terms, and then buy the first book that looks right with the click of a single button. The incentives are, in other words, driving us all straight into a flood of garbage. </p>
<p id="VJOBa6">That’s what the grift does. It finds every spot in the process of making and selling a book that is inconvenient or laborious, and it exploits those spots. It exploits our cultural belief that books are meaningful, that writing a book is a valuable act, that reading a book will enrich your life. When it’s finished, you’re left with something that’s not a real book but a book-shaped digital file filled with nothing of any use to anyone at all. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-7785">

<p>If you’re a normal person — that is, a person who doesn’t obsessively follow the latest cryptography news — you probably missed last week’s cryptography bombshell. That news comes in the form of a new e-print authored by Yilei Chen, “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems</a>“, which has roiled the cryptography research community. The result is now being evaluated by experts in lattices and quantum algorithm design (<em>and to be clear, I am not one!</em>) but if it holds up, it’s going to be quite a bad day/week/month/year for the applied cryptography community.</p>



<p>Rather than elaborate at length, here’s quick set of five bullet-points giving the background.</p>



<p>(1) Cryptographers like to build modern public-key encryption schemes on top of mathematical problems that are believed to be “hard”. In practice, we need problems with a specific structure: we can construct <em>efficient</em> solutions for those who hold a secret key, or “trapdoor”, and yet also admit <em>no efficient solution</em> for folks who don’t. While many problems have been considered (and often discarded), most schemes we use today are based on three problems: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">factoring</a> (the RSA cryptosystem), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete logarithm</a> (Diffie-Hellman, DSA) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography">elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem</a> (EC-Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA etc.)</p>



<p>(2) While we would like to believe our favorite problems are fundamentally “hard”, we know this isn’t really true. Researchers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">have devised algorithms</a> that solve all of these problems quite efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time) — provided someone figures out how to build a quantum computer powerful enough to run the attack algorithms. <em>Fortunately such a computer has not yet been built!</em></p>



<p>(3) Even though quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to break our public-key crypto, the mere threat of <em>future</em> quantum attacks has inspired industry, government and academia to join forces <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">Fellowship-of-the-Ring-style</a> in order to tackle the problem right now. This isn’t merely about future-proofing our systems: even if quantum computers take decades to build, future quantum computers could break encrypted messages we send <em>today</em>! </p>



<p>(4) One conspicuous outcome of this fellowship is <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) competition</a>: this was an open competition designed to standardize<em> “post-quantum” cryptographic schemes</em>. Critically, these schemes must be based on different mathematical problems — most notably, problems that <em>don’t</em> seem to admit efficient quantum solutions. </p>



<p>(5) Within this new set of schemes, the most popular class of schemes are based on problems related to mathematical objects called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">lattices</a></em>. NIST-approved schemes based on lattice problems include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyber">Kyber</a> and <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/">Dilithium</a> (which I <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/11/30/to-schnorr-and-beyond-part-2/">wrote about recently</a>.) Lattice problems are also the basis of several efficient <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/01/02/very-casual-introduction-to-fully/">fully-homomorphic encryption</a> (FHE) schemes.</p>



<p>This background sets up the new result.</p>



<p>Chen’s (not yet peer-reviewed) <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">preprint</a> claims a<em> </em>new quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the “shortest independent vector problem” (SIVP, as well as GapSVP) in lattices with specific parameters. If it holds up, the result could (with numerous important caveats) allow future quantum computers to break schemes that depend on the hardness of specific instances of these problems. The good news here is that even if the result is correct, the vulnerable parameters are very specific: Chen’s algorithm does not <em>immediately</em> apply to the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">recently-standardized NIST algorithms</a> such as Kyber or Dilithium. Moreover, the exact concrete complexity of the algorithm is not instantly clear: it may turn out to be impractical to run, even if quantum computers become available.</p>



<p>But there is a saying in our field that <em>attacks only get better. </em>If Chen’s result can be improved upon, then quantum algorithms could render obsolete an entire generation of “post-quantum” lattice-based schemes, forcing cryptographers <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">and</a> <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">industry</a> <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">back</a> to the drawing board.</p>



<p>In other words, both a great technical result — and possibly a mild disaster.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned: I am neither an expert in lattice-based cryptography nor quantum computing. The folks who <em>are</em> those things are very busy trying to validate the writeup<em>:</em> and more than a few big results have fallen apart upon detailed inspection.<em> </em>For those searching for the latest developments, here’s a <a href="https://nigelsmart.github.io/LWE.html">nice writeup by Nigel Smart</a> that doesn’t tackle the correctness of the quantum algorithm (see updates at the bottom), but does talk about the possible implications for FHE and PQC schemes (TL;DR: bad for some FHE schemes, but really depends on the concrete details of the algorithm’s running time.) And here’s another <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/583.pdf">brief note on a “bug” that was found in the paper</a>, that seems to have been quickly <a href="http://www.chenyilei.net/">addressed by the author.</a></p>



<p>Up until this week I had intended to write another long wonky post about complexity theory, lattices, and what it all meant for applied cryptography. But now I hope you’ll forgive me if I hold onto that one, for just a little bit longer.</p>

Inside each of the two 'Thinking Rooms,' a single armchair is surrounded by thick curtains made of blue velvet — a nod to Lynch’s 1986 film Blue Velvet. 'At the beginning, there was only one big armchair inside the room. And I realised it was exactly like an image from one of his films,' says Monda of the scenography.</p><p>Above the chair, a series of brass tubes rise towards a curving gold ceiling. While around the perimeter, screens playing abstract videos act like portals to the outside world. According to Monda, Lynch posits the installation as a moment of respite and reflection from the frenetic pace outside on the Fiera floor. To construct the sets, Monda and Lynch worked with the set builders at Milan’s Piccolo Teatro.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1920-80.jpg.webp 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1600-80.jpg.webp 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1280-80.jpg.webp 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-768-80.jpg.webp 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-415-80.jpg.webp 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-360-80.jpg.webp 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-320-80.jpg.webp 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-320-80.jpg" alt="Interiors of David Lynch Thinking Room" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1920-80.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1600-80.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1280-80.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-768-80.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-415-80.jpg 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-360-80.jpg 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-320-80.jpg 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C.jpg"></picture></p></div><p>(Image credit: Courtesy of David Lynch and Salone del Mobile)</p></figure><p>'This the first time that I do these kinds of things and it was a lot of fun,' Monda reflects on the project.

You’re accustomed to seeing how Lynch works when he does a film like Blue Velvet or a show like Twin Peaks, but now his creativity, his talent and his vision are channelled into furniture.' However, Lynch was adamant that his new foray into design exists separately from his film career. 'He wants to keep it separated,' relays Monday.
