For me, it was the perfect match of focal range (<em>zoom</em>) and sensor size (<em>more light</em>) for any compact camera I've compared. </p><p>Because I'm only using this camera for a small range of events, it's just collecting dust in the meantime. </p><p>So, why don't <strong>use it as a webcam with my Macbook</strong>?</p><p>Admittedly, it did not cost me the $6300 from the article's title, much closer to $900. Nonetheless, everything I'm describing translates to every other Canon camera model!</p><h2>Problems Problems Problems</h2><p>I've tried this at first in 2024 with macOS 14, which did not work. I <a target="_blank" href="https://romanzipp.com/blog/fujifilm-webcam-x-macos-issues">had similar experience</a> with FUJIFILM's X Webcam software where either the camera will not get recognized by the software or the camera feed will freeze or simply be not available within other apps.</p><p>As of January 2025 with macOS 15 Sequoia, these issues have been resolved for me.</p><p>Well actually, only if you are able to <strong>download the software at all</strong>. Seems like their Microsoft IIS server is having some issues. The following error page will be presented to you, after they asked you for your full legal name and mail address - without which you can not download the software.</p>

                            <p>Software development isn’t free, and I’m happy to pay for software I use regularly. However, Canon is a hardware company, not a software company, and they should—due to the lack of standards—provide software that allows you to use their cameras as intended. Aside from development costs, there’s no justification for a subscription model, particularly from a company earning nearly <a target="_blank" href="https://global.canon/en/ir/finance/highlight.html">$3 billion in profit</a>.</p><h2>Why</h2><p>So Canon will not allow you, to use <strong><u>your own</u></strong> camera on <strong><u>your own</u></strong> computer with <strong><u>your own</u></strong> cables the way you intent to without paying for another subscription.</p><p>Canon, what the fuck?</p>

<p>In March 2024, a new AI company burst onto the scene with impressive backing: a $21 million Series A led by Founders Fund, with support from industry leaders including the Collison brothers, Elad Gil, and other tech luminaries. The team behind it? IOI gold medalists - the kind of people that solve programming problems most of us can’t even understand. Their product, <a href="https://devin.ai/">Devin</a>, promised to be a fully autonomous software engineer that could chat with you like a human colleague, capable of everything from learning new technologies and debugging mature codebases to deploying full applications and even training AI models.</p>
<p>The early demos were compelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/UTS2Hz96HYQ?si=Wid68ZqqibBuY34-">A video</a> showed Devin independently completing an Upwork bounty, installing and running a PyTorch project without human intervention.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The company claimed Devin could resolve 13.86% of real-world GitHub issues end-to-end on the SWE-bench benchmark - ~3x times better than previous systems. Only a select group of users could access it initially, leading to breathless tweets about how this would revolutionize software development.</p>
<p>As a team at Answer.AI that routinely experiments with AI developer tools, something about Devin felt different. If it could deliver even half of what it promised, it could transform how we work. But while Twitter was full of enthusiasm, we couldn’t find many detailed accounts of people actually using it. So we decided to put it through its paces, testing it against a wide range of real-world tasks. This is our story - a thorough, real-world attempt to work with one of the most hyped AI products of 2024.</p>
<section id="what-is-devin">
<h2>What is Devin?</h2>
<p>What makes Devin unique is its infrastructure. Unlike typical AI assistants, Devin operates through Slack and spins up its own computing environment. When you chat with Devin, you’re talking to an AI that has access to a full computing environment - complete with a web browser, code editor, and shell. It can install dependencies, read documentation, and even preview web applications it creates. Below is a screenshot of one way to initiate a task for Devin to work on:</p>

<figcaption>One way to initiate a task with Devin - through Slack</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The experience is designed to feel like chatting with a colleague. You describe what you want, and Devin starts working. Through Slack, you can watch it think through problems, ask for credentials when needed, and share links to completed work. Behind the scenes, it’s running in a Docker container, which gives it the isolation it needs to safely experiment while protecting your systems. Devin also provides a web interface, which also allows you to gain access to its envirnoment and watch it work with IDEs, Web Browsers and more in real time. Here is a screenshot of the web interface:</p>

<section id="early-wins">
<h2 data-anchor-id="early-wins">Early Wins</h2>
<p>Our first task was straightforward but real: pull data from a Notion database into Google Sheets. Devin tackled this with surprising competence. It navigated to the Notion API documentation, understood what it needed, and guided me through setting up the necessary credentials in Google Cloud Console. Rather than just dumping API instructions, it walked me through each menu and button click needed - saving what would typically be tedious documentation sleuthing. The whole process took about an hour (but only a few minutes of human interaction). At the end, Devin shared a link to a perfectly formatted Google Sheet containing our data.</p>
<p>The code it produced was a bit verbose, but it worked. This felt like a glimpse into the future - an AI that could handle the “glue code” tasks that consume so much developer time. Johno had similar success using Devin to create a planet tracker for debunking claims about historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn. What made this particularly impressive was that he managed this entirely through his phone, with Devin handling all the heavy lifting of setting up the environment and writing the code.</p>
</section>
<section id="scaling-up-our-testing">
<h2 data-anchor-id="scaling-up-our-testing">Scaling Up Our Testing</h2>
<p>Building upon our early successes, we leaned into Devin’s asynchronous capabilities. We imagined having Devin write documentation during our meetings or debug issues while we focused on design work. But as we scaled up our testing, cracks appeared. Tasks that seemed straightforward often took days rather than hours, with Devin getting stuck in technical dead-ends or producing overly complex, unusable solutions.</p>
<p>Even more concerning was Devin’s tendency to press forward with tasks that weren’t actually possible. When asked to deploy multiple applications to a single <a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> deployment (something that Railway doesn’t support), instead of identifying this limitation, Devin spent over a day attempting various approaches and hallucinating features that didn’t exist.</p>
<p>The most frustrating aspect wasn’t the failures themselves - all tools have limitations - but rather how much time we spent trying to salvage these attempts.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-deeper-look-at-what-went-wrong">
<h2 data-anchor-id="a-deeper-look-at-what-went-wrong">A Deeper Look at What Went Wrong</h2>
<p>At this point in our journey, we were puzzled. We had seen Devin competently handle API integrations and build functional applications, yet it was struggling with tasks that seemed simpler. Was this just bad luck? Were we using it wrong?</p>
<p>Over the course of a month, we systematically documented our attempts across these categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating new projects from scratch</li>
<li>Performing research tasks</li>
<li>Analyzing &amp; Modifying existing projects</li>
</ol>
<p>The results were sobering. Out of 20 tasks, we had 14 failures, 3 successes (including our 2 initial ones), and 3 inconclusive results. Even more telling was that we couldn’t discern any pattern to predict which tasks would work. Tasks that seemed similar to our early successes would fail in unexpected ways. <strong>We’ve provided more detail about these tasks <a href="#appendix-tasks-attempted-with-devin">in the appendix</a> below.</strong> Below is a summary of our experiences in each of these categories:</p>
<section id="creating-new-projects-from-scratch">
<h3 data-anchor-id="creating-new-projects-from-scratch">1. Creating New Projects From Scratch</h3>
<p>This category should have been Devin’s sweet spot. After all, the company’s demo video showed it autonomously completing an Upwork bounty, and our own early successes suggested it could handle greenfield development. The reality proved more complex.</p>
<p>Take our attempt to integrate with an LLM observability platform called <a href="https://braintrust.dev/">Braintrust</a>. The task was clear: generate synthetic data and upload it. Instead of a focused solution, Devin produced what can only be described as code soup - layers of abstraction that made simple operations needlessly complex. We ultimately abandoned Devin’s attempt and used Cursor to build the integration step-by-step, which proved far more efficient. Similarly, when asked to create an integration between our AI notes taker and <a href="https://spiral.computer/">Spiral.computer</a>, Devin generated what one team member described as “spaghetti code that was way more confusing to read through than if I’d written it from scratch.” Despite having access to documentation for both systems, Devin seemed to overcomplicate every aspect of the integration.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling was our attempt at web scraping. We asked Devin to follow Google Scholar links and grab the most recent 25 papers from an author - a task that should be straightforward with tools like <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>. This should have been particularly achievable given Devin’s ability to browse the web and write code. Instead, it became trapped in an endless cycle of trying to parse HTML, unable to extract itself from its own confusion.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-tasks">
<h3 data-anchor-id="research-tasks">2. Research Tasks</h3>
<p>If Devin struggled with concrete coding tasks, perhaps it would fare better with research-oriented work? The results here were mixed at best. While it could handle basic documentation lookups (as we saw in our early Notion/Google Sheets integration), more complex research tasks proved challenging.</p>
<p>When we asked Devin to research transcript summarization with accurate timestamps - a specific technical challenge we were facing - it merely regurgitated tangentially related information rather than engaging with the core problem. Instead of exploring potential solutions or identifying key technical challenges, it provided generic code examples that didn’t address the fundamental issues. Even when Devin appeared to be making progress, the results often weren’t what they seemed. For instance, when asked to create a minimal <a href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI</a> theme as an example, it produced what looked like a working solution. However, upon closer inspection, we discovered the theme wasn’t actually doing anything - the colors we were seeing were from the default theme, not our customizations.</p>
</section>
<section id="analyzing-and-modifying-existing-code">
<h3 data-anchor-id="analyzing-and-modifying-existing-code">3. Analyzing and Modifying Existing Code</h3>
<p>Perhaps Devin’s most concerning failures came when working with existing codebases. These tasks require understanding context and maintaining consistency with established patterns - skills that should be central to an AI software engineer’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Our attempts to have Devin work with <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a> projects were particularly revealing. When asked to migrate a Python project to nbdev, Devin couldn’t grasp even basic nbdev setup, despite us providing it access to comprehensive documentation. More puzzling was its approach to notebook manipulation - instead of directly editing notebooks, it created Python scripts to modify them, adding unnecessary complexity to simple tasks. While it occasionally provided useful notes or ideas, the actual code it produced was consistently problematic.</p>
<p>Security reviews showed similar issues. When we asked Devin to assess a GitHub repository (under 700 lines of code) for security vulnerabilities, it went overboard, flagging numerous false positives and hallucinating issues that didn’t exist. This kind of analysis might have been better handled by a single, focused LLM call rather than Devin’s more complex approach.</p>
<p>The pattern continued with debugging tasks. When investigating why SSH key forwarding wasn’t working in a setup script, Devin fixated on the script itself, never considering that the problem might lie elsewhere. This tunnel vision meant it couldn’t help us uncover the actual root cause. Similarly, when asked to add conflict checking between user input and database values, one team member spent several hours working through Devin’s attempts before giving up and writing the feature themselves in about 90 minutes.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="reflecting-as-a-team">
<h2 data-anchor-id="reflecting-as-a-team">Reflecting As A Team</h2>
<p>After a month of intensive testing, our team gathered to make sense of our experiences. These quotes capture our feelings best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tasks it can do are those that are so small and well-defined that I may as well do them myself, faster, my way. Larger tasks where I might see time savings I think it will likely fail at. So no real niche where I’ll want to use it. <em>- Johno Whitaker</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I had initial excitement at how close it was because I felt I could tweak a few things. And then slowly got frustrated as I had to change more and more to end up at the point where I would have been better of starting from scratch and going step by step. <em>- Isaac Flath</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Devin struggled to use internal tooling that is critical at AnswerAI which, in addition to other issues, made it difficult to use. This is despite providing Devin with copious amounts of documentation and examples. I haven’t found this to be an issue with tools like Cursor, where there is more opportunity to nudge things in the right direction more incrementally. <em>- Hamel Husain</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to Devin, we found workflows where developers drive more (like Cursor) avoid most issues we faced with Devin.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2 data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Working with Devin showed what autonomous AI development aspires to be. The UX is polished - chatting through Slack, watching it work asynchronously, seeing it set up environments and handle dependencies. When it worked, it was impressive.</p>
<p><strong>But that’s the problem - it rarely worked.</strong> Out of 20 tasks we attempted, we saw 14 failures, 3 inconclusive results, and just 3 successes. More concerning was our inability to predict which tasks would succeed. Even tasks similar to our early wins would fail in complex, time-consuming ways. The autonomous nature that seemed promising became a liability - Devin would spend days pursuing impossible solutions rather than recognizing fundamental blockers.</p>
<p>This reflects a pattern we’ve observed repeatedly in AI tooling. Social media excitement and company valuations have minimal relationship to real-world utility. We’ve found the most reliable signal comes from detailed stories of users shipping products and services. For now, we’re sticking with tools that let us drive the development process while providing AI assistance along the way.</p>

<td>Migrating data from Notion Into Google Sheets</td>
<td><span>Success</span></td>
<td>I told Devin to programmatically pull info from a Notion document into a Google Sheet. This was my very first project that I executed with Devin and it pulled it off nicely. Devin read notion and Google API docs by itself. Devin also navigated me to the Google Cloud console and provided me with instructions on all the different menus to click through which would have taken me quite a bit of time on my own! At the end, I was given a reasonable Python script that executed the task.</td>

<td>Generate synthetic data and upload it to Braintrust</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>I asked Devin to create synthetic data for a LLM observability platform called Braintrust that I wanted to test.</td>
<td>Devin created overly complex code that was hard to understand, and got stuck trying to fix errors. We ended up using Cursor to do this step by step in an iterative fashion.</td>

<td>Create an integration between two applications</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>I asked Devin to create an integration between Circleback, my AI notes taker, and Spiral.computer with pointers to the documentation of each.</td>
<td>I got really horrible spaghetti code that was way more confusing to read through than me trying to just write it from scratch. So I decided to not invest any more time in using Devin for this particular task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web scraping Papers By Following Google Scholar Links</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>I asked Devin to grab the most recent 25 papers from an author on Google Scholar programmatically using playwright, and if it encountered a paywall it was ok to skip that particular document.</td>
<td>Devin went into a rabbit hole of trying to parse HTML that it seems like it couldn’t get out of. It got stuck and went to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create minimal HTMX bulk upload example app</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>I asked Devin to read the HTMX documentation page for bulk edit example and with that and fake server code, create a minimal FastHTML version of the example for the FastHTML Gallery.</td>
<td>The example did not work and was not minimal. Devin used objects from the request object that didn’t exist and added many unnecessary things, like toasts (which also didn’t work), and inline css styling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create a DaisyUI Themes to match FrankenUI Theming</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>I asked Devin to create DaisyUI and highlight.js theming so that they match the frankenui themes and can be used in the same app seamlessly</td>
<td>Devin mapped daisyUI pre-existing themes to frankenui themes, but did they did not match well in many cases. It was also a ton of code changes that I didn’t understand and I ended up not using any of it because I was too confused to know what to do with it.</td>

Finally, I told it to write its findings in notebooks with small code snippets I could use to test.</td>
<td>Devin produced research notes in the form of a markdown file as an intermediate step to creating the notebook, which I did not ask it for. However, it was quite useful to see a step-by-step plan on how an implementation might come together. The code that it provided me in the notebook was not 100% correct, but it was useful as pseudocode to give me an idea of how I might glue this together. Given that this was more of a research project and I wanted just to know the general idea, I would call this a success.</td>

<tr>
<td>Research on Transcript Summarization With Accurate Timestamps</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>One issue that I face with summarizing transcripts is that I would love to have accurate timestamps that go with notes, so that I could use it for YouTube chapter summaries or similar. Concretely, it is not a problem to get accurate time-stamps from a transcript, But it’s difficult to associate timestamps with summaries because the timestamps often get bungled. So this is kind of an AI engineering research task.</td>
<td>Devin regurgitated related things to my problem but it did not tackle it did not do a good job of performing research or trying to tackle the problem I was trying to solve, and gave me pointers to code and examples that were not helpful.</td>

<tr>
<td>Create a minimal DaisyUI theme as an example</td>
<td><span>Failure</span></td>
<td>I asked Devin to create a minimal DaisyUI theme as an example. My goal was to get a starting point to start from since asking it to do it in a more complete way was unsuccessful.</td>
<td>Devin ignored the request to make it as a FastHTML app, and it took some back and forth to get it to go down that path. Eventually, it created an app that appeared to work with different button types. While it gave a link that looked good, once I tried modifying the theme, is became clear the theme was doing nothing. The other colors in the app were from the default theme. This is not a helpful starting point.</td>

Even though I gave it infomration to use XML tags to seperate examples, it didn’t. It added and pinned a specific version of the markdown package as a dependency and used that, instead of using the markdown2 package with is already used and was already a dependency. It did a bunch of pytest stuff and added a dep, even though the project doesn’t use pytest.</td>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you setup automatic disk unlocking with TPM2 and
<code>systemd-cryptenroll</code> or <code>clevis</code>? Then
chances are high that your disk can be decrypted by an attacker who
just has brief physical access to your machine - with some
preparation, 10 minutes will suffice. In this article we will
explore how TPM2 based disk decryption works, and understand why
many setups are vulnerable to a kind of filesystem confusion
attack. We will follow along by exploiting two different real
systems (Fedora + clevis, NixOS + systemd-cryptenroll).</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span># Examples commands used to enroll a key into the TPM. Whether your system is

</span></code></pre><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Most TPM2 unlock setups fail to verify
the LUKS identity of the decrypted partition. Since the initrd must
reside in an unencrypted boot partition, an attacker can inspect it
to learn how it decrypts the disk and also what type of filesystem
it expects to find inside. By recreating the LUKS partition with a
known key, we can confuse the initrd into executing a malicious
<code>init</code> executable. Since the TPM state will not be
altered in any way by this fake partition, the original LUKS key
can be unsealed from the TPM. Afterwards, the initial disk state
can be fully restored and then decrypted using the obtained
key.</p><p>You are safe if you additionally use a pin to unlock your TPM,
or use an initrd that properly asserts the LUKS identity (which
would involve manual work, so you'd probably know if that is the
case).</p><h2 id="the-idea-behind-tpm2-based-disk-decryption"><span><span><a href="#the-idea-behind-tpm2-based-disk-decryption" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-idea-behind-tpm2-based-disk-decryption">🔗</a></span>
The idea behind TPM2 based disk decryption</span></h2><p>The idea behind secure and password-less disk decryption is that
the TPM2 can store an additional LUKS key which your system can
only retrieve, if the TPM is in a predetermined, known-good state.
This state is recorded in the so-called Platform Configuration
Registers (PCRs), of which there are 24 in a standard compliant
TPM. Their intended use is described in the <a href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/linux_tpm_pcr_registry/">Linux TPM PCR Registry</a> but also neatly summarized as a table in
the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-cryptenroll.html"><code>systemd-cryptenroll(1)</code></a> man page.</p><p>These registers store hashes which are successively updated
while booting based on information like the bootlaoder hash, the
firmware in use, the booted kernel, initrd image and a lot more
things. By establishing a chain of trust through all components
involved in booting up to the linux userspace, we can ensure that
altering any component will affect one or several PCRs. Storing
data in the TPM requires you to select a list of PCRs and it will
ensure that the data can only be retrieved again if all of these
PCRs are in the same state as when enrolling the secret.</p><p>Several of these registers have an agreed-upon purpose and are
updated with some specific information about your system, such as
your board's firmware, your BIOS configuration, OptionROMs (extra
firmware loaded from external devices such as PCIe devices after
POST), the secure boot policy, or other things. Here's an excerpt
from the man page from above containing some of the registers that
are important to us:</p><table><thead><tr><th>PCR</th><th>Name</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>platform-code</td><td>Core system firmware executable code; changes on firmware
updates</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>external-code</td><td>Extended or pluggable executable code; includes option ROMs on
pluggable hardware</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>secure-boot-policy</td><td>Secure Boot state; changes when UEFI SecureBoot mode is
enabled/disabled, or firmware certificates (PK, KEK, db, dbx, …)
changes.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>system-identity</td><td>systemd-cryptsetup(8) optionally measures the volume key of
activated LUKS volumes into this PCR. systemd-pcrmachine.service(8)
measures the machine-id(5) into this PCR. systemd-pcrfs@.service(8)
measures mount points, file system UUIDs, labels, partition UUIDs
of the root and /var/ filesystems into this PCR.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Below this list, an interesting piece of information is given in
the man page about the intended use of PCRs for encrypted
volumes:</p><blockquote><p>In general, encrypted volumes would be bound to some combination
of PCRs 7, 11, and 14 (if shim/MOK is used). In order to allow
firmware and OS version updates, it is typically not advisable to
use PCRs such as 0 and 2, since the program code they cover should
already be covered indirectly through the certificates measured
into PCR 7. Validation through certificates hashes is typically
preferable over validation through direct measurements as it is
less brittle in context of OS/firmware updates: the measurements
will change on every update, but signatures should remain
unchanged. See the Linux TPM PCR Registry for more discussion.</p></blockquote><p>If you enroll your own secure boot keys and use a Unified Kernel
Image (UKI), then using just PCR 7 will be sufficient to ensure
integrity up to the point where we need to unlock our disk. Some
distributions instead ship EFI executables that are pre-signed with
the Microsoft keys, which allows them to enable secure boot by
default without requiring the user to generate and enroll anything
on their own. Since this also means that the user cannot sign their
kernel and/or initrd image, a trusted and pre-signed shim is often
used to measure the hash of the kernel and initrd before executing
them into PCR 9, which we would want to use in that case. Another
approach is to have the user generate a so-called Machine Owner Key
(MOK) if they want to sign something, in which case PCR 14 should
be used, too.</p><p>So the exact PCR selection may change a bit depending on the
user's setup. A quick <a href="https://github.com/search?q=cryptenroll+%2F0%5C%2B2%5C%2B7%2F&amp;type=code">search on GitHub</a> or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&amp;q=cryptenroll+0%2B2%2B7&amp;ia=web">on the internet</a> reveals that many people still opt to use
additional PCRs like 0 and 2 in addition to 7, which is of course
fine but may result in keys becoming inaccessible when the BIOS or
some firmware is updated - which can be annoying.</p><h3 id="a-common-vulnerable-setup"><span><span><a href="#a-common-vulnerable-setup" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-common-vulnerable-setup">🔗</a></span>
A common (vulnerable) setup</span></h3><p>If you already have secure boot set up, configuring TPM2 unlock
for your LUKS partition is usually very simple. Most guides will
resort to <code>systemd-cryptenroll</code> or <code>clevis</code>
which are different implementations that internally do some
variation of the following:</p><ol><li>Add a newly generated key to your LUKS partition</li><li>Seal this key in your TPM based on your selection of PCRs</li><li>Store the encrypted TPM context in the LUKS token metadata
which is required to unseal the secret at a later point in
time</li></ol><p>Both <code>clevis</code> and <code>systemd-cryptenroll</code>
can store tokens in other ways than a TPM2, for example using a
FIDO2 key. I found that <code>clevis</code> also supports
retrieving tokens from network resources, but other than that the
two tools are very similar in what they do.
<code>systemd-cryptenroll</code> just comes pre-packaged with
<code>systemd</code> so it is usually a bit simpler to use. Here is
an example:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-pcrs</span><span>=</span><span>7</span><span> --tpm2-device</span><span>=</span><span>auto /dev/nvme0n1p3
</span></code></pre><p>In theory, the disk is now properly protected, assuming the
kernel command line cannot be edited, right? It can only be
decrypted if PCR 7 is unchanged, and anything we would do to the
bootloader, kernel or initrd would affect PCR 7.</p><p>Well, of course, I wouldn't be asking if there wasn't a tiny
caveat: Assuming all disks were mounted properly, the initrd can be
certain that no code has been modified up to this point. But it
does <em>not</em> automatically ensure that the data on them is
authentic. As the very last step, the initrd will execute the
<code>init</code> executable of the real system, which usually
doesn't undergo any kind of signature check before it is executed.
And why would it have to - after all it is part of the encrypted
root partition which cannot be altered by an attacker.</p><h3 id="the-exploit"><span><span><a href="#the-exploit" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-exploit">🔗</a></span> The exploit</span></h3><p>First of all, it is important to know that the initrd will fall
back to a password prompt, if TPM unlocking fails for whatever
reason. A BIOS update could always cause the secure boot database
to be altered (thus invalidating PCR 7), or somebody makes a
mistake when updating the system and forgets to sign the kernel and
initrd properly. In such a case you don't want to be locked out
from your system completely, so asking for the password is a sane
thing to do.</p><p>But that also means if we replace the encrypted partition with a
new LUKS partition (for which we choose the password), then the TPM
decryption will fail and we will be asked for the password, which
we control. After entering the password, the initrd will now think
it has decrypted the partition correctly and proceed. If we manage
to put the correct kind of filesystem inside of our fake LUKS
partition so that the actual mounting succeeds, we can ship a
malicious <code>init</code> binary that now has full access to the
unlocked TPM, thus allowing us to decrypt the original filesystem,
which we would have to backup before creating our malicious
partition.</p><p>Now you might think the initrd can simply verify the filesystem
UUID before mounting it since we cannot read it from the disk, but
remember that anything the initrd knows is public knowledge, as the
boot partition and initrd image are not encrypted. So we can just
reuse the same LUKS UUID and filesystem UUID if necessary.</p><h3 id="securing-the-system"><span><span><a href="#securing-the-system" aria-label="Anchor link for: securing-the-system">🔗</a></span> Securing the system</span></h3><p>To solve this, we need to be able to authenticate all encrypted
volumes before accessing any file on them. In <a href="https://0pointer.net/blog/brave-new-trusted-boot-world.html">this
article</a> by Lennart Poettering from October 2022, where he
describes the state of secure boot in systemd, he mentions how the
process should look like to make the system secure. It is a bit
involved so let me reiterate the important part.</p><p>After a disk has been unlocked, we want to derive a value from
its volume key (the master key used to encrypt all its data) and
use this value to extend PCR 15. This ensures that any fake volume
would change this value since the original volume key cannot be
known. Using <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code> instead of
<code>cryptsetup</code> can already take care of this by adding
<code>tpm2-measure-pcr=yes</code> to the crypttab file.</p><p>If we now ensure that the disk decryption order is
deterministic, then we can compare the value in PCR 15 against a
known and signed value in the initrd. If the wrong value is
observed, the initrd can now abort the boot process before
executing anything malicious.</p><h3 id="many-broken-guides"><span><span><a href="#many-broken-guides" aria-label="Anchor link for: many-broken-guides">🔗</a></span> Many broken guides</span></h3><p>There are loads of guides that describe in more detail how to

systemd-cryptenroll)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, I did not find any guide that addresses this, so
most user setups are probably suffering from this issue. Though in
all fairness, whether this is an issue to you obviously depends on
your threat model. If you are using the TPM just to unlock your
home server which nobody else has physical access to, then maybe
this is a non-issue to you. But if you use this to protect the data
on your laptop against theft, then chances are you want to set a
TPM pin or implement PCR 15 verification as explained above.</p><p>Notably, I found that the ArchWiki entry of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-cryptenroll">systemd-cryptenroll</a>
acknowledges this issue in a warning near the end of the
article:</p><blockquote><p>Only binding to PCRs measured pre-boot (PCRs 0-7) opens a
vulnerability from rogue operating systems. A rogue partition with
metadata copied from the real root filesystem (such as partition
UUID) can mimic the original partition. Then, initramfs will
attempt to mount the rogue partition as the root filesystem
(decryption failure will fall back to password entry), leaving
pre-boot PCRs unchanged. The rogue root filesystem with files
controlled by an attacker is still able to receive the decryption
key for the real root partition. See Brave New Trusted Boot World
and BitLocker documentation for additional information.</p></blockquote><p>And while this is correct, just using any of the PCRs 8-23
doesn't automatically protect your data either. The initrd still
has to ensure that the respective PCR is changed before executing
the system's <code>init</code> binary, which is not done by
default.</p><h2 id="proof-of-concept-exploitation-of-a-fedora-machine"><span><span><a href="#proof-of-concept-exploitation-of-a-fedora-machine" aria-label="Anchor link for: proof-of-concept-exploitation-of-a-fedora-machine">🔗</a></span> Proof-of-concept exploitation of a Fedora machine</span></h2><p>Now, let's have a look at a real system which we will setup in a
similar way to how anyone else would have done it. I've picked one
of the Fedora articles above, but you can expect this to work for
all of the other distributions, too. In summary, my setup included
the following steps:</p><ul><li>Install Fedora 41, I chose an encrypted root with ext4 on
LUKS</li><li>Enable secure boot in the BIOS (and install the Microsoft keys
since Fedora is signed with those keys)</li></ul><p>An interesting thing we notice right away is that the Fedora
bootloader is signed using the Microsoft keys. We've already
briefly talked about this in the beginning, this means it cannot
sign the initrd at all. Instead, they have a signed shim that is
executed after the bootloader which will calculate hashes of the
kernel and initrd and extend PCR 9 with those values. Therefore, it
is critical that we now include PCR 9 in our selection when
enrolling the key to the TPM, otherwise the initrd could just be
modified.</p><p>This approach has the advantage that the user doesn't have to
deal with custom secure boot keys, but the downside is that every
kernel or initrd update will affect the value in PCR 9, thus
requiring us to re-enroll the key after rebooting on each system
update. Here is a snapshot of my PCRs when I enrolled the key into
the TPM. This is also the state that we need to reach later to
succeed.</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> systemd-analyze pcrs

</span></code></pre><p>Wow, this is looks like we already found all the important
information! Judging from the commandline syntax, this is likely an
initrd that was generated by dracut. There seems to be a LUKS
encrypted partition with UUID
<code>779328d5-00ca-4ade-be44-6daa549642ed</code> and a root file
system with UUID <code>1a887df4-286d-4842-bd66-d8993e8596d2</code>,
which is certainly inside of the LUKS partition. The type of
filesystem is not specified, so we are free to choose anything that
is supported by the initramfs for our fake.</p><h4 id="planning-our-exploit"><span><span><a href="#planning-our-exploit" aria-label="Anchor link for: planning-our-exploit">🔗</a></span> Planning our exploit</span></h4><p>In theory, we'd need to find out one additional thing - the
binary that will be called by the initrd when it want's to switch
to the real system. But the chances are very high that it is
<code>/sbin/init</code> (this is not the case on all systems
though, see the NixOS PoC below for an example). If our assumption
doesn't work out, we can still double check by extracting the
initrd later.</p><p>In order to confuse the initrd, we now need to:</p><ol><li>Backup the original LUKS parition so we can later decrypt
it</li><li>Replace the LUKS partition with a fake LUKS partition that has
the UUID <code>779328d5-00ca-4ade-be44-6daa549642ed</code></li><li>This LUKS partition must contain a filesystem with UUID
<code>1a887df4-286d-4842-bd66-d8993e8596d2</code></li><li>The inner filesystem contains a <code>/sbin/init</code> binary
that does what we want</li></ol><p>We may actually only backup the first few megabytes of the
original LUKS partition and make sure our fake partition is exactly
the same size as our backup. By overwriting just the beginning in
this way we don't have to do a full disk backup, which would
otherwise take a very long time and would require us to bring a
spare disk with us.</p><h4 id="backup-the-beginning-of-the-original-luks-partition"><span><span><a href="#backup-the-beginning-of-the-original-luks-partition" aria-label="Anchor link for: backup-the-beginning-of-the-original-luks-partition">🔗</a></span> Backup the beginning of the original LUKS partition</span></h4><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> dd if=/dev/nvme0n1p3 of=/boot/luks-original.bak bs=64M count=1
</span></code></pre><p>We'll abuse the free space on the boot partition to store this
backup, which makes it easy to access later. If you don't want to
tamper too much with the original disk, you can of course use a
small thumb drive.</p><h4 id="create-fake-partition-and-filesystem-with-matching-uuids"><span><span><a href="#create-fake-partition-and-filesystem-with-matching-uuids" aria-label="Anchor link for: create-fake-partition-and-filesystem-with-matching-uuids">🔗</a></span> Create fake partition and filesystem with matching
UUIDs</span></h4><p>Next, we create a <code>64MB</code> file in which we will
prepare our partition. The size is a bit arbitrary, it just needs
to cover the LUKS and inner filesystem header and must fit our
exploit binary. So we initialize a new LUKS partition with the UUID
from above, and then open it and format its contents with
<code>ext4</code>:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> truncate</span><span> -s</span><span> 64MB /root/fakeluks

</span><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> mount /dev/mapper/fakeluks /mnt/root
</span></code></pre><h4 id="prepare-filesystem"><span><span><a href="#prepare-filesystem" aria-label="Anchor link for: prepare-filesystem">🔗</a></span> Prepare filesystem</span></h4><p>Now we could theoretically prepare a tiny binary that directly
extracts the key from the TPM, but it's far simpler just put a
minimal Alpine image there and install the necessary tools to do
that manually. This will also easily fit into <code>64MB</code>.
Let's proceed by preparing the Alpine filesystem:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> cd /mnt/root
</span><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.21/releases/x86_64/alpine-minirootfs-3.21.2-x86_64.tar.gz

Overwriting the partition</span></h4><p>Finally, we unmount our fake filesystem and overwrite the first
<code>64MB</code> of the original partition with it, then put the
disk back into the original machine and reboot:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> umount /mnt/root
</span><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> cryptsetup close /dev/mapper/fakeluks
</span><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> sync
</span><span>[root@localhost]#</span><span> dd if=/root/fakeluks of=/root/luks-original.bak bs=64M count=1
</span></code></pre><p>We will now be asked for the LUKS password we just set, since
the automatic decryption will obviously not trigger on our fake
partition, which has no token metadata. After entering our password
from above, we are greeted by the Alpine image. We can login as
<code>root</code> without a password:</p><pre><code><span>Welcome to Alpine Linux 3.21

<code>systemd-analyze pcrs</code>, but we can see that all values
are the same as in the real system. Some boards may have different
values in PCR 1 after every power cycle, but don't worry, in that
case you can be sure that the owner didn't use it either. So this
means our attack was successful! We can now go ahead and retrieve
the volume key of the original partition.</p><p>By quickly skimming <a href="https://github.com/latchset/clevis/blob/0839ee294a2cbb0c1ecf1749c9ca530ef9f59f8f/src/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/clevis.in#L78">the clevis source</a> we find that it stores a JWE token in the

the partition. It also contains some metadata required to have it

will find that the NixOS initrd works a bit differently - it itself
is a kind of mini-NixOS. The important information is the
following:</p><ul><li>The mount commands for filesystems are in systemd units, which
usually use UUIDs, labels or partlables to identify disks. In our
case it will be partlabels, so we don't even have to fake any
UUIDs.</li><li>Once the initrd decrypts the root partition, it searches for
the toplevel derivation by resolving the
<code>init=/nix/store/&lt;hash&gt;-nixos-system-.../init</code>
path</li><li>This toplevel derivation contains a <code>prepare-root</code>

fake. We can reuse the same fake partition with the Alpine image as
on Fedora as it has the advantage of being very small. If the user
has <code>/nix</code> on a separate partition it may be simpler to
just build a small NixOS system and link the resulting toplevel
derivation to the path expected by the initrd.</p><p>Rebooting the original system with the modified disk will now
yield an Alpine root shell. After running <code>tpm2_pcrread</code>
we can verify that we have not changed any PCRs with our
modifications. To understand the differences of

continue with some more detail from here:</p><p>Once again we will inspect the LUKS header of our backup, which

Finally, we need to restore the original disk header and are then
able to decrypt the whole disk. We can either decrypt it by
specifying the volume key explicitly, or simply enter the obtained
password. Since this is exactly the same as on Fedora, I have not
included it here.</p><h4 id="crude-implementation-of-pcr15-verification"><span><span><a href="#crude-implementation-of-pcr15-verification" aria-label="Anchor link for: crude-implementation-of-pcr15-verification">🔗</a></span>
Crude implementation of PCR15 verification</span></h4><p>I've looked at all of this together with my friend <a href="https://github.com/patrickdag">@PatrickDaG</a>, who has quickly
written <a href="https://forge.lel.lol/patrick/nix-config/src/commit/ab2cb2b4d554040ce208fc60624fe729a9d5e32b/modules/ensure-pcr.nix">a NixOS module</a> which you can adapt to add a crude form of PCR
15 verification. Ideally we need something proper upstreamed into
nixpkgs, but ensuring the order of decryption is not super
simple.</p><h2 id="what-now"><span><span><a href="#what-now" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-now">🔗</a></span> What now?</span></h2><p>It's obviously a pity that the default initrd implementations
available on most distributions don't include a verification step
out of the box. But there's really nobody to blame here, as none of
the distributions advertise automatic TPM unlocking as a secure or
even supported configuration, and the guides I've linked to are
mostly blog posts from other hobbyists - who may just not have
known about this issue.</p><p><em>If you happen to have written about this before, please
update your post(s) to make your readers aware of the implications!
Thank you!</em></p><p>Unfortunately, I have also not found a simple solution that I
can recommend to you right now to actually fix the issue (except
for NixOS, <a href="https://oddlama.org/blog/bypassing-disk-encryption-with-tpm2-unlock/#crude-implementation-of-pcr15-verification">see above</a>). Enabling mandatory LUKS key measurement and PCR 15
verification in the initrd is just not something that is easily
available as a module or script right now (January 2025), so you'd
have to implement it yourself.</p><p>From what I learned when researching this, a proper
implementation would need to at least:</p><ul><li>Predict the value of PCR 15 value at initrd generation
time</li><li>Implicitly sign this value by adding it to the initrd</li><li>Extend PCR 15 at boot time with the volume key of every
decrypted LUKS volume, while ensuring in a deterministic decryption
order</li><li>Verify PCR 15 against the known and signed value
<em>before</em> utilizing any data from one of the the encrypted
disks</li></ul><p>The easiest way to protect your data right now is to bite the
bullet and add a TPM PIN, for example by using
<code>systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-with-pin=yes [...]</code> when
enrolling your key.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span><span><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">🔗</a></span> Conclusion</span></h2><p>We've successfully carried out a filesystem confusion attack on
two completely different systems to extract their secret volume
key, and have seen that the majority of articles about TPM2
auto-unlock setups are likely vulnerable to this attack.</p><p>We learned that this problem is not easily fixed, as it requires
an additional verification step that cannot simply be activated on
most distributions at present. It is critical to ensure that there
is an unbroken chain of trust from the bootloader to the actual
system.</p><p>Here is a checklist of things to consider when setting up TPM2
auto-unlock:</p><ul><li>Your kernel and initramfs are both signed and verified (UKI or
MOK), or you are using PCR 9 together with a shim that hashes the
images at boot time.</li><li>You have enrolled a LUKS key in the TPM2 on at least PCR 7 (+9
if necessary).</li><li>If you are decrypting multiple devices in the initrd, their
decryption order is deterministic.</li><li>After decryption - and before any user executable is called -
the initramfs verifies the identity of all encrypted disks,
preferably by measuring a derivative of the volume key into PCR 15
for each disk.</li><li>Your initrd's emergency shell (if any) is
password-protected.</li><li>Your bootloader does not allow you to alter the kernel command
line, or you've included a PCR used in the LUKS key enrollment that
depends on the kernel command line.</li></ul><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this article - I hope you
found it both interesting and enjoyable 😊.</p><hr><p>If you'd like to send me feedback or just reach out, feel free

to every problem are political or technological in nature</strong><span>: we can solve this or that politically, or with AI. That the private-sector can trigger crises that have no political or technological fix is on very few pundits' radar.</span></p><p><strong>Uninsurable risk is one such problem.</strong></p><p><strong>Like virtually all problems, it's been approached as a problem with a political solution:</strong><span> the state or federal government can force insurers to continue offering policies that put them on the hook for additional catastrophic losses, and / or become "insurers of last resort."</span></p><p><span>That neither is a solution to the actual problem is glossed over, because as a society, we've become accustomed to the idea that there is a political solution to all problems.</span></p><p><strong>So the California authorities have prohibited insurers from cancelling coverage within the fire zones:</strong></p><p><span>"</span><a href="https://x.com/EytanWallace/status/1877604821546697041" rel="">California Insurance Commissioner has issued a mandatory one-year moratorium</a><span> </span><em>that will prohibit insurance companies from enacting non-renewals and cancellations of coverage for home owners within the perimeters or adjoining ZIP Codes of the Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County regardless of whether they suffered a loss. The moratorium will expire on Jan. 7, 2026."</em></p><p><strong>As for becoming the "insurer of last resort," states are finding providing such coverage is a financial black hole:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/10/us/fires-los-angeles-california#the-wildfires-lay-bare-an-insurance-crisis-in-california" rel="">The wildfires lay bare an insurance crisis in California</a><span>.</span><br><em>"Even before this week’s wildfires, officials in the region had warned that the California FAIR plan, a state-run insurer of last resort that has increasingly become a main source of coverage for residents, was "one bad fire season away from complete insolvency."</em></p><p><em><span>The FAIR plan’s exposure soared by 61 percent year-on-year to $458 billion by the end of September, according to Mr. Heleniak. Driving that is the flight of insurers from the California market: Between 2020 and 2022, private insurers dropped coverage for 2.8 million home insurance customers, Mr. Heleniak wrote.</span><p><span>One problem for insurers and Californians: Unlike hurricanes, wildfires are harder to model, ratcheting up the risk."</span></p></em></p><p><strong>The problems being exposed do not lend themselves to tidy political / policy fixes that magically return the world to a past era of lower risks.</strong><span> Risks and losses cannot be extinguished, they can only be transferred to others. This is the intrinsic limit of political fixes: we take the risks and losses and transfer them to others lacking the political power to contest the transfer.</span></p><p><strong>Or we transfer the risks and losses to the entire system, increasing the potential for a systemic collapse.</strong></p><p><strong>Consider the realities of acting as the "insurer of last resort." </strong><span>The insurance industry is built on a foundation of a handful of re-insurance companies that provide insurance to insurers should losses overwhelm the expected norms.</span></p><p><span>If re-insurers decide not to offer coverage due to high risks or risks that cannot be estimated with any reliability, then the "insurer of last resort" is self-insuring all potential losses, meaning if the house will cost $500,000 to rebuild, $500,000 in cash must be kept in reserve, because there is no guarantee a lender will risk offering a mortgage without conventional insurance.</span></p><p><strong>If the state or federal government offers an open checkbook</strong><span>--we'll pay any and all losses, no questions asked--then those ultimately paying these astronomical bills--the </span><strong>taxpayers--will reasonably ask: why are we subsidizing people to rebuild in places that are clearly no longer habitable</strong><span> due to the probabilities of another fire, flood or hurricane?</span></p><p><strong>In other words, the entire idea of being an "insurer of last resort" is based on an unlimited supply of money</strong><span> to fund losses that no longer make financial sense. If rebuilding a house destroyed in a "100 year flood" once made sense, now that there's a "100 year flood" every five years, rebuilding in that locale no longer makes sense. So why should taxpayers absorb the costs of this selective blindness to the realities of rising global risks?</span></p><p><strong>This is not the first time climate change has impacted civilization in ways that are not visible to or accepted by those living through the transition.</strong><span> </span></p></div><div><p><span>The early 1600s were an era of global crises, conflict and collapse, largely driven by cooler weather that reduced crop yields and thus the caloric intake of people, leaving them more prone to succumbing to disease and more willing to overthrow their rulers. For their part, this made rulers more willing to risk war and make hasty, ill-advised decisions that accelerated the crises.</span></p><p><span>The book </span><a href="https://amzn.to/428wgHQ" rel="">Global Crisis: War, Climate Change and Catastrophe in the Seventeenth Century</a><span> by Geoffrey Parker offers a comprehensive overview of these dynamics.</span></p><p><strong>Another era in which risks rose without participants realizing that global circumstances were pressuring economies and societies adversely</strong><span> nearly brough the Roman Empire to its knees: the </span><em>Third Century Crisis, "a period in Roman history, spanning roughly from 235 to 284 AD, where the Roman Empire nearly collapsed due to a series of internal civil wars, barbarian invasions, economic instability, and a chaotic succession of emperors."</em></p><p><span>The emergence of polycrisis fueled by climate change and globalized trade (which delivers instability and pandemics along with goods) has been ably described by Kyle Harper, in this Smithsonian magazine article</span><br><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-climate-change-and-disease-helped-fall-rome-180967591/" rel="">How Climate Change and Plague Helped Bring Down the Roman Empire</a><span> </span><br><span>and in his 2019 book, </span><a href="https://amzn.to/4acrb3k" rel="">The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Ours is an era soaked in the hubris of "no limits":</strong><span> there are no limits on human ingenuity, and so there are no limits on what we can do in the real world. Limits are anathema in today's zeitgeist, and so the idea that Nature imposes limits that manifest as financial limits--go ahead and print $100 trillion to fund every "no limits" proposal, but that will destroy the value of all the "money" we're creating to fund "no limits"--is unacceptable.</span></p><p><span>In times less allergic to limits and more willing to face financial realities, people accepted that it made no sense to build more than seasonal shacks along coastlines prone to devastation. To give up permanent residences with air conditioning and all the luxuries of modern life because these no longer make financial sense is a taboo topic.</span></p><p><strong>I have long held that the world has been blessed with 60+ years of beneficial weather,</strong><span> and so we've been blessed with 60+ years of agricultural surpluses globally. It seems likely this era is ending, and we're as yet unprepared for this contingency: food might become not just scarce but chronically scarce. </span></p><p><span>As I've noted previously, diesel-fueled robots can roam the field zapping weeds with lasers, but what's the point of that technology if there's no rain or high winds and heavy rain destroyed the harvest? That there are limits on our technological powers is also taboo. </span><strong>Diesel doesn't deliver the right amount of rain, and neither does AI.</strong></p><p><strong>It wasn't coincidence that the Bastille was torn down just as the price of bread spiked to unaffordability.</strong><span> Scarcities, shortages, rising prices and the illusions of "no limits" all reinforce each other. And since the participants either don't grasp or refuse to accept the nature of the new era of rising risk, they seek scapegoats in what they do grasp: politics, policies, and the transfer of losses and risk to others. </span></p><p><strong>As I've often sought to explain, transferring losses and risk to the entire system seems to extinguish the risk by diluting it in a larger pool of resources.</strong><span> So the losses triggered by the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 were absorbed by the entire financial system and economy, pools of resources large enough to dilute the losses to the point that the illusion that the risk had vanished could be sustained.</span></p><p><strong>But risk isn't extinguished, it's only transferred, and how it manifests is based on complex interactions</strong><span>, dependency chains, over-optimization and the erosion of resilience. The risks of a global financial meltdown didn't vanish in 2009; those risks were transferred to the system as a whole, a transfer that continues to this day, as risk piles up in a systemic fashion few see, or dare to recognize.</span></p><p><strong>This same reluctance to recognize system risk is evident in global supply chains,</strong><span> the global food supply, and every other tightly bound, highly interconnected system we depend on.</span></p><p><strong>Is the world becoming uninsurable? The answer is yes, in two ways.</strong><span> One is the reality that much of what we take as our God-given right no longer makes financial sense, and eventually the costs of clinging onto a status quo that no longer aligns with real-world limits will have to be covered by taking resources and capital from something else we take as our God-given inheritance. </span></p><p><strong>It boils down to the classic scenario in which we want three things but are limited to choosing two.</strong><span> Once system risks start manifesting, we'll be reduced to saving one and sacrificing two. If we refuse to accept that triage, we'll end up saving nothing.</span></p><p><strong>The other way the world is becoming uninsurable is much of what we take for granted</strong><span>--abundant, affordable resources, products, food and fuel, for example--</span><strong>is not guaranteed, and cannot be insured by political or technological means.</strong><span> This won't stop us from pursuing the hubristic extremes of "no limits," but that pursuit will hasten the collapse made inevitable by transferring all risks to the system. The pool of resources is not infinite, and so the risks can no longer be diluted.</span></p><p><strong>Highlights of the Blog </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.oftwominds.com/blogjan25/swindle1-25.html" rel="">The Easy Credit, High Interest Rate Swindle</a><span> 1/9/25</span></p><p><a href="https://www.oftwominds.com/blogjan25/quit-burnout1-25.html" rel="">I Quit!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003780/">https://lwn.net/Articles/1003780/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731962">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
We are reliably informed by the calendar that yet another year has begun.
That can only mean one thing: the time has come to go out on a limb with a
series of ill-advised predictions that are almost certainly <i>not</i> how
the year will actually go.  We have to try; it's traditional, after all.
Read on for our view of what's coming and how it may play out.
</p><p>
<b>The extensible scheduling class (sched-ext) will be a game changer</b>.
Already we have seen, in 2024, how the ability to load a CPU scheduler from
user space as a set of BPF programs has unleashed a great deal of
creativity; that was before sched-ext was part of a released kernel.  In
2025, this feature will start showing up in more distributions, and more
people will be able to play with it.  The result will be a flood of new
scheduling ideas, each of which can be quickly tested (and improved) on
real systems.  Some of those ideas will result in specialty schedulers
included with focused distributions (systems for gaming, for example);
others, hopefully, will eventually find their way into the kernel's EEVDF
scheduler.
</p><p>
<b>Code written in Rust will land in the kernel at an increasing rate</b>
over the course of the year as a result of the increased availability of
abstractions and greater familiarity with the language in the kernel
community.  The Rust code that has been merged so far is mostly
infrastructure and proofs of concept; in 2025, we'll see Rust code that end
users will run — but they may never notice.  The number of unstable
language features needed by the kernel will drop significantly as those
features are stabilized by the Rust community.
</p><p>
<b>Another XZ-like backdoor attempt will come to light</b>.  Existing code
bases have been scoured for attacks similar to those used against XZ;
little has been found, but that does not mean that there are not other
ongoing efforts, using different techniques, out there.  The potential
payoff for a government agency or other suitably well-funded organization is
simply too high for all of them to ignore; somebody is surely trying
something.
</p><blockquote>
<b><tt>$ sudo subscribe today</tt></b>
<p>

access to all of LWN’s high-quality articles as soon as they’re
published, and help support LWN in the process.  <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/nst-sudo/claim">Act now</a> and you can start with a free trial subscription.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Increasingly, <b>single-maintainer projects (or subsystems, or packages)
will be seen as risky</b> by their users.  Security incidents like the XZ
backdoor attempt will be part of that, but a project with a single
maintainer is also subject to all of the other problems associated with
burnout and insufficient time to do the job properly.  Such a project will
never be as reliable as one would like.

</p><p>
<b>A major project will discover that it has merged a lot of AI-generated
code</b>, a fact that may become evident when it becomes clear that the
alleged author does not actually understand what the code does.  We depend
on our developers to contribute their own work and to stand behind it;
large language models cannot do that.  A project that discovers such code
in its repository may face the unpleasant prospect of reverting significant
changes.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, <b>we will see more focused efforts to create truly free
generative AI systems</b>, perhaps including the creation of one or more
foundations to support the creation of the models.  This work will include
a great deal of innovation focused on reducing the resources that these
models need, driven by the much lower level of resources available.  The
resulting code will help to increase the access to — and control over —
these systems, with unknown results; not everybody will use them for good
purposes.
</p><p>
We may also see <b>the launch of one or more foundations aimed specifically
at providing support for maintainers</b>.  Even companies that contribute
enthusiastically to free-software projects often balk at supporting the
maintainer role, despite the fact that projects don't work without
maintainers.  But perhaps some of those companies can be encouraged to
support a separate entity that promises to solve — or at least improve —
the maintainer situation for specific projects of interest.  The maintainer
role will still be severely under-supported at the end of the year, though.

</p><p>
<b>Foundations supporting free-software work will continue to struggle</b>
in 2025, though, continuing <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/993665/">the trend</a> seen
in 2024.  The coming year does not look like a time of increasing
generosity in general, so organizations that depend on the generosity of
others will have their work cut out for them.
</p><p>
<b>There will be more cloud-based products turned to bricks</b> by
manufacturers that go bankrupt or simply stop caring.  Surveillance and
data-breach problems with cloud-connected products will also happen with
discouraging regularity over the course of the year; see the stories on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/05/air-fryer-excessive-surveillance-smart-devices-which-watches-speakers-trackers">air-fryer
surveillance</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24332181/volkswagen-data-leak-exposed-location-evs">Volkswagen
electric-vehicle data leak</a> for recent examples.  Perhaps 2025 will be
the year when awareness of the downsides of extensive cloud connectivity
will become more widespread.  There is an opportunity for free-software
alternatives, such as <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home
Assistant</a>, to make inroads by demonstrating a better way to manage
personal data.  Truly taking advantage of that opportunity will require a
user focus that is not always our community's strong point, but one
can always hope.
</p><p>
As a corollary to the above, <b>more fully open hardware will become
available</b> in 2025.  The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/994961/">OpenWrt One</a>,
which hit the market in 2024, quickly sold out its initial production run.
There is clearly an appetite for hardware that can be truly owned by its
purchasers, and our community has the skills and tools needed to make such
hardware.  Expect some interesting projects to launch in the coming year.

</p><p>
<b>Distributions for mobile devices will see a resurgence in interest</b>
in the coming year.  In the early days of Android, it was common to replace
a phone vendor's software with CyanogenMod or another derivative; it was
the best way to get the most control and functionality out of the device.
As Android improved, many of us stopped going to that extra effort.
Increasing privacy and security concerns, paired with increasing quality on
the part of the alternative distributions, will start to drive some users
away from stock Android once again.
</p><p>

Finally, <b>global belligerence will make itself felt in our community</b>.
The world as a whole does not appear to be headed in a peaceful direction;
even if new conflicts do not spring up, the existing ones will be enough to
affect the development community.  Developers from out-of-favor parts of the
world may, again, find themselves excluded, regardless of any personal
culpability they may have for the evil actions of their governments or
employers.
</p><p>
This is being written in the US, where politics have taken a distinct "us
versus them" turn; such trends are not limited to this country, though.
That attitude runs strongly against the foundations our community was built
on; we are building systems for everybody, accepting the contributions of
anybody who is willing and able to help.  We have shown that it is possible
to build a global community that can accomplish amazing things and change
the world.  This coming year would be a good one in which to show that we
are still capable of doing that.  As some strive to tear our institutions
down, we can work to make our institutions stronger than ever.
</p><p>
LWN will begin its 27th year of publication in January; we are one
institution that is proud to have been a part of the Linux and
free-software communities for so long, and we have no intention of stopping
now.  Whatever happens in 2025, we'll be here to write about it and,
hopefully, spread some light and understanding.  And, of course, we'll
return to these predictions in December to have a good laugh at just how
far off they turned out to be.
</p><p>
Best wishes to all of you; LWN would not be what it is without our readers.
We wish an especially happy and prosperous 2025 to our subscribers; without
you, we would not have been around for all these years.<br clear="all"></p><hr>

<p>This very page is an example of a realtime collaborative application.
Every other cursor in the garden above is a <em>real live person</em> reading the page right now.
Click one of the plants to change it for everyone else!</p>
<p>Learn Yjs starts with the basics of Yjs, then covers techniques for handling state in distributed applications.
We’ll talk about what a CRDT is, and why you’d want to use one.
We’ll get into some of the pitfalls that make collaborative applications difficult and show how you can avoid them.
There will be <em>explorable demos</em> and <em>code exercises</em> so you can get a feel for how Yjs really works.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an explorable demo.
Each box below represents a <em>client</em> — a separate computer running an app that uses Yjs.
When you interact with either client, the changes are <em>automatically synced</em> to the other one.
You can control the latency with the slider on the top left to see how clients would interact over a network.</p>

Lynch moved to Los Angeles in 1971 and studied film-making at the AFI Conservatory, where he began filming his first feature Eraserhead. Finally finishing it in 1976, the surreal black-and-white fable was received largely with bafflement, and rejected from most film festivals, but in the late 70s became something of a success on the late-night “midnight movie” circuit.</p><p>Eraserhead’s impact led to an offer from Mel Brooks’ production company to direct The Elephant Man; starring John Hurt in a biopic of Joseph Merrick, the film about the disfigured 19th-century man was nominated for eight Oscars and secured Lynch’s Hollywood status. After turning down an offer to direct Return of the Jedi, Lynch agreed to make an adaptation of Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi novel Dune, but the film was substantially recut in postproduction and proved a commercial and critical disaster. Instead of a planned Dune sequel, Lynch decided to make a more personal film: his dark noir thriller Blue Velvet was a cult hit and a hugely influential critical success on its release in 1986, and it resulted in Lynch’s second best director Oscar nomination.</p><figure id="b50137f3-9b52-4019-804e-656b5f5888a3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="David Lynch at Cannes film festival, 2002." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="293.9719240297275" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>David Lynch at Cannes film festival, 2002.</span> Photograph: Pool BENAINOUS/DUCLOS/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Lynch then embarked on another noirish project, the opaque and surreal murder-mystery Twin Peaks that – unusually for notable film directors of the period – was envisioned as a TV series; Lynch developed it with former Hill Street Blues writer Mark Frost. A mix of small town comedy, police procedural and surreal dreamworld, and described as “the most hauntingly original work ever done for American TV”, Twin Peaks defied early predictions of failure on its broadcast in 1990; as a pioneer of “high-end TV” it is arguably Lynch’s most influential work.

In complete contrast Lynch released The Straight Story in 1999, a bluntly straightforward story about an elderly man (played by Richard Farnsworth) who drives 240 miles across the country on a motorised lawnmower.</p><figure id="8166c2d2-221a-4d61-8855-3fd0697ca5be" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Dean Stockwell, Francesca Annis and David Lynch on the set of Dune." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1b9a234913fc375e46039a8c051fb1fd5e3c6d/0_0_5637_3726/master/5637.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="294.14050026609897" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Dean Stockwell, Francesca Annis and David Lynch on the set of Dune.</span> Photograph: Nancy Moran</figcaption></figure><p>Lynch then embarked on another highly successful project: Mulholland Drive. Initially it appeared to go disastrously wrong, as Lynch had pitched it as a Twin Peaks-style TV series. A pilot was shot and then cancelled by TV network ABC. But the material was picked up by French company StudioCanal, who gave him the money to refashion it as a feature film. A noir-style mystery drama, it was another big critical success, secured Lynch a third best director Oscar nomination and in 2016 was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/23/mulholland-drive-david-lynch-21st-century-top-films-bbc-poll" data-link-name="in body link">voted the best film of the 21st century</a>. Lynch followed it in 2006 with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/09/thriller" data-link-name="in body link">three-hour surreal thriller Inland Empire</a>, shot on video and starring Dern as an American movie star who appears to mysteriously transport into the Polish original of a film she is working on.</p><p>Thereafter Lynch appeared to step back from feature films, with only the third series of Twin Peaks in 2017 representing a big film-making project, although reports suggest he had been working on a series for Netflix. Lynch took acting roles in other people’s work, most notably as Gus the Bartender in Seth MacFarlane’s The Cleveland Show, and as legendary director John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s loosely autobiographical 2022 movie The Fabelmans.</p><p>Lynch was married four times and had a long-term relationship with his Blue Velvet star Isabella Rossellini.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                    <p>Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, <em>unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about</em> in order to fix your problem.</p>

<p>So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them <em>in plain english</em>.</p>

                </section>

                
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#magic-time-machine" id="magic-time-machine">Oh shit, I did something terribly wrong, please tell me git has a magic time machine!?!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code>git reflog
# you will see a list of every thing you've 
# done in git, across all branches!
# each one has an index HEAD@{index}
# find the one before you broke everything
git reset HEAD@{index}
# magic time machine
</code></pre>
<p>You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked. I use <code>reflog</code> A LOT. Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#change-last-commit" id="change-last-commit">Oh shit, I committed and immediately realized I need to make one small change!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># make your change
git add . # or add individual files
git commit --amend --no-edit
# now your last commit contains that change!
# WARNING: never amend public commits
</code></pre>
<p>This usually happens to me if I commit, then run tests/linters... and FML, I didn't put a space after an equals sign. You could also make the change as a new commit and then do <code>rebase -i</code> in order to squash them both together, but this is about a million times faster.</p>
<p><em>Warning: You should never amend commits that have been pushed up to a public/shared branch! Only amend commits that only exist in your local copy or you're gonna have a bad time.</em></p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#change-last-commit-message" id="change-last-commit-message">Oh shit, I need to change the message on my last commit!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code>git commit --amend
# follow prompts to change the commit message
</code></pre>
<p>Stupid commit message formatting requirements.</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#accidental-commit-master" id="accidental-commit-master">Oh shit, I accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># create a new branch from the current state of master
git branch some-new-branch-name
# remove the last commit from the master branch
git reset HEAD~ --hard
git checkout some-new-branch-name
# your commit lives in this branch now :)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: this doesn't work if you've already pushed the commit to a public/shared branch, and if you tried other things first, you might need to <code>git reset HEAD@{number-of-commits-back}</code> instead of <code>HEAD~</code>. Infinite sadness. Also, many many many people suggested an awesome way to make this shorter that I didn't know myself. Thank you all!</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#accidental-commit-wrong-branch" id="accidental-commit-wrong-branch">Oh shit, I accidentally committed to the wrong branch!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># undo the last commit, but leave the changes available
git reset HEAD~ --soft
git stash
# move to the correct branch
git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
git stash pop
git add . # or add individual files
git commit -m "your message here";
# now your changes are on the correct branch
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of people have suggested using <code>cherry-pick</code> for this situation too, so take your pick on whatever one makes the most sense to you!</p>
<pre><code>git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
# grab the last commit to master
git cherry-pick master
# delete it from master
git checkout master
git reset HEAD~ --hard
</code></pre>

                        <h2><a href="#dude-wheres-my-diff" id="dude-wheres-my-diff">Oh shit, I tried to run a diff but nothing happened?!</a></h2>
                        <p>If you know that you made changes to files, but <code>diff</code> is empty, you probably <code>add</code>-ed your files to staging and you need to use a special flag.</p>
<pre><code>git diff --staged
</code></pre>
<p>File under ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, I know this is a feature, not a bug, but it's fucking baffling and non-obvious the first time it happens to you!)</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#undo-a-commit" id="undo-a-commit">Oh shit, I need to undo a commit from like 5 commits ago!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># find the commit you need to undo
git log
# use the arrow keys to scroll up and down in history
# once you've found your commit, save the hash
git revert [saved hash]
# git will create a new commit that undoes that commit
# follow prompts to edit the commit message 
# or just save and commit
</code></pre>
<p>Turns out you don't have to track down and copy-paste the old file contents into the existing file in order to undo changes! If you committed a bug, you can undo the commit all in one go with <code>revert</code>.</p>
<p>You can also revert a single file instead of a full commit! But of course, in true git fashion, it's a completely different set of fucking commands...</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#undo-a-file" id="undo-a-file">Oh shit, I need to undo my changes to a file!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># find a hash for a commit before the file was changed
git log
# use the arrow keys to scroll up and down in history
# once you've found your commit, save the hash
git checkout [saved hash] -- path/to/file
# the old version of the file will be in your index
git commit -m "Wow, you don't have to copy-paste to undo"
</code></pre>
<p>When I finally figured this out it was HUGE. HUGE. H-U-G-E. But seriously though, on what fucking planet does <code>checkout --</code> make sense as the best way to undo a file? :shakes-fist-at-linus-torvalds:</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#fuck-this-noise" id="fuck-this-noise">Fuck this noise, I give up.</a></h2>
                        <pre><code>cd ..
sudo rm -r fucking-git-repo-dir
git clone https://some.github.url/fucking-git-repo-dir.git
cd fucking-git-repo-dir
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to Eric V. for this one. All complaints about the use of <code>sudo</code> in this joke can be directed to him.</p>
<p>For real though, if your branch is sooo borked that you need to reset the state of your repo to be the same as the remote repo in a "git-approved" way, try this, but beware these are destructive and unrecoverable actions!</p>
<pre><code># get the lastest state of origin
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
# delete untracked files and directories
git clean -d --force
# repeat checkout/reset/clean for each borked branch
</code></pre>

And yes, there are other ways to do these same things with more theoretical purity or whatever, but I've come to these steps through trial and error and lots of swearing and table flipping, and I had this crazy idea to share them with a healthy dose of levity and profanity. Take it or leave it as you will!</p>

	Director-writer <a href="https://variety.com/t/david-lynch/" id="auto-tag_david-lynch" data-tag="david-lynch">David Lynch</a>, who radicalized American film with with a dark, surrealistic artistic vision in films like “<a href="https://variety.com/t/blue-velvet/" id="auto-tag_blue-velvet" data-tag="blue-velvet">Blue Velvet</a>” and “Mulholland Drive” and network television with “<a href="https://variety.com/t/twin-peaks/" id="auto-tag_twin-peaks" data-tag="twin-peaks">Twin Peaks</a>,” has died. He was 78.</p>



<p>
	Lynch revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with emphysema after a lifetime of smoking, and would likely not be able to leave his house to direct any longer. His family announced his death in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>, writing, “There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.'”</p>



<p>
	The “Twin Peaks” TV show and films such as “Blue Velvet,” “Lost Highway” and “Mulholland Drive” melded elements of horror, film noir, the whodunit and classical European surrealism. Lynch wove tales, not unlike those of his Spanish predecessor Luis Bunuel, which proceeded with their own impenetrable logic.

<p>
	A four-time Oscar nominee, Lynch received an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2020.</p>



<p>
	After years spent as a painter and a maker of short animated and live action films, Lynch burst onto the scene with his 1977 feature debut “Eraserhead,” a horrific, black-humored work that became a disturbing fixture on the midnight movie circuit. His outré and uncompromising style quickly won the attention of the Hollywood and international movie-making establishment.</p>



<p>
	He was hired by Mel Brooks’ production company to write and direct “The Elephant Man,” a deeply affecting drama about a horrifically deformed sideshow freak in Victorian England who became a national celebrity. The feature captured eight Academy Award nominations, including Lynch’s first for best director.</p>



<p>
	He found less success with his 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling science fiction novel “Dune.” The production, made on a budget of $40 million during an arduous three-year shoot, was a colossal box office flop.</p>



<p>
	However, Lynch rebounded from the disaster with two films that defined his mature style: “Blue Velvet” (1986), a frightening hellride through the psychosexual underbelly of a small American town, and the sexed-up, violent road movie “Wild at Heart” (1990), which was honored with the Cannes Film Festival’s Palme d’Or.</p>



<p>
	In 1990, he revolutionized American episodic TV with “Twin Peaks,” a series he created with writer Mark Frost. With action springing from the investigation of a high school girl’s mysterious murder in a Washington lumber mill town, the weekly ABC show plumbed disquieting, theretofore taboo subject matter and made the inexplicable a fixture of modern narrative television.

	</p>




<p>
	A major hit in its first season, “Twin Peaks” lost its momentum and ultimately its audience in year two. However, it spawned a feature-length prequel, 1992’s over-the-top “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”; 25 years later, the ongoing affection of a loyal cult of viewers sparked a limited-run third season for Showtime that picked up where the second season left off.</p>



<p>
	Later in his career, in such features as “Lost Highway” (1997), “Mulholland Drive” (which won him the best director award at Cannes in 2001) and “Inland Empire” (2006), Lynch flexed a super-heated style that pivoted on plots emphasizing doubled personalities, unexplained transformations and shocking acts of violence. The quiet yet quirky “The Straight Story” (1999) harkened back to the more reserved emotional pull of “The Elephant Man.”</p>



<p>
	The director himself was consistently reticent about sorting the meaning of his work for his viewers. In the book-length collection of interviews “Lynch On Lynch” (2005), he addressed the enigmatic core of his work with writer Chris Rodley.</p>



<p>
	“Well,” Lynch said, “imagine if you did find a book of riddles, and you could start unraveling them, but they were really complicated. Mysteries would become apparent and thrill you. We all find this book of riddles and it’s just what’s going on. And you can figure them out. The problem is, you figure them out inside yourself, and even if you told somebody, they wouldn’t believe you or understand it in the same way you do.”</p>



<p>
	In addition to his honorary Oscar, Lynch’s one-of-a-kind career was acknowledged by a special award (shared with his frequent star Laura Dern) at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards and a Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>
	He was born Jan. 20, 1946, in Missoula, Montana. His father was a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, and his peripatetic family lived in the plains states, the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast before settling in Alexandria, Virginia, where Lynch attended high school.</p>



<p>
	An indifferent student, Lynch focused on painting. A one-year stay at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and an abortive trip to Europe with his friend Jack Fisk (later a noted Hollywood production designer) were succeeded by his enrollment at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1965.

	</p>




<p>
	Living in a forbidding Philly neighborhood with his first wife and infant daughter Jennifer (later a director herself), Lynch began to dabble in film, directing the animated shorts “Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)” and “The Alphabet” (1968).</p>



<p>
	“The Grandmother” (1970), a combination of animation and live action, was filmed with money obtained from a grant by the newly founded American Film Institute. In 1971, Lynch moved to Los Angeles to study filmmaking at the AFI’s Conservatory for Advanced Film Studies, headquartered in the former Doheny mansion in Beverly Hills.</p>



<p>
	Beginning in 1972, Lynch began work on a feature at the AFI. Inspired by his bleak years as a print engraver and struggling artist in Philadelphia, a 21-page initial script began to take shape; Lynch would later say he had no memory of writing it. Over the course of the next five years, he made the film with several collaborators who would remain constants in his career, including sound designer Alan Splet, cinematographer Frederick Elmes and actor Jack Nance.</p>



<p>
	Shot laboriously, cheaply and on the fly for five years, “Eraserhead” was released by indie distributor Libra Films International in 1977. The disquieting black-and-white film followed the psychological descent of its maladroit hero Henry Spencer (Nance) after the birth of his monstrously malformed baby.</p>



<p>
	Critics were decidedly alarmed by the picture when it premiered at L.A.’s Filmex in 1977, but it took on a commercial life of its own when Libra opened the picture at midnight screenings in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Lynch would frequently appear at L.A. screenings, admonishing his mystified audiences, “Don’t ask about the baby.”</p>



<p>
	One enthusiastic viewer at a midnight show at L.A.’s Nuart Theatre was Stuart Cornfeld, a producer at Mel Brooks’ Brooksfilms. He urged Brooks to employ Lynch, and, after viewing “Eraserhead,” Brooks offered the director a job.</p>



<p>
	For his project, Lynch took on the story of John Merrick, whose sensational life story had already inspired Bernard Pomerance’s hit 1977 play. The film version of “The Elephant Man” was an entirely new enterprise, co-written by Lynch and starring a heavily made-up John Hurt as the sensitive Merrick, Anthony Hopkins as the London Hospital surgeon who became his guardian, and Brooks’ wife Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic West End stage star.

	</p>




<p>
	“The Elephant Man” had a powerful emotional impact, and became a box office and critical hit; Lynch received Oscar nods as best director and for best adapted screenplay, with the film also taking a nomination for best picture. The triumph led to a multiple-picture deal with Dino Di Laurentiis.</p>



<p>
	The sprawling space opera “Dune,” about galactic family dynasties warring over possession of a space-travel “spice” mined on a desert planet, had already defeated projected adaptations by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott when Lynch took on the material.</p>



<p>
	Filmed laboriously on Mexican soundstages with an enormous international cast, “Dune” sported an unusual Flash Gordon-meets-Antonio Gaudi production design, a memorable gallery of demented Lynchian villains and the director’s trademark amniotic visuals.</p>



<p>
	The picture satisfied no one: Both audiences attuned to the boisterous heroics of “Star Wars” and impatient critics rejected Lynch’s contorted, confusing and harshly digested reading of Herbert’s novel, and the film tanked on arrival. Lynch later told Chris Rodley that at the conclusion of the ordeal, “I was almost dead. Almost dead!”</p>



<p>
	However, Lynch’s second film for De Laurentiis defined the contours of his mature style. “Blue Velvet” starred Kyle McLachlan, who had played the messianic hero of “Dune,” as a small-town boy who is plunged into a whirlpool of sexual violence, murder and sadomasochism.</p>



<p>
	Featuring a potent cast that included Isabella Rossellini (with whom Lynch became involved romantically), Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell and, most notably, Dennis Hopper as its deranged, out-of-control villain, “Blue Velvet” polarized critics, but it cemented Lynch’s reputation as a fearless and daring film author. The film was the start of his collaboration with composer Angelo Badalamenti.</p>



<p>
	Four years later, the Lynch style was brought to the small screen with “Twin Peaks.” Starring McLachlan as eccentric FBI agent Dale Cooper, the series used the investigation of the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer as a springboard into a swirling narrative vortex involving sexual intrigue, drug addiction, prostitution, madness and demonic possession. TV audiences tuned in to track the mystery and remained for the series’ complexly interwoven characters and perverse, at times supernatural plot twists.

	</p>




<p>
	The show’s first season scored 14 Emmy nominations, including nods for Lynch for writing and directing the pilot, but declining ratings after the drawn-out revelation of Palmer’s killer and Lynch’s diminishing participation due to production of a new feature led to a cliffhanging wrap-up at the end of season two.</p>



<p>
	However, the “Twin Peaks” saga had legs. Actress Sheryl Lee was brought back from the dead to play Laura Palmer in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” which tracked the fateful last week of Palmer’s life in lurid, screaming detail. And Showtime cable audiences were baffled anew by 2017’s much-belated third season, which reunited McLachlan and several members of the original cast.</p>



<p>
	The truest legacy of “Twin Peaks” may have been its impact on the development of unusual long-form episodic series. Successors ranging from “Wild Palms” to “True Detective” all bore Lynch’s distinctive stylistic fingerprints.</p>



<p>
	Lynch’s first feature after “Twin Peaks,” 1990’s “Wild at Heart,” was an oddball exodus, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, in which an Elvis-fixated ex-con (Nicolas Cage) and his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Laura Dern) are pursued by the murderous minions of the girl’s jealous mother (Dern’s own mother Diane Ladd). Domestic reaction was mixed to the gory, sexually frank mix of “Detour” and “The Wizard of Oz,” but the Cannes jury was wowed.</p>



<p>
	Lynch’s association with Gifford continued with “Lost Highway,” for which the two collaborated on an original screenplay. A doppelganger murder mystery that foreshadowed “Mulholland Drive,” the disquieting, brutally effective thriller starred Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty and Patricia Arquette as the players in a homicidal foursome.</p>



<p>
	After spending most of the decade on the far side of narrative coherence, Lynch came back down to earth with “The Straight Story,” the first feature in which he took no hand in writing. In the incongruously Disney-distributed picture, based on a true story, Richard Farnsworth starred as an Iowa man who drives from Iowa to Wisconsin on a power mower to visit his seriously ill brother.</p>



<p>
	Though not a major hit, the film was critically well received, and proved to Lynch’s naysayers that he was capable of bringing life to material that was not extravagantly outrageous. Farnsworth received an Oscar nomination for his performance; the veteran actor and stunt man, who was suffering from terminal prostate cancer during the production of the film, died by suicide in 2000.

	</p>




<p>
	An enlarged version of a prospective pilot for a new TV series became what may have been Lynch’s most widely acclaimed film, and a defining summation of the filmmaker’s themes and narrative obsessions.</p>



<p>
	“Mulholland Drive” served a darkly satirical comment on the ways of Hollywood in the story of a young actress (Naomi Watts) whose relationship with an amnesiac stranger (Laura Elena Harring) becomes a hall-of-mirrors story of manipulation, betrayal and suicide. Lynch was nominated for a 2002 best director Oscar.</p>



<p>
	Some of the same themes came to the fore in “Inland Empire,” Lynch’s first film to be shot entirely on digital video, with Laura Dern starring as an on-the-skids actress involved in typical Lynchian psychic disorder. Owing to its format, still a relative rarity theatrically in 2007, the three-hour feature was little seen after its 2007 premiere at the Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>
	In 2022, he appeared as John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s “The Fablemans,” and also provided the voice of the mad scientist in “Robot Chicken.”</p>



<p>
	Beyond his work in film and TV, Lynch exhibited his paintings internationally and issued many solo and collaborative albums of music. He contributed a weekly comic strip, “The Angriest Dog in the World,” to the alternative weekly the Los Angeles Reader for eight years. His wry, deadpan weather reports were aired daily on the L.A. rock station Indie 103.1 for several years and continued on social media.</p>



<p>
	A devotee of transcendental meditation from the 1970s on, he established his David Lynch Foundation to promote the Eastern practice, and enlisted such stars as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Donovan for fund-raising concerts.</p>



<p>
	Despite persistent rumors of new feature and TV projects after “Twin Peaks” came to an end in 2017, Lynch focused on making music videos and composing music with collaborators including Christabell. He offered his name to the David Lynch Graduate School of Cinematic Arts at Maharishi University and a line of coffee beans and designed Silencio nightclubs in Paris and New York. </p>



<p>
	Lynch was married four times. He is survived by two daughters and two sons.</p>

	<article>
		<p>This year we will continue to pursue our commitment to improving the security of the Web PKI by introducing the option to get certificates with six-day lifetimes (“short-lived certificates”). We will also add support for IP addresses in addition to domain names. Our longer-lived certificates, which currently have a lifetime of 90 days, will continue to be available alongside our six-day offering. Subscribers will be able to opt in to short-lived certificates via a certificate profile mechanism being added to our ACME API.</p>
<h2 id="shorter-certificate-lifetimes-are-good-for-security">Shorter Certificate Lifetimes Are Good for Security</h2>
<p>When the private key associated with a certificate is compromised, the recommendation has always been to have the certificate revoked so that people will know not to use it. Unfortunately, certificate revocation doesn’t work very well. This means that certificates with compromised keys (or other issues) may continue to be used until they expire. The longer the lifetime of the certificate, the longer the potential for use of a problematic certificate.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of short-lived certificates is that they greatly reduce the potential compromise window because they expire relatively quickly. This reduces the need for certificate revocation, which has historically been unreliable. Our six-day certificates will not include OCSP or CRL URLs. Additionally, short-lived certificates practically require automation, and we believe that automating certificate issuance is important for security.</p>
<h2 id="ip-address-support-for-securing-additional-use-cases">IP Address Support For Securing Additional Use Cases</h2>
<p>We will support including IP addresses as Subject Alternative Names in our six-day certificates. This will enable secure TLS connections, with publicly trusted certificates, to services made available via IP address, without the need for a domain name.</p>
<p>Validation for IP addresses will work much the same as validation for domain names, though validation will be restricted to the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">http-01 and tls-alpn-01 challenge types</a>. The dns-01 challenge type will not be available because the DNS is not involved in validating IP addresses. Additionally, there is no mechanism to check CAA records for IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>We expect to issue the first valid short-lived certificates to ourselves in February of this year. Around April we will enable short-lived certificates for a small set of early adopting subscribers. We hope to make short-lived certificates generally available by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The earliest short-lived certificates we issue may not support IP addresses, but we intend to enable IP address support by the time short-lived certificates reach general availability.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-six-day-and-ip-address-certificates">How To Get Six-Day and IP Address Certificates</h2>
<p>Once short-lived certificates are an option for you, you’ll need to use an ACME client that supports <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/09/acme-profiles/">ACME certificate profiles</a> and select the short-lived certificate profile (the name of which will be published at a later date).</p>
<p>Once IP address support is an option for you, requesting an IP address in a certificate will automatically select a short-lived certificate profile.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The best way to prepare to take advantage of short-lived certificates is to make sure your ACME client is reliably renewing certificates in an automated fashion. If that’s working well then there should be no costs to switching to short-lived certificates.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about our plans, feel free to let us know on our <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/questions-regarding-announcing-six-day-and-ip-address-certificate-options-in-2025/232043">community forums</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>Welcome to the very first post in a new blog! Here I will discuss software development, SRE work, and other fun stuff. Sometimes an idea is just too good to pass up. I hope this blog will motivate me to turn sparks and little pieces into general knowledge in writing the words down.</p>
<p>The other day I was discussing <a href="https://www.tabbyml.com/">Tabby</a> with a coworker. We talked about whether we should consider AI-autocompleted code harmful and ditch everyone’s newfound habit due to LLM’s inherent unreliability and their tendency toward spaghetti code, throwing traditional software engineering principles like DRY out the window. I disagreed: what if we could have a framework that integrates AI development tooling while also making everything better and more reliable instead? This instantly reminds me of Test-Driven Development, or TDD, which I think is great when combined with the use of a Large Language Model.</p>
<p>TDD in essence is to write comprehensive unit tests before you work on the main program. Since you wrote so many test cases that they essentially become the full specification, having the tests pass at the end “proves” your program’s correctness. Despite its promise, a lot of people find it a ridiculously clumsy process, even a major drag on productivity. Days could pass when nothing useful gets done. LLMs, however, have fundamentally changed the economics of doing TDD.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-normally-code-with-an-llm">How I normally code with an LLM</h3>
<p>I used tools like Github Copilot heavily ever since they came along. They are good for finding repetitive patterns and helping us fill in the next few lines, but usually struggle to: look at a clear specification, think deeply about it, and produce a whole working module against said specification. Sometimes a problem is so easy I am positive Copilot must be capable of it, but it stops short of giving me the full solution, opting to generate a single line of code instead.</p>
<p>To achieve what I want, LLMs need to be given well-formed requests with necessary, but not overwhelming, contexts. Stuff every tool and library at our disposal inside a model’s context, then it is distracted and easily carried away from the specific problem at hand.</p>
<p>In the end, I find myself rephrasing and renaming project-specific things in more general terms, introducing additional pieces of project-specific context into the conversation only when I realize solving the task requires them after all.</p>
<p>Another observation I had working with LLMs is that they are great debuggers. I can often paste raw error outputs to an LLM, and more often than not, they succeed at guessing the cause.</p>
<p>At some point, I realized that the bulk of friction coding with an LLM came from the back-and-forth copy-pasting juggle between my IDE, shell terminal, and the chat interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-automate-it">Can I automate it?</h3>
<p>So I wrote a little <a href="https://github.com/yfzhou0904/tdd-with-llm-go">event loop</a> to automate this process.</p>
<p>In the first prompt we give to the LLM, we type in a specification of the function we want to implement and a function signature for extra stability. The LLM is expected to generate a good unit test followed by an implementation.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a non-trivial, real-world problem to be solved:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>% go run main.go <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>--spec <span>'develop a function to take in a large text, recognize and parse any and all ipv4 and ipv6 addresses and CIDRs contained within it (these may be surrounded by random words or symbols like commas), then return them as a list'</span> <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>--sig <span>'func ParseCidrs(input string) ([]*net.IPNet, error)'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The model will happily give us a first draft, which we immediately parse and load into a “sandbox” subdirectory for automatic verification:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>% tree ./sandbox
</span></span><span><span>./sandbox
</span></span><span><span>├── go.mod
</span></span><span><span>├── go.sum
</span></span><span><span>├── main.go
</span></span><span><span>└── main_test.go
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>go mod tidy &amp;&amp; gotfmt -w . &amp;&amp; goimports -w .</code> is used to fix minor syntax issues, then <code>go test . -v</code> is run.</p>
<p>If things fail (totally expected at this point,) we make use of the second (iteration) prompt. Now that we are working on existing code, this prompt includes the code we just ran and, crucially, the actual command line output from running the test, which would be either a compiler error or information about some failed tests. The model is expected to think about what happened and iterate by producing a revised test + implementation in a loop until all tests are cleared.</p>
<p>The idea is that in most cases, sending the full debug session is not a very frugal use of the model’s context. A reasonably intelligent model can think about what went wrong and make incremental changes. We also get the benefit of way lower API bills by keeping the context length more or less constant, regardless of how many iterations we end up doing.</p>
<p>Sometimes the model does get stuck. In our CIDR example, claude-3.5-sonnet came very close to all-clear on its second attempt, but proceeded to fail the same test case twice in a row. This is when I come in to look at the code, realize the regexp is not matching the final ‘1’ in “2001:db8::1”, and then provide that as an explicit hint to the model:
<img alt="test fails" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.yfzhou.fyi/tdd-llm-test-output.png"></p>
<p>Claude makes progress and clears the tests with our help:
<img alt="test passed" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.yfzhou.fyi/tdd-llm-test-passes.png"></p>
<p>Now we must contend with the “who guards the guards” problem. Because LLMs are unreliable agents, it might so happen that Claude just scammed us by spitting out useless (or otherwise low-effort) test cases. Anyway, it is a good practice that whoever implements the code shouldn’t write their own tests, because <a href="https://hackernoon.com/test-driven-development-is-fundamentally-wrong-hor3z4d">the same blindspots in design will crop up in tests</a>. In our case, LLM generated both. So it’s time to introduce some <em>human</em> input in the form of additional test cases, which is made extra convenient since the model already provided the overall structure of our test. If those cases pass, we can be reasonably confident in integrating this function into our codebase. Theoretically, you might even invoke a third prompt to do some AI-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation testing</a> by asking for a subtle, but critical, change in the implementation that is supposed to break our tests, then find out if it did!</p>
<h3 id="llm-powered-development-and-cognitive-loadhttpsmindsmdzakirullincognitive">LLM-powered development and <a href="https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive">cognitive load</a></h3>
<p>So this method appears to reliably tackle leetcode-style questions, but would it work in a practical codebase with an actual dependency graph? I believe it can be made to work with some engineering effort, and it’s great news for the codebase’s long-term maintainability if you do. For best results, our project structure needs to be set up with LLM workflows in mind. Specifically, we should carefully manage and keep the cognitive load required to understand and contribute code to a project at a minimum.</p>
<p>Every package, or directory, should consist of several independently testable subsets of code, wherein each subset contains basically 3 files: <code>shared.go</code> for the package’s shared typedefs and globals, whereas <code>x.go</code> and <code>x_test.go</code> focus on a specific aspect of our functional logic, ideally just one public function per file. Sometimes we also have <code>main_test.go</code> supplying a <a href="https://medium.com/goingogo/why-use-testmain-for-testing-in-go-dafb52b406bc">TestMain</a> function for setting up test environments (e.g. <a href="https://testcontainers.com/">testcontainers</a>).</p>
<p>Recently I started a brand new software project at work, so I had the opportunity to design the code organization starting from a blank slate. I’m currently exploring an extension to the AI TDD workflow for larger projects. The whole project code would need to be copied to the sandbox for execution, but sending the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical and distract the model’s focus. Instead, we designate a specific package (subdirectory) that the LLM will work on at any given time, include a <a href="https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc">gomarkdoc</a>-generated documentation for each dependency package we think is helpful, and finally include a same-package example code (perhaps a tightly-coupled entity’s <em>finished</em> implementation). The model will produce a function and a test, just like before, but this time we write the files in our intended subdirectory deep inside the sandbox to run the unit test.</p>
<p>With this pattern, not only do we limit the chance of introducing problematic code into production with test coverage by default, but we also encourage aggressive de-coupling and a unit test-first project structure. Because adding additional context to a model incurs some inference (and human-psychological) cost, we are constantly nudged into maintaining our code as nice little chunks, each consuming only a small cognitive load to fully understand. Hopefully, this approach lets us end up with “deep” modules with rich functionalities but minimal surface area.</p>
<p>In closing, you should remember <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">AI’s Bitter Lesson</a>. There is a non-zero chance that we wake up tomorrow to a major shift in AI architecture, eliminating the LLM limitations we talked about, and rendering our efforts meaningless. So perhaps don’t start refactoring right away your 100k-Line-of-Code projects following this advice!</p>

<p>Broadcom’s <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/05/26/with-vmware-broadcom-has-a-real-enterprise-software-stack/">$61 billion acquisition of VMware</a> in November 2023 and the <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/06/25/cloud-foundation-updates-reflect-the-new-vmware-by-broadcom/">subsequent changes</a> to venerable virtualization company’s business model and pricing have rankled many long-time enterprise users, a situation that has been highly publicized despite assertions by Broadcom and VMware executives that such reports are little than FUD – short for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.</p>
<p>A survey of 300 enterprise IT executives last year by cloud financial management company CloudBolt Software revealed a <a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/industry-research/vmware-acquisition-aftermath/">range of concerns</a> VMware users had about the acquisition from uncertainly about Broadcom’s plans and a mandatory shift to subscription (rather than perpetual) licenses to anticipated price increases – some reports have talked of 150 percent to 200 percent jumps – and the forced bundling of products. About 95 percent of respondents saw the acquisition as disruptive to their IT strategies.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is a high-profile example. The telecommunication giant has claimed in court documents that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/01/att_broadcom_filings_update/">Broadcom quoted it a 1,050 percent increase</a> and last year sued the company for allegedly refusing to honor a renewal for support services.</p>
<p>Given all that, it’s not surprising that VMware customers are looking for options for their virtualized workloads. <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/05/07/red-hat-saddles-up-for-the-wide-open-genai-horizons/">Red Hat</a> apparently is on the list. The <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/10/24/ibms-red-hat-acquisition-will-pay-for-itself-by-early-next-year/">IBM-owned company</a> had always had conversations with VMware users inquiring about its OpenShift container and OpenStack virtualization platform, with much of the talk focusing on modernization, according to Simon Seagrave, senior principal product marketing manager.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-scaled.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1252" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-768x376.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-1536x751.jpg 1536w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-2048x1002.jpg 2048w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Red-Hat-OpenShift-virt-overview-600x293.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a></p>
<p>“Customers came to us because they wanted to bring their virtualized workloads onto a modern platform that would then allow them to modernize these specialized workloads onto containerized cloud native instances using things like serverless, DevOps, sort of GitHub methodologies, and so forth,” Seagrave tells <em>The Next Platform</em>.</p>
<p>However, the content of the conversations changed soon after Broadcom bought VMware. Almost immediately Red Hat began getting calls from VMware users that were tinged with more urgency.</p>
<p>“What we’ve found in the last year is that customers obviously, unfortunately, have had a little bit of sticker shock as renewal prices subscription based on their traditional virtualization platform,” he says. “They were looking for alternatives. … Customers new and existing were coming to us. ‘How can you help us? How quickly can you get us onto your platform?’ It was very much a response to the events that happened within the virtualization industry.”</p>
<p>For many of those enterprises, the goal was less about modernizing what they had by adding containerization capabilities and more about finding safe harbor for their virtualization workloads as their contracts with VMware expired. Red Hat this week is throwing them a lifeline with the launch of OpenShift Virtualization Engine, a new OpenShift edition that essentially removes the container capabilities to give VMware users a virtualization-only OpenShift option.</p>
<p>Similarly, Red Hat also unveiled Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) for Virtualization that comes with features in the vendor’s ACM for Kubernetes tool but that focuses on tasks central to VM lifecycle management, such as provisioning, monitoring, and compliance.</p>
<p>With OVE, “we basically took an edition of OpenShift that was just primarily focused on virtualization only,” Seagrave says. “It’s exactly the same code. It’s OpenShift virtualization. That’s no different than the other editions of OpenShift at all. It’s exactly the same, but it’s really more of a consumption model. Basically, we get rid of any of the ability to run containers on the platform, although it can technically still do it. They just won’t be license for it. It just focuses purely on virtualization. So as such, it’s not a new product <em>per se</em>.”</p>
<p>It includes the <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/11/21/hpe-greenlake-platform-gets-expanded-storage-and-custom-kvm-hypervisor/">KVM hypervisor</a>, can run both on-premises on hardware that supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and supported bare-metal cloud services in the cloud, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>ACM for Virtualization is the same tool as ACM for Kubernetes but that only manages virtual workloads. This also is paired with Red Hat’s Ansible automation platform. OVE also gives users access to Red Hat’s Migration Tool for Virtualization (MTV) to ease the moving of workloads to the new OpenShift platform. The company also has a service where its experts assess the amount of work it will take to make the migration happen.</p>

<p>“We find the pairing of OVE plus ACM for Virtualization and then Ansible for the migration of virtual machines at scale – but also for automating the data operations – is a support network of products that’s really resonating with customers as they migrate across and with the prospect of running their VMs going forward,” he says.</p>
<p>The pairing of Ansible and MTV also is key. Users can point MTV as the workloads they have in other environments – such as VMware or Microsoft’s Hyper-V – that they want to migrate and it will indicate which workloads will be easy to move and which ones will take more work. Some, such as those involved VMware’s vSAN or NSX, will need more planning than easier ones, Seagrave says. MTV lets enterprises move those that are simplest first.</p>
<p>That works well for smaller and midsize enterprises, but some – including many VMware users that have contacted Red Hat since the Broadcom deal – can have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of VMs.</p>
<p>“This is where we recommend the use of Ansible … that will allow them to migrate these at scale,” he says. “MTV still performs the migration across, but Ansible provides the way for all the automation around the migration at scale. It does allow for data operations, so after the fact, when they move their VMs over, they can continue to use Ansible with our pre-created playbooks or they can create their own playbooks that allow them to automate a lot of their data operational tasks.”</p>
<p>Until now, Red Hat offered various editions of OpenShift that included both virtualization and containerization capabilities. OpenShift Kubernetes Engine (OKE) was for organizations that wanted basic Kubernetes containerized capabilities, while OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) brought in more advanced GitOps kinds of features, like CI/CD pipelines – for modernizing applications and deploying them at scale – and serverless capabilities, Seagrave says.</p>
<p>At the top is OpenShift Platform Plus, that includes everything with OKE and OCP as well as features like Advanced Cluster Security for compliance for virtual and container workloads and ACM. The idea of a virtualization-only version of OpenShift was on the roadmap, but Red Hat accelerated its development after the sharp increase of interest from VMware users after the Broadcom deal, he says.</p>
<p>OVE and ACM for Virtualization are both available now.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Device Uses Wind to Create Ammonia Out of Thin Air"><p>Lots of green energy experiments in the lab publish impressive results—but what’s more impressive is when those results come from an actual on-site pilot demonstration in the real world. That’s the case with new research that is able <a data-linked-post="2650279182" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-retired-jpl-engineers-journey-from-space-probes-to-carbonneutral-farming" target="_blank">to generate ammonia</a> out of thin air, without requiring an external power source.</p><p>This technique was developed by a team of researchers from Stanford University and King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. It relies on a fine mesh coated with catalysts that combine atmospheric nitrogen with hydrogen from water vapor to create ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).<sub></sub></p><p>Ammonia has long-been a key component of fertilizer for agricultural crops, but it recently has taken on increased importance as a sustainable fuel. Ammonia can be cracked to yield hydrogen for fuel cells and internal combustion engines, and which only produces water with no carbon emissions when burned. Ammonia can store much more energy in a given volume than hydrogen at a much lower cost per kilowatt hour. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ammonia-fuel" target="_blank">The shipping industry</a> is one of the targets for such technology, and one company has already launched an <a href="https://amogy.co/news/amogy-sails-worlds-first-carbon-free-ammonia-powered-maritime-vessel" target="_blank">ammonia-powered tugboat</a> as a demonstration platform.</p><p>Traditional methods for ammonia production require high temperatures and pressures, a process that can contribute to carbon emissions by using methane as a source material. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.ads4443" target="_blank">The new research</a>, published on 13 December in <em>Science Advances,</em> shows how ammonia can be created without the need for electricity or any other external energy source. The process occurs at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure.</p><h2>Pulling Ammonia From Thin Air</h2><p>The system is based on a micromesh that is coated with catalysts. Water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) combines with atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to create ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The ammonia ends up in a water solution which can be enriched through the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeolite" target="_blank">zeolite</a> filter to absorb and concentrate the ammonia. (Zeolite is commonly used to remove ammonia in wastewater treatment.)</p><p>The process can be powered simply by ambient wind to pass the water vapor through the mesh. The researchers tested the device in the field in areas adjacent to either saltwater and freshwater, to find out if the different sources of humidity impacted output. While wind speed had an impact on ammonia production, it was not a significant factor when conditions ranged from 8 to 21 kilometers per hour; under those conditions the output was essentially the same.<span><span><strong></strong></span></span></p><p>The mesh coating relies on iron oxide and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafion" target="_blank">Nafion</a>, which is a fluoropolymer-copolymer material that is often used in fuel cells. Simply passing air containing water droplets (in the presence of the atmospheric nitrogen) through the mesh creates a chain of reactions that results in ammonia. Production can be accelerated by spraying a continuous supply of water droplets.</p><p>The researchers tested a field unit in nine different locations<strong></strong> in the San Francisco Bay area, obtaining different production rates based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed, demonstrating its practical application if it can be scaled economically.</p><p>The system produces an ammonia solution that could be used directly as fertilizer for crops, and eliminates or reduces the need to purchase and transport traditional nitrogen fertilizers. When scaled, the system could produce commercial quantities of ammonia, suitable for use as a sustainable green energy source.</p><p>According to <a href="https://chemistry.stanford.edu/people/richard-zare" target="_blank">Richard Zare</a>, a professor of chemistry in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, “this innovation could fundamentally reshape fertilizer manufacturing by providing a more sustainable, cost-effective alternative to centralized production.” The water droplet technology has “the potential to revolutionize chemistry—from empowering farmers in developing countries to advancing pharmaceutical and industrial applications.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
