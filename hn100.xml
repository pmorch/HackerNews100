<p>Northwestern Medicine and Brigham and Women’s Hospital scientists have discovered a molecular defect that promotes the pathologic immune response in systemic lupus erythematosus (known as lupus) and in a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em>, show that reversing this defect may potentially reverse the disease.</p>



<p>Lupus affects more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. Until this new study, the causes of this disease were unclear. Lupus can result in life-threatening damage to multiple organs including the kidneys, brain and heart. Existing treatments often fail to control the disease, the study authors said, and have unintended side effects of reducing the immune system’s ability to fight infections.</p>



<p>“Up until this point, all therapy for lupus is a blunt instrument. It’s broad immunosuppression,” said co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=33689">Jaehyuk Choi, MD, PhD</a>, the Jack W. Graffin Professor, an associate professor of <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/index.html">Dermatology</a> and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. “By identifying a cause for this disease, we have found a potential cure that will not have the side effects of current therapies.”</p>



<p>“We’ve identified a fundamental imbalance in the immune responses that patients with lupus make, and we’ve defined specific mediators that can correct this imbalance to dampen the pathologic autoimmune response,” said co-corresponding author Deepak Rao, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and co-director of its Center for Cellular Profiling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the study, the scientists reported a new pathway that drives disease in lupus. There are disease-associated changes in multiple molecules in the blood of patients with lupus. Ultimately, these changes lead to insufficient activation of a pathway controlled by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which regulates cells’ response to environmental pollutants, bacteria or metabolites. Insufficient activation of AHR results in too many disease-promoting immune cells, called the T peripheral helper cells, that promote the production of disease-causing autoantibodies.</p>



<p>To show this discovery can be leveraged for treatments, the investigators returned the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating molecules to blood samples from lupus patients. This seemed to reprogram these lupus-causing cells into a cell called a Th22 cell that may promote wound healing from the damage caused by this autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>“We found that if we either activate the AHR pathway with small molecule activators or limit the pathologically excessive interferon in the blood, we can reduce the number of these disease-causing cells,” said Choi, who is also a member of the <a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. “If these effects are durable, this may be a potential cure.”</p>



<p>Choi, Rao and colleagues next want to expand their efforts into developing novel treatments for lupus patients. They are now working to find ways to deliver these molecules safely and effectively to people.</p>

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. "There is no reason why members of&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get."</p><p>The proposal is the latest chapter in a yearslong <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-opposes-banning-stock-buys-by-congress-members.html">saga</a> in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks, and the first one to get formal consideration by a Senate committee — in this case the Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;on July 24.</p><p>Ethics experts say that legislators' access to the kind of information they receive gives them the potential of having an unfair advantage to the investing public.</p><p>Wednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks.</p><p>Sens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Gary Peters, D-Mich., negotiated and announced the new details.</p><p>If passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027.

The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended the probe without making any charges.</p><p>The effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-opposes-banning-stock-buys-by-congress-members.html">Nancy Pelosi</a> dropped her opposition to it.</p><p>Pelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>If you’ve read my <a href="https://www.timdbg.com/posts/fakers-guide-to-assembly">first post about assembly language</a>, you might expect that this is another post on how to understand assembly language. I will write more about that at some point, but this post is not that. Instead, this post is going to talk about some of the weird things and random trivia I learned while writing an x86 and amd64 emulator. The emulator I wrote was for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview">Time Travel Debugging</a>. One piece of TTD is a CPU emulator, which is used to record the entire execution of a process at an instruction level. The first version of TTD was called iDNA, and the emulator for iDNA was written almost completely in assembly code, which was fast but difficult to maintain and extend.</p><p>I wasn’t involved in the first version of TTD, but I was involved in the second version where we rewrote the emulation portion (and eventually most other parts). The new one was written in C++, and we aimed to achieve most of the performance of the assembly language version while having a more maintainable code base. Writing a CPU emulator is, in my opinion, the best way to <em>REALLY</em> understand how a CPU works. You need to pay attention to every detail. This post is a somewhat random collection of the things I learned. If you have a lot of experience with x86 these might be old news, but maybe a few are things you haven’t seen before.</p><h2 id="useless-x86-encoding-trivia">Useless x86 encoding trivia</h2><p>The x86 encoding scheme is a bit funny in that there are often multiple ways to encode the exact same instruction. The <code>int 3</code> instruction can be encoded as <code>CD 03</code>, but can also be encoded in a single byte of <code>CC</code>. This is a very useful encoding because <code>int 3</code> is used as a software breakpoint. That way, it’s always possible to set a breakpoint at any point in a function, even if it’s an instruction that lands at the end of a memory page (with no page mapped after it). Many of these alternate encodings are designed to be shorter for some common case. For instance, adding an immediate value to <code>EAX</code> or <code>RAX</code> with the <code>ADD</code> instruction can be expressed in a compact form that’s shorter than the more general instruction. An <code>add eax, ...</code> instruction can be encoded like this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>05cccccccc      add     eax,0CCCCCCCCh
</code></pre><p>Doing the same for ECX takes an extra byte:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>81c1cccccccc    add     ecx,0CCCCCCCCh
</code></pre><p>So while both registers are general purpose, the fact that <code>EAX</code> is called the “Accumulator register” is not just a convention, it actually makes a difference to the encoding (and potentially the performance, as a result). Compilers tend to be very smart, and can take advantage of these shorter encodings whenever possible. Shorter instructions mean less data transferred from main memory, and more instructions that can fit in the instruction cache, which is good for performance.</p><p>There are other ways to have equivalent instructions besides just alternate encodings. Instructions in x86 can take “prefix bytes” which modify the behavior of the instruction. The “REX” set of prefixes are commonly used in 64 bit code to access a wider range of registers compared to 32-bit code (and make code sequences <a href="https://www.timdbg.com/posts/recognizing-patterns">easier to recognize</a>). An x86 CPU will happily take one of these prefixes, even if it doesn’t have any effect. Put a “REX” byte on an 8-bit add, and it does nothing:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>4004cc          add     al,0CCh
</code></pre><p>In fact, you can put TWO of these prefixes on. Many disassemblers (including the one in WinDbg) will get confused, but the CPU will execute it just fine:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rrax=0
0:000&gt; u . L2
00007ff8`22160950 40              ???
00007ff8`22160951 4004cc          add     al,0CCh
0:000&gt; t
00007ff8`22160954 cc              int     3
0:000&gt; rrax
rax=00000000000000cc
</code></pre><p>Can we add as many prefixes as we want? You can add quite a few until you get to 15 bytes<sup>1</sup>. This length is a hard limit on current x86-compatible CPUs. Any instruction longer than 15 bytes is considered invalid and will generate an exception.</p><p>There are also some other weird prefixes that you might not know about. The “Address override” prefix can be used to reference a 32-bit address when running in 64-bit mode.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>488d0424        lea     rax,[rsp]
67488d0424      lea     rax,[esp] # Note the extra '0x67' prefix
</code></pre><p>And when running 32-bit code, it will switch the address mode to 16-bit addresses! I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a compiler generate code like that, but it’s there. Something interesting to note, however, is that disassembling or interpreting these bytes correctly relies on knowing the default operand size and address size of a code segment (which can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_descriptor">configured by the kernel</a>). If we disassemble the same bytes in 32-bit mode and 64-bit mode, we can get different results.</p><p>In 32-bit mode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>8b0424          mov     eax,dword ptr [esp]
</code></pre><p>In 64-bit mode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>8b0424          mov     eax,dword ptr [rsp]
</code></pre><p>It’s not just address sizes either. The entire range that was previous dedicated to <code>INC reg</code> and <code>DEC reg</code> on x86 (40-4F) is now used for the <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanrouzanov/status/1616933010707972097">REX prefix bytes</a> on x64!</p><p>In 32-bit mode, we have this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>48              dec     eax
030424          add     eax,dword ptr [esp]
</code></pre><p>But in 64-bit mode, those two instructions have merged to form a single instruction!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>48030424        add     rax,qword ptr [rsp]
</code></pre><p>The encoding space used by <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code> was quite large, so it’s understandable why the AMD64 designers decided to use these bytes for the new prefixes to expand the register set in 64 bit mode. There was already a different encoding for these instructions that supported both registers and memory locations, so nothing was really lost (except a slightly larger encoding for a somewhat infrequent instruction).</p><p>I’ll also note that due to this peculiarity and due to the fact that WinDbg will always assemble instructions as if they are in 32-bit mode, trying to assemble an “INC reg” instruction will always fail, because it will generate the single byte form which is actually a REX prefix.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; a. 
00007ff8`4bfc0950 inc eax
00007ff8`4bfc0951 
0:000&gt; u .
ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x30:
00007ff8`4bfc0950 40eb00          jmp     ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x33 (00007ff8`4bfc0953)
</code></pre><p>The <code>inc eax</code> here got turned into a useless REX prefix modifying the next instruction, instead of actually being an <code>inc</code> instruction.</p><h2 id="odd-flag-quirks">Odd flag quirks</h2><p>Speaking of <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code>, there’s a slightly odd aspect of these instructions that’s worth noting. You might thing that <code>INC EAX</code> does the same thing as <code>ADD EAX, 1</code>, but they are slightly different. An <code>ADD</code> instruction will update the carry flag but the <code>INC</code> instruction does not! This is an easy thing to miss, and when writing the TTD emulator I got this wrong initially, until I caught it with some unit tests.</p><p>There are a few other outliers worth mentioning. Most arithmetic and logical operations will set the overflow, sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags. That includes the <code>CMPXCHG</code> (compare and exchange) instruction. Interestingly, it does not include the <code>CMPXCHG8B</code>/<code>CMPXCHG16B</code> instructions, which will only modify the zero flag. Weird, right?</p><p>Other instructions leave some of the flags in an undefined state, although in some cases they are <em>conditionally</em> undefined. The shift and rotate instructions leave the overflow flag undefined if the shift amount was more than one. It seems that the actual behavior of the undefined flags is related to the internal implementation of the shift operation, and is different between different architectures. I’ve heard that the Atom line of CPUs used a cheaper/slower way of doing bit shifts in the ALU, which results in the undefined flags having different values, although I haven’t tested this myself.</p><h2 id="more-surprises-with-shift-instructions">More surprises with shift instructions</h2><p>Consider this instruction:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>66c1e810        shr     ax,10h
</code></pre><p>This instruction is to shift the <code>ax</code> register by 16 bits. Since this is a 16 bit register, it will clear the register to zero. Now consider this instruction:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>c1e820          shr     eax,20h
</code></pre><p>This instruction says that it will shift the eax register 0x20 (32 decimal) bits to the right. Since this is a 32 bit register, you might think that it will clear the <code>eax</code> register. In reality, the value of eax is unchanged! If you read the details of this instruction in the Intel SDM, you’ll see that the count is masked against 1FH, essentially using only the lowest five bits of the rotation.<sup>2</sup> If the <code>REX.W</code> prefix is used, the mask will be 3FH, meaning the maximum shift is 63 bits.</p><h2 id="segment-overrides">Segment overrides</h2><p>While segmented memory might make you think we are back in the days of 16-bit code, it turns out that segments are alive and well in 32-bit and 64-bit code, and they can have real effects. We tend not to think about them very much because for the most part every OS uses a mostly-flat memory model and all of the segments have a base address of 0.<sup>3</sup> The exception to this tends to be for thread local storage, where one of the “extra segment registers” is used, either <code>FS</code> or <code>GS</code> (or both).</p><p><del>What can complicate things is the fact that usermode code doesn’t have access to the CPU configuration that determines the base address of the FS or GS segments. So if you want to know what flat address corresponds to <code>GS:0x12345678</code>, there’s no way to determine that directly unless the OS has a way of querying this information.</del></p><p><strong>CORRECTION</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/sixtyvividtails/status/1621532553873080322">Sixtyvividtails points out</a> that you can read the base of fs/gs segs using the rdfsbase/wrfsbase/rdgsbase/wrgsbase instructions, which are available in unprivileged code. These instructions are available starting on Ivy Bridge (from 2012). Thanks for the correction, sixtyvividtails!</p><p>On Windows, these registers are used for referring to the TEB (Thread Execution Block), and these structures conveniently have a “self” pointer with a flat address to the start of the structure, which also happens to be the base of the segment.</p><p>In 32-bit processes, the TEB is located using <code>FS</code>. We can see how the OS does this by looking at the disassembly of the GetLastError function, which simply accesses a field out of the TEB.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; u kernelbase!GetLastError

A 32-bit process on a 64-bit OS will have both a 32-bit TEB <em>and</em> a 64-bit TEB, and in some contexts it can be useful to have access to both TEBs (such as the 64-bit WOW code that runs in a 32-bit process).</p><h2 id="segment-overrides-more-trivia">Segment overrides: More trivia</h2><p>I mentioned earlier that the base address of the FS segment and GS segment is determined by CPU configuration. You might be wondering “what CPU configuration?” And the answer is “it depends”. Specifically, it depends on whether you’re in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode. In 32-bit mode, the actual value of the segment register is used to reference a segment descriptor (defined by the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table">Global Descriptor Table</a> and <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Local_Descriptor_Table">Local Descriptor Table</a>). But in 64-bit mode, the base is controlled by two MSRs, the FS Base (IA32_FS_BASE in the Intel SDM) and GS Base (IA32_GS_BASE). A side effect of this scheme is that the actual value of FS and GS don’t matter at all in 64-bit mode. You can see the effect of this in WinDbg by trying to directly read from something in one of those segments. When debugging a 32-bit process, you can dump the contents of the “FS segment” by using the value of the FS register:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rfs
fs=00000053
0:000&gt; db 53:0
0053:00000000  60 f2 2f 03 00 00 30 03-00 30 20 03 00 00 00 00 `./...0..0 .....
</code></pre><p>If you try the same thing on a 64-bit process, it doesn’t work because the segment values don’t matter, only the segment override prefixes!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rfs
fs=0053
0:000&gt; db 53:0

</code></pre><h2 id="roll-credits">Roll credits</h2><p>This turned out to be a pretty random list of x86 trivia. Most of it totally useless unless you want to write an emulator (which I <em>highly</em> recommend if you ever get the chance). I still think it’s sort of interesting, and gives a little bit of insight into how things “really work”. Some of this I learned through trial and error, but I had some great mentors while writing an x86 emulator, one of whom was Darek Mihocka, who has been doing emulators long enough that he owns <a href="http://emulators.com/">emulators.com</a>. I’d never claim to be an expert myself, but if this sort of thing is interesting to you make sure to check out the fantastic resources on <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog’s website</a>.

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
              Large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs), e.g., <span>GPT-<span>4o</span></span> and <span>Gemini-<span>1.5</span>
                Pro</span> are
              powering countless image-text processing applications and scoring high on existing vision-understanding
              benchmarks.
              Yet, we find that VLMs fail on 7 visual tasks <em>absurdly easy</em> to humans such as identifying (a)
              whether two
              circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d)
              counting the
              number of circles in an Olympic-like logo.
              The shockingly poor performance of four state-of-the-art VLMs suggests their vision is, at best, like that
              of a person
              with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia" target="_blank">myopia</a> seeing fine details as
              blurry, and at
              worst, like an intelligent person who is blind making
              educated
              guesses.

      <h2>Task 1: Counting line intersections <img src="https://vlmsareblind.github.io/static/images/logo/two_lines.svg" alt="Two intersecting lines"></h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          Given the impressive accuracy of VLMs on answering questions on diagrams and charts (e.g., <span>Sonnet-<span>3.5</span></span> scoring 94.7% on AI2D and 90.8% on
          ChartQA) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10244">[1]</a>, a reasonable hypothesis is that VLMs must be able
          to see whether two graphs
          intersect in a
          chart. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking VLMs to count the number of intersections between two 2-segment
          piece-wise linear functions.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We create 150 images (see Figure 1) of 2D line plots drawn on a white canvas. Each line plot consists of two
          line
          segments, defined by three points whose x-coordinates are fixed and equally spaced. The y-coordinates are
          randomly
          sampled to create two plots that intersect at exactly 0, 1 or 2 points. See Appendix A for more details.

          interactions
          between larger objects - specifically, two same-sized filled circles. This task assesses VLMs' capability to
          detect
          (1) small gaps between circles and (2) overlapping circles.

        <h3>Images</h3>

          We generate 672 images of two circles on a white canvas. The circles vary in size, distance, and orientation:

        <ul>
          <li>Circle diameters: 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, or 1/7 of the canvas size</li>

          vision is "blurry", it might not be able to identify the exact letter being circled since there is tiny
          spacing
          between the adjacent letters.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We choose three strings <span>Acknowledgement</span>, <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span>, and tHyUiKaRbNqWeOpXcZvM because they contain
          characters
          of variable widths and heights. Furthermore, all four tested VLMs can read out all characters in these strings
          when
          they are input to the models as an image. While <span>Acknowledgement</span> is a common
          English word, <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span> is
          the
          longest word without repetitive letters. We also test VLMs on the random string <span>tHyUiKaRbNqWeOpXcZvM</span> to
          estimate how
          much model accuracy is due to its familiarity with the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each (string, circled-letter) pair, we render a 512×512 image by choosing among 3 red oval line-thickness
          levels,
          2 font sizes, and 4 random positions in the canvas for a total of 24 images. That is, we generate 360, 408,
          and 480
          images for <span>Acknowledgement</span> (15 letters), <span>Subdermatoglyphic</span> (17 letters), and
          <span>tHyUiKaRbNqWeOpXcZvM</span> (20
          letters),
          respectively. We ensure each letter to be circled fits completely the oval.

      <h2>Task 4: Counting overlapping shapes <img src="https://vlmsareblind.github.io/static/images/logo/olympic-rings-svg.svg" alt="Two intersecting lines"></h2>



      <div>
        <p>
          Aligned with prior research <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17421">[4]</a>, we also find VLMs to be able
          to count disjoint circles. Yet, here, we test
          VLMs on
          counting circles that are <em>intersecting</em> like in the Olympic logo—a common cognitive development
          exercise for
          preschoolers <a href="https://www.myteachingstation.com/preschool/math/numbers/count-shapes-printables">[5]</a><a href="https://depositphotos.com/vector/how-many-counting-game-with-color-simple-geometric-shapes-for-kids-educational-maths-task-for-266096226.html">[6]</a>.
          Our hypothesis is that a "blurry" vision may not see the
          intersection between two circles
          clearly
          and therefore unable to trace circles and count them. For generalization of our findings, we repeat the
          experiment
          with pentagons as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          In an image of size C×C, where C ∈ {384, 769, 1155}px, we draw N ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} overlapping, same-sized
          circles
          arranged in two rows like the Olympic logo. A circle diameter φ ∈ {C/5, C/10}. We repeat the images with two
          different
          line thickness for rendering circles. This procedure renders 3 resolutions × 5 × 2 diameters = 60 images. We
          repeat
          for pentagons in addition to circles, resulting in 60 × 2 shapes = 120 images in total. For pentagons, their
          side
          length d ∈ {C/5, C/10}.

      <h2>Task 5: Counting the nested squares <img src="https://vlmsareblind.github.io/static/images/logo/nested-squares-svg.svg" alt="Two intersecting lines"></h2>


      <div>
        <p>
          Motivated by the findings that VLMs struggle in counting the intersected circles (Task 4), here, we arrange
          the shapes
          differently so that their edges do <em>not</em> intersect.
          That is, each shape is nested entirely inside another. For completeness, we test squares in this task.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          In a canvas of size C×C, we render N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} nested squares.
          The outermost square is rendered first using a random edge length d and a line thickness ∈ {2, 3, 4}px.
          The remaining N-1 squares are drawn using a size reduction factor, 0.75 × d and placed at a random coordinate
          that
          ensures they do not touch outer squares.
          For each line thickness, we generate 10 images (where squares have different, random locations) to create 3 ×
          10 = 30
          images.
          Repeating the process for all N values results in 4 × 30 = 120 images.

        <p>
          The results from prior tasks show VLMs cannot always count shapes that are overlapping (Task 4) or nested
          (Task 5).
          What about adjacent shapes? Here, we tile up shapes (specifically, squares) into a grid and challenge VLMs to
          count—a
          task that is supposedly simple to VLMs given their remarkable performance (≥ 90% accuracy) on DocVQA, which
          includes
          many questions with tables.
          To simplify the task, we ask models to count the number of rows and columns in a given table.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          A grid may have N×N, N×N', or N'×N cells, where N∈{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and N' = N + 1.
          Each grid is rendered with two different line-thicknesses on a canvas of size C×C where C∈{500, 1250, 2000}px.
          Besides empty grids, we also replicate the procedure to make grids contain text (which is more common in
          real-world
          tables) where each cell contains a single random word.
          Two versions combined have 2×222 = 444 images.

          that
          challenges VLMs significantly.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          We create each subway map on an image of size C×C, where C ∈ {512, 1024}px. We write 4 station names (A, B, C,
          D) at 4
          fixed coordinates. We divide the canvas into an invisible grid of 18×18 cells and initialize 3 path-starting
          points
          C/18px away from each station. We draw a path, using the depth-first search algorithm starting from a random
          station
          and a random starting point, where a valid move is one cell in any direction: North, south, east or west. We
          repeat
          the process so that each station has exactly N ∈ {1, 2, 3} outgoing paths, for a total of 180 maps.
        </p>

          variations

      <h3>Prompts</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          We ask each question using two different wordings:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>"How many single-colored paths go from A to C? Answer with a number in curly brackets, e.g., {3}"</em>
          </li>
          <li><em>"Count the one-colored routes that go from A to C. Answer with a number in curly brackets, e.g.,
              {3}."</em>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Groundtruth</h3>
        <p>
            Answers are ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} (random-baseline accuracy: 25%).
          </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The following table shows the performance of the four models on the task of counting single-colored paths
          between
          stations.

The rest of this post is just the story of how we came to write this tool, which is totally a skippable story. But along the way we learned things which have <em>opened up such terrifying vistas of reality that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.</em> We hope you find it interesting too!</p>

<div><p data-sid="6000009">We are big fans of <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, the build system, and we use NixOS literally everywhere at our company.<sup>1</sup> But not everybody in the world runs NixOS, so we are frequently in the business of building native executables and shared libraries that need to run both on NixOS and on the kinds of Linux used by normal people (insofar as any Linux user is a normal person). Does that sound like it should be straightforward? Buckle up and prepare yourself for a descent into the depths of ELF program interpretation and loading. We survived this journey, we even brought back an artifact. But at what cost? At what terrible cost?</p></div>
<p data-sid="6000011">I used to think computers were straightforward. I used to think computers made sense. I could do things like compile a program. See? Like this:</p>

<p data-sid="6000015">Those paths that start with <code>/nix/store</code> followed by a long pseudorandom string might look ugly to you, but to me they look like salvation. Yes, salvation from the depths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL Hell</a>. You see, in ancient times dynamic linking was invented to save a few kilobytes here and there. If a bunch of different programs all needed the same library, the OS could provide just one copy of the library, and everybody could map it into their address space. This seemed like a great idea at the time, and then it led to 40 years of version conflicts, inscrutable error messages, and total dependency resolution insanity.</p>
<p data-sid="6000016">It was partly in the interest of slaying this monster that containers were invented. One way to think of a container is that you’re just static-linking your entire userspace, which seems excessive unless you remember the world where it was normal to see your process spitting out errors like “cannot open shared object file” when you deployed it to prod, and vowed to become a wandering hermit and never to touch a computer again. Hypothetically. NixOS is a different way to solve the same problem. Instead of wrapping an entire Linux userspace around your process like a warm parka, we just store every version of every dependency, uniquely identified by the hash of all of <em>its</em> dependencies, and then recursively do the same thing to those, and so on. The result is that you can have multiple versions of your entire operating system happily coexisting on the same hard drive, and a lot of other crazy tricks.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000017">If you’ve been around the software packaging block, then you probably know the first error you’ll run into when you try to run our hello world program on Ubuntu. Yes, it has to do with <code>glibc</code> version symbols, the bane of every software packager and maintainer. The problem boils down to the fact that it’s not safe to have a newer version of <code>glibc</code> on your build machine than on your deployment machine (developers who want to build one binary that targets multiple Linuxes generally have to keep around a computer with the <a href="https://gist.github.com/wagenet/35adca1a032cec2999d47b6c40aa45b1">lowest common denominator</a> version of <code>glibc</code>).<sup>2</sup> NixOS tends to have an extremely bleeding edge <code>glibc</code>, so this will always be a problem. Fortunately, it’s trivial on NixOS to summon another universe into existence where every program and every dynamic dependency was built with an old <code>glibc</code>, then do your build in that universe. Cool.</p>
<p data-sid="6000018">But you do that and then it still doesn’t work.</p>

The library you were looking for is on the left side of each of the arrows, and the actual, resolved library from your load path is on the right side. Since we’re running this in an Ubuntu container, the libraries it finds are all in normal locations under <code>/lib</code> rather than zany locations under <code>/nix/store</code>.</p>
<p data-sid="6000034"><code>ldd</code> prints the location of <code>ld-linux.so</code> (the Linux ELF program loader) in the same format, but in this case it’s a total lie. When you ran <code>ldd</code> on the program, it was able to find a copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code> for you. But when you run the actual program, <code>ld-linux.so</code> itself is the thing that does library name resolution! It can’t very well find itself, so every ELF native binary on Linux hardcodes the location of the <code>ld-linux.so</code> that it should use. Thus, if you want to know the copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code> that your program will use, <code>ldd</code> gives a very misleading answer. Only the thing on the <em>left</em> side of the arrow matters, the thing on the right-hand side is a lie that will not matter when your program actually runs. And in our case, the hardcoded path to <code>ld-linux.so</code> points to a location in the Nix store that definitely doesn’t exist on Ubuntu, and that’s what leads to the “No such file or directory” error. It’s a little clearer if you look at the output of the <code>file</code> utility:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-sid="6000035"><code><span><span>root@9cd480a40ee7:/#</span><span> file</span><span> /tmp/a.out</span><span> </span></span>
<span><span>&gt;</span><span> /tmp/a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (</span><span>SYSV</span><span>), dynamically linked, interpreter /nix/store/kpsz7y412y5f95mv468bs4v5c2g9zy67-glibc-2.27/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, </span><span>for</span><span> GNU/Linux 3.10.0, not stripped</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p data-sid="6000036">Where does this hardcoded path to <code>ld-linux.so</code> come from? Well, it’s injected in the link phase of your compilation toolchain, based on information provided by your installation of the C standard library. Fortunately, the good people at NixOS have produced a handy utility called <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> that lets you selectively modify the ELF headers of an existing executable or shared library, and <code>patchelf</code> has an option, <code>--set-interpreter</code> that lets you modify this path. So that’s it, we just need to add a call to <code>patchelf</code> in our toolchain, and we should be good…</p>
<p data-sid="6000037">…but what do we set the path to? If we set it to a location in the Nix store, this won’t work on any other kind of Linux. If we set it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">FHS standard location</a>, it won’t work on NixOS. We want the same binary to work in both locations. Is this possible?</p>
<p data-sid="6000038">Yes… if you’re willing to embrace Madness.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000039">Our first thought was that since the FHS location is fixed, we could simply configure our NixOS machines to have a symlink from that standard location to the “real” location of the <code>ld-linux.so</code> we wanted to use. Then, we would simply patch all the binaries we built to have the FHS loader location. This would mean they work out of the box on Ubuntu, and on NixOS they’d just require a line or two in your <code>configuration.nix</code>. In fact this approach is so sensible that in NixOS 24.05 they use <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=24.05&amp;show=environment.stub-ld.enable&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=stub-ld">something very much like it</a> to print a sensible error message when you try to run a binary compiled on a different system.<sup>3</sup></p></div>
<p data-sid="6000041">But we want to do better than that! We don’t want you to get an error message when you run a binary with an FHS loader path, we want it to actually work! Should be straightforward right? Just point the symlink at a real copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code>. There’s only one problem…</p>
<p data-sid="6000042">Which one?</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/REYEFhAVtq-1294.webp 1294w"><img alt="...and sometimes it feels like this." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/REYEFhAVtq-1294.png" width="1294" height="1294"></picture></p>
<p data-sid="6000043">Remember the part where I said the amazing thing about NixOS is that you can have multiple versions of every library happily coexisting on your computer? On a normal version of Linux, you have one copy and one version of all of your core system libraries. So on a normal Linux you also have one version of <code>ld-linux.so</code>, living in a canonical location, that’s tested and confirmed to work with those libraries. But a moment ago I just showed you that you can have multiple versions of <code>glibc</code> on the same Nix machine, and moreover entire non-overlapping software ecosystems using those different versions of <code>glibc</code>. Can we guarantee that the <code>ld-linux.so</code> we choose will work with all of them?</p>
<p data-sid="6000044">Unfortunately, this is not some theoretical issue. If you go try to build your own copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code>, you’ll discover that it’s part of the <code>glibc</code> project, and that it’s versioned together with <code>glibc</code>. There’s no documentation anywhere about what the rules are around using mismatched <code>glibc</code>/<code>ld-linux.so</code> versions, but we’ve determined via exhaustive experimentation that it is not guaranteed to work. So if we pick a random version of <code>ld-linux.so</code> out of the Nix store for our canonical symlink to point to, it might not work for some programs. In Nix jargon, this is what’s called an impurity, an arbitrary source of out-of-band state about your system that could cause a program to fail, and that’s a big no-no.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000045">This is a tricky issue. There’s a project which I discovered while I was writing this post, called <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>, that is basically trying to deal with this same problem using a similar approach. They also ran into this impurity issue and decided that the best course was to force the <em>user</em> to specify which version of <code>ld-linux.so</code> to use via an environment variable. That’s a totally valid approach, and their program has some other very nice features,<sup>4</sup> but what if we could somehow scan the binary and just <em>figure out</em> dynamically which <code>ld-linux.so</code> to use?</p></div>
<p data-sid="6000047">If we <em>could</em> figure this out dynamically, there would be an easy way to take advantage of the information. You see, there’s a way to override the program loader path hardcoded into a binary, which is just to invoke the loader directly as the first argument of your command (even before the program you’re trying to run). So for instance: <code>$ foo</code> will execute the program <code>foo</code> using the path to <code>ld-linux.so</code> in <code>foo</code>’s ELF headers. But <code>$ /home/will/my_crazy_ld-linux.so foo</code> will ignore the one that’s present in <code>foo</code>’s ELF headers, and directly use <code>/home/will/my_crazy_ld-linux.so</code>. But what this means is that you can “chain” program loaders – it’s possible to write a “meta-loader” which when asked to load a program, invokes some other loader to finish the job. To make this concrete, here’s the simplest possible example of such a meta-loader:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-sid="6000048"><code><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span>
<span><span>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</span><span> $1</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p data-sid="6000049">So if we knew what the correct loader should be, then we could have the meta-loader invoke it (and hardcode the path to the meta-loader into our program). But is there a foolproof way to decide what the correct loader is? Again, YES! There’s another special header in your executable which defines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath">“RPATH” and the “RUNPATH”</a>, think of these as a way of providing hints to the dynamic linker about where to go looking for certain libraries that you’ve linked against. But for a binary compiled on NixOS, these actually contain store paths for (among other things) the <code>glibc</code> that your program was built against. And that same store path will contain a copy of <code>ld-linux.so</code> that is guaranteed (well, I hope) to work with that version of <code>glibc</code>. Best of all, having a bunch of extra <code>RPATH</code>s pointing to nonexistent Nix store locations doesn’t break anything on normal Linux. And that means we can actually have a plan that works.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/abgCANcj6P-1265.webp 1265w"><img alt="That moment when you've figured it all out" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://antithesis.com/img_opt/abgCANcj6P-1265.png" width="1265" height="1265"></picture></p>
<p data-sid="6000050">Let’s consider the 4 possible cases of has/does not have a Nix-style <code>RPATH</code> and running on NixOS/normal linux:</p>
<ul>
<li data-sid="6000051"><span>Normal</span> binary, <span>Normal</span> Linux: No problem, the loader is where we expect and library resolution works as normal.</li>
<li data-sid="6000052"><span>Nix</span> binary, <span>Normal</span> Linux: No problem, we <code>patchelf</code>’d the binary so it works on normal linux. Library resolution using the <code>RPATH</code> will fail, and then it will fall back on the system library path and find what it needs.</li>
<li data-sid="6000053"><span>Nix</span> binary, <span>NixOS</span>: No problem, our symlink will point it at the meta-loader, which will then read the <code>RPATH</code> and pick the correct “real” loader to use.</li>
<li data-sid="6000054"><span>Normal</span> binary, <span>NixOS</span>: <strong>ALSO NO PROBLEM!!!</strong> Assuming that your binary is able to run at all, there is some <code>glibc</code> it will pick up at runtime (perhaps via your shell’s <code>PATH</code> or <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>). Our symlink will point the binary at the meta-loader, which will fail to read the <code>RPATH</code>, and fall back on the <code>ld-linux.so</code> provided by the <code>glibc</code> installation that your binary would have used. This will exactly match the <code>glibc</code> that gets loaded by the process, so everything will still work.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sid="6000055">So great, now we have a design that should work. Can we just write a little shell script to do this and act as our meta-loader?</p>
<p data-sid="6000056">Lol. Lmao, even.</p>
<p data-sid="6000057">Remember our simplest possible meta-loader? It takes your program and invokes it again using the real loader. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-sid="6000058"><code><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span></span>
<span><span>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</span><span> $1</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p data-sid="6000059">This minimal meta-loader will totally work if you invoke it directly like <code>$ meta_loader.sh foo</code>, and it will totally <em>not</em> work if you hardcode its path (or a symlink to it) in the ELF headers of a binary. Why? I dunno man, haven’t you learned not to ask these sorts of questions? This is the part of programming that feels more like archaeology. We are descending through geological strata, marveling at perfectly preserved skulls and papyri and stuff, pondering how to run our sewer line through here without triggering a lot of red tape.</p>
<div><p data-sid="6000060">Great, no shell script. Let’s write a C program. Yeah, a simple C program. C programs are great. C has a standard library. Unfortunately, if you attempt to use that standard library, your little meta-loader will fail in all sorts of gory ways.<sup>5</sup> Again, we don’t have an exact diagnosis of why this is. We are in the region of the space-time continuum where we sort of shrug our shoulders and roll with things.</p>
<p data-sid="6000061">Great, no standard library. We will write a C program like God intended: using raw system calls, intrinsics, and a little inline assembly. Unfortunately that is not the most productive programming environment, so we cheat and have our meta-loader actually just bootstrap the loading process, and defer all the hard work to a… shell script which we exec. This <em>totally</em> works.<sup>6</sup> Yes, after all that it really genuinely works. This program has never let us down. If you want to try it, we’ve open-sourced it <a href="https://github.com/antithesishq/madness">here</a> and turned it into a tiny NixOS module that’s trivial to enable. Enjoy!</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>.env</code> files can be loaded using the <code>--env</code> option.
Variables from these files can then be used in the UI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h3><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you're testing an API which exists in both <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code> environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code> environments share some common variables, but differ in many ways too.
We can model this by having a single <code>shared.env</code> file which contains variables which are shared between environments, and then a <code>dev.env</code> and <code>prod.env</code> file which contain environment specific variables.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# file: shared.env
API_PATH=&quot;/api/v1&quot;
ENV_NAME=&quot;shared&quot;

# file: dev.env
API_KEY=&quot;dev-api-key&quot;
ENV_NAME=&quot;dev&quot;
BASE_URL=&quot;https://${ENV_NAME}.example.com&quot;

# file: prod.env
API_KEY=&quot;prod-api-key&quot;
ENV_NAME=&quot;prod&quot;
BASE_URL=&quot;https://${ENV_NAME}.example.com&quot;"><pre><span><span>#</span> file: shared.env</span>
API_PATH=<span><span>"</span>/api/v1<span>"</span></span>
ENV_NAME=<span><span>"</span>shared<span>"</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> file: dev.env</span>
API_KEY=<span><span>"</span>dev-api-key<span>"</span></span>
ENV_NAME=<span><span>"</span>dev<span>"</span></span>
BASE_URL=<span><span>"</span>https://<span>${ENV_NAME}</span>.example.com<span>"</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> file: prod.env</span>
API_KEY=<span><span>"</span>prod-api-key<span>"</span></span>
ENV_NAME=<span><span>"</span>prod<span>"</span></span>
BASE_URL=<span><span>"</span>https://<span>${ENV_NAME}</span>.example.com<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When working in the <code>dev</code> environment, you can then load all of the shared variables and all of the development environment specific variables using the <code>--env</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="posting --env shared.env --env dev.env"><pre>posting --env shared.env --env dev.env</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will load all of the shared variables from <code>shared.env</code>, and then load the variables from <code>dev.env</code>. Since <code>ENV_NAME</code> appears in both files, the value from the <code>dev.env</code> file will be used since that was the last one specified.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that you do <em>not</em> need to restart to load changes made to these files,
so you can open and edit your env files in an editor of your choice alongside Posting.
However, autocompletion and variable highlighting will not update until Posting is restarted.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to permit using environment variables that exist on the host machine (i.e. those which are not defined in any <code>.env</code> files), you must set the <code>use_host_environment</code> config option to <code>true</code> (or set the environment variable <code>POSTING_USE_HOST_ENVIRONMENT=true</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment specific config</h4><a id="user-content-environment-specific-config" aria-label="Permalink: Environment specific config" href="#environment-specific-config"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since all Posting configuration options can also be specified as environment variables, we can also put environment specific config inside <code>.env</code> files. There's a dedicated "Configuration" section in this document which covers this in more detail.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if you wanted to use a light theme in the prod environment (as a subtle reminder that you're in production!), you could set the environment variable <code>POSTING_THEME=solarized-light</code> inside the <code>prod.env</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that configuration files take precedence over environment variables, so if you set a value in both a <code>.env</code> file and a <code>config.yaml</code>, the value from the <code>config.yaml</code> file will be used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Command palette</h2><a id="user-content-command-palette" aria-label="Permalink: Command palette" href="#command-palette"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Some functionality in Posting doesn't warrant a dedicated keyboard shortcut (for example, switching to a specific theme), and can instead be accessed via the <em>command palette</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To open the command palette, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Posting can be configured using a configuration file, environment variables, and/or <code>.env</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">Configuration values are loaded in the following order of precedence (highest to lowest):</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Configuration file</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li><code>.env</code> files</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The range of available configuration will be greatly expanded in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration file</h3><a id="user-content-configuration-file" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration file" href="#configuration-file"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can write configuration for Posting using YAML.</p>
<p dir="auto">The location of the config file can be checked using the command <code>posting locate config</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's an example configuration file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="theme: galaxy
layout: horizontal
response:
  prettify_json: false
heading:
  visible: true
  show_host: false"><pre><span>theme</span>: <span>galaxy</span>
<span>layout</span>: <span>horizontal</span>
<span>response</span>:
  <span>prettify_json</span>: <span>false</span>
<span>heading</span>:
  <span>visible</span>: <span>true</span>
  <span>show_host</span>: <span>false</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment variables</h3><a id="user-content-environment-variables" aria-label="Permalink: Environment variables" href="#environment-variables"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All configuration values can also be set as environment variables.</p>
<p dir="auto">Simply prefix the name of the config with <code>POSTING_</code> and set it as an environment variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">For nested configuration values, use <code>__</code> as the delimiter. So to set <code>heading.visible</code> to <code>false</code>, you can set the environment variable <code>POSTING_HEADING__VISIBLE=false</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to set the theme to <code>galaxy</code>, you can set the environment variable <code>POSTING_THEME=galaxy</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">dotenv (<code>.env</code>) files</h3><a id="user-content-dotenv-env-files" aria-label="Permalink: dotenv (.env) files" href="#dotenv-env-files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Posting also supports <code>.env</code> (dotenv) files, which are useful if you want to keep your configuration in a file rather than in your shell's environment variables.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can tell Posting to use a <code>.env</code> file using the <code>--env-file</code> option.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's an example <code>.env</code> file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="POSTING_THEME=&quot;cobalt&quot;
POSTING_LAYOUT=&quot;vertical&quot;
POSTING_HEADING__VISIBLE=&quot;false&quot;"><pre>POSTING_THEME=<span><span>"</span>cobalt<span>"</span></span>
POSTING_LAYOUT=<span><span>"</span>vertical<span>"</span></span>
POSTING_HEADING__VISIBLE=<span><span>"</span>false<span>"</span></span></pre></div>

<hr></div><p>The <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech </a>nonprofit women’s tech community is closing its doors after 17 years, according to a newsletter from founder <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/adriana-gascoigne-on-how-girls-in-tech-can-get-women-to-infiltrate-silicon-valley/">Adriana Gascoigne</a>.</p>



<p>Gascoigne said the decision was made with “sadness and devastation” and was not made lightly.</p>



<p>“It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that Girls in Tech will be closing its doors. This decision was not made lightly, and the sadness and devastation we feel cannot be overstated,” Gascoigne wrote. “For 17 incredible years, we have offered a welcoming community based on empowerment, support, and inspiration for women in the tech industry. Together, we have made a profound impact, helping women reach for the stars and excel in their careers, while working tirelessly to eliminate the gender gap in tech worldwide.”</p>

<p>The group reached more than 250,000 individuals across 35 chapters in 30 countries on six continents. It was founded in Silicon Valley, but <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/adriana-gascoigne-why-girls-in-tech-moved-to-nashville/">Gascoigne relocated the group to Nashville</a>, Tennessee, in 2022 during the pandemic. I interviewed her numerous times about the group’s mission and goals, and how it rose to greater relevance in fighting the “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/girls-in-techs-adriana-gascoigne-fights-the-toxic-culture-of-silicon-valley/">toxic culture</a>” of Silicon Valley.</p>

The passion to support, uplift, and inspire each other is what has truly set us apart. I am immensely proud of what we have built together and the lasting impact we have made,” Gascoigne said in the newsletter.</p>



<p>The group’s programs included a mentorship program, hackathons, coding bootcamps, the Girls in Tech Conference, a startup challenge, global classroom, podcast, blog, jobs board, and shop. The group organized thousands of in-person and virtual events, producing educational and engaging content. </p>

<p>“To everyone who poured their heart into building this wonderful community where women in tech could have a voice, learn, grow, and be celebrated just as they are—I am profoundly grateful,” Gascoigne said. “A special thanks to all of our members, who established such a friendly, warm, and collaborative environment and culture; the managing directors and advisory board teams who led our chapters; our staff at headquarters who managed and grew the organization; our sponsors who funded our programs and events; and our board of directors.”</p>



<p>Without explanation, Gascoigne said in closing, “Though Girls in Tech is closing its doors, the movement we started must and will continue. I encourage each of you to carry on the fight to eliminate the gender gap in tech. Our mission will live on in other forms, driven by the same passion and commitment that have always defined us. I will miss you all deeply. Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: We’re introducing the “free as in beer”, self-hosted and AGPL-licensed Plausible Community Edition (CE). <a href="https://github.com/plausible/community-edition/">Installation instructions are here</a>.</p> <p>In October 2020, we changed <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-licenses">from the MIT to the AGPL license</a> to prevent corporations from exploiting our code without giving back.</p> <p>As mentioned at the time, we wanted a “don’t be evil” license. Here’s the quote of what we wrote more than three years ago on what we were trying to accomplish with the license change:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We want to prevent corporations from taking our code and using it as part of their closed-source proprietary products</li> <li>We want to prevent corporations from offering Plausible as a service without contributing to the open source project</li> <li>We want to prevent corporations from confusing people and making them think that the service they sell is in any shape or form approved by the original team</li> </ul> <p>And we don’t want this to in any way impact the actual use case Plausible is built for. A completely open source and self-hostable web analytics tool that helps people de-Googlify their sites and respect the privacy of their visitors.</p> </blockquote> <p>That license change has helped us build <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-saas">a sustainable open source project</a> with 8 core team members and several paid external contributors at the time of writing. We don’t have any investors, so all this is solely funded by the fees our 12,000+ subscribers pay us.</p> <p>As we’ve progressed in our journey, we’ve become aware that despite its advantages, the AGPL license doesn’t go far enough to protect us against all the threats we face. To better protect our project in the future, we’re changing some things about our self-hosted release. These changes don’t affect anyone subscribing to the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud. Everything stays the same there.</p> <p>If you have a blog, a personal site or a business site, we want you to be able to self-host our code on your servers without needing to pay us any fees if that’s your preference. Nothing changes about this either. Our self-hosted code continues being AGPL-licensed, “free as in beer” and is the same code running in the production on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s more on what’s being changed and why.</p> <ol id="markdown-toc"> <li><a href="#threats-were-facing" id="markdown-toc-threats-were-facing">Threats we’re facing</a></li> <li><a href="#sticking-to-the-agpl-license" id="markdown-toc-sticking-to-the-agpl-license">Sticking to the AGPL license&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="#changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release" id="markdown-toc-changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release">Changes we’re making to our self-hosted release</a> <ol> <li><a href="#our-self-hosted-release-will-be-called-plausible-community-edition" id="markdown-toc-our-self-hosted-release-will-be-called-plausible-community-edition">Our self-hosted release will be called Plausible Community Edition</a></li> <li><a href="#a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting" id="markdown-toc-a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting">A stronger moat for our official managed hosting</a></li> <li><a href="#features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce" id="markdown-toc-features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce">Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability" id="markdown-toc-ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability">Ensuring the continuous sustainability</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="threats-were-facing">Threats we’re facing</h2> <p>We want to reduce the threat from businesses such as hosting companies and other resellers who try to commercialize popular open source projects. We’ve seen our self-hosted code being used in a way it was never intended for by corporations that don’t care about us or open source. Our license doesn’t prevent these corporations from using the Plausible Analytics name and logo either, as these are a part of our self-hosted code.</p> <p>We face threats both from single-tenant and multi-tenant hosts and resellers. These entities compete against us using our work and brand without contributing back. For them it’s a business opportunity to commercialize open source software. They are even damaging our brand. We’ve had cases of these entities:</p> <ul> <li>Confusing people and making them think that we approve of the service they run</li> <li>Reselling our self-hosted code while running Google Analytics and other surveillance capitalism scripts on their site</li> <li>Using Google and Amazon-owned servers despite promising that they’re running on <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-illegal">EU-owned infrastructure</a></li> <li>Having a bad user experience with under provisioned servers, slow loading time, frequent downtime and no support&nbsp;</li> <li>Running paid advertising on Google and paying referral fees for people to promote them. Both marketing tactics that <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/best-marketing-practices">we say no to ourselves</a></li> </ul> <p>These use cases were never the intention behind our self-hosted release. We wanted to give site owners a way to de-Google their sites even if they didn’t want to or couldn’t use our managed service. Now, we’re facing situations where companies much larger than us with much bigger resources use our brand to compete against us and gain a business advantage.</p> <p>It’s telling that these entities rarely decide to build their brand on top of our code. They prefer to use the brand we’ve built instead as it gives them a better and easier starting point. These actions not only threaten our sustainability but also mislead people who trust the Plausible Analytics name. We want to ensure that anyone using or considering our services knows precisely what they’re getting, without confusion or misrepresentation.</p> <h2 id="sticking-to-the-agpl-license">Sticking to the AGPL license&nbsp;</h2> <p>We’re real people who have rent to pay and mouths to feed. We make $300 per month from donations from our self-hosted users. It would take us more than ten years of donations to pay one month of salary for our small team. If we cannot capture the economic value of our work, the project will become unsustainable and die.</p> <p>We believe this would not only hurt us as people but also all of the users of the product. Our self-hosted users directly benefit from the investments we can put into product development. All this is made possible and solely funded by the revenue we get from our managed hosting in the cloud.</p> <p>We’ve learned that being open source and transparent has costs. Dealing with these threats is an incredibly taxing and time-consuming distraction for our small team. It’s something our proprietary competitors never even have to think about.</p> <p>Several popular open source projects have shifted away from traditional models in the last few years because of similar threats that we’re facing. They’re adopting licenses such as the Business Source License (BSL) or the Server Side Public License (SSPL) as these licenses more directly address the concerns about resellers and hosting companies.</p> <p>These licenses are <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">not approved nor recognized by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>, which is why we’re not interested in switching to them. We want to stay open source to continue providing a transparent and privacy-friendly web analytics tool with a “free as in beer” self-hosted release.</p> <h2 id="changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release">Changes we’re making to our self-hosted release</h2> <p>Here’s how we’ll proceed with our self-hosted release. These changes will go live with the next version of our self-hosted release (2.1.0).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc.0">Release notes are here</a>.</p>  <p>Our self-hosted release will be renamed Plausible Community Edition (or Plausible CE). Plausible CE will also have a different logo from the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud. This is the main change you’ll see if you’re running our self-hosted code on your server.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plausible CE continues to be AGPL-licensed and “free as in beer”. It continues to be the same code running in the production on our managed hosting. As we’ve done so far, we’ll keep maintaining, improving and adding features to the Plausible CE with new releases twice annually.</p> <p>To further protect our brand from threats, we’ve registered trademarks for Plausible Analytics on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting">A stronger moat for our official managed hosting</h3> <p>We’re excluding features we use to manage Plausible Analytics at scale, such as the sites API and customer relationship management system, from Plausible CE. As a self-hoster, you likely haven’t noticed these features, as they’ve been undocumented and are primarily helpful when providing web analytics as a service.</p> <p>We’re also keeping some of the newly released business and enterprise features (<a href="https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis">funnels</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/ecommerce-revenue-tracking">ecommerce revenue metrics</a> at the time of being) exclusive to the business plan subscribers on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting.&nbsp;</p> <p>The code for all these features is still available to the public so it can be reviewed and inspected, but these features will not be a part of Plausible CE and they’ll have a different license.</p> <p>This change also means that if you want to contribute to our codebase in the future as an external contributor, you’ll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).</p> <p>To provide a better service and experience to people who pay our bills, Plausible CE will continue to not have any premium customer support and is <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/building-open-source">community-supported only</a>.</p> <p>This open core model is something that GitLab and other open source projects have championed and we believe it’s the best and most open source friendly approach for the situation we’re in.</p> <h3 id="features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce">Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE</h3> <p>The plan moving forward is to carefully consider which features to keep exclusive to our managed cloud hosting. These will predominantly be features that help us run our managed hosting at scale and enterprise features. We aim always to ensure a protective barrier around our cloud offering.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean that all business and enterprise features won’t ever make it to the Plausible CE. Nothing from Plausible CE will be taken away in the future and we plan to periodically evaluate business and enterprise features to be added to Plausible CE.&nbsp;</p> <p>For instance, we’ve already decided to release <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/custom-props/introduction">custom properties</a> (another business feature in the cloud) as part of the Plausible CE. We’ll update the release notes with any new features making their way to Plausible CE in the future.</p> <h2 id="ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability">Ensuring the continuous sustainability</h2> <p>These changes will affect corporations that take our code to compete directly against us as it will create a more substantial moat and better protection for our official managed hosting. It will get more challenging for them to misrepresent their association with us or use our brand and logo misleadingly. And they won’t be able to offer a fully featured Plausible Analytics product with all the enterprise features included either.</p> <p>Many indie hackers that contact us about our experience of running an open source startup tell us that their main concern about open sourcing their code is the risk that large corporations will resell that code and take advantage of their project. It’s a valid concern. We hope that our new approach mitigates most potential downsides and still allows the upsides of releasing our code free to the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the change of our self-hosted release name and logo, the registration of our trademarks and the exclusive availability of certain enterprise features to our managed cloud hosting, we aim to better ensure the sustainability of Plausible Analytics in the face of external threats in the future.

<h2>Welcome to the home of Railway Signalling Simulations</h2>

<h2>So what is SimSig?</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the world of railway signalling! SimSig brings the signal box to your home PC and with it the enjoyment and frustrations of running today's (and some of yesterday's) railways. How often has your train been delayed because of "signal failure" and you've wondered why trains can't be routed around the problem - or why it is even a problem in the first place? You'll soon see exactly why - with SimSig!
</p>
<p>
    SimSig puts you in the seat of a signaller, also called a Dispatcher or Network Control Officer, operating signalling screens based on the widely used IECC and Westcad graphics used in the UK. That is, you operate the signals and points/switches
    in order to get trains to their destinations on time. SimSig has a wide range of areas you can operate including large portions of the UK, a small US
    simulation, and a couple of Australian areas. Each has its own challenges and skill level, the latter ranging from easy to mentally complicated.

<h3>The Brief Specs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Replicates the operation of British IECCs (Integrated Electronic Control Centres)</li>
    <li>All signalling equipment simulated (track circuits, points, signals, etc.)</li>
    <li>Correct signalling (overlaps, aspect sequencing, approach control)</li>
    <li>Emphasis is on quality and realism, not quantity</li>
    <li>Used by signallers, drivers, and other professionals from all over the world</li>
    <li>User oriented - tell us what you want, we'll try to produce it!</li>
    <li>Free demo downloads of every simulation available right now</li>
</ul>

<p>SimSig runs on Windows 8.1 and 10.</p>

<p>
    <i>
        SimSig also runs on <a href="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Wiki/Show?page=usertrack:install">emulators such as Wine for Linux and Crossover for Mac</a>. This is not guaranteed but we try to keep such emulators supported.
        Tablets and phones are not supported.
    </i>
</p>

<h2>How much is it?</h2>

<p>
    You can peruse prices in our <a href="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Store">Shop</a> but we have several <b>free</b> simulations, then range from under £10 upwards,
    depending on the complexity of the simulation. All simulations come with an evaluation period so you can try before you buy.
</p>

<h2>Can I play with friends?</h2>

<p>
    Yes! Many of our simulations are suitable for multiplayer. The larger simulations have as many as nine positions keeping people busy. But many
    simulations also have optional automation such as ARS (Automatic Route Setting) which means you can run a larger simulation by yourself.
</p>

<p>
    Multiplayer works over the Internet, or your home LAN. One person acts as the host while others connect with an IP address and port number. We
    have run multiplayers across the world with members in the UK, the US, Australia, Europe, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>Many simulations can be "chained", which is where adjacent areas can be linked together to form a larger area.</p>

<h2>Can I contribute?</h2>

<p>
    Unlike other products, anybody can write a timetable using the in-built timetable editor. We also do not charge for extra timetables. Our files
    area has plenty of user-contributed timetables to download.
</p>

<p><i>Sorry, users cannot produce simulations themselves.</i></p>

<h2>What does it look like?</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Media/LivSt2.gif"></p><p>
    Here we have the free Liverpool Street simulation running. ARS (automatic route setting) is setting the routes but we can easily take over.
    The eighteen platforms at Liverpool Street in London are very busy during the morning rush hour that we see here. The blue four-character
    labels are the train descriptions (like a flight number) such as 2H07. The signaller can identify the routing and destination of the train
    from that train description. The flashing white blobs indicate that a train is ready to depart. White lines show route set for trains, while
    you can see the signals showing red (stop), yellow (caution), double yellow (preliminary caution), or green.
</p>
<p><i>This animated GIF is running at approximately 4x normal speed.</i></p>

    <p><i><small>You must download and install the system files (from the <b>Download Now!</b> link above; under 3MB) before any simulations can be played</small></i></p>

<p>Europe's new heavy-lift rocket, Ariane 6, made its inaugural flight from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana at 16:00 &nbsp;local time on 9 July (20:00 BST, 21:00 CEST).</p>

		<p>Ariane 6 is the latest in Europe's Ariane rocket series, taking over from Ariane 5, and featuring a modular and versatile design that can launch missions from low-Earth orbit and farther out into deep space.</p><p>"A completely new rocket is not launched often, and success is far from guaranteed. I am privileged to have witnessed this historic moment when Europe's new generation of the Ariane family lifted off – successfully – effectively reinstating European access to space,” said ESA's Director General Josef Aschbacher.</p><p>"An inaugural launch is a huge undertaking from thousands of people who have worked relentlessly for years. To see it perform wonderfully at the first attempt is testament to their dedication and a demonstration of European excellence in engineering and technology. Heartfelt thanks go to the teams at ESA, CNES, ArianeGroup and Arianespace for their hard work to get to this point. I also want to sincerely thank our Member States for having enabled and supported the Ariane 6 programme along the way. Not always easy, but the endurance shown has paid off handsomely today."</p>	</div>

		<p>This inaugural flight, designated VA262, is a demonstration flight whose aim is to show the capabilities and prowess of Ariane 6 in escaping Earth's gravity and operating in space. Nevertheless, it had several passengers on board.</p><p>At 21:06 BST, 22:06 CEST,&nbsp;one hour after liftoff, the first set of satellites on board Ariane 6 were released from the upper stage and placed into an orbit 600 km above Earth. Satellites and experiments from various space agencies, companies, research institutes, universities and young professionals were included on this inaugural flight.</p>	</div>

		<p>In addition to the rocket, the liftoff demonstrated the functioning of the launch pad and operations on the ground at Europe's Spaceport. The new custom-built dedicated launch zone was built by France's space agency CNES and allows for a faster turnover of Ariane launches.</p><p>On the occasion of the launch, Philippe Baptiste, CEO of CNES, said: “With this first successful launch by Ariane 6, Europe has finally recovered its capacity to access space. Beyond the great emotion I am feeling right now, my first thoughts are for all the teams in Kourou, Paris, Vernon, Les Mureaux, Toulouse, Bremen, Lampoldshausen, Liège, Barcelona, Colleferro, Zürich and everywhere else in Europe who made this success possible. I would like to acknowledge the commitment of the employees of CNES, ESA, ArianeGroup, Arianespace and our subcontractors. The last few months have been intense, and I would like to thank them all. Europe can be proud of its space programme, Europe can be proud of its knowledge and expertise. Together, let's prepare the future of launchers and space.”</p>	</div>	
    
						
			<p>Ariane 6 was built by prime contractor and design authority ArianeGroup. “With the successful first flight of Ariane&nbsp;6, the European space industry has moved into a new era,” said Martin Sion, CEO of ArianeGroup. “This historic launch demonstrates the unfailing commitment of our teams and partners, whom I would like to thank warmly for this success, which reflects on the entire European industry. Seeing Europe’s new launcher lift off into space marks the culmination of an outstanding technical and technological adventure, and the beginning of a long history of Ariane&nbsp;6 operations. The next flight models are already in production and the stages of the second model will be shipped to the Guiana Space Centre this autumn for the first commercial flight of Ariane&nbsp;6.”</p>

		<p>With the placement of satellites into orbit, Ariane 6 has demonstrated that it can successfully launch its payloads into space, but ground control has more in store for its inaugural flight. Over the next hour, Ariane 6's upper stage will show again that it can restart its Vinci engine using the novel auxiliary propulsion unit. This restart capability will allow Ariane 6 to drop off multiple passengers into different orbits on future flights and deorbit itself through Earth’s atmosphere at the end of its mission, to ensure it does not become space debris.</p><p>On this flight the Ariane 6 upper stage is set to release two reentry capsules as it enters Earth's atmosphere for a clean disposal to burn up harmlessly, leaving no space debris in orbit.</p>	</div>

		<p>The next Ariane 6 is planned for launch this year on its first commercial flight under Arianespace as operator and launch service provider. “The success of this first flight marks the start of Ariane&nbsp;6’s operational career, giving Europe an autonomous access to space,” added Stéphane Israël, CEO of Arianespace. “The new launcher’s order book is proof of the versatility of Ariane 6 and of its capacity to accomplish a wide range of missions into multiple orbits. It reflects the confidence that customers have in Ariane 6 for both their institutional and commercial missions. We are eager to begin operating our new launcher.”</p>	</div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The amount of sugar consumed by children from soft drinks in the UK halved within a year of the sugar tax being introduced, a study has found.</p><p>The tax, which came into force in April 2018, has been so successful in improving people’s diets that experts have said an expansion to cover other high sugar food and drink products is now a “no-brainer”.</p><p>The <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jech-2023-221051" data-link-name="in body link">research</a>, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, looked at responses from 7,999 adults and 7,656 children between 2008 and 2019 to the annual nationally representative UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey.</p><p>It showed that the daily sugar intake for children fell by about 4.8g, and for adults 10.9g, in the year after the levy’s introduction.</p><p>The total dietary free sugars, including food and drink, in children was about 70g a day at the beginning of the study, but this fell to about 45g by the end.</p><p>For adults, the study found that the total dietary free sugar consumption stood at about 60g a day, and fell to about 45g a day by the end of the study.</p><p>But despite this reduction, the amount of sugar consumed by adults and children still remains above the recommended guidelines and is contributing to high levels of tooth decay, obesity, diabetes and other illnesses.</p><p>The study found that compared to the period before the sugar tax was announced in 2016, free sugars consumed from all soft drinks reduced by around a half in children, and by a third in adults, after the levy was announced.</p><p>The researchers also note that the fall in consumption of free sugars observed in the whole diet rather than just from soft drinks suggests that consumption of free sugar from food was also falling from as early as 2008.</p><p>Eddie Crouch, the chair of the British Dental Association, said that the sugar tax was delivering “tangible results” and was effective.</p><p>He added: “Extending it to the likes of cereals is a no-brainer for any government that cares about prevention. This needn’t add to the cost of living. Where voluntary action on reformulation has failed, the levy forces the food industry to do the right thing.”</p><p>According to the World <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Health</a> Organization and the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, the consumption of free sugar should be below 5% of a person’s total calorie intake. For adults, this would be limited to 30g of sugar a day, 24g for children aged between 7 and 10, and 19g for children aged between 4 and 6.</p><p>Dr Nina Rogers, the lead author of the study and part of the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, said: “The findings of our study are encouraging and show that the UK soft drinks industry levy is linked to a significant reduction in daily sugar intake in adults and children. These results are consistent with previous research which show a reduction in household purchasing of sugar from soft drinks one year after adoption of the levy.”</p><figure id="c7041e84-e774-4012-b332-a1c667e8109c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Does Australia need a sugar tax to tackle diabetes, and how would it work?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;c7041e84-e774-4012-b332-a1c667e8109c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/04/australia-sugar-tax-diabetes-parliamentary-report&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>She added: “The new UK government might want to consider extending the tax to other (currently exempt) drinks which have a high sugar content, or even to some foods. They might also want to look at restructuring the tax to apply a per gram of sugar/100mls rather than threshold-based levy.”</p><p>Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in Public Health Nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This new analysis drives home the importance of policies designed to improve the nutritional quality of food and drink. In particular, the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL) in the UK has proven to be an effective lever to encourage food and drink manufacturers to reduce sugar.</p><p>“With a new government now in place, policymakers are urged to consider applying a similar levy to other discretionary products that are key contributors to sugar intake, such as chocolate confectionery, to shift diets towards a healthier direction.”</p><p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government will take action to prevent ill-health and tackle the obesity crisis head on, easing the strain on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">NHS</a> and helping people to live well for longer.</p><p>“We will introduce tight restrictions on advertising junk food, alongside banning children from being able to purchase sugary, high-caffeine energy drinks.</p><p>“By building a healthier society, we will help to build a healthy economy.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Well, let’s see if you hold on to the same opinion by the end of this post. </p><p id="whats-the-big-deal-with-aws-account"><h2>What's the Big Deal with AWS Account IDs?</h2></p><p> First things first, let's get our basics straight. </p><p> Every AWS account has a unique 12-digit identifier. </p><div><ol start="1"><li><p> These IDs are part of most AWS resource's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Amazon Resource Name</a> (ARN). </p></li><li><p> They're crucial for sharing resources between accounts (using resource policies or Resource Access Manager) </p></li><li><p> They're used in sharing resources outside your AWS accounts, especially with external vendors. </p></li></ol></div><p> In simple terms, your AWS Account ID is your identity in the AWS cloud. If someone needs to access your resources or if you need to intentionally share your resources with others, you need to provide them with your AWS Account ID. </p><p id="the-power-of-knowing-an-account-id"><h2>The Power of Knowing an Account ID</h2></p><p> Imagine you're a red teamer or black box pentester (or worse, an attacker). With just an Account ID, you can: </p><p><b>Bruteforce IAM Entities:</b> You can bruteforce for the existence of common IAM users and roles. This information is gold for phishing attacks, social engineering, or password spraying. You can also see the user name patterns for IAM users (especially those of the target’s infra or DevOps team). An attacker with this information could craft convincing phishing emails or vishing scripts targeting the company's cloud team. </p><div><p><span>Tool Spotlight: Check out the </span><span><a href="https://github.com/dagrz/aws_pwn/blob/master/reconnaissance/validate_iam_principals.py?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">validate_iam_principals.py</a></span><span> script in the </span><span><a href="https://github.com/dagrz/aws_pwn?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">aws_pwn</a></span><span> GitHub repository. It allows you to test for the existence of IAM users and roles when you know the Account ID.</span></p></div><p><b>Discover Services in Use: </b>By checking for specific <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#iam-term-service-linked-role" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AWS Service Linked Roles</a>, you can deduce which AWS services or third-party security tools a company uses. </p><p> Example: If you find a role named <code>AWSServiceRoleForAmazonGuardDuty</code>, the account might use GuardDuty for threat detection. I say “might” here because enabling an AWS service like GuardDuty will create the service-linked role. But if you turn it off, AWS will not delete the role. If the role doesn’t exist, it's 100% certain that GuardDuty is not enabled in the target account. </p><p> Note: You can use the same technique to determine whether the target AWS account uses services like EKS or ECS, allowing you to fine-tune your attacks and web app payloads. </p><p><b>Find Public Resources:</b> You can search for the target company's unintentional public resources, from public EBS snapshots to AMIs. </p><div><ul><li><p> EBS Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#Snapshots:visibility=public;sort=snapshotId" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Snapshots:visibility=public;sort=snapshotId</a></p></li><li><p> RDS Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#snapshots-list:tab=public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#snapshots-list:tab=public</a></p></li><li><p> DocumentDB Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/docdb/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#snapshots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/docdb/home?region=us-east-1#snapshots</a></p></li><li><p> Neptune Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#snapshots:type=public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/home?region=us-east-1#snapshots:type=public</a></p></li><li><p> Public AMIs: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#Images:visibility=public-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Images:visibility=public-images</a></p></li></ul></div><p><b>Correlate Resources (Niche):</b> You can confirm if a leaked resource belongs to a specific company. </p><p> Account IDs can be crucial in HackerOne or other bug bounty reports where you can correlate a misconfigured S3 bucket leaking PII belonging to the target company by matching Account IDs. </p><p><b>Evade Detection (Niche):</b> Some security tools, like <a href="https://canarytokens.org/?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CanaryTokens.org</a>, create credentials from known AWS accounts.

Or even stumble upon any security tools they use in the company (Wiz, Datadog, etc.) </p></li></ol></div><p> Each piece of information you gather paints a clearer picture of the company's AWS footprint.
