With full support for Apple Pencil, digital artists can enjoy painting in the most natural way with a beautiful collection of pressure-sensitive brushes. And unmatched Apple Pencil precision — combined with features like hover,<sup>9</sup> squeeze,<sup>10</sup> and double-tap<sup>11</sup> — gives creators the ability to craft pixel-perfect designs.

<p>Democracy rarely collapses in a single dramatic moment. Lately, however, it can feel as though those type of moments are arriving faster and more frequently, piling up in ways that leave people disoriented and unsure where to look. What often gets lost in that rush is not concern, but orientation – a shared sense of where we are, what matters, and how any of it connects.





</p><p>Long before laws are tested or elections contested, something more basic starts to fray: the everyday understanding of how our communities work and who is accountable to whom.&nbsp;





</p><p>I’ve found myself asking a simple question more often lately: <em>Where do people actually see themselves inside public life anymore?</em>

</p>





<p>That question keeps leading me back to local journalism and to why its decline should concern anyone who cares about democracy.&nbsp;





</p><p>Democracy doesn’t live only in Washington or Harrisburg. It lives in school board meetings, zoning decisions, municipal budgets, local courts, and elections that rarely make national headlines. It lives where policy meets daily life. Local journalism is how those places stay visible.&nbsp;





</p>







<p>When local reporters attend meetings most of us can’t, sift through public records, and follow issues over time, they make public life legible. They help citizens see not just <em>what</em> happened, but <em>why</em> it matters, who made the decision, and what the consequences may be. Without that work, power doesn’t disappear – it simply operates out of view.&nbsp;





</p><p>National media plays an important role, but it works at a distance.&nbsp; Democracy, however, is practiced close to home. I’ve noticed that when local reporting weakens, people don’t just lose information – they lose orientation.&nbsp; It becomes harder to tell where influence actually lives, or how individual participation connects to outcomes.&nbsp;





</p><p>What often gets labeled as apathy looks different up close. Many people I speak with aren’t indifferent; they’re resigned. They’ve absorbed the sense that nothing they do matters, or that no one is really listening. When that happens, public life shrinks.&nbsp; Engagement gives way to spectatorship, and frustration seeks expression through outrage or grievance rather than responsibility.&nbsp;





</p><p>Local journalism quietly counters that drift by doing something deceptively simple: it keeps the public in the room.&nbsp;





</p><p><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong> <a href="https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/01/interview-solidarity-journalism-can-help-the-mainstream-media-restore-public-trust-and-strengthen-democracy-with-dr-anita-varma/">Solidarity Journalism Can Help the Mainstream Media Restore Public Trust and Strengthen Democracy, with Dr. Anita Varma</a>





</p><p>It connects decisions to real people. It shows patterns rather than isolated moments. It reminds us that our communities are not abstract – that they are shaped by named individuals, concrete choices, and shared consequences. In that way, local journalism doesn’t just report on democracy; it helps sustain it.&nbsp;





</p><p>This is also why attacks on journalism, especially local journalism,&nbsp; feel so consequential. Undermining trust in reporters, starving newsrooms of resources, or dismissing local coverage as irrelevant all serve the same end: weakening the connective tissue that allows a community to hold itself accountable.&nbsp;





</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think the responsibility for preserving local journalism rests with journalists alone.&nbsp;





</p><p>Supporting local journalism isn’t charity. It’s civic participation.&nbsp;





</p>







<p>I’ve come to see local news outlets less as content providers and more as public infrastructure – as essential to democratic functioning as schools, courts, or roads. Subscribing, donating, and sharing credible reporting are practical ways citizens invest in the health of their communities.&nbsp;





</p><p>Engagement matters, too.&nbsp;Reading beyond headlines.&nbsp;Responding thoughtfully rather than reactively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offering tips, context, and lived experience that strengthen reporting rather than distort it.&nbsp;&nbsp;





</p><p>These are small acts, but they shape the quality of the public conversation we’re all part of.&nbsp;





</p><p><strong>READ:</strong> <a href="https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/11/democracy-begins-where-we-live/">Democracy Begins Where We Live</a>





</p><p>Publications like <em>Bucks County Beacon</em> model what this can look like: careful reporting, transparency about sources, and a commitment to clarity over sensationalism. In a media environment driven by speed and outrage, that kind of work feels both grounded and rare.&nbsp;





</p><p>I don’t see democracy as something we inherit once and for all. I see it as something we practice – in how we speak, what we support, and whether we stay engaged when the work feels slow or imperfect.&nbsp;





</p><p>At a moment when democratic norms feel increasingly fragile, local journalism offers something quietly powerful: a shared, grounded understanding of our common life. Defending it may be one of the most practical and hopeful&nbsp;choices citizens can make.&nbsp;

<h3>Algorithms, facial recognition, and tightening protest laws signal a deepening surveillance state</h3>



<p>~  <strong><em>Blade Runner</em></strong> ~</p>



<p>The UK is expanding its use of predictive policing and surveillance, framing it as a response to crime, protest, and public safety. But the direction is clear: more monitoring, earlier intervention, and more control over dissent.</p>



<p>In early April, <em>The Guardian </em>revealed that the Ministry of Justice is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/08/uk-creating-prediction-tool-to-identify-people-most-likely-to-kill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing a “murder prevention” system</a>. The tool aims to identify individuals judged to be at high risk of committing lethal violence, based on data drawn from multiple agencies—social care, policing, education. The government has framed the project as a research initiative to improve risk assessments and early intervention. But its underlying logic marks a shift toward ‘precrime’—managing individuals on the basis of what they might do, rather than what they’ve done.</p>



<p>The comparison to <em>Minority Report</em>—Philip K. Dick’s 1956 story, later adapted into a 2002 film—is hard to avoid. In both, people are flagged not by witnesses or evidence, but by prediction systems that turn patterns into verdicts. Dick’s vision included ‘precogs’—human oracles housed by the state—while today’s version relies on datasets and AI algorithms. In both, the future is treated as knowable, and the present is shaped around managing that future in advance.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Notably, overall crime rates in England and Wales have been falling for decades. According to the Office for National Statistics, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incidents have dropped </a>from nearly 20 million in the mid-1990s to under 5 million in recent years. Homicide levels have followed a similar decline, with 594 recorded in the year ending March 2021—far below their peak in the early 2000s. Only 35 of those involved firearms. The relative rarity of such violence raises questions about why a predictive “murder prevention” system is being pursued now.</p>



<p>At the same time, police forces face <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/18/met-police-budget-heading-off-a-cliff-commissioner-mark-rowley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">severe financial pressure</a>. The Metropolitan Police is planning to cut 1,700 officers and staff to cover a £260 million budget gap. Other forces<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/31/policing-minister-police-forces-england-wales-challenging-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> face similar cuts</a>. But rather than scaling back, policing is being reorganised—away from visible presence and toward data-driven surveillance, algorithmic profiling, and anticipatory enforcement.</p>



<p>The Crime and Policing Bill 2025 reinforces this direction. It allows police to access DVLA-held driver licence records for law enforcement purposes. While the Home Office denies any link to facial recognition, civil liberties groups have raised concerns that this access could be repurposed—effectively turning the DVLA database into a foundation for real-time identification. Combined with surveillance networks already active in shops, housing estates, and transport hubs, this lays the groundwork for a more integrated system of biometric tracking, with limited transparency or oversight. These tools are disproportionately deployed in working-class areas and are consistently shown to <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disproportionately </a> <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">misidentify Black and Brown individuals</a>.</p>



<p>In August 2024, following a series of racist attacks across England, Prime Minister Keir Starmer proposed the expanded use of live facial recognition technology (LFR) as part of the government’s response. Civil liberties groups, including Statewatch, <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/august/uk-racist-violence-does-not-justify-proposed-expansion-of-police-surveillance-technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned the move</a>, warning that it would further entrench surveillance and racialised policing. In an open letter, over two dozen organisations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/02/starmer-live-facial-recognition-plan-would-usher-in-national-id-campaigners-warn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that the UK risks becoming “an outlier in the democratic world”</a> by embracing a technology with no explicit legal basis, widespread inaccuracy, and discriminatory impacts. Critics noted that the <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/riots-far-right-facial-recognition-tech-b2595048.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">government’s response to racist violence</a> focused not on addressing its causes, but on expanding state power over already over-policed communities.</p>



<p>The focus of policing is also shifting. As street crime continues to fall, more attention is directed toward protest, dissent, and the perceived risk of unrest. UK military operations abroad—most recently <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/28/suspected-us-airstrikes-hit-houthi-controlled-areas-of-yemen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint airstrikes in Yemen</a>—raise the likelihood of retaliatory attacks. Surveillance systems originally developed for counter-terrorism are now being used to monitor social movements and suppress political disruption.</p>



<p>Recent protest laws support this shift. The Public Order Act and related legislation criminalise slow marches, locking-on, and disruption to infrastructure. These laws were drafted in response to climate protests from groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. Often operating without strong ties to other struggles—like labour, housing or anti-racist organising—these campaigns were easier to isolate and criminalise. The <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05013/SN05013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resulting legal framework</a> now stands ready for broader use.</p>



<p>The surveillance and predictive systems now being assembled are being designed not only for the current moment, but in preparation for what comes next. Whether in response to renewed austerity, military escalation, or widespread resistance, these tools are positioned to contain unrest before it surfaces. What’s emerging is a model of preemptive policing—structured around behaviour, association, and predicted risk. Individuals are reduced to data profiles, tracked not for what they’ve done but for their statistical proximity to disruption. Suppression is exercised in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk scoring, biometric surveillance, and protest restrictions are being embedded into law and infrastructure. These powers are built to be extended—to trade unionists, migrant organisers, housing activists, and anyone seen to disrupt the smooth functioning of a society of control.</p>

  <strong>A network of fake Scottish</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25757818.ofcom-launches-probe-x-ai-chatbot-concerns/" target="_blank"><strong>X accounts</strong></a> <strong>linked to</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/national/25758779.swinney-very-concerned-situation-iran/" target="_blank"><strong>Iran</strong></a> <strong>has gone dark, after an internet blackout was imposed in the</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25756687.iranian-scientist-glasgow-calls-government-back-protestors/" target="_blank"><strong>West Asian</strong></a> <strong>nation.</strong>
</p><p>
  The silence from the group of accounts, which began on Thursday, comes amid widespread protests against the leadership of the Islamic Republic.
</p><div id="po-inline-articlegate-partialarticle">
<p>
  Industry publication <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UK Defence Journal</a>, which has tracked the accounts for months, <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said that</a> multiple X accounts claiming to be supporters of <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/scottish-independence/?ref=au" target="_blank">Scottish independence</a> have ceased activity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  One such account, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/fiona175161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fiona</a>’, has not posted since Thursday.
</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-575 575w, https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-962 962w, https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-642 1400w, https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20408242/?type=mds-article-620 1401w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 575px, (max-width: 992px) 962px, (max-width: 1400px) 1400px, (min-width: 1401px) 1401px" width="100%"><span>The accounts went silent after the internet was cut amid protests in Iran. <em>(Image: PA)</em></span>
</p>
<p>
  The account, which describes itself as “a proud Scottish lass” and “passionate about Scotland's independence &amp; our right to self-determination”, is based in Europe (according to X’s location data).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  However, this is likely due to the use of a VPN which obscures the country or region the account is located in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Other accounts, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/jakeq9170/status/2009122928085160433" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jake</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://x.com/lucy9760" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lucy</a>’, have also been quiet since the blackout began.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  The accounts, which have thousands of followers, increasingly shared extreme content in the days prior to going dark.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Jake’ claimed that a “top BBC anchor resigned on air and was immediately detained by security services” and that “crowds have surrounded the residence of the newly appointed ‘Governor General’ imposed by London”.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, ‘Fiona’ said that “protesters have seized Balmoral Estate” and “International markets are dumping UK assets as images of tanks in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/local-news/edinburgh-news/?ref=au" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> go viral”.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Lucy’ claimed that "farmers have used tractors to block the A1 at the English border”, while another account called ‘<a href="https://x.com/kelly18600" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelly</a>’ said that “army trucks are rolling down the Royal Mile. Soldiers in fatigues are guarding the Scottish Parliament”.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, a group of pseudonymous accounts expressing support for Scottish independence went dark immediately after the internet in Iran collapsed amid Israeli and US strikes in June 2025.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25413339.iranian-bots-behind-1-300-pro-independence-x-accounts/" target="_blank">disinformation analysis firm Cyabra claimed</a> that as much as “26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake”.

  Similarly, a 2024 <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/hub/images/hiding-under-the-kilt1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> by researchers at Clemson University has estimated that 4% of content relating to independence were linked to one Iranian-backed bot network of around 80 accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  According to the study, "the accounts in this network all have false persona which purport to be citizens of the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  "They post messages which support left leaning political views and attack conservative politicians, champion Scottish independence and back the Scottish National Party (<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/snp/" target="_blank">SNP</a>) and denounce <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/israel/" target="_blank">Israel</a> and its behavior in the ongoing war in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/gaza/" target="_blank">Gaza</a>.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need to talk about war. And we need to talk about companies building bots that propose to rewrite our source code. And about the people behind both, and how we preserve what is great about FOSS while avoiding disruption. How do geopolitical conflicts on the one hand and the risk of bot-generated (adversarial) code on the other influence the global community working together on Free and Open Source software?</p>
<hr>
<p>The immense corpus of free and open source software created by a global community of researchers and engineers, developers, architects and designers is an impressive achievement of human collaboration at an unprecedented scale. An even bigger circle of users, translators, writers, creatives, civil society advocates, public servants and private sector stakeholders has helped to further develop and spread this technological Gesamtkunstwerk far and wide - with the help of the internet and the web. With individual freedoms and user empowerment at its center, these jointly created digital public goods have removed many economic and societal barriers for a large part of the world's population. Users are not just allowed to benefit from technology, but each and every user can in principle actively help shape it. On top of the FOSS ecosystem our global economy has been propelled to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Much of this incredible growth was achieved within a (relatively) calm geopolitical situation, in the wake of the cold war which ended in the very same year that also saw the genesis of the World Wide Web at CERN in Switzerland. Economists, philosophers and other observers at the time spoke of the 'end of history' and expected no more big conflicts at the superpower level. We could now globalise the economy and all work together. The flood of innovation taking place all around us promised a bright future for all, with room for altruism and collaboration. In retrospect it certainly was an ideal situation for an optimistic and constructive global movement like the FOSS community to take over the helm.</p>
<p>But apart from the fact that under the surface that narrative was already flawed (with some actors like the USA having a double agenda, as the Snowden and Shadowbrokers revelations exposed) history didn't end. To some ironic extent we are now becoming victim of our own success. In recent years we've seen geopolitical stability punctured by war effort levering low cost technology that includes heaps of FOSS. Social media powered by FOSS infrastructure promote disinformation and have successfully stirred large scale polarisation. Within some of the largest and most populous countries on the planet authoritarian regimes have successfully used technology to break oppression in a new race towards totalitarianism. While for instance Europe has tried to regulate 'dual use' technology, "any use" technology (which our libre licenses guarantee) has escaped our attention. Even in countries which had stable non-authoritarian regimes there is a visible technology-assisted relapse towards anti-democratic movements. On the back of a tech stack which consists of FOSS with a thin crust of proprietary special sauce, unprecedented private capital (sometimes referred to as 'hypercapitalism') is interfering with global politics at an alarming rate. Apart from the direct democratic disbalance the resulting oligarchy is giving rise to overt nepotism, corruption and a new global protectorate for predatory business models and unethical extractive behaviour. Expecting peace in cyberspace any time soon is probably naive, and free and open source technology stands to make up for a significant part of the battleground.</p>
<p>At the same time we are facing other challenges, such as climate change and an imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources. We have more people living on the surface of the planet than ever before, and they are consuming more raw materials and more energy than ever. This won't go on indefinitely. And right at that point we see an army of next generation Trojan horses galloping through the gates of our global commons villages, accelerating our use of both. Generative pre-trained transformers (also known as Large Language Models) kindly offer to take cumbersome and boring coding work off our hands. They can liberate us from responsibility and allow us to do other things or move even faster.</p>
<p>But is it really wise to accept this apparent gift, or should we be a little more suspicious? Just as it has proven way too easy for AI to poison the web with fake content, our software supply chain is vulnerable to manipulation. The attack surface is immense. Due to the inherent complexity of software it is easier to achieve and harder to detect manipulation before it is too late. While many talented and committed people have spent years reverse engineering binary blobs to avoid the associated risks, those blobs were at least isolated and clearly marked. AI is the ultimate black box and it introduces significantly more uncertainty: it rewrites the truth from the inside.</p>
<p>AI in its current form has no actual sense of truth or ethics. Like with Russian roulette, once in a while the models completely bork up and create phantom code and real risk - and that is even in a best case scenario, without assuming malicious intent and manipulation from the outside. In an adversarial scenario (and this adversity can come from traditional nation state actors with non-aligned interests but also from corporate or even private individuals with some determination - like Cambridge Analytica illustrated so vividly) manipulation only requires subtle changes. At the frantic scale at which any available learning content is ingested from the internet these days one can expect targeted adversarial training to manipulate specific code with subtle triggers to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>As a community we have spent billions of hours of careful coding and software engineering to make free and open source technology as trustworthy as it is today. Geopolitical conflict is an incentive to hollow out that trust. AI is an additional leap of faith, and if you look at the forces driving its adoption and their interests, are we really sure those black boxes are safe to invite into our trusted coding base? It is clear that the end game of AI coding is not a healthy FOSS ecosystem, but its total displacement. The threat of machine crafted and man-crafted malicious code in war-time FOSS are equally realistic. Perhaps we can find a middle ground, where we combine some of AI and human skill - and add enough checks and balances, and a variety of assurances through compartementalisation, formal and symbolical proofs and other traditional means of quality assurance.</p>
<p>This talk is an open exploration of some of the challenges the FOSS community will have in the years ahead, working towards a hopeful notion of maximal defendable FOSS.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/">https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46597518">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Before I start, let me get two things out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>In this article I’m <strong>not</strong> going to include the admittedly cool <a href="https://www.brow.sh/">browsh,</a> because it only works by utilizing Firefox under the hood. When I say text-based, I’m talking about old-school browsers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks">ELinks</a>, <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> or <a href="https://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m.</a> These are also the three browsers I’ve used to test everything described below.</li>
<li>The whole article ended up being a rant about how text-based browsers deal with features that got added to HTML. Or more like, how they neglect dealing with said features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-text-based-web-browsers-still-matter" tabindex="-1">Do text-based web browsers still matter?</h2>
<p>Well, I won’t be the judge of that. I like them, I have them installed, and I test every project I create in them. But they are not what I use to surf the web.</p>
<p>Speaking of testing your creations, here’s the good news: If your project has a solid HTML foundation that you then <a href="https://cssence.com/2021/the-day-the-website-stood-still/">progressively enhance</a> with CSS and JS, you are off to a great start.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-html-evolve-in-recent-years" tabindex="-1">How did HTML evolve in recent years?</h2>
<p>While CSS is the star of the show when it comes to new features, HTML ain’t stale either. If we put the long-awaited <strong>styleable selects</strong> and Apple’s take on <strong>toggle switches</strong> aside, there’s a lot readily available cross-browser.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: Whenever we say cross-browser, we usually look at the big ones, never at text-based browsers. So in this article I wanna shed some light on how they handle the following recent additions.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-text-based-web-browsers-handle-modern-html" tabindex="-1">How do text-based web browsers handle modern HTML?</h2>
<nav aria-labelledby="toc">

</ul>
</nav>
<p>When viewing a web page in a text-based browser, you essentially get plain HTML, no CSS, no JS. There is some “styling”, a result of the elements’ semantics, but don’t expect anything fancy, we are down to colors, indentation, and centered text.</p>
<p>It reminds me of what the browsers we are used to give us when they show unstyled HTML—well, HTML with the browser default styles, to be exact. That in turn reminds me of <a href="https://cssence.com/about/css-naked-day/">CSS Naked Day.</a></p>
<p>Text-based browsers work well with good old HTML. Said recent additions however are a bit more nuanced (e.g. interactive), so let’s talk about them individually.</p>
<h3 id="details" tabindex="-1">Details</h3>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-styling-the-details-element/">Disclosure widgets</a> are simple interactive elements we no longer need JS for. When <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> are closed, only their <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> is shown.</p>
<p>Text-based browsers have no clue what disclosure widgets are, so they always show the whole <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> content, meaning you always get the <code>open</code> state. This way things can get verbose, but in essence it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="data-lists" tabindex="-1">Data lists</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/datalist">Data lists</a> can be used to add suggested values to an input field. In my tests they have been ignored entirely, Lynx even mentions that it encountered “bad HTML”, probably because it expects <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> only in a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> parent. At least no browser rendered the options on the screen, they simply fall back to a plain <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> field, which is better than nothing. Side note: I’ve been told data lists have accessibility issues, so …</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Whatever.</p>
<h3 id="dialogs" tabindex="-1">Dialogs</h3>
<p>Yes, HTML can do <a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/dialog/">modal and non-modal dialogs, and even alert dialogs,</a> all thanks to the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element. Initially we needed JS to toggle their visibility, but with the help of the Popover API (see next chapter) we can now even get most of it done in plain HTML.</p>
<p>Alas, once again there is no support in text-based browsers, so you’ll end up seeing all dialog content, as if they had their <code>open</code> attribute set. Consequently, there’s no awareness of a form’s <code>method="dialog"</code> nor a submit button’s <code>formmethod="dialog"</code>, so in both cases the form <code>action</code> is triggered.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Problematic.</p>
<h3 id="popovers" tabindex="-1">Popovers</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/introducing-popover-api/">The Popover API</a> is probably my favorite new feature, but only if you stick to regular web browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/clarifying-the-relationship-between-popovers-and-dialogs/">Given that dialogs are a type of popover,</a> it’s no surprise that nothing works, and once again all <code>popover</code> content gets dumped onto the screen.</p>
<p>By now I think you get the idea, so I won’t even talk about the <a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/7/">Invoker Commands API</a> at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Most likely problematic.</p>
<h3 id="inert-content-areas" tabindex="-1">Inert content areas</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.dev/articles/inert">A modal dialog makes the rest of the page inert</a>, so we don’t have to do it. But with the global <code>inert</code> attribute we can do this manually too, if we need to make certain parts of the DOM unreachable.</p>
<p>Sure enough, text-based browsers will happily let you access interactive elements inside an inert content area.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Bad.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-content" tabindex="-1">Hidden content</h3>
<p>We’re now approaching something that is not new at all, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden">global hidden attribute</a> has been supported for over a decade. It allows us to hide content in the same way as <code>display: none</code>, but directly in HTML.</p>
<p>Adding support in text-based browsers has been discussed back in the day, but got rejected, hence it was never implemented. You’ll end up seeing all content marked as <code>hidden</code>. This is the primary reason why I started writing this article, and what enrages me the most. If I decide to hide content in HTML instead of CSS, I must have a very good reason, thus hidden content should not be visible in any browser! Certain progressive enhancement techniques work by hiding content in HTML and then making it visible via CSS or JS. That possibility goes out the window in text-based browsers.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Epic fail. 😠 🤬</p>
<h3 id="visually-hidden-content" tabindex="-1">Visually hidden content</h3>
<p>Just kidding, there’s still <a href="https://cssence.com/2024/native-visually-hidden/">no native way in HTML to hide content visually</a>, so we continue to rely on class names like <code>.visually-hidden</code> or <code>.sr-only</code>. No matter how they are named, they need to summon <a href="https://vispero.com/resources/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/">quite a few of lines of CSS</a> to get things done. Whether there should be a native way is up for debate. Personally I would welcome a one-liner to achieve this, but it should remain in the domain of CSS.</p>
<p>However, if we had a way in HTML, text-based browsers would display such visually hidden content anyway, that is certain.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> To be continued.</p>
<h2 id="now-what-what-now" tabindex="-1">Now what? What now?</h2>
<p>Text-based browsers and modern HTML, no success story in sight. Given the progress we see in web technologies, the gap will only widen, so much so that w3m and its friends might fall into oblivion.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>Why AI Overviews produces errors</h2>
<p>The recurring problems with AI Overviews stem from a design flaw in how the system works. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">reported</a> in May 2024, Google built AI Overviews to show information backed up by top web results from its page ranking system. The company designed the feature this way based on the assumption that highly ranked pages contain accurate information.</p>
<p>However, Google’s page ranking algorithm has long struggled with SEO-gamed content and spam. The system now feeds these unreliable results to its AI model, which then summarizes them with an authoritative tone that can mislead users. Even when the AI draws from accurate sources, the language model can still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">draw incorrect conclusions</a> from the data, producing flawed summaries of otherwise reliable information.</p>
<p>The technology does not inherently provide factual accuracy. Instead, it reflects whatever inaccuracies exist on the websites Google’s algorithm ranks highly, presenting the facts with an authority that makes errors appear trustworthy.</p>
<h2>Other examples remain active</h2>
<p>The Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range,” still prompted AI Overviews. Hebditch said this was a big worry and that the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.</p>
<p>AI Overviews still appear for other examples that The Guardian originally highlighted to Google. When asked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known&nbsp;and reputable sources and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.</p>
<p>Google said AI Overviews only appear for queries where it has high confidence in the quality of the responses. The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.</p>
<p>This is not the first controversy for AI Overviews. The feature has previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">told</a> people to put glue on pizza and eat rocks. It has proven unpopular enough that users have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/01/just-give-me-the-fing-links-cursing-disables-googles-ai-overviews/">discovered</a> that inserting curse words into search queries disables AI Overviews entirely.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


The <code>ts_zip</code> utility can
compress (and hopefully decompress) text files using a Large Language
Model. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
<ul>
  <li>A GPU is necessary to get a reasonable speed. 4 GB of RAM is
    required. </li>
  <li>It is slower than conventional compressors (compression and
    decompression speed: up to 1 MB/s on a RTX 4090).</li>
  <li>Only text files are supported. Binary files won't be compressed
  much. The currently used language model (RWKV 169M v4) was trained
  mostly on English texts. Other languages are supported including
  source code.</li>
  <li>It is experimental so no backward compability should be expected
    between the various versions.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="https://www.bellard.org/ts_sms">ts_sms</a> which is optimized for the
    compression of small messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>ts_zip</code> uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV 169M v4</a>
  language model which is a good compromise between speed and
  compression ratio. The model is quantized to 8 bits per parameter
    and evaluated using BF16 floating point numbers.</li>
  <li>The language model predicts the probabilities of the next token. An
    arithmetic coder then encodes the next token according to the
    probabilities.</li>
  <li>The model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible
    way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU
    model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point
    ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we released Claude Code, we expected developers to use it for coding. They did—and then quickly began using it for <a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2009666254815269313" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e170" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e170">almost everything else</a>. This prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone—<a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/everyone-should-be-using-claude-code" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e173" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e173">not just developers</a>—to work with Claude in the very same way. Cowork is available today as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on our <a href="https://claude.com/download" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e176" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e176">macOS app</a>, and we will improve it rapidly from here.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAmKyyZ-b9E" title="Introducing Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work"></iframe></p></figure><p>How is using Cowork different from a regular conversation? In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder of your choosing on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.&nbsp;</p><p>In Cowork, Claude completes work like this with much more agency than you’d see in a regular conversation. Once you’ve set it a task, Claude will make a plan and steadily complete it, while looping you in on what it’s up to. If you’ve used Claude Code, this will feel familiar—Cowork is built on the very <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82a" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82a">same foundations</a>. This means Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve mastered the basics, you can make Cowork more powerful still. Claude can use your existing <a href="https://claude.com/connectors" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82f" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b82f">connectors</a>, which link Claude to external information, and in Cowork we’ve added an initial set of <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b832" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b832">skills</a> that improve Claude’s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. If you pair Cowork with <a href="https://claude.com/chrome" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b835" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="638a9647-f7be-7484-3d32-f34fa167b835">Claude in Chrome</a>, Claude can complete tasks that require browser access, too.</p><p>Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format. Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E" title="Organize your desktop files with Cowork"></iframe></p></figure><h2>Stay in control</h2><p>In Cowork, you can choose which folders and connectors Claude can see: Claude can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to. Claude will also ask before taking any significant actions, so you can steer or course-correct it as you need.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, there are still things to be aware of before you give Claude control. By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it’s instructed to. Since there’s always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this.&nbsp;</p><p>You should also be aware of the risk of “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e19c" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e19c">prompt injections</a>”: attempts by attackers to alter Claude’s plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We’ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety—that is, the task of securing Claude’s real-world actions—is still an active area of development in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>These risks aren’t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1a2" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1a2">Help Center</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking forward</h2><p>This is a research preview. We’re releasing Cowork early because we want to learn what people use it for, and how they think it could be better. We encourage you to experiment with what Cowork can do for you, and to try things you don’t expect to work: you might be surprised! As we learn more from this preview, we plan to make lots of improvements (including by adding cross-device sync and bringing it to Windows), and we’ll identify further ways to make it safer.&nbsp;</p><p>Claude Max subscribers can try Cowork now by downloading the <a href="https://claude.com/download" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1aa" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7e2b4a8-bd30-6427-2c54-02a35d22e1aa">macOS app</a>, then clicking on “Cowork” in the sidebar.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>After creating thousands</span> of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-pushing-ai-undressing-mainstream/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_e6f38b98-522c-48d8-be73-d982c8e641e2_popular4-2">“undressing” pictures of women</a> and sexualized imagery of apparent minors, Elon Musk’s X has apparently limited who can generate images with Grok. However, despite the changes, the chatbot is still being used to create “undressing” sexualized images on the platform.</p><p>On Friday morning, the Grok account on X started responding to some users’ requests with a message saying that image generation and editing are “currently limited to paying subscribers.” The message also includes a link pushing people toward the social media platform’s $395 annual subscription tier. In one test of the system requesting Grok create an image of a tree, the system returned the same message.</p><p>The apparent change comes after days of growing outrage against and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/">scrutiny</a> of Musk’s X and xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot. The companies face an increasing number of investigations from regulators around the world over the creation of nonconsensual explicit imagery and alleged sexual images of children. British prime minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjzknepvzo">has not ruled out</a> banning X in the country and said the actions have been “unlawful.”</p><p>Neither X nor xAI, the Musk-owned company behind Grok, has confirmed that it has made image generation and editing a paid-only feature. An X spokesperson acknowledged WIRED’s inquiry but did not provide comment ahead of publication. X has previously <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223&quot;}" href="https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a> it takes “action against illegal content on X,” including instances of child sexual abuse material. While Apple and Google have previously banned apps with similar “nudify” features, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/">X and Grok remain available</a> in their respective app stores. xAI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.</p><p>For more than a week, users on X have been asking the chatbot to edit images of women to remove their clothes—often asking for the image to contain a “string” or “transparent” bikini. While a public feed of images created by Grok contained far fewer results of these “undressing” images on Friday, it still created sexualized images when prompted to by X users with paid for “verified” accounts.</p><p>“We observe the same kind of prompt, we observe the same kind of outcome, just fewer than before,” Paul Bouchaud, lead researcher at Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, tells WIRED. “The model can continue to generate bikini [images],” they say.</p><p>A WIRED review of some Grok posts on Friday morning identified Grok generating images in response to user requests for images that “put her in latex lingerie” and “put her in a plastic bikini and cover her in donut white glaze.” The images appear behind a “content warning” box saying that adult material is displayed.</p><p>On Wednesday, WIRED revealed that Grok’s stand-alone website and app, which is separate from the version on X, has also been used in recent months to create <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_e6f38b98-522c-48d8-be73-d982c8e641e2_popular4-2">highly graphic and sometimes violent sexual videos</a>, including celebrities and other real people. Bouchaud says it is still possible to use Grok to make these videos. “I was able to generate a video with sexually explicit content without any restriction from an unverified account,” they say.</p><p>While WIRED’s test of image generation using Grok on X using a free account did not allow any images to be created, using a free account on Grok’s app and website still generated images.</p><p>The change on X could immediately limit the amount of sexually explicit and harmful material the platform is creating, experts say. But it has also been criticized as a minimal step that acts as a band-aid to the real harms <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepfake-survivor-breeze-liu-microsoft/">caused by nonconsensual intimate imagery</a>.</p><p>“The recent decision to restrict access to paying subscribers is not only inadequate—it represents the monetization of abuse,” Emma Pickering, head of technology-facilitated abuse at UK domestic abuse charity Refuge, said in a statement. “While limiting AI image generation to paid users may marginally reduce volume and improve traceability, the abuse has not been stopped. It has simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">yolobox uses <strong>container isolation</strong> (Docker or Podman) as its security boundary. When you run <code>yolobox</code>, it:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Starts a container with your project mounted at <code>/workspace</code></li>
<li>Runs as user <code>yolo</code> with sudo access <em>inside</em> the container</li>
<li>Does NOT mount your home directory (unless explicitly requested)</li>
<li>Uses Linux namespaces to isolate the container's filesystem, process tree, and network</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The AI agent has full root access <em>inside the container</em>, but the container's view of the filesystem is restricted to what yolobox explicitly mounts.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trust Boundary</h3><a id="user-content-trust-boundary" aria-label="Permalink: Trust Boundary" href="#trust-boundary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The trust boundary is the container runtime</strong> (Docker/Podman). This means:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>✅ Protection against accidental <code>rm -rf ~</code> or credential theft</li>
<li>✅ Protection against most filesystem-based attacks</li>
<li><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> <strong>NOT protection against container escapes</strong> — a sufficiently advanced exploit targeting kernel vulnerabilities could break out</li>
<li><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> <strong>NOT protection against a malicious AI</strong> deliberately trying to escape — this is defense against accidents, not adversarial attacks</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you're worried about an AI actively trying to escape containment, you need VM-level isolation (see "Hardening Options" below).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Threat Model</h3><a id="user-content-threat-model" aria-label="Permalink: Threat Model" href="#threat-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What yolobox protects:</strong></p>

<li>Your home directory from accidental deletion</li>
<li>Your SSH keys, credentials, and dotfiles</li>
<li>Other projects on your machine</li>
<li>Host system files and configurations</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>What yolobox does NOT protect:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your project directory (it's mounted read-write by default)</li>

<p dir="auto">Rootless Podman runs the container without root privileges on the host, using user namespaces. This significantly reduces the impact of container escapes since the container's "root" maps to your unprivileged user on the host.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Level 4: VM isolation</strong> (maximum security)</p>
<p dir="auto">For true isolation with no shared kernel, consider running yolobox inside a VM:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: Use a Linux VM via UTM, Parallels, or Lima</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: Use a Podman machine or dedicated VM</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This adds significant overhead but eliminates kernel-level attack surface.</p>

The first attack of rheumatism was a week before I saw you, and the second when I saw you, and the third when I saw you, and the third in the same time. The second attack of gout, however, was not accompanied by any febrile symptoms, but was accompanied with an increased flow of urine, and with a more copious discharge of urine. The third attack was an hour after I saw you, and was succeeded by a return of a paroxysm of gout, and a more rapid return of the gout. The fourth attack was also accompanied by a fever, but was not always accompanied by any febrile symptoms. The third attack of gout was a fortnight after you had been ill, and the fourth was followed by a paroxysm of gout. The fourth attack was a fortnight after you were attacked, and was accompanied by a sense</p>

<p dir="auto">Selective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It's done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it's not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?</h2><a id="user-content-why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora" aria-label="Permalink: Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?" href="#why-not-just-use-fine-tuning-or-lora"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For this project I'm trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it's already pre-trained and that information won't go away. If I train from scratch the language model won't pretend to be old, it just will be. The Goal for this project right now is to create something can reason exclusively using knowledge from London books published between 1800 and 1875.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm using books, legal documents, newspapers, and other writings from 1800–1875 London. The list I linked (for v0) has like 200 but for the first training I just used 50 files about ~187 MB. You can view a list of the documents:
