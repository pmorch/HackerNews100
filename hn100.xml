<p>TLDR: <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/">https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday I stumbled on this HN thread <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205632">Show HN: Gemini Pro 3 hallucinates the HN front page 10 years from now</a>, where Gemini 3 was hallucinating the frontpage of 10 years from now. One of the comments struck me a bit more though - Bjartr linked to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2015-12-09">HN frontpage from exactly 10 years ago</a>, i.e. December 2015. I was reading through the discussions of 10 years ago and mentally grading them for prescience when I realized that an LLM might actually be a lot better at this task. I copy pasted one of the article+comment threads manually into ChatGPT 5.1 Thinking and it gave me a beautiful analysis of what people thought + what actually happened in retrospect, even better and significantly more detailed than what I was doing manually. I realized that this task is actually a really good fit for LLMs and I was looking for excuses to vibe code something with the newly released Opus 4.5, so I got to work. I'm going to get all the front pages of December (31 days, 30 articles per day), get ChatGPT 5.1 Thinking to do the analysis, and present everything in a nice way for historical reading.</p>
<p>There are two macro reasons for why I think the exercise is interesting more generally:</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe it is quite possible and desirable to train your forward future predictor given training and effort.</li>
<li>I was reminded again of my tweets that said <em>"Be good, future LLMs are watching"</em>. You can take that in many directions, but here I want to focus on the idea that future LLMs <strong>are</strong> watching. Everything we do today might be scrutinized in great detail in the future because doing so will be "free". A lot of the ways people behave currently I think make an implicit "security by obscurity" assumption. But if intelligence really does become too cheap to meter, it will become possible to do a perfect reconstruction and synthesis of everything. LLMs are watching (or humans using them might be). Best to be good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Vibe coding the actual project was relatively painless and took about 3 hours with Opus 4.5, with a few hickups but overall very impressive. The repository is on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/hn-time-capsule">karpathy/hn-time-capsule</a>. Here is the progression of what the code does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a date, download the frontpage of 30 articles</li>
<li>For each article, download/parse the article itself and the full comment thread using Algolia API.</li>
<li>Package up everything into a markdown prompt asking for the analysis. Here is the prompt prefix I used:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span>The following is an article that appeared on Hacker News 10 years ago, and the discussion thread.

Let's use our benefit of hindsight now in 6 sections:

1. Give a brief summary of the article and the discussion thread.
2. What ended up happening to this topic? (research the topic briefly and write a summary)
3. Give out awards for "Most prescient" and "Most wrong" comments, considering what happened.
4. Mention any other fun or notable aspects of the article or discussion.
5. Give out grades to specific people for their comments, considering what happened.
6. At the end, give a final score (from 0-10) for how interesting this article and its retrospect analysis was.

As for the format of Section 5, use the header "Final grades" and follow it with simply an unordered list of people and their grades in the format of "name: grade (optional comment)". Here is an example:

Final grades
- speckx: A+ (excellent predictions on ...)
- tosh: A (correctly predicted this or that ...)
- keepamovin: A
- bgwalter: D
- fsflover: F (completely wrong on ...)

Your list may contain more people of course than just this toy example. Please follow the format exactly because I will be parsing it programmatically. The idea is that I will accumulate the grades for each account to identify the accounts that were over long periods of time the most prescient or the most wrong.

As for the format of Section 6, use the prefix "Article hindsight analysis interestingness score:" and then the score (0-10) as a number. Give high scores to articles/discussions that are prominent, notable, or interesting in retrospect. Give low scores in cases where few predictions are made, or the topic is very niche or obscure, or the discussion is not very interesting in retrospect.

Here is an example:
Article hindsight analysis interestingness score: 8

</pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Submit prompt to GPT 5.1 Thinking via the OpenAI API</li>
<li>Collect and parse the results</li>
<li>Render the results into static HTML web pages for easy viewing</li>
<li>Host the html result pages on my website: <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/">https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/</a></li>
<li>Host all the intermediate results of the <code>data</code> directory if someone else would like to play. It's the file <code>data.zip</code> under the exact same url prefix (intentionally avoiding a direct link).</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent a few hours browsing around and found it to be very interesting. A few example threads just for fun:</p>
<ul>
<li>December 3 2015 <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/2015-12-03/index.html#article-10669891">Swift went open source</a>.</li>
<li>December 6 2015 <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/2015-12-06/index.html#article-10685407">Launch of Figma</a></li>
<li>December 11 2015 <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/2015-12-11/index.html#article-10720176">original announcement of OpenAI</a> :').</li>
<li>December 16 2015 <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/2015-12-16/index.html#article-10744206">geohot is building Comma</a></li>

<li>December 28 2015 <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/2015-12-28/index.html#article-10799261">Theranos struggles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And then when you navigate over to the <a href="https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/hall-of-fame.html">Hall of Fame</a>, you can find the top commenters of Hacker News in December 2015, sorted by imdb-style score of their grade point average. In particular, congratulations to pcwalton, tptacek, paulmd, cstross, greglindahl, moxie, hannob, 0xcde4c3db, Manishearth, johncolanduoni - GPT 5.1 Thinking found your comments very insightful and prescient. You can also scroll all the way down to find the noise of HN, which I think we're all familiar with too :)</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/hn-time-capsule">code</a> (wait, Opus' code?) on GitHub can be used to reproduce or tweak the results. Running 31 days of 30 articles through GPT 5.1 Thinking meant <code>31 * 30 =</code> 930 LLM queries and cost about $58 and somewhere around ~1 hour. The LLM megaminds of the future might find this kind of a thing a lot easier, a lot faster and a lot cheaper.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

        <p>The HDMI Forum, responsible for the HDMI specification, continues to stonewall open source. Valve's Steam Machine theoretically supports HDMI 2.1, but the <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Linux-Konsole-Valve-kuendigt-neue-Steam-Machine-an-11076221.html?from-en=1">mini-PC is software-limited to HDMI 2.0</a>. As a result, more than 60 frames per second at 4K resolution are only possible with limitations.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->




  


<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/why-wont-steam-machine-support-hdmi-2-1-digging-in-on-the-display-standard-drama/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Ars Technica, a Valve spokesperson confirmed</a> that HDMI 2.1 support is "still a work-in-progress on the software side." "We’ve been working on trying to unblock things there."</p>
<p>The Steam Machine uses an AMD Ryzen APU with a Radeon graphics unit. Valve strictly adheres to open-source drivers, but the HDMI Forum is unwilling to disclose the 2.1 specification. According to Valve, they have validated the HDMI 2.1 hardware under Windows to ensure basic functionality.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->

  




<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<h3 id="nav_no_change_after__0">No Change After Almost Two Years</h3>
<p>The restriction imposed by the HDMI Forum <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/AMD-HDMI-Forum-verhindert-HDMI-2-1-unter-Linux-9643729.html?from-en=1">was already criticized in early 2024 by an AMD employee responsible for Linux</a>. Even then, according to AMD, they had submitted a functional, HDMI 2.1-compatible driver, which the HDMI Forum rejected.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the HDMI Forum rejected our proposal," it was stated at the time. "At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements."</p>
<p>Only HDMI 2.1 offers sufficient bandwidth for 120 or 144 Hertz at 3840&nbsp;× 2160 pixels without compression. Furthermore, this version introduced manufacturer-independent variable refresh rates (HDMI VRR). Valve enables 4K and 120 Hertz using chroma subsampling, a compression technique that is particularly noticeable with text. VRR functions in the form of AMD's Freesync, which requires compatible displays.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->


  



  




<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>Alternatively, interested parties can use an active adapter from DisplayPort 1.4 to HDMI 2.1 to increase the frame rate without compression. However, they do not officially support VRR. Popular variants from Club3D are no longer available; <a data-teaser-tracking-content="textlink-pvg" data-teaser-tracking-id="textlink-pvg-pvg_a2664995-1" data-teaser-tracking-name="pvg_a2664995: Lindy DisplayPort 1.4 Stecker auf HDMI 2.1 Buchse, Adapter (41094)" data-teaser-tracking-rank="11107440: Valve: HDMI Forum Continues to Block HDMI 2.1 for…" href="https://preisvergleich.heise.de/lindy-displayport-1-4-stecker-auf-hdmi-2-1-buchse-41094-a2664995.html?cs_id=1206858352&amp;ccpid=hocid-newsticker" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">offers from less well-known providers (starting from 35,67 €)</a> are still available in price comparisons.</p>

  <p>A new toll applied to cars driving in parts of New York City has led to a measurable drop in traffic, and with it, a 22 percent decline in particulate pollution, according to a new study.</p><p>Congestion pricing came into effect in January, with cars paying $9 to drive through busy parts of Manhattan during peak hours. In the first six months of the program, traffic in the congestion zone dropped by 11 percent, accidents by 14 percent, and complaints of excessive honking or other noise by 45 percent, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/congestion-pricing-first-6-months/">officials said</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A new study from Cornell has now tallied the impact on particulate pollution. Particulates issued from tailpipes can aggravate asthma and heart disease and increase the risk of lung cancer and heart attack. Globally, they are a leading risk factor for premature death.</p><p>Analyzing data on air quality, traffic, and weather conditions, researchers determined that in the first half of this year, particulate pollution was down 22 percent in parts of Manhattan affected by congestion pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>The decline seen in New York was greater than in other cities with congestion pricing, such as Stockholm and London, researchers note. And the effect extended beyond Lower Manhattan. Pricing led to a drop in pollution across the greater metropolitan area, according to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44407-025-00037-2">study</a>, published in the journal <i>npj Clean Air.</i></p><p>“It’s really exciting to me that air quality improved throughout the entire metro area,” <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/congestion-pricing-improved-air-quality-nyc-and-suburbs">said lead author</a> Timothy Fraser, of Cornell University. “This tells us that congestion pricing didn’t simply relocate air pollution to the suburbs by rerouting traffic. Instead, folks are likely choosing cleaner transportation options altogether, like riding public transportation or scheduling deliveries at night. This thins traffic and limits how smog compounds when many cars are on the road.”</p><h2><strong>ALSO ON YALE E360</strong></h2><p><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/free-parking-reform"><i><strong>How Parking Reform Is Helping Transform American Cities</strong></i></a></p>

</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosopher-Valley-Palantir-Surveillance-State-ebook/dp/B0D54L7Q4W" rel="">biography </a><span>of Palantir co-founder Alex Karp, “The Philosopher in the Valley: Alex Karp, Palantir, and the Rise of the Surveillance State,” by New York Times journalist Michael Steinberger, he writes that prior to the genocide in Gaza,  “the Mossad had been using Palantir technology,” adding that the Shin Bet and IDF, “ sought to obtain Palantir’s software in the wake of Ocotber 7th”. </span></p><p>He goes on to write that, “The demand for Palantir’s assistance was so great that the company dispatched a a team of engineers from London to help get Israeli users online,” adding, “Palantir ended up having to rent a second-floor building that housed its Tel Aviv office, to accommodate the intelligence analysts who needed tutorials”. </p><p>Revealing what Israel used the AI-powered software for, Michael Steinberger notes, “Its software was used by the Israeli military in several raids in Gaza” and goes on to write that, “The company’s technology was deployed by the Israelis during military operations in Lebanon in 2024 that decimated Hezbollah’s top leadership” adding that, “It was also used in Operation Grim Beeper, in which hundreds of Hezbollah fighters were injured and maimed when their pagers and walkie-talkies exploded (the Israelis had booby trapped the devices)”. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

        <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46214950">Discussion on Hacker News</a>  <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/h7a3xy/stop_breaking_tls">Discussion on lobste.rs</a></p>

<p>Rant ahead: I hate TLS “Inspection” software with a burning passion and I wish we collectively as an industry would just knock it the <em>fuck</em> off and stop pretending it’s some great security benefit. Every time I encounter it, in whatever form, it’s a gigantic headache that makes everyone’s life worse off and as far as I am concerned offers next to zero tangible benefits.</p>

<p>For those blissfully unaware, this is a class of “security” software or appliance that is supposed to let organisations monitor all encrypted traffic. It does this by inserting itself in the middle of traffic, stripping the encryption off so it can inspect it and then re-signing it with its own certificate. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s a widely known class of attack - the Man In The Middle attack. Great stuff, we’re literally deploying the exact attack vector that TLS was designed to prevent, but slapping a “security” label on it.</p>

<p>Firstly, it undermines one of the most important protocols of the modern Internet as it deliberately breaks all the guarantees that TLS encryption is supposed to offer. If the MITM certificate is installed everywhere, your company can intercept and monitor everything you say and do. Consider the ramifications of that - confidential messages to HR, medical information, insider trading information, your banking sessions - would you feel happy BCC’ing every single email to your IT department? Would you print out your therapy notes and pin them to the kitchen notice board?</p>

<p>But even ignoring the philosophical arguments about privacy and trust, I argue it actively makes your security <em>worse</em>. Consider this - what is the likelihood of every certificate authority on the Internet having their private keys compromised simultaneously? I’d wager that’s almost at the whatever is the statistics equivalent of the Planck length level of probability.¹</p>

<p>On the other hand, what’s the chance of your company’s MITM private key getting compromised by an attacker? Even if you completely trust your IT team and vendor (and if you do, you clearly haven’t been paying attention to any tech news for oh… the last few decades), you have to admit that chance is a lot higher. And depending on the vendor or tech stack involved, it could be a LOT higher. One disgruntled employee, one unpatched vulnerability, one phishing email to the right admin and choo-choo, it’s all aboard the FAIL train. Now an attacker could have the keys to your entire kingdom.</p>

<p>Then there’s the practicalities of it. It’s simply a massive hassle. Different Operating Systems expect certificates in different formats (PEM? DER? PFX? P7B?) installed in different places with different tooling to manage it all. <code>update-ca-certificates</code> vs <code>update-ca-trust</code> is just the tip of the iceberg - and that’s just the OS level. You then have language runtimes (Java keystore anyone?) and the applications themselves that all need to be configured.</p>

<p>And the problem is compounded with modern cloud-native apps. In a Kubernetes cluster, as well as having to handle updating the node VM images and container runtimes, you’ll have dozens if not hundreds of different base images each of which has their own standards. Alpine uses a different certificate path than Ubuntu. Your Node app expects them somewhere else entirely. The various CRDs or Helm charts you are using may or may not support custom CA bundles, and if they do there’s no agreed-on standard.</p>

<p>Now I’m not saying that because a problem is hard we should simply give up, but even if the benefits were worth it the simple fact is even with the best tooling and automation, you are <strong>guaranteed</strong> to miss something. Whether it’s some obscure tool that has a custom keystore and non-standard tooling, a quick “one off” command in an ephemeral container, some app that uses certificate pinning or an aging switch firmware that doesn’t even support custom certificate bundles, <em>something</em> will slip through the cracks. And when it does, guess what happens?</p>

<p>Which brings me to my biggest peeve: it normalizes bad security practices. Given that you will never have 100% coverage of your CA certificate installation - particularly amongst your technical teams who will be using a multitude of different tools and platforms - you get developers and sysadmins used to TLS errors. Instead of treating each one as an anomaly and something to be investigated, you get used to just running with <code>--insecure</code> or <code>curl -k</code> because you just need to get shit done. Turning off certificate verification becomes a routine troubleshooting step. “Oh, it’s probably just the corporate proxy again” becomes the reflexive response to any TLS error. You’ve just trained your entire technical staff to ignore one of the most important security warnings on the Internet!</p>

<p>And don’t even get me started on the performance and availability implications. All your traffic now has to be decrypted and re-encrypted by your magic box. Hope you sized that appliance correctly! Hope it doesn’t become a single point of failure! Hope it supports all the latest TLS versions and cipher suites!</p>

<p>There are a multitude of ways to protect yourself that are not only less invasive but are often <em>more</em> effective because they’re designed for how modern infrastructure actually works. Anomaly detection, Zero Trust network architecture, EDR, Netflow analysis… You don’t need to create single points of failure, and you can actually work with modern cloud-native infrastructure instead of fighting it. Plus, y’know, there’s this AI thing which as it turns out is actually quite useful at analysing metadata and spotting odd behavioral patterns.</p>

<p>In my experience: TLS <del>Inspection</del> MITM is a gigantic administrative burden, it normalizes bad practice, it creates bottlenecks and availability risks, and actively worsens your security posture.</p>

<p>Just stop it already.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE :</strong> This was a particularly cathartic rant, and I didn’t expect it to blow up and hit the front page of Hacker News! While I was venting away, I do appreciate that there is actually some nuance at play here so for a fuller discussion with some dissenting opinions, please do check out the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46214950">comment thread</a>.</p>

<p>¹ = In particular, I worded this poorly. What I was thinking of was more along the lines of being able to do this without detection via CT logs etc. A commenter on HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46214950#46215764">pointed out</a> that you only need one trusted CA to be compromised which is of course true.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/revisiting-lets-build-a-compiler/">https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/revisiting-lets-build-a-compiler/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46214693">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>There's an old compiler-building tutorial that has become part of the field's
lore: the <a href="https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/">Let's Build a Compiler</a>
series by Jack Crenshaw (published between 1988 and 1995).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2003/07/29/great-compilers-tutorial">ran into it in 2003</a>
and was very impressed, but it's now 2025 and this tutorial is still being mentioned quite
often <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=crenshaw&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=all">in Hacker News threads</a>.
Why is that? Why does a tutorial from 35
years ago, built in Pascal and emitting Motorola 68000 assembly - technologies that
are virtually unknown for the new generation of programmers - hold sway over
compiler enthusiasts? I've decided to find out.</p>
<p>The tutorial is <a href="https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/">easily available and readable online</a>, but
just re-reading it seemed insufficient. So I've decided on meticulously
translating the compilers built in it to Python and emit a more modern target -
WebAssembly. It was an enjoyable process and I want to share the outcome and
some insights gained along the way.</p>
<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/eliben/letsbuildacompiler">this code repository</a>.
Of particular interest is the <a href="https://github.com/eliben/letsbuildacompiler/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md">TUTORIAL.md file</a>,
which describes how each part in the original tutorial is mapped to my code. So
if you want to read the original tutorial but play with code you can actually
easily try on your own, feel free to follow my path.</p>
<div id="a-sample">
<h2>A sample</h2>
<p>To get a taste of the input language being compiled and the output my compiler
generates, here's a sample program in the KISS language designed by Jack
Crenshaw:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>var X=0

 { sum from 0 to n-1 inclusive, and add to result }
 procedure addseq(n, ref result)
     var i, sum  { 0 initialized }
     while i &lt; n
         sum = sum + i
         i = i + 1
     end
     result = result + sum
 end

 program testprog
 begin
     addseq(11, X)
 end
 .
</pre></div>
<p>It's from part 13 of the tutorial, so it showcases procedures along with control
constructs like the <tt>while</tt> loop, and passing parameters both by value and by
reference. Here's the WASM text generated by my compiler for part 13:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>module</span>

</pre></div>
<p>You'll notice that there is some trickiness in the emitted code w.r.t. handling
the by-reference parameter (my <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/notes-on-the-wasm-basic-c-abi/">previous post</a>
deals with this issue in more detail). In general, though, the emitted code is
inefficient - there is close to 0 optimization applied.</p>
<p>Also, if you're very diligent you'll notice something odd about the global
variable <tt>X</tt> - it seems to be implicitly returned by the generated <tt>main</tt>
function. This is just a testing facility that makes my compiler easy to test.
All the compilers are extensively tested - usually by running the
generated WASM code <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> and verifying expected results.</p>
</div>
<div id="insights-what-makes-this-tutorial-so-special">
<h2>Insights - what makes this tutorial so special?</h2>
<p>While reading the original tutorial again, I had on opportunity to reminisce on
what makes it so effective. Other than the very fluent and conversational
writing style of Jack Crenshaw, I think it's a combination of two key
factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The tutorial builds a recursive-descent parser step by step, rather than
giving a long preface on automata and table-based parser generators. When
I first encountered it (in 2003), it was taken for granted that if you want
to write a parser then lex + yacc are the way to go <a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>. Following the
development of a simple and clean hand-written
parser was a revelation that wholly changed my approach to the subject;
subsequently, hand-written recursive-descent parsers have been my go-to approach
<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/recursive-descent-parsing">for almost 20 years now</a>.</li>
<li>Rather than getting stuck in front-end minutiae, the tutorial goes straight
to generating working assembly code, from very early on. This was also a
breath of fresh air for engineers who grew up with more traditional courses
where you spend 90% of the time on parsing, type checking and other semantic
analysis and often run entirely out of steam by the time code generation
is taught.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be honest, I don't think either of these are a big problem with modern
resources, but back in the day the tutorial clearly hit the right nerve with
many people.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-else-does-it-teach-us">
<h2>What else does it teach us?</h2>
<p>Jack Crenshaw's tutorial takes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax-directed_translation">syntax-directed translation</a>
approach, where code is emitted <em>while parsing</em>, without having to divide the
compiler into explicit phases with IRs. As I said above, this is a fantastic
approach for getting started, but in the latter parts of the tutorial it starts
showing its limitations. Especially once we get to types, it becomes painfully
obvious that it would be very nice if we knew the types of expressions <em>before</em>
we generate code for them.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is implicated in Jack Crenshaw's abandoning the tutorial
at some point after part 14, but it may very well be. He keeps writing how
the emitted code is clearly sub-optimal <a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a> and can be improved, but IMHO it's
just not that easy to improve using the syntax-directed translation strategy.
With perfect hindsight vision, I would probably use Part 14 (types) as a turning
point - emitting some kind of AST from the parser and then doing simple type
checking and analysis on that AST prior to generating code from it.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, the original tutorial remains a wonderfully readable introduction
to building compilers. This post and the <a href="https://github.com/eliben/letsbuildacompiler">GitHub repository</a>
it describes are a modest
contribution that aims to improve the experience of folks reading the original
tutorial today and not willing to use obsolete technologies. As always, let
me know if you run into any issues or have questions!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
            <p>This week, Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson and WordPress founding developer Matt Mullenweg started fighting about what "open source" means. I've spent twenty years working on open source sustainability, and I have some thoughts.</p>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson (also known as DHH) released a new kanban tool, Fizzy, this week and <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/fizzy-is-our-fun-modern-take-on-kanban-and-we-made-it-open-source-54ac41b6">called it open source</a>.</p>
<p>People quickly pointed out that the <a href="https://www.fizzy.do/license">O'Saasy license</a> that Fizzy is released under blocks others from offering a competing SaaS version, which violates the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Initiative's definition</a>. When challenged, he brushed it off on X and said, "You know this is just some shit people made up, right?". He followed with "Open source is when the source is open. Simple as that".</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://ma.tt/2025/12/dhh-open-source/">Matt Mullenweg rightly pushed back</a>. He argued that you can't ignore the Open Source Initiative definition. He compared it to North Korea calling itself a democracy. A clumsy analogy, but the point stands.</p>
<p>Look, the term "open source" has a specific, shared meaning. It is not a loose idea and not something you can repurpose for marketing. Thousands of people shaped that definition over decades. Ignoring that work means benefiting from the community while setting aside its rules.</p>
<p>This whole debate becomes spicier knowing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vagyIcmIGOQ">DHH was on Lex Fridman's podcast</a> only a few months ago, appealing to the spirit and ethics of open source to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=vagyIcmIGOQ&amp;t=20506">criticize Matt's handling of the WP Engine dispute</a>. If the definition is just "shit people made up", what spirit was Matt violating?</p>
<p>The definition debate matters, but the bigger issue here is sustainability. DHH's choice of license reacts to a real pressure in open source: many companies make real money from open source software while leaving the hard work of building and maintaining it to others.</p>
<p>This tension also played a role in <a href="https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem">Matt's fight with WP Engine</a>, so he and DHH share some common ground, even if they handle it differently. We see the same thing in Drupal, where contributions from the biggest companies in our ecosystem is extremely uneven.</p>
<p>DHH can experiment because Fizzy is new. He can choose a different license and see how it works. Matt can't as WordPress has been licensed under the GPL for more than twenty years. Changing that now is virtually impossible.</p>
<p>Both conversations are important, but watching two of the most influential people in open source argue about definitions while we all wrestle with <a href="https://dri.es/scaling-open-source-communities">free riders</a> feels a bit like firefighters arguing about hose lengths during a fire.</p>
<p>The definition debate matters because open source only works when we agree on what the term means. But sustainability decides whether projects like Drupal, WordPress, and Ruby on Rails keep thriving for decades to come. That is the conversation we need to have.</p>
<p>In Drupal, we are experimenting with contribution credits and with guiding work toward companies that support the project. These ideas have helped, but also have not solved the imbalance.</p>
<p>Six years ago I wrote in <a href="https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source">my Makers and Takers blog post</a> that I would love to see new licenses that "encourage software free riding", but "discourage customer free riding". O'Saasy is exactly that kind of experiment.</p>
<p>A more accurate framing would be that Fizzy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software">source available</a>. You can read it, run it, and modify it. But DHH's company is keeping the SaaS rights because they want to be able to build a sustainable business. That is defensible and generous, but it is <em>not</em> open source.</p>
<p>I still do not have the full answer to the open source sustainability problem. I have been wrestling with it for more than twenty years. But I do know the solution is not renaming the problem.</p>
<p>Some questions are worth asking, and answering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we distinguish between companies that can't contribute and those that won't?</li>
<li>What actually changes corporate behavior: shame, self-interest, punitive action, exclusive benefits, or regulation?</li>
</ul>
<p>If this latest fight nudges us away from word games and toward these questions, some good may come from it.</p>

The topic of the Rust experiment was just discussed at the annual
Maintainers Summit.  The consensus among the assembled developers is that
Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental — it is now a core part of the
kernel and is here to stay.  So the "experimental" tag will be coming off.
Congratulations are in order for all of the Rust for Linux team.

														<p><strong>In its first six months, New York City’s controversial congestion pricing scheme has reduced air pollution by 22% in Manhattan’s toll zone, while improving air quality across the entire metropolitan region, according to new research.</strong></p>
<p>The Cornell University study analysed data from 42 air quality monitors throughout the New York area between January 2024 and June 2025, tracking PM2.5 concentrations before and after the January 2025 launch of the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg" alt="yellow cab on road during daytime" width="800" height="508" srcset="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg 1600w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-300x191.jpg 300w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-768x488.jpg 768w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-1536x975.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><br>
The findings provide the first rigorous evidence that charging drivers to enter Manhattan’s core delivers substantial public health benefits.</p>
<p>Within the CRZ, which covers Manhattan streets at or below 60th Street, average daily peak concentrations of PM2.5 dropped by 3.05 µg/m³. For context, background pollution levels in the region typically hover around 8-9 µg/m³, making this reduction particularly significant for public health.</p>
<p>Notably, the benefits were found to extend far beyond the toll zone itself. Across New York City’s five boroughs, pollution levels fell by an average of 1.07 µg/m³, while the broader metropolitan area saw reductions of 0.70 µg/m³. This refutes claims that congestion pricing merely pushes traffic and its associated pollution to neighboring communities.</p>
<p>The improvements grew stronger over time, suggesting drivers are increasingly adapting their behavior. In the CRZ’s first week, pollution reductions within the toll zone averaged just 0.8 µg/m³. By the 20th week, that figure had grown to 4.9 µg/m³, suggesting commuters were switching to public transit, rescheduling trips or finding alternative routes.</p>
<p>Indeed, traffic data supports this. Between January and June 2025, vehicle entries into the toll zone dropped approximately 11% overall, with heavy-duty truck traffic falling by 18% and passenger cars declining by 9%. The disproportionate reduction in truck traffic appears particularly important, as these vehicles contribute heavily to urban air pollution despite representing a smaller share of total traffic.</p>
<p>The results exceed outcomes from similar programs in European cities. Stockholm’s congestion pricing reduced air pollution by 5-15% over several years, while London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone achieved roughly a 7% citywide decline. The researchers suggest that New York’s comparatively larger impact reflects the city’s exceptional transit infrastructure and the high volume of discretionary trips that drivers can easily shift to subways and buses.</p>
<p>The findings arrive as other American cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, consider implementing their own congestion pricing systems. New York’s experience suggests such programs can deliver rapid environmental benefits while generating revenue for transit improvements – a dual outcome that urban planners have long sought but rarely achieved.</p>
<p>Senior author Oliver Gao said: ‘Our overall conclusion is that congestion pricing in New York City, like many other cities in the world that have implemented it, helped not only improve traffic, but also helped reduce air pollutant concentration, improve air quality and should be good for public health.’</p>
<p>The study’s co-lead author Timothy Fraser added: ‘It’s really exciting to me that air quality improved throughout the entire metro area. This tells us that congestion pricing didn’t simply relocate air pollution to the suburbs by rerouting traffic. Instead, folks are likely choosing cleaner transportation options altogether, like riding public transportation or scheduling deliveries at night. This thins traffic and limits how smog compounds when many cars are on the road.’</p>
