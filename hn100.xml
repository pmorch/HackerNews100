                <div id="art-body-desc">
                        <p>Last week, the US Forest Service announced it would stop prescribed burning in California “<a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1994972/forest-service-halts-prescribed-burns-california-worth-risk">for the foreseeable future,</a>” stating that the decision was made as a precautionary measure to ensure the availability of staff and equipment in case of potential wildfires. But temps are falling across California, and state, tribal authorities, and prescribed burn associations have commenced with their prescribed burns. If the federal agency doesn’t hold up its end of the work, all that mitigation work can be undone.</p>
<p>To grasp the impact of the Forest Service’s decision on California, it’s essential to understand the history of the state and the intricate mosaic of private, state, and federal land that constitutes the forests. Over the past 100 years, the state and federal governments relied on a “<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/tending-the-wild/paper">paramilitary-like program</a>” that focused on fire suppression by rapidly mobilizing firefighters and equipment. Very little was done regarding fire prevention besides creating the famous Smokey Bear ad campaign. One of the problems was that colonialist attitudes of fire officials constantly disregarded the valuable knowledge of forest management practices held by California’s Indigenous communities. One such practice is prescribed burning, which involves intentionally setting controlled fires to remove dry vegetation that could serve as “ladder fuel,” allowing wildfires to spread to taller vegetation. Without this mitigation work, the buildup of vegetation and increasing average global temperatures has created the conditions for the mega-wildfires we see in the West today.</p>
<p>These destructive fires have over time shifted state and federal policies toward wildfire mitigation. California’s recently enacted 2024-25 budget includes <a href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2024-25/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/NaturalResourcesandEnvironmentalProtection.pdf">$4.2 billion and 12,512 positions</a> for CAL FIRE, which provides resource management and fire protection services across 31 million acres of state forests. However, California relies on the federal government to maintain areas outside state and local control, mainly the 20 million acres of National Forests managed by the Forest Service. The Forest Service, like many other federal agencies, lacks stable long-term funding because the continuing resolution process constantly threatens its programs. In the past, these issues have had dire consequences for Californians.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Caldor Fire started in the El Dorado National Forest, and the Forest Service knew this region was at risk. The agency had created a model two decades before the fire predicting the danger and proposed the Trestle Project in 2013 to manage federal land near the town of Grizzly Flats. The project was expected to be completed by 2020. However, an <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/08/16/how-we-measured-us-forest-service-wildfire-prevention-work/">investigation</a> by CapRadio and the California Newsroom discovered only 2,137 acres of the planned 15,000, or 14 percent of the project, had been completed before August 14, 2021. That was the day the Caldor Fire started, and 48 hours later, the fire had leveled Grizzly Flats.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/26/1125172945/forest-service-fell-short-of-executing-plan-to-protect-town-from-fire-probe-find"> NPR</a>, the Trestle Project faced “staffing shortages, pushback from environmental groups, too many days when prescribed burns would be dangerous due to hotter, drier conditions caused by climate change,” and, most importantly, a lack of funding. Unfortunately, the Trestle Project’s setbacks left Grizzly Flats and other El Dorado County communities vulnerable to the scenario the Forest Service had modeled.&nbsp; Tellingly, as the fire moved east toward Lake Tahoe, the community of Kirkwood was <a href="https://snowbrains.com/kirkwood-mountain-resort-no-fire-damage-caldor/">spared</a> thanks to an <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd741953.pdf">escaped prescribed burn</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>This scenario shows what happens when Congress is less committed than California to tackling forest management. With wildfire management funding constantly tied up in unpredictable budget debates, the current state-federal partnership is fragile and based on the whims of the legislative and executive branches, which can withhold funding based on which political party is currently in power. The Forest Service’s latest decision is the consequence of these issues.</p>
<p>Congress must commit to forest management by providing stable and reliable funding for wildfire prevention. Forest management is not a partisan issue – it is a matter of public safety, environmental protection, and economic sustainability. It’s well past time to put politics aside and cooperate with California and other fire-prone states to ensure that we provide the resources needed to manage forests, reduce the danger of wildfires, and safeguard communities.</p>
<p>EDIT: The original version of this article referred to Smokey Bear as Smokey the Bear. Officially, the mascot is named Smokey Bear. In popular culture, the “the” was added by a song in 1952 by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins and stuck with the general public.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>One of the best parts of antitrust trials is how much information comes into the public domain about corporations that usually keep details about their industry private. The Kroger-Albertsons supermarket merger case is no different. One interesting nugget is that supermarket executives sees rural markets as particularly easy to monopolize, because there is often just one store. They even have a name, “no-comp[etition] or low-comp[etition] zones,” according to one executive on the stand.</p><p>Of course that makes sense, we’d expect firms to maximize profits where they can. One might be tempted to say, well, there are some towns that can’t support more than one store. And that might be true, except that there are several examples of supermarket chains using tactics in such towns to thwart the opening of competition. How? Well, they find a way to dominate the existing plots of land and building suitable for such a store.</p><p><span>In June, for instance, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is also litigating against the merger, </span><a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/legislation-regulatory-news/albertsons-lifts-land-use-restriction-in-washington" rel="">fined</a><span> Albertsons $25,000 for imposing a land use restriction on a store it sold in 2018 in a low-income section of Bellingham, Washington. As part of the sale, the supermarket giant put a requirement on the deed that no grocery store could open there until 2038. Ferguson found this provision was a violation of the state antitrust law.</span></p><p>These kinds of land use restrictions are likely common. A few months ago, I got an email from an economist explaining how Albertsons abuses its monopoly power in a small skiing town in rural California using a similar strategy. </p><blockquote><p>I’m in Mammoth, CA. The town needs more grocery, but they’re limited on land. There’s a vacant Kmart that is desirable, BUT the local Vons grocery (which is owned by Albertsons) is leasing the old Kmart of keep it vacant (to the tune of $750k annually). The community is outraged, but feels they cant do anything…</p><p>It’s so apparent walking in the Vons in that region that customer service is dismissed. Workers aren’t happy, store shelves aren’t stocked, and the general messiness is simply undignified.”</p></blockquote><p><span>In Mammoth Lakes, there are two old K-Mart lots that could easily welcome competitive grocery stores, but both are foreclosed by Albertsons. According to </span><a href="https://www.easternsierranow.com/whats-bugging-you-eastern-sierra-oh-tenants-where-art-thou/" rel="">the mayor</a><span>, there are deed restrictions that “deter big box retailers such as Target/Walmart, and basically completely block grocery retailers.” According to a different media outlet, the prohibition is not in the deed, but is a direct leasing arrangement. Vons </span><a href="https://thesheetnews.com/2019/11/15/bishop-kmart-to-close/" rel="">started</a><span> leasing one plot in 2019 when K-Mart went under, “holding the space hostage.” It now leases the other as well. It doesn’t actually matter which strategy is involved, both are intended to restrict new grocery stores so there’s no competition.</span></p><p>And it looks as if Albertson’s monopolization strategy has worked. Here are the first several Google reviews about the local Vons, along with pictures.</p><blockquote><p>“The most expensive Vons in California is also in the worst physical condition,” wrote one reviewer. “Worn and missing floor tiles, empty shelves, rude employees etc…”</p><p>“This is effectively the only grocery store in town and seems to have a hard time keeping items in stock…”</p><p>“There were a lot of bare shelves and the vegetables looked well picked over. Got the 6 items that I wanted and tried to pay. Self check-out counters were all closed. There was only one cash register light on and NOBODY was there…”</p><p>“Definitely the worst and dirtiest Vons I've ever seen… It's clear the owners operate on the "only game in town" ethos. Losers...”</p><p>“Always a terrible experience at this store. Limited selection of items and saying the older female checker is surly is an understatement. She doesn't understand Vons and Safeway are the same, yelled at me for adding items to our order, refused to honor the digital coupon prices and told us to shop at Grocery Outlet…”</p><p>“Consensus among locals is that everything purchased here basically rots within a day or so of purchase…”</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<p>Contemporary high-level programming languages and advanced compilers greatly simplify software development and lower its costs. However, this way of programming can hide the performance capabilities of modern hardware, partly due to inefficiencies of application programming interfaces (APIs). Apparently, a good old assembly code path can improve performance by between three and 94 times, depending on the workload, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/FFmpeg/status/1852542388851601913" data-url="https://x.com/FFmpeg/status/1852542388851601913" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">FFmpeg</a>. The hardware this multiplied performance was achieved on was not disclosed.</p><p>FFmpeg is an open-source video decoding project developed by volunteers who contribute to its codebase, fix bugs, and add new features. The project is led by a small group of core developers and maintainers who oversee its direction and ensure that contributions meet certain standards. They coordinate the project's development and release cycles, merging contributions from other developers. This group of developers tried to implement a handwritten AVX512 assembly code path, something that has rarely been done before, at least not in the video industry.</p><p>The developers have created an optimized code path using the AVX-512 instruction set to accelerate specific functions within the FFmpeg multimedia processing library. By leveraging AVX-512, they were able to achieve significant performance improvements — from three to 94 times faster — compared to standard implementations. AVX-512 enables processing large chunks of data in parallel using 512-bit registers, which can handle up to 16 single-precision FLOPS or 8 double-precision FLOPS in one operation. This optimization is ideal for compute-heavy tasks in general, but in the case of video and image processing in particular.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark">benchmarking</a> results show that the new handwritten AVX-512 code path performs considerably faster than other implementations, including baseline C code and lower SIMD instruction sets like AVX2 and SSSE3. In some cases, the revamped AVX-512 codepath achieves a speedup of nearly 94 times over the baseline, highlighting the efficiency of hand-optimized assembly code for AVX-512.</p><p>This development is particularly valuable for users running on high-performance, AVX-512-capable hardware, enabling them to process media content far more efficiently. There is an issue, though: Intel disabled AVX-512 for its Core 12th, 13th, and 14th Generations of Core processors, leaving owners of these CPUs without them. On the other hand, AMD's Ryzen 9000-series CPUs feature a fully-enabled AVX-512 FPU so the owners of these processors can take advantage of the FFmpeg achievement.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the complexity and specialized nature of AVX-512, such optimizations are typically reserved for performance-critical applications and require expertise in low-level programming and processor microarchitecture.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SDpvGFrC3qiFsDcJ94h8pj"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

        <p>What does it mean to keep security in mind when writing Go code? Answering this question in one short article seems impossible. For this reason, we will narrow it down to a few specific practices.</p>
<p>They will lead to writing robust, secure and performant code when applied continuously.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we stay informed about the Go security announcements?</li>
<li>How do we keep our Go code patched and up to date?</li>
<li>How do we test our Go code focusing on security and robustness?</li>
<li>What are CVEs, and where do we learn about the most common software vulnerabilities?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the most obvious place - the Go mailing list. We need to subscribe to get all critical security information right from the source.
All releases that contain security fixes are announced to the <code><a href="https://jarosz.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="bcdbd3d0ddd2db91ddd2d2d3c9d2dfd9fcdbd3d3dbd0d9dbced3c9cccf92dfd3d1">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> list.
Once we subscribe to the list, we can be sure we won’t miss any important announcements.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-go-version-up-to-date">Keeping Go version up to date</h2>
<p>The second step is to keep the Go versions in our projects current. Even though we don’t use the latest and greatest language features, bumping the Go version gives us all security patches for discovered vulnerabilities. Also, the new Go version ensures compatibility with newer dependencies.
It protects our applications from potential integration issues.</p>
<p>The third step is to learn which security issues and CVEs are addressed in what Go releases. We can check it on the Go release history website and then update it to the latest version in the <code>go.mod</code> files in our projects.</p>
<p>After upgrading to new versions of Go, we should ensure that the operation does not introduce compatibility and dependency problems, especially with third-party packages. It can be more risky when we work on large projects with tens and sometimes hundreds of direct and indirect package dependencies.</p>
<p>The point is to maintain the risk by eliminating potential dependency problems. The problems may include an urgent need to refactor the existing code to make it work with a new dependency. Examples of such issues include changed packages, APIs or function signatures.</p>

<p>We can concentrate on the project source code after we know we will use the Go version without security issues. We can start assessing code quality and security by employing static code analysers.</p>
<h3 id="vet">vet</h3>
<p>Before installing and using third-party analysers, it’s a good idea to use the Go “native” <code>go vet</code> command.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>go vet</code> command to analyse our Go code. The <code>go vet</code> command without arguments runs the tool with all options allowed by default. The tool scans the source code and reports potential issues. The issues include code syntax errors and certain programming constructs that can cause problems during program executions.</p>
<p>Most common issues include goroutine mistakes, unused variables and unreachable areas of the codebase. The main advantage of using the <code>go vet</code> command is that it is a part of the Go toolbox.</p>
<p>In a separate article, we will dive deeper into the <code>vet</code> details. The extensive documentation and examples are on the <code>go vet</code> <a href="https://golang.google.cn/cmd/vet/">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="staticcheck">staticcheck</h3>
<p>Staticcheck is another static code analyser. It’s a third-party linter that helps to find bugs and detects possible performance problems. It also enforces Go language styling. It offers code simplifications, explains discovered issues and suggests corrections with examples.</p>
<p>Besides running staticcheck in a CI pipeline, we can install <code>staticcheck</code> on our laptops as a standalone binary and scan the code locally. Let’s install the latest version:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>No errors on the terminal? If so, we are ready to run the scans. But first, let’s check the installed version to ensure everything looks good.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>staticcheck --version
</span></span><span><span>staticcheck 2024.1.1 <span>(</span>0.5.1<span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Similarly to the <code>go vet</code>, running <code>staticcheck</code> without arguments invokes all code analysers by default. This approach plays nicely with the UNIX programming philosophy of using sensible defaults and not forcing users to do unnecessary paperwork.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the tool can find in the <a href="https://github.com/nginx/agent">NGINX Agent</a> GitHub repository. First, we need to clone it:</p>
<p>Then, we can run it from the root directory of the project:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  agent git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ staticcheck ./...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After a short moment, we are ready to check the scanning results. We can categorise the listed examples into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>packages, methods or functions that are deprecated, for example:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>src/core/metrics/sources/cpu.go:111:9: times.Total is deprecated: Total returns the total number of seconds in a CPUTimesStat Please <span>do</span> not use this internal <span>function</span>. <span>(</span>SA1019<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>test/component/nginx-app-protect/monitoring/monitoring_test.go:15:8: <span>"github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb"</span> is deprecated: Use the <span>"google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"</span> package instead. <span>(</span>SA1019<span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>unused variables and fields, for example:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>src/core/metrics/sources/nginx_plus.go:74:2: field endpoints is unused <span>(</span>U1000<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>src/core/metrics/sources/nginx_plus.go:75:2: field streamEndpoints is unused <span>(</span>U1000<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>src/core/metrics/sources/nginx_plus_test.go:94:2: var availableZones is unused <span>(</span>U1000<span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>possible problems related to the quality of the code, for example:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>src/core/nginx.go:791:4: ineffective break statement. Did you mean to break out of the outer loop? <span>(</span>SA4011<span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, we are ready to start analysing the highlighted issues. A detailed deep dive into the codebase is outside this introductory article’s scope. We will do deeper code analysis, show examples, and fix security and performance issues in upcoming articles.</p>
<p>For now, let’s take note of CWE websites that contain tons of information about listed weaknesses so we can study them at a later time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unused variables</li>
<li>Using deprecated constructs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golangci-lint">golangci-lint</h3>
<p>The third code analyser we are going to employ is <code>golangci-lint</code>. As with all Go tools, we can install it in a variety of ways, including the <code>go install</code> command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s verify if the installation went well and check the version:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>golangci-lint --version
</span></span><span><span>golangci-lint has version v1.61.0 built with go1.23.2
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Perfect! All looks good.</p>
<p>Following the same principle of the least surprise, <code>golangci-lint</code> runs all linters when we invoke it with no arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens when we check the cloned earlier <code>agent</code> repository? Will <code>golangci-lint</code> show us the same warnings and suggestions? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>As previously, we will start scanning the project from its root directory.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  agent git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ golangci-lint run ./...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Almost immediately, we noticed a list of suggestions for improving the code! For example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>src/extensions/nginx-app-protect/monitoring/processor/nap_test.go:60:14: S1025: the argument is already a string, there<span>'</span>s no need to use fmt.Sprintf <span>(</span>gosimple<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span> logEntry: fmt.Sprintf<span>(</span><span>`</span>%s<span>`</span>, func<span>()</span> string <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span> ^
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>src/plugins/common.go:85:5: S1009: should omit nil check; len<span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>[]</span>string is defined as zero <span>(</span>gosimple<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span> <span>if</span> loadedConfig.Extensions !<span>=</span> nil <span>&amp;&amp;</span> len<span>(</span>loadedConfig.Extensions<span>)</span> &gt; <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    ^
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The linter points to exact files and lines that need our attention. Our job now is to assess the code, make changes, run the liner a second time and run all unit tests. If the tests are green, we can commit updated code. Job done! Ok, we still need to push it to the remote.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-race-conditions">Detecting race conditions</h2>
<p>Race conditions in our programs and libraries can occur when multiple goroutines try to access a resource concurrently. These conditions
are detected when at least one goroutine tries to write (change) the resource. For example, the resource can be a global, package-level variable that acts as a counter.
This situation in a program can lead to subtle, very hard-to-diagnose and detect bugs.</p>
<p>Go has native support for testing such conditions. We run tests using the Go <code>test</code> tool with the argument <code>-race</code>.
This method will run the race detector and help identify problems in concurent programs.</p>
<p>There is one warning we need to remember. The detector can assess the executed code and will ignore code paths that are not executed. So, it’s crucial to run static code analysers first and make sure we do not have so-called dead code in our project.</p>
<p>When we tell Go: “Hey, run tests with the <code>-race</code> argument”, the Go compiler compiles the code with the race detector enabled. Then, tests are run, and possible race conditions are checked at runtime. When races are detected, the tool will print a detailed report. It will show what goroutines try to access which resources.</p>
<p>Another way to increase the chances of detecting concurrency issues is to run tests in parallel. To do so we need to inform the runner explicitly by adding <code>t.Parallel()</code> to our tests.</p>
<p>Two tests executed in parallel</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>TestParseDiskSpace</span>(<span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span>.<span>T</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>t</span>.<span>Parallel</span>()
</span></span><span><span>    <span>...</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>TestParseMemoryUsage</span>(<span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span>.<span>T</span>) {

<h2 id="scanning-source-code-for-vulnerabilities">Scanning source code for vulnerabilities</h2>
<h3 id="govulncheck">govulncheck</h3>
<p>We have a broad choice of tools that scan the codebase for known vulnerabilities listed in the <a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVEs</a> database.</p>
<p>Our default tool for ensuring we develop and release safe code is <code>govulncheck</code>. We can install it locally on a developer’s machine and run scans locally before committing and pushing our code to a remote Git repository.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can integrate the scanning step with CI pipelines in GitHub or GitLab. Then, the scan can be invoked on each merge request to ensure we do not introduce vulnerabilities in the project.</p>
<p><code>govulncheck</code> is developed by the Go team. A dedicated database of Go vulnerabilities provides information for the scanner.
Let’s install <code>govulncheck</code> locally and try basic functionality.</p>
<p>To install the latest version, we need to run the following command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It’s time to check if the installation process went well:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>govulncheck -version
</span></span><span><span>Go: go1.23.2
</span></span><span><span>Scanner: <a href="https://jarosz.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="dabdb5acafb6b4b9b2bfb9b19aacebf4ebf4e9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
</span></span><span><span>DB: https://vuln.go.dev
</span></span><span><span>DB updated: 2024-10-17 15:37:30 +0000 UTC
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We are ready to run our first scan. Let’s clone the <a href="https://github.com/qba73/habit">habit</a> git repository. Then, navigate to its root directory and run the tool.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  habit git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ govulncheck
</span></span><span><span>No vulnerabilities found.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It looks promising! We did not find vulnerabilities in the source code. Are we done? Not really! We built the habit binary when the <code>go.mod</code> file defined the version of Go 1.18. The current version is v1.23.2.</p>
<p>Let’s scan the habit binary, not the source code.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  habit git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ govulncheck -mode binary -show verbose habit
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We run <code>govulncheck</code> in the binary mode. It means that we can scan any Go binary we have access to! We do not need source code! Then, we run the scan in the verbose mode. It will show the complete report broken into multiple sections. The last argument is the name of the binary we want to scan.</p>
<p>Hmmm! This report does look different! What just happened?</p>

<p>The remaining sections contain information about other vulnerabilities discovered in standard Go libraries. Ok, but are we affected? Is our program not secure?</p>
<p>The final scan report tells us we should not worry. Our program <em>doesn’t appear to call

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>Your code is affected by <span>0</span> vulnerabilities.

<h3 id="gosec">gosec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/securego/gosec"><code>gosec</code></a> is a static code analyzer. It helps to find insecure code constructs.
We can install it locally on our laptops or run it as a GitHub Action in a CI pipeline. As described earlier, <code>golangci-lint</code> includes the <code>gosec</code> as a plugin and runs it as default on each code scan.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a try and install the scanner locally.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we do not see errors, <code>gosec</code> is ready for action. Before running our first scan, let’s look at the menu:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>gosec -h
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>gosec - Golang security checker
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>gosec analyses Go source code to look <span>for</span> common programming mistakes that
</span></span><span><span>can lead to security problems.
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can use a long list of options and rules to configure the scanner behaviour. Going into details of specific options is outside of the scope of this article. A detailed tutorial on configuring, running and benefiting from this SAST tool is coming soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>To try gosec, we need to clone a GitHub repository with the Go code we want to scan.</p>
<p>Let’s clone the <a href="https://github.com/CyberRoute/bruter">brutus</a> repository. It’s an open-source experimental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">OSINT</a> app for testing web server configuration.</p>
<p>Next, change our current directory to the project’s root directory and start scanning.</p>
<p>After a couple of seconds, <code>gosec</code> presents the scan report. What can we learn immediately? We see a list of potential issues sorted by severity and confidence.
We know what part of the code needs attention and what weakness classification the issue applies to. Perfect! What’s next?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>[</span>/.../bruter/pkg/fuzzer/randomua.go:69<span>]</span> - G404 <span>(</span>CWE-338<span>)</span>: Use of weak random number generator <span>(</span>math/rand or math/rand/v2 instead of crypto/rand<span>)</span> <span>(</span>Confidence: MEDIUM, Severity: HIGH<span>)</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At this stage of our investigation, we can check reported CWEs and learn about details of listed weaknesses. For example, the second listed issue brings us to the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html">CWE-295</a> website, where we can learn more about vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzing">Fuzzing</h2>
<p>The last method of checking code quality and discovering vulnerabilities is fuzz testing. Fuzzing is a special kind of automated testing. It uses code test coverage to manipulate randomly generated input data.</p>
<p>It’s extremely helpful in finding potential security flaws like buffer overflows, <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL injections</a>, <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Denial_of_Service">DoS attacks</a> and <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS attacks</a>. The most crucial attribute of fuzzing is that many input combinations are generated automatically! Developers don’t need to scratch their heads trying to figure out hundreds, if not thousands, of input data combinations! What a relief!</p>
<p>We will focus on fuzzing in more detail in upcoming tutorials.</p>
<p>Most of the methods and testing techniques we discussed today are encouraged by <a href="https://openssf.org/best-practices-badge/">OpenSSF</a> foundation. Open source projects that want to get the Best Practice Badge are required to meet <a href="https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria/0">FLOSS criteria</a> in areas like licencing, change control, vulnerability reporting, quality, security and static and dynamic security code analysis.</p>
<p>Stay secure, free from CVEs and enjoy programming!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/">John Arundel</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Programming is fun, and you should have fun!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Till next time!</p>

<h2>High Performance Scientific Calculator, Reinvented</h2>
<p>DB48X is a modern scientific calculator in the spirit of the Hewlett-Packard HP48X, featuring a complete, from-scratch reimplementation of the Reverse Polish Lisp (RPL) programming language. The firmware is initially designed for the SwissMicros <a href="https://www.swissmicros.com/product/model-dm32">DM32</a> and <a href="https://www.swissmicros.com/product/dm42">DM42</a> calculators. In other words, it is optimized for physical hardware that you can keep in your pocket. There is also an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/db50x/id6625971367?l=en-GB">iPhone version</a> if you want to run this on your phone or display graphs in colour.</p>
<p>You can try the calculator firmware directly in your browser by clicking on the following image:</p>

            <p><em>Vogue</em> is an RIAA-certified triple-platinum hit, selling over six million copies since its 1991 release on the "I'm Breathless" album by pop mega-star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna?ref=seekhifi.com">Madonna</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(Madonna_song)?ref=seekhifi.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Vogue</em></a> topped charts in Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has been sampled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue?ref=seekhifi.com">Kylie Minogue</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9?ref=seekhifi.com">Beyoncé</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande?ref=seekhifi.com">Ariana Grande</a>. David Fincher (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher?ref=seekhifi.com#Filmography">that David Fincher</a>) directed the provocative and iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJQSAiODqI&amp;ref=seekhifi.com">music video</a>. <em>Vogue </em>also possibly resurrected disco from its commercial death in the late 70s and helped bring house music into the mainstream.</p><p>I don't care about any of that.</p><p>HERE'S THE DEAL: pound-for-pound, <em>Vogue</em> is one of the most remarkable examples of artificial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound?ref=seekhifi.com">stereophonic sound</a> ever produced. Let's strike a pose, er, have a listen.</p><hr><hr><p>Stereophonic sound is typically what people mean when saying "stereo." It uses separate sound sources to give the illusion of sound in a 3-D dimensional space as perceived by our ears. "Natural" stereophonic sound is recorded and reproduced with arrays of microphones and speakers. That's not what <em>Vogue</em> is.</p><p><em>Vogue</em>'s incredible soundscape is entirely artificial. It was not recorded by an array of microphones placed around a band. There was no band. There was no dance floor. There was QSound. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSound?ref=seekhifi.com">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote>QSound is essentially a filtering algorithm. It manipulates timing, amplitude, and frequency response to produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording?ref=seekhifi.com">binaural image</a>. Systems like QSound rely on the fact that a sound arriving from one side of the listener will reach one ear before the other and that when it reaches the furthest ear, it is lower in amplitude and spectrally altered due to obstruction by the head.</blockquote><p>QSound was only used on a handful of albums in the early 90s. Its remarkable ability to place sounds in a 3-D space was quickly iterated upon and has since found widespread usage in video game development. If you've ever been blown away by surround sound from a gaming headset, it was likely some form of QSound or something related.</p><p>The music recording industry moved on to other production methods. Still, <em>Vogue</em> remains a unique time capsule of state-of-the-art audio technology deployed by masters of the craft.</p><p>The track starts with a startling, sweeping vocal line, "What are you looking at?" that pans around our heads like Michael Bay's camera, setting the stage (literally) for what's about to come. Sustained synth chords gently surround, laying the foundation for sharp snaps in front and to the right. A Roland TR-909 drum machine starts far in the distance on the left before a meaty bass line gets its groove on. This is house music exploding to the top of all the charts.</p><p>The song's main vocal comes in at 1:22, giving plenty of time to fill the dance floor. But come in, it does. Madonna's vocals on <em>Vogue</em> sound so freaking cool. It's like she's in my head, but if my head was the size of a symphony hall. The voice of god. Backing vocals feint and doge, appearing with impressive effect from all angles and orientations. One of my favorite vocal moments is at 3:15 with the delightfully corny (or perhaps deeply philosophical) line, "Beauty's where you find it, not just where you bump and grind it." The wall of voices here is astounding from the sweet spot between two loudspeakers or on a good set of cans.</p><p>The keyboard and drum machine programming and mixing throughout the song is a blast. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)?ref=seekhifi.com"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a> of audio effects. Many people worked on the track, but much credit goes to 80's remix master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shep_Pettibone?ref=seekhifi.com">Shep Pettibone</a>, who produced with Madonna. Oodles of little details and layered moments reward a close listen. It's an impressive display of realized artistic vision and craft by true medium masters.</p><p><em>Vogue</em> is an exceptional pop song with sonic and cultural depth for those who care to engage critically but also somehow remains a mile wide. Decades after its release, <em>Vogue </em>still fills dance floors at concerts, weddings, and house parties. Madonna reinvented herself many times throughout her career, but <em>Vogue</em> has rarely been left off the set list. It stands as a towering pop-art achievement in mainstream music-making.</p><hr><h3 id="data">Data</h3><p><strong>Song</strong>: Vogue<br><strong>Album</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Breathless?ref=seekhifi.com">I'm Breathless</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immaculate_Collection?ref=seekhifi.com" rel="noreferrer">The Immaculate Collection</a><br><strong>Artist</strong>: Madonna<br><strong>Genre</strong>: Pop, Dance, House<br><strong>Year</strong>: 1990<br><strong>Length</strong>: 5:17<br><strong>Composer</strong>: Madonna, Shep Pettibone <br><strong>Producer</strong>: Madonna, Shep Pettibone</p>

Here are two examples: Caslon and Bifur. Caslon is an alphabet designed as far back as 1725 by William Caslon. It appears to be a good choice because it is both elegant and bookish, qualities well suited for educational purposes.</p> <p>Bifur, a novelty face by A. M. Cassandre, was designed as recently as 1929. An unconventional but ingenious design, it has the advantage, to some, of visually implying advanced technology. <em>(Attributing certain magical qualities to particular typefaces is, however, largely a subjective matter.)</em></p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2004.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2004-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2004-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>One reason for looking at a number of possible typefaces is to satisfy one’s curiosity. Another, and perhaps more meaningful one, is to study the relationship of different letter combinations, to look for visual analogies, and to try to elicit ideas that the design of a letter or group of letters might inspire.</p> <p>Here are some further choices, but no matter how one may look at these different examples: sans serifs, hairline and slab serifs, condensed, expanded, bold, light, outline… they still say <em>next</em>… like <em>next time, what’s next?, next in line,</em> or even <em>next of kin</em>. The word is in such common usage that it is simply taken for granted.</p> <p>Personal preferences, prejudices, and stereotypes often dictate what a logo looks like, but it is <em>needs</em>, not wants, <em>ideas</em>, not type styles which determine what its form should be. To defamiliarize it, to make it look different, to let it evoke more than the mere adjective or adverb it happens to be is, it seems, the nub of the problem.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2005.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2005-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2005-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>Set in all capitals, the word NEXT is sometimes confused with EXIT possibly because the EXT grouping is so dominant. A combination of capitals and lower case letters alleviates this problem.</p> <p>Here are some possibilities which explore the use of lower case letters.</p> <p>The e is differentiated so as to provide a focal point and visual contrast among the capital letters which, otherwise, consist only of straight lines.</p> <p>Happily, the e also could stand for:<br> education<br> excellence<br> expertise<br> exceptional<br> excitement<br> e=mc2<br> etc.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2006.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2006-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2006-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>Note the difference that the lower case e makes when compared with the capital E.

Stripes are now associated with computers because the initials of a great computer company happen to be striped.This is equally true of the ABC symbol which does not suggest TV. The mnemonic factors in both logps are graphic devices: stripes and circles.</p> <p>In this example the e is the mnemonic factor.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2008.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2008-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2008-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>A logo takes on meaning, only if over a period of time it is linked to some product or service of a particular organization. What is needed is finding a meaningful device, some idea that reinforces the memorability of the company name. A black cube can be such a device because it has visual impact, and is easy to remember. Unlike the word Next, it is depictable, possesses the <em>promise of meaning</em>, and the <em>pleasure of recognition.</em></p> <p>This idea in no way restricts its application to any one product or concept.<br> The three dimensional effect functions as an underscore to attract the viewer s attention.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2009.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2009-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2009-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>It is desirable to keep the letter style simple, unmannered, and untrendy so as not to distract from the cube concept. Furthermore, the use of a single identification device and a simple sans serif letter, designed to harmonize with almost any accompanying typeface, is essential for practical application. Whenever possible, double identification (name plus symbol) is best avoided.The brevity of the word NeXT and its containment within the framework of the cube obviates the need for such awkward devices.</p> <p>Splitting the logo into two lines accomplishes several things: it startles the viewer and gives the word a new look, thus making it easier to separate from common usage. And even more importantly, it increases the letter size two-fold, within the framework of the cube. For small space use, a one line logo would have been too small to fit within this same framework.</p> <p>Readability is hardly affected because the word is too simple to be misread.<br> Moreover, people have become accustomed to this format with such familiar four- letter word combinations as<br> LO<br> VE</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2010.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2010-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2010-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>In its design, color arrangement, and orientation the logo is a study in contrasts. Kipped at a jaunty angle, it brims with the informality, friendliness, and spontaneity of a Christmas seal and the authority of a rubber stamp.Together with its lively, black silhouette it becomes a focal point difficult for the eyes to avoid.</p> <p>The unconventional, yet dignified, array of colors: vermilion against cerise and green, and yellow against black (the most intense color contrast possible) is designed to appeal to a youthful audience and to add a sparkling, jew’el-like touch to paper, package, or machine. It is the sparing use of brilliant colors on a predominantly black ground that produces this effect, like stars in the sky. In itself, a decorative and self contained device, the logo does not depend on extraneous embellishment or fancy backgrounds for its many varied applications.</p> <p>Poised at an angle of twenty-eight degrees, the black cube—even w ithout color— is equally effective for black and white use.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2011.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2011-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2011-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <p>Here are some other choices.<br> Many different color combinations are possible.</p> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2012.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2012-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2012-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>The application of this device to such items as paper weights, stickers, and other promotional articles is endless.

Whilst they are known within the field, rarely are they known outside the field or widely, yet should be.</em></p><p><span>If you've heard of the </span><strong>Turing Test</strong><span>, you've undoubtedly heard of Alan Turing. But in the same breath, you might also encounter the lesser-known name, </span><strong>Alonzo Church</strong><span>. When we review the ‘popular’ history of computing and Artificial Intelligence, it’s often Turing’s name that receives the spotlight, but the collaboration upon which Turing performed much of his groundbreaking work was aided and shaped by Church. Alonzo Church's work profoundly influenced Alan Turing's thinking and played a decisive role in the development of the Turing Test. Furthermore, without Church's contributions to the understanding of computation, our current conceptions of artificial intelligence and the tests, which have considerably evolved, to evaluate it may likely be very different.</span></p><p><span>Born on June 14, 1903, in Washington, D.C., Alonzo Church was a quiet, soft-spoken logician whose impact on mathematics and computing was monumental, even though he never sought acclaim. Little is known of his early life, however, it was marked by challenges, an air gun incident in his childhood left him </span><a href="https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/history/biographies/alonzo-church.pdf" rel="">blind in one eye</a><a href="#_ftn1" rel="">[1]</a><span>. Despite this, he thrived academically. Church finished preparatory school in Connecticut in 1920 and began his university education at Princeton that same year, where he completed his doctoral studies in 1927. After spending time at Harvard and abroad as a National Research Fellow in Göttingen, and Amsterdam, Church returned to Princeton, where he would build much of his academic legacy. </span><strong>Church was known for his exceedingly polite demeanor and meticulous nature</strong><span>. His blackboard writing was immaculate, and he was known to cover important papers in </span><a href="https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/history/biographies/alonzo-church.pdf" rel="">Duco</a><span> cement to preserve them, a reflection of his careful and deliberate approach to both scholarship and life.</span></p><p><strong>Did you know</strong><span> that despite his immense contributions to computer science, much of Alonzo Church's early life remains relatively unknown? Unlike some of his more famous contemporaries, his personal history hasn't been extensively documented, adding to the air of mystery surrounding this intellectual giant.</span></p><p><span>Despite his reserved demeanor and personal challenges, </span><strong>Church's intellectual contributions were nothing short of revolutionary.</strong></p><p>Church’s most profound contribution was the “λ-calculus,” a formal system that served as the bedrock of computer science before computer science even had a name. In 1936, Alonzo Church formulated what is now known as the Church-Turing thesis, a concept fundamental to theoretical computer science that states any function that can be effectively computed can be computed by a Turing machine or its equivalent. This thesis was groundbreaking, as it provided the framework within which to understand what machines could theoretically do, but also highlighted the boundaries of algorithmic processes. While foundational, the Church-Turing thesis also has limitations and has been subject to debate, particularly concerning the interpretation of 'effective computability' and its implications for physical computation and the nature of human intelligence.</p><p><span>Where Turing proposed his eponymous machine, a model meant to exemplify how mechanical procedures could be translated into logical form, Church provided the pure abstraction that made such a machine theoretically sound. The λ-calculus was almost mystical in its generality and elegance</span><a href="#_ftn2" rel="">[2]</a><span>. The influence of λ-calculus can be seen in the very principles of how programs are written today, emphasizing composition, higher-order functions, and immutability. This formalism allowed abstract mathematical problems to be codified and ultimately solved mechanically, and became essential to the architecture of modern compilers and interpreters. His work posed and solved problems about the limits of mathematical procedures, effectively asking: </span><strong>“To what extent can machines replicate human thought?”</strong></p><p><span>In addition to λ-calculus, Church made important contributions to other areas of logic and philosophy, such as his work on the </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem" rel="">Entscheidungsproblem</a></strong><span>, a decision problem posed by David Hilbert in 1928 that asked whether there exists a definitive algorithm to determine the truth of any mathematical statement. Church answered this question negatively, showing that such an algorithm does not exist, which became known as Church's Theorem. This finding profoundly influenced decision theory and underscored the limits of what could be achieved with computation alone.</span></p><p><span>Church was also a mentor to some of the greatest logicians and computer scientists of his time. His academic offspring included luminaries such as Stephen Kleene, J. Barkley Rosser, and perhaps most notably, Alan Turing, who completed his Ph.D. under Church's supervision at Princeton. </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/01445349708837290?needAccess=true" rel="">David Kaplan</a><span> says that he used always to recommend that his new graduate students sit in on a class with Church, telling them: </span><strong>“Take a class from Professor Church. It will change you. And even if you are not interested in pursuing the subjects he teaches, you will tell your grandchildren.” </strong></p><p>During the 1930s, Princeton was an intellectual epicenter for the development of modern logic, with influential figures such as John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel alongside Church. The symmetry of Church's mentorship and Turing's later achievements creates a hidden but potent partnership, an invisible bridge that helped carry humanity from mechanical calculation to computational intelligence.</p><p><strong>Did you know that Alonzo Church was already a professor at Princeton University by the age of 26?</strong><span> He joined the faculty in 1929, shortly after completing his Ph.D., showcasing his rapid ascent in academia.</span></p><p><span>Despite his massive intellectual contributions, Alonzo Church never enjoyed the fame of Turing or von Neumann, Gödel and others. His legacy was one of meticulous abstraction, a kind that doesn’t make it into Hollywood scripts or capture public imagination easily. It lacked the heroism of wartime codebreaking or the evocative tragedy of an early (</span><em>forced</em><span>) death. Yet, </span><strong>Church's influence is indelible</strong><span>. The very programs that run on the billions of smartphones today can trace their logic back to the abstract functions of λ-calculus. </span><strong>The invisible DNA of computation, from the simple app to artificial intelligence, owes a significant part of its lineage to Church’s work.</strong></p><p><span>Why, then, should we know him? Perhaps because our reverence for brilliance is often biased toward the visible, the concrete, and the heroic. Alonzo Church’s genius was of a different kind, it was the genius of the unseen, of the rigorous structure without which the edifice could not stand.

				<p>Kubernetes seems like the obvious choice for building out remote, standardized and automated development environments. We thought so too and have spent six years invested in making the most popular cloud development environment platform at internet scale. That’s 1.5 million users, where we regularly see thousands of development environments per day. <strong>In that time we’ve found that Kubernetes is not the right choice for building development environments.</strong></p>
<p>This is our journey of experiments, failures and dead-ends building development environments on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>. Over the years, we experimented with many ideas involving SSDs, PVCs, <a href="https://ebpf.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eBPF</a>, <a href="https://brauner.github.io/2020/07/23/seccomp-notify.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seccomp notify</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TC</a> and <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">io_uring</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718639/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shiftfs</a>, FUSE and <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/idmappings.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">idmapped mounts</a>, ranging from <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microVMs</a>, <a href="https://kubevirt.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kubevirt</a> to <a href="https://www.vcluster.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vCluster</a>.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the most optimal infrastructure to balance security, performance and interoperability. All while wrestling with the unique challenges of building a system to scale up, remain secure as it’s handling arbitrary code execution, and be stable enough for developers to work in.</p>
<p><strong>This is not a story of whether or not to use Kubernetes for production workloads</strong> that’s a whole separate conversation. As is the topic of how to build a comprehensive soup-to-nuts developer experience for shipping applications on Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>This is the story of how (not) to build development environments in the cloud.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-are-development-environments-unique">Why are development environments unique?<a href="#why-are-development-environments-unique"></a></h2>
<p>Before we dive in, it’s crucial to understand what makes development environments unique compared to production workloads:</p>
<ul><li><strong>They are extremely stateful and interactive</strong>: Which means they cannot be moved from one node to another. The many gigabytes of source code, build caches, Docker container and test data are subject to a high change rate and costly to migrate. Unlike many production services, there’s a 1-to-1 interaction between the developer and their environment.</li>
<li><strong>Developers are deeply invested in their source code and the changes they make</strong>: Developers don’t take kindly to losing any source code changes or to being blocked by any system. This makes development environments particularly intolerant to failure.</li>
<li><strong>They have unpredictable resource usage patterns</strong>: Development Environments have particular and unpredictable resource usage patterns. They won’t need much CPU bandwidth most of the time, but will require several cores within a few 100ms. Anything slower than that manifests as unacceptable latency and unresponsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>They require far-reaching permissions and capabilities</strong>: Unlike production workloads, development environments often need root access and the ability to download and install packages. What constitutes a security concern for production workloads, is expected behavior of development environments: getting root access, extended network capabilities and control over the system (e.g. mounting additional filesystems).</li></ul>
<p>These characteristics set development environments apart from typical application workloads and significantly influence the infrastructure decisions we’ve made along the way.</p>
<h2 id="the-system-today-obviously-its-kubernetes">The system today: obviously it’s Kubernetes<a href="#the-system-today-obviously-its-kubernetes"></a></h2>
<p>When we started Gitpod, Kubernetes seemed like the ideal choice for our infrastructure. Its promise of scalability, container orchestration, and rich ecosystem aligned perfectly with our vision for cloud development environments. However, as we scaled and our user base grew, we encountered several challenges around security and state management that pushed Kubernetes to its limits. <strong>Fundamentally, Kubernetes is built to run well controlled application workloads, not unruly development environments.</strong></p>
<p>Managing Kubernetes at scale is complex. While managed services like GKE and EKS alleviate some pain points, they come with their own set of restrictions and limitations. We found that many teams looking to operate a CDE underestimate the complexity of Kubernetes, which lead to a significant support load for our previous self-managed Gitpod offering.</p>
<h2 id="resource-management-struggles">Resource management struggles<a href="#resource-management-struggles"></a></h2>
<p>One of the most significant challenges we faced was resource management, particularly CPU and memory allocation per environment. At first glance, running multiple environments on a node seems attractive to share resources (such as CPU, memory, IO and network bandwidth) between those resources. In practice, this incurs significant noisy neighbor effects leading to a detrimental user experience.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-challenges">CPU challenges<a href="#cpu-challenges"></a></h3>
<p>CPU time seems like the simplest candidate to share between environments. Most of the time development environments don’t need much CPU, but when they do, they need it quickly. Latency becomes immediately apparent to users when their language server starts to lag or their terminal becomes choppy. This spiky nature of the CPU requirements of development environments (periods of inactivity followed by intensive builds) makes it difficult to predict when CPU time is needed.</p>
<p>For solutions, we experimented with various CFS (<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Completely Fair Scheduler</a>) based schemes, implementing a custom controller using a DaemonSet. A core challenge is that we can not predict when CPU bandwidth is needed, but only understand when it would have been needed (by observing nr_throttled of the cgroup’s cpu_stats).</p>
<p>Even when using static CPU resource limits, challenges arise, because unlike application workloads a development environment will run many processes in the same container. These processes compete for the same CPU bandwidth, which can lead to e.g. VS Code disconnects because VS Code server is starved for CPU time.</p>
<p>We have attempted to solve this problem by adjusting the process priorities of the individual processes, e.g. increasing the priority of bash or vscode-server. However, these process priorities apply to the entire process group (depending on your Kernel’s autogroup scheduling configuration), hence also to the resource hungry compilers started in a VS Code terminal. Using process priorities to counter terminal lag requires a carefully written control loop to be effective.</p>
<p>We introduced custom CFS and process priority based control loops built on cgroupv1 and moved to cgroupsv2 once they became more readily available on managed Kubernetes platforms with 1.24. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dynamic resource allocation</a> introduced with Kubernetes 1.26 means one no longer needs to deploy a DaemonSet and modify cgroups directly, possibly at the expense of the control loop speed and hence effectiveness. All the schemes outlined above rely on second-by-second readjustment of CFS limits and niceness values.</p>
<h3 id="memory-management">Memory management<a href="#memory-management"></a></h3>
<p>Memory management presented its own set of challenges. Assigning every environment a fixed amount of memory, so that under maximum occupation each environment gets their fixed share is straightforward, but very limiting. In the cloud, RAM is one of the more expensive resources, hence the desire to overbook memory.</p>
<p>Until <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/run-nodes-with-swap-alpha/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swap-space became available in Kubernetes 1.22</a>, memory overbooking was near impossible to do, because reclaiming memory inevitably means killing processes. With the addition of swap space the need to overbook memory has somewhat gone away, since swap works well in practice for hosting development environments.</p>
<h2 id="storage-performance-optimization">Storage performance optimization<a href="#storage-performance-optimization"></a></h2>
<p>Storage performance is important for the startup performance and experience of development environments. We have found that specifically IOPS and latency affect experience within an environment. IO bandwidth however directly impacts your workspace startup performance, specifically when creating/restoring backups or extracting large workspace images.</p>
<p><strong>We experimented with various setups to find the right balance between speed and reliability, cost and performance.</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>SSD RAID 0</strong>: This offered high IOPS and bandwidth but tied the data to a specific node. The failure of any single disk would result in complete data loss. This is how gitpod.io operates today and we have not seen such a disk failure happen yet. A simpler version of this setup is to use a single SSD attached to the node. This approach provides lower IOPS and bandwidth, and still binds the data to individual nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Block storage such as EBS volumes or Google persistent disks which are permanently attached to the nodes</strong> considerably broaden the different instances or availability zones that can be used. While still bound to a single node, and offering considerably lower throughput/bandwidth than local SSDs they are more widely available.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) seem like the obvious choice when using Kubernetes</strong>. As abstraction over different storage implementations they offer a lot of flexibility, but also introduce new challenges:<ul><li>Unpredictable attachment and detachment timing, leading to unpredictable workspace startup times. Combined with increased scheduling complexity they make implementing effective scheduling strategies harder.</li>
<li>Reliability issues leading to workspace failures, particularly during startup. This was especially noticeable on Google Cloud (in 2022) and rendered our attempts to use PVCs impractical.</li>
<li>Limited number of disks that could be attached to an instance, imposing additional constraints on the scheduler and number of workspaces per node.</li>
<li>AZ locality constraints which makes balancing workspaces across AZs even harder.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Backing up and restoring local disks proved to be an expensive operation. We implemented a solution using a daemonSet that uploads and downloads uncompressed tar archives to/from S3. This approach required careful balancing of I/O, network bandwidth, and CPU usage: for example, (de)compressing archives consumes most available CPU on a node, whereas the extra traffic produced by uncompressed backups usually doesn’t consume all available network bandwidth (if the number of concurrently starting/stopping workspaces is carefully controlled).</p>
<p>IO bandwidth on the node is shared across workspaces. We found that, unless we limited the IO bandwidth available to each workspace, other workspaces might starve for IO bandwidth and cease to function. Particularly the content backup/restore produced this problem. We implemented cgroup-based <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9440" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IO limiter</a> which imposed fixed IO bandwidth limits per environment to solve this problem.</p>
<h2 id="autoscaling-and-startup-time-optimization">Autoscaling and startup time optimization<a href="#autoscaling-and-startup-time-optimization"></a></h2>
<p>Our primary goal was to minimize startup time at all costs. Unpredictable wait times can significantly impact productivity and user satisfaction. However, this goal often conflicted with our desire to pack workspaces densely to maximize machine utilization.</p>
<p>We initially thought that running multiple workspaces on one node would help with startup times due to shared caches. However, this didn’t pan out as expected. The reality is that Kubernetes imposes a lower bound for startup time because of all the content operations that need to happen, content needs to be moved into place, which takes time.</p>
<p>Short of keeping workspaces in hot standby (which would be prohibitively expensive), we had to find other ways to optimize startup times.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-ahead-evolution-of-our-approach">Scaling ahead: evolution of our approach<a href="#scaling-ahead-evolution-of-our-approach"></a></h3>
<p><strong>To minimize startup time, we explored various approaches to scale up and ahead:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Ghost workspaces</strong>: Before cluster autoscaler plugins were available, we experimented with “ghost workspaces”. These were preemptible pods that occupied space to scale ahead. We implemented this using a custom scheduler. However, this approach proved to be slow and unreliable to replace.</li>
<li><strong>Ballast pods</strong>: An evolution of the ghost workspace concept, ballast pods filled an entire node. This resulted in less replacement cost and faster replacement times compared to ghost workspaces.</li>
<li><strong>Autoscaler plugins</strong>: In June 2022, we switched to using cluster-autoscaler plugins when they were introduced. With these plugins we no longer needed to “trick” the autoscaler, but could directly affect how scale-up happens. This marked a significant improvement in our scaling strategy.</li></ul>
<h3 id="proportional-autoscaling-for-peak-loads">Proportional autoscaling for peak loads<a href="#proportional-autoscaling-for-peak-loads"></a></h3>
<p>To handle peak loads more effectively, we implemented a proportional autoscaling system. This approach controls the rate of scale-up as a function of the rate of starting development environments. It works by launching empty pods using the pause image, allowing us to quickly increase our capacity in response to demand spikes.</p>
<h3 id="image-pull-optimization-a-tale-of-many-attempts">Image pull optimization: a tale of many attempts<a href="#image-pull-optimization-a-tale-of-many-attempts"></a></h3>
<p>Another crucial aspect of startup time optimization was improving image pull times. Workspace container images (i.e. all the tools available to a developer) can grow to more than 10 gigabytes uncompressed. Downloading and extracting this amount of data for every workspace considerably taxes a node’s resources. We explored numerous strategies to speed up image pulls:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Daemonset pre-pull</strong>: We tried pre-pulling common images using a daemonSet. However, this proved ineffective during scale-up operations because when the node came online, and workspaces were starting, the images still wouldn’t be present on the node. Also, the pre-pulls would now compete for IO and CPU bandwidth with the starting workspaces.</li>
<li><strong>Layer reuse maximization</strong>: We built our own images using a custom builder called <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/dazzle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dazzle</a>, which can build layers independently. This approach aimed to maximize layer reuse. However, we found that layer reuse is very difficult to observe due to the high cardinality and amount of indirections in the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCI manifests</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-baked images</strong>: We experimented with baking images into the node disk image. While this improved startup times, it had significant drawbacks. The images quickly became outdated, and this approach didn’t work for self-hosted installations.</li>
<li><strong>Stargazer and lazy-pulling</strong>: This method required all images to be converted, which added complexity, cost, and time to our operations. Additionally, not all registries supported this approach when we tried it in 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Registry-facade + IPFS</strong>: This solution worked well in practice, providing good performance and distribution. We gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS6aDScfVuw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KubeCon talk about this approach in 2022</a>. However, it introduced significant complexity to our system.</li></ul>
<p>There is no one-size-fits all solution for image caching, but a set of trade-offs with respect to complexity, cost and restrictions imposed on users (images they can use). We have found that homogeneity of workspace images is the most straightforward way to optimize startup times.</p>
<h2 id="networking-complexities">Networking complexities<a href="#networking-complexities"></a></h2>
<p>Networking in Kubernetes introduced its own set of challenges, specifically:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Development environment access control</strong>: by default the network of environments needs to be entirely isolated from one another, i.e. one environment cannot reach another. The same is true for the access of a user to the workspace. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Network Policies</a> go a long way in ensuring environments are properly disconnected from each other.</p>
<p>Initially we controlled the access to individual environment ports (such as the IDE, or services running in the workspace) using Kubernetes services, together with an ingress proxy that would forward traffic to the service, resolving it using DNS. This quickly became unreliable at scale because of the sheer number of services. Name resolution would fail, and if not careful (e.g. setting enableServiceLinks: false) one can bring entire workspaces down.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network bandwidth sharing</strong> on the node is yet another resource that needs to be shared with multiple workspaces on a single node. Some CNIs offer network shaping support (e.g. Cilium’s <a href="https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/network/kubernetes/bandwidth-manager/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bandwidth Manager</a>). This now leaves you with yet another resource to control for, and potentially share between environments.</p></li></ul>
<h2 id="security-and-isolation-balancing-flexibility-and-protection">Security and isolation: balancing flexibility and protection<a href="#security-and-isolation-balancing-flexibility-and-protection"></a></h2>
<p>One of the most significant challenges we faced in our Kubernetes-based infrastructure was providing a secure environment while giving users the flexibility they need for development. Users want the ability to install additional tools (e.g., using apt-get install), run Docker, or even set up a Kubernetes cluster within their development environment. Balancing these requirements with robust security measures proved to be a complex undertaking.</p>
<h3 id="the-naive-approach-root-access">The naive approach: root access<a href="#the-naive-approach-root-access"></a></h3>
<p>The simplest solution would be to give users root access to their containers. However, this approach quickly reveals its flaws:</p>
<ul><li>Giving users root access essentially provides them with root privileges on the node itself, granting access to the development environment platform and other development environments that are running on that node .</li>
<li>This eliminates any meaningful security boundary between users and the host system meaning developers can accidentally, or intentionally interfere and break the development environment platform itself or even access others’ development environments.</li>
<li>It also exposes the infrastructure to potential abuse and security risks. It is then also not possible to implement a true access control model and the architecture falls short of zero-trust. You cannot ensure that a given actor in the system performing an action was verifiably themselves.</li></ul>
<p>Clearly, a more sophisticated approach was needed.</p>
<h3 id="user-namespaces-a-more-nuanced-solution">User namespaces: a more nuanced solution<a href="#user-namespaces-a-more-nuanced-solution"></a></h3>
<p>To address these challenges, we turned to user namespaces, a Linux kernel feature that provides fine-grained control over the mapping of user and group IDs inside containers. This approach allows us to give users “root-like” privileges within their container without compromising the security of the host system.</p>
<p>While Kubernetes introduced support for user namespaces in version 1.25, we had already implemented our own solution starting with Kubernetes 1.22. Our implementation involved several complex components:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Filesystem UID shift</strong>: This is necessary to ensure that files created inside the container map correctly to UIDs on the host system. We experimented with several approaches:</p>
<ul><li>We continue to use shiftfs as our primary method for filesystem UID shifting. Despite being deprecated in some contexts, shiftfs still provides the functionality we need with acceptable performance characteristics.</li>
<li>We’ve experimented with fuse-overlayfs, which provided the necessary functionality but had performance limitations.</li>
<li>While idmapped mounts offer potential benefits, we haven’t transitioned to them yet due to various compatibility and implementation considerations.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mounting masked proc</strong>: When a container starts, it typically wants to mount /proc. However, in our security model, /proc is sensibly masked to prevent potential security bypasses. Working around this limitation required a tricky solution:</p>
<ul><li>We construct a masked proc filesystem.</li>
<li>This masked proc is then moved into the correct mount namespace.</li>
<li>We implement this using seccomp notify, which allows us to intercept and modify certain system calls.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>FUSE support</strong>: Adding FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support, which is crucial for many development workflows, required implementing custom device policies. This involved modifying the container’s eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) device filter, a low-level programming capability that allows us to make fine-grained decisions about device access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network capabilities</strong>: As true root one holds the CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_RAW capabilities which provide far-reaching privileges to configure networking. Container runtimes (such as Docker/runc) make extensive use of these capabilities. Granting such capabilities to the development environment container would interfere with CNI and break the security isolation.</p>
<p>To provide such capabilities we ended up creating another network namespace inside the Kubernetes container, first connected to the outside world using slirp4netns and later using a veth pair and custom and nftables rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enabling docker</strong>: required some specific hacks for Docker itself. We register a custom <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/components/docker-up/runc-facade/main.go" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">runc-facade</a> which modifies the OCI runtime spec produced by Docker. This lets us remove e.g. OOMScoreAdj which still isn’t allowed because that would require CAP_SYS_ADMIN on the node.</p></li></ul>
<p>Implementing this security model came with its own set of challenges:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Performance impact</strong>: Some of our solutions, particularly earlier ones like fuse-overlayfs, had noticeable performance impacts. We’ve continually worked to optimize these.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Not all tools and workflows are compatible with this restricted environment. We’ve had to carefully balance security with usability.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: The resulting system is significantly more complex than a simple containerized environment, which impacts both development and operational overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping up with Kubernetes</strong>: As Kubernetes has evolved, we’ve had to adapt our custom implementations to take advantage of new features while maintaining backwards compatibility.</li></ul>
<h2 id="the-micro-vm-experiment">The micro-VM experiment<a href="#the-micro-vm-experiment"></a></h2>
<p>As we grappled with the challenges of Kubernetes, we began exploring micro-VM (uVM) technologies like <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firecracker</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloud Hypervisor</a>, and <a href="https://www.qemu.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QEMU</a> as a potential middle ground. This exploration was driven by the promise of improved resource isolation, compatibility with other workloads (e.g. Kubernetes) and security, while potentially maintaining some of the benefits of containerization.</p>
<h3 id="the-promise-of-micro-vms">The promise of micro-VMs<a href="#the-promise-of-micro-vms"></a></h3>
<p>Micro-VMs offered several enticing benefits that aligned well with our goals for cloud development environments:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enhanced resource isolation</strong>: uVMs promised better resource isolation compared to containers, albeit at the expense of overbooking capabilities. With uVMs, we would no longer have to contend with shared kernel resources, potentially leading to more predictable performance for each development environment.</li>
<li><strong>Memory snapshots and fast resume</strong>: One of the most exciting features, particularly with Firecracker using userfaultfd, was the support for memory snapshots. This technology promised near-instant full machine resume, including running processes. For developers, this could mean significantly faster environment startup times and the ability to pick up exactly where they left off.</li>
<li><strong>Improved security boundaries</strong>: uVMs offered the potential to serve as a robust security boundary, potentially eliminating the need for the complex user namespace mechanisms we had implemented in our Kubernetes setup. This could provide full compatibility with a wider range of workloads, including nested containerization (running Docker or even Kubernetes within the development environment).</li></ul>
<h3 id="challenges-with-micro-vms">Challenges with micro-VMs<a href="#challenges-with-micro-vms"></a></h3>
<p>However, our experiments with micro-VMs revealed several significant challenges:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Overhead</strong>: Even as lightweight VMs, uVMs introduced more overhead than containers. This impacted both performance and resource utilization, key considerations for a cloud development environment platform.</li>
<li><strong>Image conversion</strong>: Converting OCI (Open Container Initiative) images into uVM-consumable filesystems required custom solutions. This added complexity to our image management pipeline and potentially impacted startup times.</li>
<li><strong>Technology-specific limitations</strong>:<ul><li>Firecracker:<ul><li>Lack of GPU support, which is increasingly important for certain development workflows.</li>
<li>No virtiofs support at the time of our experiments (mid 2023), limiting our options for efficient file system sharing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Cloud hypervisor:<ul><li>Slower snapshot and restore processes due to the lack of userfaultfd support, negating one of the key advantages we hoped to gain from uVMs.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Data movement challenges</strong>: Moving data around became even more challenging with uVMs, as we now had to contend with large memory snapshots. This affected both scheduling and startup times, two critical factors for user experience in cloud development environments.</li>
<li><strong>Storage considerations</strong>: Our experiments with attaching EBS volumes to micro-VMs opened up new possibilities but also raised new questions:<ul><li>Persistent storage: Keeping workspace content on attached volumes reduced the need to pull data from S3 repeatedly, potentially improving startup times and reducing network usage.</li>
<li>Performance considerations: While sharing high-throughput volumes among workspaces showed promise for improving I/O performance, it also raised concerns about implementing effective quotas, managing latency, and ensuring scalability.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3 id="lessons-from-the-uvm-experiment">Lessons from the uVM experiment<a href="#lessons-from-the-uvm-experiment"></a></h3>
<p>While micro-VMs didn’t ultimately become our primary infrastructure solution, the experiment provided valuable insights:</p>
<ul><li>We loved the experience of full workspace backup and runtime state suspend/resume provided for development environments.</li>
<li>We, for the first time, considered moving away from Kubernetes. The effort to integrate KVM and uVMs into pods had us explore options outside of Kubernetes.</li>
<li>We, once again, identified storage as the crucial element for providing all three: reliable startup performance, reliable workspaces (don’t lose my data) and optimal machine utilization.</li></ul>
<h2 id="kubernetes-is-immensely-challenging-as-a-development-environment-platform">Kubernetes is immensely challenging as a development environment platform<a href="#kubernetes-is-immensely-challenging-as-a-development-environment-platform"></a></h2>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, for development environments we need a system that respects the uniquely stateful nature of development environments. We need to give the necessary permissions for developers to be productive, whilst ensuring secure boundaries. And we need to do all of this whilst keeping operational overhead low and not compromising security.</p>
<p>Today, achieving all of the above with Kubernetes is possible—but comes at a significant cost. We learned the difference between application and system workloads the hard way.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is incredible. It’s supported by an engaged and passionate community, which builds a truly rich ecosystem. If you’re running application workloads, Kubernetes continues to be a fine choice. However <strong>for system workloads like development environments Kubernetes presents immense challenges in both security and operational overhead</strong>. Micro-VMs and clear resource budgets help, but make cost a more dominating factor.</p>
<p>So after many years of effectively reverse-engineering and forcing development environments onto the Kubernetes platform we took a step back to think about what we believe a future development architecture needs to look like. In January 2024 we set out to build it. In October, we shipped it: <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/introducing-gitpod-flex" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gitpod Flex</a>.</p>
<p>More than six years of incredibly hard-won insights for running development environments securely at internet scale went into the architectural foundations.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-development-environments">The future of development environments<a href="#the-future-of-development-environments"></a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/introducing-gitpod-flex" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gitpod Flex</a> we carried over the foundational aspects of Kubernetes such as the liberal application of control theory and the declarative APIs whilst simplifying the architecture and improving the security foundation.</p>
<p>We orchestrate development environments using a control plane heavily inspired by Kubernetes. We introduced some necessary abstraction layers that are specific to development environments and cast aside much of the infrastructure complexity that we didn’t need—all whilst <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/how-we-built-it-zero-trust-architecture" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">putting zero-trust security first</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Security boundaries of Gitpod Flex.</p>
<p>This new architecture allows us to <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-supports-development-container" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integrate devcontainer seamlessly</a>. We also unlocked the ability to <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/introducing-gitpod-desktop" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">run development environments on your desktop</a>. Now that we’re no longer carrying the heavy weight of the Kubernetes platform, <strong>Gitpod Flex can be deployed self-hosted in less than three minutes</strong> and in any number of regions, giving more fine-grained control on compliance and added flexibility when modeling organizational boundaries and domains.</p>
<p>We’ll be posting a lot more about Gitpod Flex architecture in the coming weeks or months. I’d love to invite you on November the 6th to a virtual event where I’ll be giving a demo of Gitpod Flex and I’ll deep-dive into the architecture and security model at length.

<p><b></b>The Q source hypothesis is a prominent theory in New Testament scholarship that seeks to explain the literary relationship between the synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. According to this hypothesis, there was a hypothetical written source, known as “Q” (short for the German word “<i>Quelle</i>,” meaning “source”), which contained the sayings and teachings of Jesus that were shared by <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> but are absent in <i>Mark</i>.</p>

<p><h2><strong>The Synoptic Problem</strong></h2></p>

<p>Scholars refer to the gospels of <i>Matthew</i>, <i>Mark</i>, and <i>Luke</i> as the synoptic gospels. The term “synoptic” comes from two Greek words: <i>syn</i>, meaning “together,” and <i>opsis</i>, meaning “seeing.” It refers to the fact that these three gospels share a similar structure, tell the same stories, and parallel each other in content and wording to a large extent.</p>

<p>Consider the following passages from each of these gospels:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4><i>Matthew</i> 3:16-17</h4>
<h4>“And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;&nbsp;and behold, a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.’”<i>&nbsp;</i></h4>
<h4><i>Mark</i> 1:10-11</h4>
<h4>“And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.&nbsp;And a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.’”</h4>
<h4><i>Luke</i> 3:21-22</h4>
<h4>“Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.’”</h4>

<p>Scholars have long held that <i>Mark</i> was the first of the <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/exploring-the-four-evangelists-who-wrote-christian-gospels/">gospels</a>, dated to around 65-70 CE. <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> are dated at least a decade, if not two later, sometime between 80 and 95 CE. It is highly likely that <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke</i> had copies of the <i>Gospel of Mark</i> at their disposal when they authored their versions.</p>

<p>Having <i>Mark</i> as a mutual source for <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> would explain their many similarities. What it does not explain, however, is the literary similarities between <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke </i>that do not appear in <i>Mark</i>. These similarities are attributed to <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/jesus-christ-in-context-rome-jerusalem-judea/">Jesus</a>, but never to any narrative.</p>

<p>The parallels unique to <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke</i> gave rise to the theory that these gospel authors made use of a second source for their material, resulting in the equivalencies in their work. Scholars called this hypothetical second source “Q.”</p>

<h2><strong>The Q Source Hypothesis</strong></h2>
<figure id="attachment_126325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126325"><center><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-matthew-and-angel.jpg" alt="saint matthew and angel" width="1655.1724137931035" height="1200" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-matthew-and-angel.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-matthew-and-angel-300x218.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-matthew-and-angel-1024x742.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-matthew-and-angel-768x557.jpg 768w"></center><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126325">Saint Matthew and the Angel, by Giovanni Gerolamo Savoldo, 16th century.

<p>The “Q” in “Q source hypothesis” comes from the first letter of the German word “quelle” which means “source.” Given the similarities between <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke</i>, this source must have consisted of the sayings of Jesus. The lack of narrative similarities in these two gospels makes it unlikely that Q had a narrative framework.</p>

<p>The Q source hypothesis developed in the late 18th century and early 19th century as a means of explaining the parallels between <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i>. Two German biblical scholars, particularly Johann Gottfried Eichhorn and Heinrich Julius Holtzmann were prominent in the development of the Q source hypothesis, postulating that a proto-gospel, probably written in Hebrew or Aramaic, was the source for the three synoptic gospels. In the mid-1920s, with the work of B. H. Streeter, the theory seems to have gained traction.</p>

<figure id="attachment_126324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126324"><center><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lion-of-saint-mark.jpg" alt="lion of saint mark" width="1200" height="444" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lion-of-saint-mark.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lion-of-saint-mark-300x111.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lion-of-saint-mark-1024x379.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lion-of-saint-mark-768x284.jpg 768w"></center><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126324">The Lion of Mark, by Vittore Carpaccio, 1416.

<p>This original source may have been an oral tradition on the sayings of Jesus that the authors of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> codified. Alternatively, their capturing of the Q sayings in their gospels could have resulted in the original written Q source becoming redundant as these gospels expanded on and provided context for these sayings.</p>

<p>Various scholars have made attempts to reconstruct Q by analyzing <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> and using the parallels to identify the original material. The process involved, among other things, identifying distinctive characteristics such as theological emphasis, literary style, and cultural context. By its very nature, it remains a speculative endeavor. Scholars also regularly investigate parallels with other Early Christian sources such as the <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/what-is-the-didache/"><i>Didache</i></a>, the<i> Gospel of Thomas</i>, and similar works that contain sayings of Jesus.</p>

<p>Though no evidence for Q exists, there are several reasons why such a source is likely. First, there are overlaps in the wording and the order of the sayings and teachings between <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i>, particularly in passages not found in <i>Mark</i>, which suggest a common origin. This includes a consistent thematic focus on ethical teachings, wisdom sayings, and teachings about the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Secondly, statistical analysis done by Markos Papapetrou showed quantitative support for the existence of Q by demonstrating statistically significant patterns of verbal agreement between <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> in passages not found in <i>Mark</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, variations in order and wording make it unlikely that <i>Luke</i> copied from <i>Matthew</i> and more likely that they shared a common source. Each of them adopted the original material to fit their style, narrative, and focus.</p>

<p>Fourth, <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke </i>parallel other early Christian works. They may not have used Q as a source directly, but they indicate a broader circulation and influence of Jesus’ teachings beyond the canonical gospels.</p>

<p><h2><strong>Variations and Alternatives of the Q Hypothesis</strong></h2></p>
<figure id="attachment_126331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126331"><center><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/three-source-hypothesis-q-source.jpg" alt="three source hypothesis q source" width="1173" height="1200" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/three-source-hypothesis-q-source.jpg 1173w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/three-source-hypothesis-q-source-293x300.jpg 293w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/three-source-hypothesis-q-source-1001x1024.jpg 1001w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/three-source-hypothesis-q-source-768x786.jpg 768w"></center><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126331">Diagram illustrating the Three Source Hypothesis. Source: Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>

<p>One variation on the Q source hypothesis proposes that <i>Mark </i>also made use of Q or a similar proto-gospel. This is an unorthodox approach since the original hypothesis had Q as a source for similarities between <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke </i>that exclude similarities with <i>Mark</i>. The three initial Bible passages referenced in this article show some sayings are shared among all three. This idea of a proto-gospel as the source for all three synoptic gospels dates back as far as the 1800s.</p>

<p>Scholars have come up with alternatives to the Q source hypothesis to explain similarities in the gospels of the different authors. The Farrer hypothesis proposes that<i> Matthew </i>used <i>Mark</i> as a source, but <i>Luke</i> used both <i>Mark</i> and <i>Matthew </i>as a source. This approach is simple and negates the need for a Q source altogether.</p>

<h2><strong>Arguments Against the Existence of Q</strong></h2>
<figure id="attachment_126329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126329"><center><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-luke-plaque.jpg" alt="saint luke plaque" width="827" height="1200" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-luke-plaque.jpg 827w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-luke-plaque-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-luke-plaque-706x1024.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-luke-plaque-768x1114.jpg 768w"></center><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126329">Plaque with the symbol of Saint Luke, 1100 CE. Source: The MET Museum</figcaption></figure>

<p>Some scholars argue that the similarities between <i>Matthew </i>and<i> Luke</i> can be adequately explained by literary dependence on each other or on oral tradition, without the need to posit a separate written source like Q. Similarly, scribal traditions may also have resulted in literary parallels between <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> and would provide a much simpler explanation than the Q hypothesis.</p>

<p>A weakness of the Q source hypothesis is the absence of any textual evidence despite extensive scholarly efforts to find it. The entire hypothesis is based on statistical and literary analysis and inference. It adds complexity to the synoptic problem by introducing an additional layer of tradition, transmission, and composition, which may not be warranted given the available evidence (or rather lack thereof).</p>

<p>The lack of any textual evidence for Q leads to a variety of proposed reconstructions. It results in a lack of consensus which undermines the reliability and validity of the hypothesis.</p>

<p><h2><strong>What Q Lacks</strong></h2></p>
<figure id="attachment_126330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126330"><center><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-mark-statue.jpg" alt="saint mark statue" width="635" height="1200" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-mark-statue.jpg 635w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-mark-statue-159x300.jpg 159w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/saint-mark-statue-542x1024.jpg 542w"></center><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126330">Statue of Saint Mark, c.1700, Flemish. Source: The MET Museum</figcaption></figure>

<p>From reconstructions of Q, it is evident that it does not contain the birth, <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/easter-historical-context/">crucifixion</a>, and resurrection narratives that are at the core of the gospels — the “good news.” As such, Q could not be the source of the gospels but could be a source of the sections of the gospels that relate to the sayings of Jesus.</p>

<p>With the abundance of manuscripts and indirect evidence for the <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/what-are-the-earliest-manuscripts-of-the-new-testament/">New Testament</a> and other early <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/how-did-christianity-conquer-an-empire-in-300-years/">Christian</a> works, it is hard to imagine that a source as prominent as Q would leave no trace of evidence. That said, the reasoning behind the likely existence of a single source—the parallels in <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke</i>—seems reasonable.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<figure id="attachment_126328" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126328"><center><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/christ-with-four-eveangelists-q-source.jpg" alt="christ with four eveangelists q source" width="740" height="1200" srcset="https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/christ-with-four-eveangelists-q-source.jpg 740w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/christ-with-four-eveangelists-q-source-185x300.jpg 185w, https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/christ-with-four-eveangelists-q-source-631x1024.jpg 631w"></center><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126328">Plaque with Christ in Majesty and the Four Evangelists, 11th Century.

<p>The gospels of <i>Matthew</i>,<i> Mark</i>, and <i>Luke</i> have much in common, resulting in scholars referring to them as the “synoptic gospels.”&nbsp; While most scholars believe <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke </i>used <i>Mark</i> as a source, similarities in <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i> gave rise to speculation that these two gospels share a second source that is absent in <i>Luke</i>.</p>

<p>Scholars have not been able to verify this hypothesis with manuscript evidence. While the existence of the Q source remains a hypothesis, there were good reasons for positing a single source for the parts of <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke</i> that parallel one another but are absent in <i>Mark</i>. From a statistical-analytical perspective, such a source is likely. It would explain the similarities between the two later synoptic gospels and even the parallels with other early Christian sources.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would also make for a more complex explanation than other scholars have proposed, violating the principle of Occam’s Razor. Alternatively, <i>Mark </i>could have been the source for <i>Matthew</i>, and <i>Matthew</i> for <i>Luke</i>, which is a much simpler explanation than the Q hypothesis.</p>

<p>The lack of reference to the essentials of the gospel (the birth, death, and resurrection of Christ) makes Q an unlikely source for the origin of the gospels themselves, but it would qualify as a source for the sayings of Jesus in the gospels of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i>.</p>

I will also list some initiatives that aim to enable system-wide profiling without the need for frame pointers.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>Several recent articles have discussed the interaction of frame pointer optimization defaults and profiling, including <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/07/31/frame-pointers-untangling-unwinding">Guinevere Larsen’s overview of the issue</a>, <a href="https://opensource.com/article/23/3/gdb-debugger-call-frame-active-function-calls">Will Cohen’s article on call-frame information and unwinding</a>, and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/06/11/get-system-wide-profiles-binaries-without-frame-pointers">my own article on profiling frame pointer-less code with eu-stacktrace</a>.</p><p>In short, modern <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/gcc-clang-llvm-go-rust/overview">compilers</a> can produce code either with or without a frame pointer register indicating the beginning of the current stack frame. With frame pointers enabled, the structure of the call stack is trivial to analyze; without frame pointers, an additional register becomes available for general computation. Since around 2011 with GCC version 4.6, the default has been to omit the frame pointer register, which means that debugging and profiling tools must use call-frame information to produce stack traces. In user space, call-frame information in the DWARF-based <code>.eh_frame</code> format is universally available.</p><p>Unfortunately, it has not been feasible to include a full interpreter for DWARF and <code>.eh_frame</code> bytecode in the Linux kernel. Thus, the kernel’s <code>perf_events</code> framework can only use frame pointer unwinding for user-space code, which has affected profiling tools based on this framework and made them non-functional on most Linux distributions. This led to widespread calls to recompile distributions with frame pointers enabled, in the hopes of enabling system-wide stack trace profiling based on <code>perf_events</code>.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are several issues with frame pointer unwinding that have been overlooked in the recent discussions.</p><h2>Uneven distribution of performance gains and losses</h2><p>First, the users most impacted by the slowdown due to frame pointers are different from the users who benefit from profiling-driven fixes. This creates a win-lose tradeoff that cannot be discussed in a satisfying fashion.</p><p>In general, one group of users is concerned with performance losses on systems with large numbers of interacting components. Such systems can exhibit issues due to mistuning, which can be fixed for a large performance impact when a profiler is available.</p><p>Another group of users are concerned with raw computational capacity when obtaining the maximum degree of optimization from their compiler. There are no low-hanging fruit for such users to find; all that they get from re-enabling frame pointers is a 1-2% performance loss, which translates to the loss of about 1 or 2 years of compiler improvements.</p><p>It is never good for an upstream project to be forced to decide which group of users is more important. This is especially true for projects whose user base is as large and diverse as that of a compiler or Linux distribution. Thus, there is a lot of motivation to develop a profiling solution that does not require frame pointer optimizations to be disabled.</p><h2>Function prologues and epilogues</h2><p>Second, the profiles produced by frame pointer unwinding will inevitably exhibit gaps around function prologues and epilogues and in procedure lookup table (PLT) sections. In these portions of an executable, the frame pointer register does not accurately reflect the current stack frame, which causes the frame pointer unwinder to skip the innermost function. In particular, this affects the validity of the profile for evaluating code-locality optimizations.</p><p>A lower-bound estimate of the problem can be <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-perf-users/6c694175-22aa-431d-a71e-0b0c117020ed@redhat.com/">obtained by a method suggested by Will Cohen</a>. The minimum size of an x86 function prologue is 8 bytes. We can use the following <code>perf</code> command to check the number of samples that fall into the first 8 bytes of a function and are thus guaranteed to have an inaccurate frame pointer:</p><pre><code># perf report --sort=sample,symoff
  | grep -E '0x[01234567]$' # first 8 bytes only
  | grep -v "[k]" | grep -v "@plt" # userspace only</code></pre><p>When tested on x86, this analysis yielded about 5.2% of samples falling into the first 8 bytes of a function. Therefore, at least that proportion of samples will have an inaccurate stack trace when frame pointer unwinding is used. The actual proportion is likely to be greater, since compiler optimizations may expand the prologue with additional initialization code. Similarly, on aarch64, where the minimal function prologue size is 12 bytes, a minimum of 6.0% of inaccurate samples were found to occur. The frequent occurrence of samples early in a function may be a result of sampling being more likely to happen immediately after code is loaded into cache after a TLB miss.</p><p>In any case, this means that even with frame pointers enabled, call-frame information is still required to obtain an accurate profile.</p><h2>Assembly-code functions in libraries</h2><p>Third, the existence of hand-written assembly-code functions in commonly-used libraries, particularly the glibc string and memory manipulation functions, causes another source of inaccuracy. Again, the assembly-code sections do not maintain the frame pointer register the same way that an ordinary function call does.</p><p>In the best case, the frame pointer unwind will skip the caller of the assembly-code function. That is, if function <code>f</code> calls function <code>g</code> which calls <code>strcpy</code>, the resulting stack trace will claim that function <code>f</code> called <code>strcpy</code> directly. In the worst case, if the assembly-code function uses the frame pointer register for general-purpose computation, the unwind will not be able to proceed at all.</p><p>On the other hand, a Call Frame Information (CFI) unwinder will be able to unwind the call correctly. Since around 2003, the glibc assembly code has been hand-annotated with CFI directives, and these document how the canonical frame address can be calculated relative to the stack pointer, or relative to a value spilled to memory, or otherwise. Any other library that includes similar annotations can enable accurate CFI unwinding of assembly-code.</p><p>To support frame pointer unwinding by modifying the glibc assembly-code functions to stop using the frame pointer register for computation and imitate frame pointer-enabled code emitted by a compiler is not a likely prospect. In addition to the volume of the work required, only a subset of the glibc users would find such a change desirable.</p><h2>Alternatives to frame pointer unwinding</h2><p>Fortunately, there are signs that frame pointer enablement in current Linux distributions is only a stopgap measure. Several initiatives are underway, each of which would make it feasible to obtain profiles via <code>perf_events</code> without relying on a frame pointer unwinder:</p><ol><li>My own <code>eu-stacktrace</code> project <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/06/11/get-system-wide-profiles-binaries-without-frame-pointers">was described in a prior article</a>. As of the time of writing, an initial version has been merged upstream into <a href="https://inbox.sourceware.org/elfutils-devel/CAJDtP-T3+gXqHWp3T0mejWWbPr0_1tHetEXwfB67-o+zz7ShiA@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">elfutils release 0.192</a> and can be enabled by compiling elfutils with the <code>--enable-stacktrace</code> option, <a href="https://sourceware.org/cgit/elfutils/tree/README.eu-stacktrace?h=users/serhei/eu-stacktrace">as described in the README</a>.</li><li><a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.40/sframe-spec.html">The SFrame project</a> is a simplified call-frame information format with stronger efficiency guarantees than <code>.eh_frame</code>, albeit slightly less flexibility. As of the time of writing, a patchset <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1726268190.git.jpoimboe@kernel.org/">to implement SFrame unwinding for <code>perf_events</code></a> is being reviewed for inclusion in the Linux kernel. After that, SFrame support will need to be added to elfutils and then major distributions will consider compiling their packages with <code>.sframe</code> sections by default.</li><li>New generations of hardware will include shadow stack support. Shadow stacks are a security feature which uses hardware assistance to track the structure of the call stack and monitor its integrity. This would also allow stack traces to be obtained without relying on call-frame information or on frame pointers.</li></ol><p>Overall, the accuracy of a stack trace profile depends on a number of subtle details that are easy to overlook. Fortunately, the current projects seem to be on track to improve the quality of profile information over what has been available in the past.</p>

<p>A curious tale this, about an artist who draws an album cover for a band he does not care for, playing a music style he does not listen to, appealing to an audience he does not connect with. And to top it, the art selected for the front cover was the one he intended for the back cover. The result: one of the most iconic album covers to come out of the late 1960s. This is the story of Robert Crumb’s cover art for Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company’s career-changing album Cheap Thrills.</p>

<p>The story of this album cover starts in January of 1967,
when Crumb moved to San Francisco. The previous two years were spent soaking in
LSD and travelling between New York, Chicago, and Detroit. The drug was legal
then and an eye opener for many, as he remembers: “At that moment, 1965-1966,
it was very exciting. You got in a subway and you were a person that took LSD.
If there was another person on that subway who has also taken LSD, you
immediately knew who they were, you knew each other. You’d look in their eyes
and you knew and they knew you had. It was like an intimate brotherhood of
people who had seen through the whole thing in some way that most people didn’t
have a clue at all. There was that golden moment.”</p>



<p>During these two years he published the character of Fritz the Cat, the most outrageous feline in history, in various magazines including Help! and Cavalier. Other characters started their life during that period and bloomed after his move to the Hippie capital. They included the mystic guru Mr. Natural, the sex-crazed Mr. Snoid and last but not least, Snoid’s favorite companion Angelfood McSpade, the insatiable African black woman who took stereotyping to new levels.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in San Francisco, Crumb quickly found his way to Haight Ashbury and the Psychedelic Shop and immersed himself in the carefree culture of the town: “San Francisco was a great town at the time, a really beautiful city. After living in Cleveland, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Detroit, all these really depressing industrial cities, San Francisco seemed like a sweet little cupcake with Victorian houses and pretty parks.” The town offered him the best environment to indulge in the things that most interested him: drawing wild comics and taking acid. Oh, and of course, sex. </p>

<p>Talking about LSD and its impact on the counter-culture, Crumb said: “LSD was the road to Damascus for the hippies. It turned the left wing serious political anti-war movement into something religious and visionary. It was no longer political, folk music, help the Negros, fight the war and all that. It became mystical, saving the earth, the preciousness of nature, living close to nature. Much more radical and extreme.” He was drawing all that time, adapting old cartoon styles to the hippie hallucinogen vision, slowly picking up interest and recognition. After contributing his work to various underground magazines, he was invited to create a full comic magazine named Zap. The first issue featured his favorite Mr. Natural on the cover.</p>

<p>The publication of Zap Magazine provided exposure but no income and Crumb was nearly penniless. Copies of the first issue were printed, folded and stapled by Crumb and sold on the street at Haight-Ashbury for 25 cents a copy. Proprietors of stores in that hip area did not get what’s with these comic books he was offering them. They stocked psychedelic art nouveau concert posters, incense, pipes, bongs, candles, not comic books that looked like Popeye on the cover. But within six months Zap comics caught on and Crumb became known for his talent as an underground comics artist. None describes the world of Crumb better than Crumb: “My comics appealed to the hard-drinking, hard-fucking end of the hippie spectrum as opposed to the spiritual, Eastern-religious, lighter-than-air type hippie.” Still, monetary rewards were not forthcoming from hippie stardom. He wrote in a letter in June 1968: “What good has fame done me? I’m broke and girls still act aloof. Time has come for a change! Bwah howdy!” In that same letter, addressed to his friend Mike Britt, he mentions an important meeting, contrasting it with the sad affair of his monogamous relationship: “I am going over to meet Janis Joplin tonight… CAN’T WAIT! Which brings me to another important point, which is my sex life has been sliding downhill lately so I’m trying to do something about that! The only girl I’m making it with is my wife, and getting’ tired of just her all the time.” Words that would send chills down conservative Americans’ spines, but we are at the center of the hippie galaxy in 1968, the time and place where anything goes. Was Janis his salvation from bedroom boredom? Lets stick with the topic of this article and assume that she was just asking him to draw the cover of her band’s second album, which is exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Crumb had no patience for much of the music surrounding him in San Francisco or elsewhere in the late 1960s. This is blasphemy for anyone (myself included) who cares about all the great music created in those days, the golden age of rock and psychedelic music. But Crumb came from another era, mentally, and to him this music was commercialism personified compared to the roots music from the 1920s and 1930s that moved him: “I had no patience for any of that psychedelic pop music or crap that came in the 60s: The Grateful Dead, Jim Morrison, The Doors, The Beatles, Bob Dylan. I had little or no interest in any of that. I thought I had found some music that was much more real, that came from the heart of people’s culture but had been wiped out by mass media and commercialism.”</p>

<p>But Crumb made an exception with Janis Joplin, connecting with her for their mutual love of old Blues music: “She wasn’t nationally known yet. I remember going to see her at the Avalon Ballroom and you could tell right away that she had an exceptional voice and she would go far. She started out singing old time blues like Bessie Smith. She was kind of a folknik originally.“ While he did not care for her current band and the psychedelic spin they took on blues, he recognized her ability to belt out the good ol’ blues: “Janis had played with earlier bands just playing country blues and it was much better. Way, way better. She’s singing well, not screaming, not playing to the audience that wanted to watch her sweat blood. In the beginning she was just an authentic, genuine Texas country-girl shouter.”</p>

<p>Crumb was not the first choice for Big Brother and the Holding Company’s album cover. The band, which rose to meteoric success immediately after their milestone performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967, was quickly signed to Columbia Records who wanted an album quick to cash in on the emerging flower power market. The original title for the band’s first album for Columbia was Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills, a fair summary of the band’s credo. That, of course, did not fly with the suits at Columbia who nixed the blunt Sex and Dope and left only the vague Cheap Thrills. When it came time for the album cover, the band’s idea was to go with an expected band photo, with a minor twist of taking the photo in their birthday suits. The result proved unsatisfactory, and another no-no for the suits who make the decisions. </p>



<p>The idea of going with a standard band photograph was not
abandoned yet, as Drummer Dave Getz remembers: “Then Bob Cato, CBS’s art
director, thought we should do a photo session with Richard Avedon, perhaps the
most famous fashion photographer in the world. Avedon did his ‘Avedon thing’ on
us; the fan blowing our hair, the strobe lights flashing, white background,
random rearrangement of our faces. It was another huge and costly miss. The
photos were good but more about Avedon than us.”</p>

<p>What’s a band to do now? Enter Crumb the Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills universe. Drummer Dave Getz recalls the moment the idea of asking Crumb to do the cover came up: “We had a huge loft/warehouse in SF where we rehearsed and I lived. I remember us all sitting around and talking ideas for the cover and I said ‘How about asking R.Crumb?’&nbsp; Janis, James (Gurley, guitar player) and I were all big fans of his work, we loved his cartoons which were appearing in the SF underground newspapers and Zap Comics. But outside of SF not that many people knew of his genius.” Through a mutual friend they got Crumb’s number and Janis called him. Crumb continues the tale: “Janis asked me to do an album cover. I liked Janis OK and I did her cover. I took speed and did an all-nighter. The front cover I designed wasn’t used at all. They used the back cover for the front. I got paid $600. The album cover impressed the hell out of girls much more so than the comics. I got a lot of mileage out of that over the years!” Getz adds: “The next weekend Crumb came to our show at The Carousel Ballroom, sat on the floor in our backstage dressing room and observed. He really wasn’t into our music but it didn’t matter. It was maybe one or two days later Crumb called Janis to come and pick up what he’d done.”</p>

<p>Getz is understandably mild in his description of Crumb’s opinion of Big Brother and the Holding Company. Here is Crumb’s version, unadulterated: “She was a swell gal and a very talented singer. Ever heard any of this pre-Big Brother stuff she recorded? She was great. Then she got together with those idiots. The main problem with Big Brother was they were amateur musicians trying to play psychedelic rock and be heavy and you listen to it now and it’s bad… just embarrassing.” Agree with him or not, this is Crumb. Gotta love his candid way of describing things in words and images.</p>



<p>Back to that cover. Crumb’s original idea for the front
cover was a cartoon of the band performing on stage with the band’s faces
pasted on them. The band was less than overwhelmed by this, but then they
looked at what Crumb delivered for the back cover and they saw the light. A
comic strip with a panel for each of the songs plus band members credits. They
immediately decided to make it the front cover and forever cemented the iconic
status of that comic strip among album covers.</p>

<p>Lets give the band some and listen to a few tunes from that album, while looking at the comic panels related to them. </p>

<p>We begin with I Need A Man To Love, a blues-rock number that Crumb adorned with his idea of a well-endowed woman (Janis) stretched on a bed, looking in need, of a man.</p>

<p>Next is the band’s fantastic cover of Summertime, George Gershwin’s song from the 1935 opera Porgy and Bess. The song has been covered many times in operatic and jazz renditions, but here it takes a completely different spin with a wonderful arrangement and solo by the band’s guitarist Sam Andrew. As for Crumb’s depiction of that scene from the musical, lets not even go there. Suffice it to say that a cover like that will not see the light of day today.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>And one more, the song that put the band and Janis Joplin on the map at the Monterey Pop Festival, Big Mama Thornton’s Ball and Chain. The song closes the album with a bang with one of the dirtiest guitar sounds committed to vinyl and a vocal performance for the ages.</p>

<p>Cheap Thrills was released in August of 1968, steadily climbing the Billboard LPs chart until it reached the top and stayed there 8 consecutive weeks. When Janis Joplin announced during a show at the Fillmore East in the fall of 1968 that their album cover was the work of R.Crumb, they received the biggest standing ovation of the night. Crumb was a hero for the hippies, but by that point he was on a very different wavelength. He liked some aspects of the Hippie movement, what he termed as seeing through the hype of consumer culture. He valued how they strived to live simply and saw the ecology movement being sparked by that. But he quickly became disillusioned by the movement: “Since it was mostly children of the middle class, it was immediately something for them to be smug about. ’Oh, I have seen the light and you haven’t. I’m beautiful, I’m spiritual. I lost my ego and you haven’t.’ It became where in any social gathering everybody sat around trying to out-cool each other.” But as he admits, he never felt comfortable in that environment anyway, even when it was at its peak of innocence: “I couldn’t kick off my shows and go dance in the park. I didn’t have it in me.” </p>

<p>In November of 1968, when the album peaked at the top of the
LP charts, the top 10 albums also included Electric Ladyland and Are You Experienced
by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Time Has Come by The Chambers Brothers,
Crown of Creation by Jefferson Airplane, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and
Wheels of Fire by Cream. This was the golden age of psychedelic music. Crumb
was inside the bubble physically, but not mentally.</p>



<p>I want to spend the last part of this article discussing the
music Crumb DID like, for which he produced many album covers and portraits of
musicians, all of them wonderful articles of art. None of them as remotely well
known as Cheap Thrills, however by all means worth looking at.</p>

<p>Crumb owns a large collection of old 78 albums. He talked elaborately about his passion for the music he loves, and the moment he started collecting music: “I always liked the kind of music you’d hear in the background of old movies from the early ‘30s, the early sound movies and cartoons. And then in my searching for old books and comic books, these junk stores had these old 78 records. One day, out of curiosity, I bought some of these records. They were very cheap. I put the records on and voila! ‘Oh my god, that’s the music, that’s the music from these old movies, that’s incredible.’ I was sixteen and I remember very clearly the day that I discovered that you could find those records. They were lying around everywhere in those days, in 1959.”</p>

<p>In his teens Crumb was exposed to 1950s pop music, which he describes as something he had to suffer through, singers like Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Doris Day. He had a period of reprieve with the advent of rock n roll, Elvis Presley and Little Richard: “There was some feeling of blues and old time country in that early rock and roll, it was coming out of really low life in the South. Those people all came from the lowest rung of society.” That period did not last long for him, as it was quickly commercialized for middle class consumption, and he stack with old black blues and folk music ever since.</p>

<p>Asked about how a white guy connects so deeply with black music created in the 1930s, he answered: “I don’t know. There’s something so raw, kind of beauty that speaks to me in a deep and direct way. Personally I barely even know any black people and I can’t relate to lower class black culture very well at all. It’s very alien to me in a certain way, and people I’ve known from that black culture, I’ve never been able to get very close to, because their values are so different. So what is it about their music that speaks so directly? It has some universal appeal because it has had such a big influence on the music of the entire world.”</p>

<p>What a better way to close this article about Crumb and his contributions as an artist to the music world, then mention the stint he had in the mid 1970s as a musician himself. After settling down in Madison, California, Crumb started playing banjo and mandolin in the Cheap Suit Serenaders Band: “They were my pals for years. We sat around playing music together and somebody said we could play a job for $100, so we agreed. It was interesting for a while, but I came to the point where I realized I had to quit. I asked myself ‘Do I want to get more deeply involved in this music business?’ and I really didn’t.”</p>

        AP AUDIO: Quincy Jones, music titan who worked with everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, dies at 91
    </h2>
    
    
    <p>AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on the death of Quincy Jones.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for “Roots” and “In the Heat of the Night,” organized President Bill Clinton’s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World” and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.”</p>




    

<p>In a career which began when records were still played on platters turning at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&amp;B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q,” including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.</p><p>Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that “There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don’t. Nothing’s in between.” Jones’ mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem “senseless” for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.</p>
    

<p>“They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,” he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.</p><p>Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.</p><p>“I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,” he wrote in his autobiography. “That’s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.”</p>
    

<p>Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.</p><p>“We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,” Jones later told Musician magazine. “That’s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.”</p><p>As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early ’60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, “The Color Purple,” received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986. (But, to his great disappointment, no wins). In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.</p><p>“My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,” Jones wrote in his autobiography.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon” to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles’ soulful “In the Heat of the Night” with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, Queen Latifah).</p><p>On “We are the World” alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson – “P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)” – and Donna Summer – “Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) – and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom “Sanford and Son.”</p><p>Jones was a facilitator and maker of the stars. He gave Will Smith a key break in the hit TV show “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” which Jones produced, and through “The Color Purple” he introduced Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg to filmgoers. Starting in the 1960s, he composed more than 35 film scores, including for “The Pawnbroker,” “In the Heat of the Night” and “In Cold Blood.”</p><p>He called scoring “a multifaceted process, an abstract combination of science and soul.”</p><p>Jones’ work on the soundtrack for “The Wiz” led to his partnership with Jackson, who starred in the 1978 movie. In an essay published in Time magazine after Jackson’s death, in 2009, Jones remembered that the singer kept slips of paper on him that contained thoughts by famous thinkers. When Jones asked about the origins of one passage, Jackson answered “Socrates,” but pronounced it “SO-crayts.” Jones corrected him, “Michael, it’s SOCK-ra-tees.”</p><p>“And the look he gave me then, it just prompted me to say, because I’d been impressed by all the things I saw in him during the rehearsal process, ‘I would love to take a shot at producing your album,’” Jones recalled. “And he went back and told the people at Epic Records, and they said, `No way — Quincy’s too jazzy.’ Michael was persistent, and he and his managers went back and said, `Quincy’s producing the album.’ And we proceeded to make ‘Off the Wall.’ Ironically, that was one of the biggest Black-selling albums at the time, and that album saved all the jobs of the people saying I was the wrong guy. That’s the way it works.”</p><p>Tensions emerged after Jackson’s death. In 2013, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/7adb910007e4d705278bed1b7ecb5660">Jones sued Jackson’s estate</a></span>, claiming he was owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the superstar’s greatest hits. In a 2018 interview with New York magazine, he called Jackson “as Machiavellian as they come” and alleged that he lifted material from others.</p><p>Jones was hooked on work and play, and at times suffered for it. He nearly died from a brain aneurysm in 1974 and became deeply depressed in the 1980s after “The Color Purple” was snubbed by Academy Awards voters; he never received a competitive Oscar. A father of seven children by five mothers, Jones described himself as a “dog” who had countless lovers around the world. He was married three times, his wives including the actor Peggy Lipton.</p><p>“To me, loving a woman is one of the most natural, blissful, life-enhancing — and dare I say, religious — acts in the world,” he wrote.</p><p>Along with Rashida, Jones is survived by daughters Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.</p><p>He was not an activist in his early years, but changed after attending the 1968 funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and later befriending the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jones was dedicated to philanthropy, saying “the best and only useful aspect of fame and celebrity is having a platform to help others.”</p><p>His causes included fighting HIV and AIDS, educating children and providing for the poor around the world. He founded the Quincy Jones Listen Up! Foundation to connect young people with music, culture and technology, and said he was driven throughout his life “by a spirit of adventure and a criminal level of optimism.”</p><p>“Life is like a dream, the Spanish poet and philosopher Federico Garcia Lorca said,” Jones wrote in his memoir. “Mine’s been in Technicolor, with full Dolby sound through THX amplification before they knew what these systems were.”</p><div data-align-center="">

</div><div><p>One of the somewhat obscure features of Unix is that the kernel has
a specific interface to get (and set) the 'window size' of your
terminal, and can also send a Unix signal to your process when that
size changes. The official POSIX interface for the former is
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/tcgetwinsize.html">tcgetwinsize()</a>,
but in practice actual Unixes have a standard tty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl">ioctl</a> for this, <code>TIOCGWINSZ</code> (see
eg <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_tty.2.html">Linux ioctl_tty(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/TIOCSWINSZ.2const.html">also</a>) or
<a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?tty(4)">FreeBSD tty(4)</a>). The
signal is officially standardized by POSIX as <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/signal.h.html">SIGWINCH</a>,
which is the name it always has had.  Due to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/113420346633001178">a Fediverse conversation</a>, I looked into
the history of this today, and it turns out to be more interesting
than I expected.</p>

<p>(The inclusion of these interfaces in POSIX turns out to be <a href="https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1151">fairly
recent</a>.)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, 4.2 BSD did not have either TIOCGWINSZ or
SIGWINCH (based on its <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.2BSD/usr/man/man2/sigvec.2">sigvec(2)</a>
and <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.2BSD/usr/man/man4/tty.4">tty(4)</a>
manual pages). Both of these appear in the main BSD line in 4.3
BSD, where <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD/usr/man/man2/sigvec.2">sigvec(2)</a>
has added SIGWINCH (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SignalsHowOld">as the first new signal along with some others</a>) and <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD/usr/man/man4/tty.4">tty(4)</a> has
TIOCGWINSZ. This timing makes a certain amount of sense in Unix
history. At the time of 4.2 BSD's development and release, people
were connecting to Unix systems using serial terminals, which had
more or less fixed sizes that were covered by termcap's basic size
information. By the time of 4.3 BSD in 1986, Unix workstations
existed and with them, terminal windows that could have their size
changed on the fly; a way of finding out (and changing) this size
was an obvious need, along with a way for full-screen programs like
vi to get notified if their terminal window was resized on the fly.</p>

<p>However, as far as I can tell 4.3 BSD itself did not originate
SIGWINCH, although it may be the source of TIOCGWINSZ. The FreeBSD
project has manual pages for a variety of Unixes, including 'Sun
OS 0.4', which seems to be an extremely early release from early
1983. This release has a <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=signal&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=Sun+UNIX+0.4&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html">signal(2)</a>
with a SIGWINCH signal (using signal number 28, which is what 4.3
BSD will use for it), but no (documented) TIOCGWINSZ. However, it
does have <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sizesh&amp;sektion=1&amp;apropos=0&amp;manpath=Sun+UNIX+0.4">some programs that generate custom $TERMCAP values with
the right current window sizes</a>.</p>

<p>The Internet Archives has <a href="https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Sun+Microsystems%22">a variety of historical material from
Sun Microsystems</a>,
including (some) documentation for both SunOS 2.0 and SunOS 3.0.
This documentation makes it clear that the primary purpose of
SIGWINCH was to tell graphical programs that their window (or one
of them) had been changed, and they should repaint the window or
otherwise refresh the contents (a program with multiple windows
didn't get any indication of which window was damaged; the programming
advice is to repaint them all). The SunOS 2.0 <a href="https://archive.org/details/sun-system-interface/page/n302/mode/1up">tgetent()</a>
termcap function will specifically update what it gives you with
the current size of your window, but as far as I can tell there's
no other documented support of getting window sizes; it's not
mentioned in <a href="https://archive.org/details/sun-system-interface/page/n359/mode/1up">tty(4)</a> or
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sun-system-interface/page/n350/mode/1up">pty(4)</a>.
Similar wording appears in <a href="https://archive.org/details/unix-interface-ref">the SunOS 3.0 Unix Interface Reference
Manual</a>.</p>

<p>(There are PDFs of some SunOS documentation online (<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/sun/sunos/">eg</a>), and up through SunOS 3.5 I
can't find any mention of directly getting the 'window size'.  In
SunOS 4.0, we finally get a TIOCGWINSZ, documented in termio(4).
However, I have access to SunOS 3.5 source, and it does have a
TIOCGWINSZ ioctl, although that ioctl isn't documented. It's entirely
likely that TIOCGWINSZ was added (well) before SunOS 3.5.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://github.com/weiss/original-bsd">this Git version of the original BSD development
history</a>, BSD itself added
both SIGWINCH and TIOCGWINSZ at the end of 1984. The early SunOS
had SIGWINCH and it may well have had TIOCGWINSZ as well, so it's
possible that BSD got both from SunOS. It's also possible that early
SunOS had a different (terminal) window size mechanism than TIOCGWINSZ,
one more specific to their window system, and the UCB CSRG decided
to create a more general mechanism that Sun then copied back by the
time of SunOS 3.5 (possibly before the official release of 4.3 BSD,
since I suspect everyone in the BSD world was talking to each other
at that time).</p>

<p>PS: SunOS also appears to be the source of the mysteriously missing
signal 29 in 4.3 BSD (mentioned in my entry on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SignalsHowOld">how old various
Unix signals are</a>). As described in the SunOS 3.4
sigvec() manual page, signal 29 is 'SIGLOST', "resource lost (see
lockd(8C))". This appears to have been added at some point between
the initial SunOS 3.0 release and SunOS 3.4, but I don't know exactly
when.</p>

      <p>Do you work in Software Engineering, and have you seen messages or sentences like these before?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Can’t we <em>just</em> set up a redirect to this other domain?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why don’t we <em>just</em> add some caching to speed that page up?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I read their documentation, and we <em>just</em> need to inject some javascript, we should be all set!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too, and it drives me a little crazy.</p>

<p>Not because anyone is being rude, or because anything they are saying is necessarily wrong. Nobody is being intentionally malice, here. <strong>It’s that (in my opinion) the word “<em>just</em>” added as a qualifier to an idea carries with it a whole bunch of implied baggage.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-baggage">The Baggage</h2>

<h2 id="implies-simplicity">Implies Simplicity</h2>

<p>First and foremost, the word “<em>just</em>” implies that an idea is simple. “Oh, we can <em>just</em> do this!”.</p>

<p>If there is one thing I’ve learned with Software Engineering, it’s that <em>Computers are Hard</em> and implementation details matter, especially when it comes to complexity. Very rarely can the complexity of an engineering solution be outlined in a single sentence. There is almost always more to it.</p>

<p>Let’s take one of the above examples of “<em>just</em>” injecting javascript into the page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do we trust this javascript to run on our page? What is the security posture of the javascript author?</li>
  <li>What dependencies does the script have, and are they trusted and up-to-date?</li>
  <li>What data is being sent from their javascript? Do we need to update our privacy policy?</li>
  <li>How will the javascript be minified?</li>
  <li>Does it work with our other libraris, such as React or Turbolinks?</li>
  <li>Do we need to load this Javascript from a third party? What if that server goes down? Can we trust the integrity of their server?</li>
  <li>Do we need to update our Content Security Policy for this script?</li>
  <li>What sort of performance impact will this have on our page load performance?</li>
  <li>Does the script need to run at any a particular point in the page load process?</li>
  <li>Does the styling of the DOM elements it produces match our brand? Is that important?</li>
  <li>What sort of impact will this have on the accessibility of our website?</li>
  <li>Who is going to maintain this javascript, and update it when it needs to be?</li>
  <li>How will we monitor if this javascript snippet is still working?</li>
  <li>If the business decides to stop using it, who will tell us and how will we know?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reinforces-imposter-syndrome">Reinforces Imposter Syndrome</h2>

<p>Many engineers report having Imposter Syndrome, with some data even suggesting over <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-58-of-tech-employees-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome/">half of engineers</a> at most major Silicon Valley companies.</p>

<p>Let’s paint the picture of a very common, every-day scenario…</p>

<p>Imagine being an engineer with Imposter Syndrome, and you are working on solving a problem all day. You find yourself stuck on a few tricky details on the solutions you are considering, and so you ask for help from a Senior Engineer on your team. You sit down, start to talk through it, and your coworker says…</p>

<p><strong>“what if you <em>just</em> do this?”</strong></p>

<p>I ask you, reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Would you feel good or happy to hear that?</li>
  <li>If you disagreed, would you voice that disagreement with such a confident and simple answer from a Senior Engineer?</li>
  <li>If you don’t understand, do you ask “what do you mean?”</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is probably not. How could you disagree with such a simple answer?! Or not understand it?!</p>

<h2 id="reduces-ideation">Reduces Ideation</h2>

<p>Because of the implications the word “<em>just</em>” comes with, I believe that engineers are less likely to ideate and brainstorm in that environment.</p>

<p>In the face of an idea that says to “<em>just</em> do this”, I believe engineers are less confident in voicing disagreement, and are less likely to ask “what do you mean?” to truly understand the problem and the solution.</p>

<p>A team where engineers aren’t asking for clarification, don’t understand their solutions, and aren’t voicing alternative approaches is <strong>not a team that I hope to be on</strong>. That team is missing out on so much, including great ideas.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>My solution is simple: stop qualifying your statements with the word “<em>just</em>”.</p>

<p>Of course, I’ll acknowledge right away that such as task is not easy. And I continue to use the word by mistake all the time! But I try hard not to, and I believe I am better for it.</p>

<p>When I catch myself typing a sentence that uses the word “just”, I pause and rephrase my sentence to avoid using it. I find that doing so helps for me to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get better response and ideation back from others</li>
  <li>clarify my thinking with strong examples and evidence</li>
  <li>orient the discussion towards a more generative mindset</li>
  <li>produce a healthier debate with more learning and sharing from everyone</li>
</ul>

<p>So please… <em>just</em> stop saying “<em>just</em>”!</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in generating text, benefiting from extensive training on vast textual corpora. However, LLMs may also acquire unwanted behaviors from the diverse and sensitive nature of their training data, which can include copyrighted and private content. Machine unlearning has been introduced as a viable solution to remove the influence of such problematic content without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. This process aims to erase specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving as much model utility as possible. Despite the effectiveness of current unlearning methods, little attention has been given to whether existing unlearning methods for LLMs truly achieve forgetting or merely hide the knowledge, which current unlearning benchmarks fail to detect. This paper reveals that applying quantization to models that have undergone unlearning can restore the "forgotten" information. To thoroughly evaluate this phenomenon, we conduct comprehensive experiments using various quantization techniques across multiple precision levels. We find that for unlearning methods with utility constraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\% of the intended forgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\% after 4-bit quantization. Based on our empirical findings, we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed phenomenon and propose a quantization-robust unlearning strategy to mitigate this intricate issue...

                    <p>A new molecule developed by Stanford Medicine researchers (turquoise and yellow) tethers two proteins (purple and red) that together switch on self-destruction genes in cancer cells.<br>

<div id="main_content">
    <p>Our bodies divest themselves of 60 billion cells every day through a natural process of cell culling and turnover called apoptosis.</p>
<p>These cells — mainly blood and gut cells — are all replaced with new ones, but the way our bodies rid themselves of material could have profound implications for cancer therapies in a new approach developed by Stanford Medicine researchers.</p>
<p>They aim to use this natural method of cell death to trick cancer cells into disposing of themselves. Their method accomplishes this by artificially bringing together two proteins in such a way that the new compound switches on a set of cell death genes, ultimately driving tumor cells to turn on themselves. The researchers describe their <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5361?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">latest such compound</a> in a paper published Oct. 4 in <i>Science</i>.</p>
<p>The idea came to <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/gerald-crabtree">Gerald Crabtree</a>, MD, a professor of development biology, during a pandemic stroll through the forests of Kings Mountain, west of Palo Alto, California. As he walked, Crabtree, a longtime cancer biologist, was thinking about major milestones in biology.</p>
<p>One of the milestones he pondered was the 1970s-era discovery that cells trigger their own deaths for the greater good of the organism. Apoptosis turns out to be critical for many biological processes, including proper development of all organs and the fine-tuning of our immune systems. That system retains pathogen-recognizing cells but kills off self-recognizing ones, thus preventing autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>“It occurred to me, Well gee, this is the way we want to treat cancer,” said Crabtree, a co-senior author on the study who is the David Korn, MD, Professor in Pathology. “We essentially want to have the same kind of specificity that can eliminate 60 billion cells with no bystanders, so no cell is killed that is not the proper object of the killing mechanism.”</p>


</div>

<div id="main_text">
    <p>Traditional treatments for cancer — namely chemotherapy and radiation — often kill large numbers of healthy cells alongside the cancerous ones. To harness cells’ natural and highly specific self-destruction abilities, the team developed a kind of molecular glue that sticks together two proteins that normally would have nothing to do with one another.</p>
<h3>Flipping the cancer script</h3>
<p>One of these proteins, BCL6, when mutated, drives the blood cancer known as diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma. This kind of cancer-driving protein is also referred to as an oncogene. In lymphoma, the mutated BCL6 sits on DNA near apoptosis-promoting genes and keeps them switched off, helping the cancer cells retain their signature immortality.</p>
<p>The researchers developed a molecule that tethers BCL6 to a protein known as CDK9, which acts as an enzyme that catalyzes gene activation, in this case, switching on the set of apoptosis genes that BCL6 normally keeps off.</p>
<p>“The idea is, Can you turn a cancer dependency into a cancer-killing signal?” asked <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/nathanael-gray">Nathanael Gray</a>, PhD, co-senior author with Crabtree, the Krishnan-Shah Family Professor and a chemical and systems biology professor. “You take something that the cancer is addicted to for its survival and you flip the script and make that be the very thing that kills it.”</p>
<p>This approach — switching something on that is off in cancer cells — stands in contrast to many other kinds of targeted cancer therapies that inhibit specific drivers of cancer, switching off something that is normally on.</p>
<p>“Since oncogenes were discovered, people have been trying to shut them down in cancer,” said Roman Sarott, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford Medicine and co-first author on the study. “Instead, we’re trying to use them to turn signaling on that, we hope, will prove beneficial for treatment.”</p>

</div>

<div id="main_text_0">
    <p>When the team tested the molecule in diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma cells in the lab, they found that it indeed killed the cancer cells with high potency. They also tested the molecule in healthy mice and found no obvious toxic side effects, even though the molecule killed off a specific category of of the animals’ healthy B cells, a kind of immune cell, which also depend on BCL6. They’re now testing the compound in mice with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to gauge its ability to kill cancer in a living animal.</p>
<p>Because the technique relies on the cells’ natural supply of BCL6 and CDK9 proteins, it seems to be very specific for the lymphoma cells — the BCL6 protein is found only in this kind of lymphoma cell and in one specific kind of B cell. The researchers tested the molecule in 859 different kinds of cancer cells in the lab; the chimeric compound killed only diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma cells.</p>
<p>And because BCL6 normally acts on 13 different apoptosis-promoting genes, the researchers hope their strategy will avoid the treatment resistance that seems so common in cancer. Cancer is often able to rapidly adapt to therapies that target only one of the disease’s weak spots, and some of these therapies may stop cancer from growing without killing the cells entirely. The research team hopes that by blasting the cells with multiple different cell death signals at once, the cancer will not be able to survive long enough to evolve resistance, although this idea remains to be tested.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of cell death by committee,” said Sai Gourisankar, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar and co-first author on the study. “And once a cancer cell is dead, that’s a terminal state.”</p>
<p>Crabtree and Gray, both members of the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/cancer.html">Stanford Cancer Institute</a>, are co-founders of a biotech startup, Shenandoah Therapeutics, that aims to further test this molecule and a similar, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06348-2">previously developed molecule</a> in hopes of gathering enough pre-clinical data to support launching clinical trials of the compounds. They also plan to build similar molecules that could target other cancer-driving proteins, including the oncogene Ras, which is a driver of several different kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Institutes of Health (grants CA276167, CA163915, MH126720-01 and 5F31HD103339-03), the Mary Kay Foundation, the Schweitzer Family Fund, the SPARK Translational Research Program at Stanford University and Bio-X at Stanford University.</p>
