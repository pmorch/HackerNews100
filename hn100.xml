          <h2>Basic explainer</h2>
          <p>Google Scholar is a tool that helps researchers find and read research papers. It started 20 years ago, and it's been growing ever since.  It's like a giant library for research, with lots of cool features. You can even use it to find legal cases, save articles, and follow your favorite authors.  It's been used in some surprising ways, like helping people reconnect with family history and even getting marriage proposals!</p>

        <p data-block-key="7l8nl">Google Scholar, a tool used by researchers around the world, was founded by two researchers. We started Scholar in 2004, physically delivering hard drives to the office (see fact number 2), and two decades later adding new AI features (see fact number 6). To celebrate 20 years of Google Scholar, here are 20 fun facts about its origins, how you can use it and what’s new.</p>
      </div>
  

  
    

  

  
    <div data-component="uni-article-paragraph" data-analytics-module="{
           &quot;module_name&quot;: &quot;Paragraph&quot;,
           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;20 things you didn’t know about Google Scholar&quot;
         }"><h2 data-block-key="54fr1">The early days</h2><p data-block-key="5kgpf"><b>1. The team started with just two of us.</b> Back in 2004, access to academic information was difficult to navigate and often restricted behind paywalls. We wanted to make it possible for researchers to be able to find and read what their peers had written. After nine months of development, our vision came to life as Google Scholar, which would end up making it easy for people to discover and engage with research.</p><p data-block-key="fouk8"><b>2. We physically delivered files at first.</b> In the early days of Google Scholar, slow, flaky internet speeds made it hard to gather research to build this online research library. As a workaround, the team embraced a low-tech solution dubbed the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">Sneakernet.</a>” Instead of relying solely on slow downloads, publishers would load articles on physical hard drives and we would pick up these drives on the way to the office.</p><p data-block-key="atfso"><b>3. A baby set the deadline for launching Scholar.</b> It was crunch time leading up to Thanksgiving, and Alex was awaiting the birth of his son, Nicholas. He was heading out on paternity leave shortly, but we still had a lot of work to bring Scholar into the world. We pulled some all-nighters to meet our deadline — and to make sure Alex wouldn’t miss the birth of his child.</p><p data-block-key="3fuma"><b>4. Scholar’s product motto pays tribute to our fellow researchers.</b> In the research community, we build on the foundation laid by others, hence our product motto: “Standing on the shoulders of giants.” It's a testament to the collaborative nature of discovery and Scholar’s goal to help researchers everywhere readily access and build upon the accumulated knowledge of those who have come before. We hope to always be able to help researchers everywhere see further.</p><p data-block-key="5fp45"><b>5. Our goal is to make Scholar comprehensive.</b> Imagine a library with tons of books, articles and research papers, in numerous languages, from every corner of the world. That’s what we aim to do with Scholar. On its index, you can find peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports and other scholarly literature.</p></div>

Review a paper efficiently and effectively with AI outlines.</b> We recently added<a href="https://scholar.googleblog.com/2024/11/ai-outlines-in-scholar-pdf-reader-skim.html"> AI outlines</a> to <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-scholar-pdf-reader/dahenjhkoodjbpjheillcadbppiidmhp?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=scholar.googleblog.com&amp;utm_campaign=kp&amp;utm_content=top">Scholar PDF Reader</a> to help you read papers both quickly and in depth. PDF reader provides a one-click preview of cited articles, linked figure and table mentions, citing and related articles. Now with AI outlines, you can quickly grasp the main points or delve into specific details that pique your interest, explore methods, results, discussions or any intriguing nuance.</p><p data-block-key="4b8k5"><b>7. Unlock the law with Scholar’s “Case law” button.</b> For most of the first 250 years of U.S. history, accessing legal documents was a challenge because they weren't easily accessible. But thanks to Google Scholar's comprehensive case law collection, anyone can explore the laws that govern them. Just select "Case law" below the search bar, type your query and dive in.</p><p data-block-key="1ip9q"><b>8. Copy article citations in the style of your choice.</b> No more manually formatting bibliographies. With a click of the "cite" button, Google Scholar provides ready-to-use citations in a number of different formats. Simply select and use the style you need.</p><p data-block-key="22ure"><b>9. Celebrate research milestones.</b> At Scholar, we know how hard it is to reach the finish line. That’s why we take celebrating milestones pretty seriously and have a <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22google+scholar%22+balloons+citations&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">balloon display</a> on the Scholar homepage for users who reach a milestone number of citations.</p></div>

         }"><h2 data-block-key="deg3o">Tools and tricks to make the most out of Scholar</h2><p data-block-key="f6ff3"><b>10. Expand your access to research.</b>Today Google Scholar partners with libraries and publishers worldwide to ensure access to subscription-based articles directly within your search results. And if a free version exists (like a preprint), Scholar will point you there, too.</p><p data-block-key="4huak"><b>11. Create your own research library.</b> With Google Scholar, you can save articles to your personal library with a single click. Organize your research, create custom folders and access your library from anywhere with an internet connection.</p><p data-block-key="65ig"><b>12. Become a research “superfan.”</b> In the fast-paced world of academia, staying current is essential. On Scholar, you can follow specific authors to receive email alerts every time they publish something new. This feature allows researchers and students to easily track new discoveries, trends, debates and stay up-to-date on the latest research from the people who matter most to you and of course your competitors.</p><p data-block-key="ep5f9"><b>13. More papers, not less, during the pandemic:</b> Library subscriptions are usually available only while you’re on campus. Once you go home you lose all access. When COVID-19 hit, researchers everywhere were locked out of their labs and worked from home. Thanks to work we had done with publisher partners on portable subscriptions — Scholar’s off-campus access program — researchers could still get their work done. In fact, during the pandemic, researchers read and wrote more than ever before, leading to a sharp jump in papers published between 2020 and 2021.</p></div>

Think your research abstract is concise? Think again.</b> Check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2832">physics abstract</a> that contains only two words — “Probably not.” It's proof that sometimes, less is more (at least in the world of academic publishing).</p><p data-block-key="eegt7"><b>18.

Chester’s starring role came about because his co-author/owner, Jack H. Hetherington wrote the entire paper with the plural “we” instead of a single “I.”</p><p data-block-key="4tm7n"><b>19.

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, I’m Hunter the founder of Regatta Storage (<a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a>). Regatta Storage is a new cloud file system that provides unlimited pay-as-you-go capacity, local-like performance, and automatic synchronization to S3-compatible storage. For example, you can use Regatta to instantly access massive data sets in S3 with Spark, Pytorch, or pandas without paying for large, local disks or waiting for the data to download.</p><p>Check out an overview of how the service works here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY</a>, and you can try it for free at <a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a> after signing up for an account. We wanted to let you try it without an account, but we figured that “Hacker News shares a file system and S3 bucket” wouldn’t be the best experience for the community.</p><p>I built Regatta after spending nearly a decade building and operating at-scale cloud storage at places like Amazon’s Elastic File System (EFS) and Netflix. During my 8 years at EFS, I learned a lot about how teams thought about their storage usage. Users frequently told me that they loved how simple and scalable EFS was, and -- like S3 -- they didn’t have to guess how much capacity they needed up front.</p><p>When I got to Netflix, I was surprised that there wasn’t more usage of EFS. If you looked around, it seemed like a natural fit. Every application needed a POSIX file system. Lots of applications had unclear or spikey storage needs. Often, developers wanted their storage to last beyond the lifetime of an individual instance or container. In fact, if you looked across all Netflix applications, some ridiculous amount of money was being spent on <i>empty storage space</i> because each of these local drives had to be overprovisioned for potential usage.</p><p>I tried to evangelize EFS, but I got consistent pushback. Other engineers told me that NFS was slow or chatty and couldn’t deliver adequate performance for their applications. Most of these applications were transferring data from S3 for analysis, and then uploading some set of results. Using EFS as the backing storage system meant that the teams would need to “clean up” this temporary data when the jobs were done.</p><p>At this point, I realized that there was a missing solution in the cloud storage market which wasn’t being filled by either block or file storage, and I decided to build Regatta.</p><p>Regatta is a pay-as-you-go cloud file system that automatically expands with your application. Because it automatically synchronizes with S3 using native file formats, you can connect it to existing data sets and use recently written file data directly from S3. When data isn’t actively being used, it’s removed from the Regatta cache, so you only pay for the backing S3 storage. Finally, we’re developing a custom file protocol which allows us to achieve local-like performance for small-file workloads <i>and</i> Lustre-like scale-out performance for distributed data jobs.</p><p>Under the hood, customers mount a Regatta file system by connecting to our fleet of caching instances over NFSv3 (soon, our custom protocol). Our instances then connect to the customer’s S3 bucket on the backend, and provide sub-millisecond cached-read and write performance. This durable cache allows us to provide a strongly consistent, efficient view of the file system to all connected file clients. We can perform challenging operations (like directory renaming) quickly and durably, while they asynchronously propagate to the S3 bucket.</p><p>We’re excited to see users share our vision for Regatta. We have teams who are using us to build totally serverless Jupyter notebook servers for their AI researchers who prefer to upload and share data using the S3 web UI. We have teams who are using us as a distributed caching layer on top of S3 for low-latency access to common files. We have teams who are replacing their thin-provisioned Ceph boot volumes with Regatta for significant savings. We can’t wait to see what other things people will build and we hope you’ll give us a try at regattastorage.com.</p><p>We’d love to get any early feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I’ll be in the comments for the next few hours to respond!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, my team and I fixed an absolutely bizarre bug that only one person in the team could reproduce. And to make it even weirder, she was only able to reproduce the issue when using her work laptop at home; it worked fine with the same laptop in the office.</p><h2 id="heading-so-what-was-the-bug">So what was the bug?<a href="#heading-so-what-was-the-bug"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The BBC's UK website uses a <code>click</code> event to respond to when a user activates the 'More' button. <code>click</code> events aren't just activated by the click of a mouse; they can also be activated by touch and the 'enter' or 'space' keys on a keyboard.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-bbc-global-nav.png" alt="Screenshot of BBC global navigation bar opened using the 'more' button." loading="lazy" width="792" height="280"></p><p>Our 'more' button should open a menu. However, when she was clicking on it at home, the <code>click</code> event didn't seem to do anything. Instead, the menu opened using our no-JavaScript fallback behaviour.</p><p><em>That's strange.</em> 💭</p><p>When we looked into it a bit more, we found out that the bug only happened when her web browser window was on one of her external monitors. She had two external monitors and it happened on both. But when she clicked the button on her laptop screen, the button worked as expected.</p><p><em>What?</em> 🤯</p><p>And to make it even stranger, the bug didn't happen in Safari.</p><p><em>What? What? What?</em> 🤯 🤯 🤯</p><p>So why on earth was something like a user's external monitor set up affecting <code>click</code> events on our website? And why was this bug not happening to everyone else in our team who used an external monitor? It was very strange indeed.</p><h2 id="heading-reproducing-the-issue">Reproducing the issue<a href="#heading-reproducing-the-issue"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We wanted to be able to reproduce the bug to properly investigate it, so we needed to understand what it was in her home environment that triggered it.</p><p>Since the bug only occurred on her external monitors, we noticed that it stopped if she repositioned them in the OS settings. Her external monitors were positioned above her laptop, so once we replicated that arrangement in our OS settings, we were finally able to reproduce the bug, too.</p><p><em>Bingo!</em></p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-multi-monitor-negative.png" alt="Screenshot of macOS display settings. Second monitor is shown arranged top left of the built-in laptop monitor." loading="lazy" width="1516" height="916"></p><h2 id="heading-our-investigation">Our investigation<a href="#heading-our-investigation"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We had two clues to begin our investigation:</p><ul><li><strong>1st clue:</strong> <mark>The bug didn't occur on Safari</mark>.</li><li><strong>2nd clue:</strong> <mark>The bug only happened when the external monitors were positioned above and left of the main monitor</mark>.</li></ul><p>Our next step was to investigate our 'more' button's <code>click</code> event handler function.</p><p>While reproducing the issue, a <code>console.log</code> of our 'more' button's click event showed our <strong>3rd clue:</strong> that, <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties were negative numbers</mark>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Even though they can be triggered by any kind of input, <code>click</code> events are a type of <code>PointerEvent</code>, so their <code>event</code> objects include information about the mouse or touch pointers that trigger the clicks. For example, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties show the coordinates (in pixels) for what point on the screen gets clicked on.</p></blockquote><p>That surprised me, because I didn't know those properties were allowed to have negative numbers. I checked the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#dom-mouseevent-screenx">DOM UI Events spec</a> to see if that was correct, but there didn't seem to be any specific information about it.</p><p>With some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwzOhHFGZKw">Ace Attorney Investigations-style logic</a>, when we put together the fact that <mark>the bug didn't occur on Safari</mark> and that, <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties were negative numbers</mark>, we could deduce that browsers have an interoperability issue in how they represent screen coordinates in multi-monitor set ups.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-aai-logic.gif" alt="Animation of the logic sequence in Ace Attorney Investigations.

  <p>"It is an existential crisis," he said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Holding the outside world at bay&nbsp;</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-morley-safer-visited-a-fairy-tale-kingdom/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bhutan</a></span>, which is about the size of Maryland, was largely isolated from the rest of the world for centuries. The kingdom was so protective of its unique Buddhist culture that it only started allowing foreign tourists to visit in the 1970s and didn't introduce television until 1999.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>Buddhism is the country's national religion. Bhutanese, especially older men and women, spend hours spinning prayer wheels full of Buddhist scriptures. Prayer flags flutter on hillsides and in forests, turning nature itself into a shrine.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhutan's capital city of Thimpu still has no traffic lights. The nation's roads are shared by cars and cows.</p><p>Dasho Kinley Dorji, who ran Bhutan's first newspaper before serving as the government's minister of information and communications, describes the population as nervous, surrounded as it is by India and China, and lacking military might or economic power.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/f15b6214-c8b0-4f8b-b800-08ea711e9c7c/thumbnail/620x349/b10cb5312d6b8dc4e86817671f3dbf32/dasho-kinley-dorji.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Dasho Kinley Dorji speaks with Lesley Stahl " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/f15b6214-c8b0-4f8b-b800-08ea711e9c7c/thumbnail/620x349/b10cb5312d6b8dc4e86817671f3dbf32/dasho-kinley-dorji.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/f15b6214-c8b0-4f8b-b800-08ea711e9c7c/thumbnail/1240x698/6f066d1bcaac64f3a10874e2e794dae7/dasho-kinley-dorji.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>Bhutanese wear different clothes and construct buildings in a traditional architectural style. The culture remains strong today.&nbsp;</p><p>"We came to realize that, you know, that what we had in the past, what is old, is actually very valuable," Dorji said.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhutan was, and is today, largely a subsistence agricultural society. Many families still live in multigenerational farmhouses.&nbsp;</p><p>The country was unified by the man who became its first king in 1907. His sons and grandsons — who are referred to in Bhutan as the second, third, fourth and today, fifth, kings — have reigned since.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bhutan's unique path to modernity&nbsp;</h2><p>It was Bhutan's fourth king who, as a young, newly-crowned ruler in the 1970s, set Bhutan onto its path toward modernity. Jigme Singye Wangchuck, on his way home from a summit of nonaligned nations in Cuba, landed at an airport in India, where journalists asked him what Bhutan's gross national product was.&nbsp;</p><p>"And the king said, 'Actually, in Bhutan, gross national happiness is much more important to us than gross national product,'" Dorji recounted.&nbsp;</p><p>The phrase stuck and attracted international attention. Maximizing Gross National Happiness became a primary responsibility of Bhutan's government, led today by Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/620x349/8f087cf03f1f013345d8d653f7746036/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/620x349/8f087cf03f1f013345d8d653f7746036/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/1240x698/79d51679c662135e7f143e3f82dc1a2a/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>"Gross National Happiness acknowledges that economic growth is important, but that growth must be sustainable. It must… be balanced by the preservation of our unique culture," Tobgay said. "People matter. Our happiness, our well-being matters. Everything should serve that."</p>

    
    

<p>Every five years, surveyors fan out across Bhutan measuring the nation's happiness. The results are analyzed and factored into public policy.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gross National Happiness does not directly equate to happiness in the moment. One happiness is fleeting, it is emotion, it is joy," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-traditions-of-bhutan-60-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Experiencing Bhutan's ancient and wondrous traditions</a></li></ul><p>The other — the kind Bhutan is focused on, Tobgay said — is contentment, being happy with life and oneself.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also about nature. By law, at least 60% of the country must remain under forest cover. And with most of its energy coming from hydroelectric power, Bhutan was the first and remains today one of the only countries in the world to be carbon negative.&nbsp;</p><p>It earns foreign revenue selling excess hydropower to India and from tourism, but there are limits. The country is full of gorgeous mountains, but summiting mountain peaks isn't allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>"For a Bhutanese, it's very easy to understand: You know, the mountains are sacred," Dorji said.&nbsp;</p><p>School is taught in English and it's free, as is health care.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>And though the country has a king, Bhutan is also a democracy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Introducing Bhutan to democracy</h2><p>A quarter century after introducing Gross National Happiness, the fourth king decided the best thing for his country would be to have an elected parliament and a prime minister.&nbsp;</p><p>"[It's] the only country where<span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bhutans-reluctant-road-to-democracy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""> democracy was introduced</a></span> in a time of peace and stability, where democracy was literally gifted, imposed on the people, not just gifted, because the people didn't want it," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reporter, Dorji covered the king's travels throughout Bhutan as he held meetings called consultations to discuss the idea with his subjects. Dorji remembers people begging the king not to institute a democracy.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/620x349/59c32fa71bd725415ffa8d50e8c1daf9/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Bhutan's king with Lesley Stahl " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/620x349/59c32fa71bd725415ffa8d50e8c1daf9/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/1240x698/4f57142cc6e241bc794c077fd92af141/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

"Which is really synonymous with violence, with corruption. So they said, 'No, thank you. We don't really need that. We are fine.'"</p><p>The king was not swayed by their arguments, arguing in response that a leader chosen by birth and not by merit might one day lead the country to disaster. Then, at just 51, he abdicated and passed the crown to his 26-year-old son, the fifth and current king. Bhutanese headed to the polls for the first time ever in 2008.</p><p>Today the fifth king is 44. He is adored in the country and works closely with the prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<h2>So why are young Bhutanese leaving the country in record numbers?</h2><p>Bhutan is currently facing what is known in the country as a crisis of outmigration. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Bhutan's economy hard, shutting down tourism. Recovery has been slow.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Bhutanese, with their excellent English, found higher-paying jobs in Australia, even doing menial labor. Word of opportunities spread fast on social media and now a devastating 9% of the country's population, most of them young people, have left.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is a very difficult situation for Bhutan," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Luring people back with a City of Mindfulness&nbsp;</h2><p>Bhutan's government has mobilized, with the king launching a bold, high-stakes plan to lure people back. Prime Minister Tobgay is trying to attract more business and tourists to Bhutan, highlighting landmarks like a centuries-old suspension bridge, part of an ancient 250-mile trail from one end of the country to the other that is now open to trekking tourists.&nbsp;</p><p>But tourism can only do so much and Bhutan's king knows it, so he has decided to create a new city in southern Bhutan with different rules from the rest of the country. It will be an attempt at a new model of robust economic development, while still holding true to Bhutanese values.&nbsp;</p><p>The king is calling it the Gelephu Mindfulness City.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned to Danish architect <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-architect-bjarke-ingels-billion-dollar-designs/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bjarke Ingels</a></span> to design it. The new city will have neighborhoods nestled between the area's many rivers, connected by a series of unusual bridges. The bridges will also act as public buildings, with one home to a Buddhist center, another to health care facilities and yet another a university. There won't be any skyscrapers, and everything will be built with local materials.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/620x349/37163192d257b344a8547e5e1f3fd5b4/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Danish architect Bjarke Ingels " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/620x349/37163192d257b344a8547e5e1f3fd5b4/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/1240x698/39653bcb18ca41cea483029b47028571/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Right now, the area — located in Bhutan's lowlands — is largely undeveloped. Dr. Lotay Tshering, a former prime minister whom the king has tapped to lead the new city, said it will be built in phases over the next two decades, with no polluting industries allowed.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>The area is also home to a lot of wildlife, including elephants. The new city will have wildlife corridors to protect the animals.&nbsp;</p><p>The king has said the success of the project will shape the future of Bhutan.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we say we follow the principles of Gross National Happiness, we do not mean we are happy with less… We also want to be rich. We also want to be technologically high standard," Dr. Tshering said. "We want Bhutanese to be heading multi-million dollar companies, multinational companies."</p><p>A Bhutanese team is collaborating with experts around the world, seeking investors to help build the city, the cost of which is likely to run in the billions. The city will have its own legal framework modeled on Singapore's and will run on clean hydroelectric power, with the hope of drawing technology companies, especially AI.</p><h2>Deciding to stay</h2><p>Ingels presented his plans to the king, and the king then presented them to the nation, last December.&nbsp;</p><p>Namgay Zam, a journalist who used to anchor Bhutan's nightly newscast, was in attendance. She'd been in the middle of planning a move to Australia with her family when she went to hear the king that day at a packed stadium.</p><p>"He did what no king had done before. He asked the people to help him directly. And he said, 'Will you help me?' And there was shocked silence," Zam said. "Even for me, I froze. And I was like, 'Did he just ask us to help him?' And then he said, 'Will you help me,' a second time."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/620x349/7c2e479d49acdca1e85261eee9a228f6/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Namgay Zam " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/620x349/7c2e479d49acdca1e85261eee9a228f6/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/1240x698/67661abb73cbb1500e9f4defac53f065/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>"I came home and I told my husband, 'We can't leave,'" Zam said. "And he said, 'Why?' And I said, 'I've signed a social contract with his majesty, because I said yes.'"</p><p>Zam and her husband did not go to Australia, but the king and his family did. He visited the country last month to bring his vision for the new Gelephu Mindfulness City and the future of Bhutan to packed stadiums of more than 20,000 Bhutanese who live in Australia now, all in the hopes of one day luring them back home.&nbsp;</p><p>"If we succeed, we can show that you can create a city that does not displace nature, that is anchored and rooted in the local heritage and culture, and that still allows for growth and prosperity to happen," Ingels said. "That is a struggle a lot of places in the world are struggling with."</p>

<h2>Also known as: why you shouldn’t trust a company who makes their product intensionally inaccessible with allowing you an accessibility workaround</h2>



<p>Update: I’ve been informed that hCaptcha now has a text captcha option. The bulk of this blog post still stands. Thanks to D Hamlin for the correction. Also thanks to T Spivey for pointing out my capitalization error causing eloquence users to just hear captcha. This has also been fixed. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Well I’m back again with a long overdue blog post. Once again, it’s a warning of something crazy. Seems I’m good at coming up with blog posts for those lol. Anyway, let’s get on with it</p>



<p>I’m sure you’ve seen the hCaptcha captcha service, where you check a box and then need to select all images of a house or whatever. If you’re not aware, they intensionally do not provide an audio captcha version for the blind since they say this would make it easier for bots to get through. Instead, they provide a special account for blind people that allows them to get a cookie which lets them get past the captcha without a challenge…</p>



<p>This should be warning sign umber one. If they’re intensionally making their captcha inaccessible, then why should you trust them with an accessibility workaround. What happens when they decide that the accessibility workaround is causing too much of a headache? What happens when bots start using it to get past the captcha for free? We’ll be partially discussing that today, though in a slightly different context.</p>



<p>Anyway, I mainly use brave browser for my browsing needs, and for about a year, my accessibility account just wouldn’t set the cookie on brave. I followed all the steps, third party cookies were allowed, etc, but the cookie just would not set. It worked great on firefox, chromium, and everything else I tried. The message just said that if this keeps occurring that I should email support. So finally I did email support.</p>



<p>They walked me through basic troubleshooting steps, most of which I had already tried, and in an attempt to isolate the problem and help out their technical staff, I mentioned that the call to their set cookie endpoint seemed to be returning a 401 unauthorized code in brave, looking at the javascript console. This, I think, made them a little suspicious, even though I was only trying to help them out.</p>



<p>So imagine my surprise, when out of nowhere in the middle of my conversation with a support rep named Gemma, another rep named Mel sends a reply and says</p>



<pre>Hello,
                                                                                                                                
This is not a supported use, and you are not being credited for accessibility passes.
                                                                                                                                
All accounts being used in this way will be deleted from hCaptcha, and the users banned if they attempt to sign up again for
accessibility.
                                                                                                                                
Thanks,
hCaptcha Support
</pre>



<p>I was obviously very confused, as I wasn’t doing anything they didn’t allow, I was just trying to get it working under brave. So I emailed back, and they clarified that since I wasn’t blind, I shouldn’t be using the accessibility account.</p>



<p>Excuse me? I’m not blind? Are you serious?</p>



<p>I have no idea what got that idea through their heads, but I verified that my account had indeed been banned. I emailed back a day or so later, requesting an unban because, y’know, I *actually* am blind, but they gave a pretty canned response of no, your account is remaining banned.</p>



<p>So the end result is that, irony of all ironies, if I want to get past hCaptcha, I have to break their terms of service and use an automated solving program to solve the captcha, all because they decided, randomly, that I wasn’t blind, so can’t use their accessibility account.</p>



<p>Consider this a warning that, if you rely on a workaround to an intensionally inaccessible system to make it useable, you’re just waiting for something to go wrong.</p>



<p>I can’t stress this enough. Don’t trust a company that makes their product intensionally inaccessible to provide an accessibility work around. That’s like a zebra trusting a lion who eats zebras to not eat them out of the kindness of their heart. It’s a ticking timebomb.</p>



<p>Please share this post with your friends, and if you know any webmasters who use hCaptcha, consider forwarding this to them. It’s not ok what they’re doing, and it’s affecting real people. I was going to reach out to Cloudflare to share my experience in an attempt to get them to drop hCaptcha, but apparently they’re using an in house system now anyway. Good riddance, I say.</p>



<p>Anyway, consider this a warning, and maybe I won’t wait 5 years before my next blog post! Lol.</p>



<p>Michael.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

  I've packaged this article up and released a library, <a href="https://maxbo.me/celine">@celine/celine</a>. It has a slightly nicer API too. Check it out! (o˘◡˘o)

<div><p>

Before I start, why am I doing this?
</p><p>

<b>I don't think HTML is being used enough as a platform for scientific publishing.</b></p><p>

Instead, people will:
</p><ol>
  <li>Use an interactive notebook like <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html">RStudio</a>, <a href="https://plutojl.org/">Pluto.jl</a> or <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> to do data exploration, analysis and visualisation,</li>
  <li>Move to a publishing platform like <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>, <a href="https://overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, pure <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor to typeset their work,</li>
  <li>Export to <code>.pdf</code> for distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think a HTML file can be used for all 3 of these stages, and prevent a lot of faffing around with manual processes, CLI tooling, CI steps and 3rd-party platforms.
</p><p>

HTML's typesetting capabilities are well documented, but its capabilities as a platform for data exploration, analysis and visualisation are not.
</p>
<p>
I'll try and demonstrate these capabilities, literate programming style.
</p><p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/document.png" alt="A computer displays an open book">
</p>

</div>



<p>

We also want <code>contenteditable</code> <code>script</code>s to be re-evaluated on blur by building a clone of the <code>script</code> and then removing the original.
<br>



</p>



<div><p>

Now we'll declare a cell called <code>counter</code> that emits a number every second.
<b>The <code>script</code>'s <code>id</code> attribute is the same as the <code>name</code> parameter passed to <code>cell</code></b>.

</p><p>


<i>Try changing the initial counter value <code>i</code> above to a much bigger number, and then defocus the <code>script</code>.</i></p></div>
<p>

Now that we've created a our <code>counter</code> cell, we can create other cells that depend on it.

<br>

We'll import <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/htl">Hypertext Literal</a> and use it to format the
<code>counter</code> value. <code>htl</code> implements a full-blown HTML5 parser that performs automatic escaping and 
interpolation of non-serializable values, such as event listeners, style objects, and other DOM nodes.



</p>


<p>
We can still observe the output of a cell without needing to show its definition. Just don't add the <code>echo</code> class. 
This makes them useful as a rendering primitive.


<i>(There's a hidden cell above ^)</i>

</p>

<p>

Alternatively, we can create a cell type that doesn't display its output at all.
<br>
We can use these cells to store intermediate values or datastructures.




Also note that cells can be declared out of order.





</p>



<p>

We can use cell values in more complex outputs. We'll import <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/what-is-plot">Observable Plot</a> and use the <code>counter</code> value in a plot.



</p>

<p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/up.png" alt="A computer displays a graph in the upward direction">
</p>

<div>

<h2>TeX, Markdown, Graphviz</h2><p>

We can return any type of DOM element from a cell. 
<br>
In this case, the <code>tex</code>, <code>md</code>, and <code>dot</code> cells return <code>span</code>, <code>table</code> and <code>svg</code> elements respectively.
</p><p>

<i>Try editing any of the following cells.</i></p></div>




<!-- <div class="slide">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.13.18/dist/katex.min.css">
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wypst@0.0.8/dist/wypst.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  
<script type="module" class="echo" id="typst" contenteditable="true">
cell("typst", [], async () => {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  await wypst.initialize()
  wypst.render("sum_(k=1)^n k = (n(n+1)) / 2", div);
  return div
});
</script> -->

<p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/data.png" alt="A computer with an open CD tray is surrounded by data">
</p>

<div>

<h2>Cell status</h2><p>

We can also return a <code>Promise</code>, or throw an <code>Error</code>, from a cell.

Observable's <code>Inspector</code> will apply an <code>observablehq--running</code> or
<code>observablehq--error</code> class to the cell's outer <code>div</code> element respectively.
We'll style them appropriately:



</p></div>


<div>
<h2>Python</h2><p>

The <a href="http://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> CPython WASM distribution includes <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="https://scipy.org/">Scipy</a>.
We'll rebuild the plot seen above, but using Matplotlib and Python's <code>sqlite3</code> module instead.

</p><p>

<i>Try editing one of the plot labels!</i></p></div>
<div>
<h2>R</h2><p>

You know the drill. It's R, using <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/">WebR</a>. 
I didn't figure out how to get <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/plotting.html">rendering</a> working, but I assume it's possible.

<i>I must disclose that this cell seems to be a bit flaky on iOS. I have not had a chance to investigate further, nor will I.</i>



</p></div>
<div>

<h2>Inputs</h2><p>

We'll create a new cell type <code>viewof</code> that works specifically with <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/inputs">Observable Inputs</a>.

It declares 2 reactive cells: <code>NAME</code> and <code>viewof NAME</code> - one for the value, and one for the DOM element itself.



</p></div>
<div><p>

To display the input above the cell, we set the cell <code>id</code> to <code>viewof NAME</code>.
</p><p>

<i>Wiggle the range input and see another dependent cell update.</i></p>




<p><i>NB: The way Observable Inputs work is a bit arcane. This demo of <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/synchronized-inputs">Synchronized Inputs</a> may shed some light.</i>

</p></div>
<div>

<h2>Mutability</h2><p>

Purely functional dataflow is great, but sometimes you just need to mutate state.
We'll create a new helper function <code>mutable</code>. It registers a <code>Mutable</code> - an object that yields new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator"><code>Generator</code></a> values when the value is mutated - in the runtime.



</p></div>
<p><i>Try editing the initial state of the <code>mutable</code>.</i>



<i>Try editing the button labels.</i>





</p>


<!-- <h2>3D models</h2>

We can use Google's <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/"><code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code></a> <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction">Web Component</a> to display 3D models.

<script type="module" class="echo" id="model">
import 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/model-viewer/3.5.0/model-viewer.min.js';

cell("model", async () => {
  return htl.html`
    <model-viewer 
      style="width: 100%; height: 400px"
      src="/models/NeilArmstrong.glb"

      touch-action="pan-y">

  `;
});
</script> -->

<!-- <div class="slide"> -->

<!-- <h2>Saving contenteditable changes</h2>

Taking a note out of <a href="https://cristobal.space/">Cristóbal Sciutto</a>'s <a href="https://cristobal.space/note">Self-modifying HTML notes</a>,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<article>
		<div class="page">
			
			
			<p>I have come to believe that by and large “best practices” are doing more harm
than good. Not necessarily because they’re bad advice as such, but because
they’re mostly pounded by either 1) various types of zealots, idiots, and
assholes who abuse these kind of “best practices” as an argument from authority,
or 2) inexperienced programmers who lack the ability to judge the applicability,</p>

<p>Everyone else just says “X is better because Y”. This is an actual argument that
can be engaged with, and engaging with actual arguments is what discovers the
best solution for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>This is not unique to programming; even the best of ideas becomes silly once you
start uncritically applying it to everything – one can find many examples in
politics. There, too, it’s mostly pounded by various types of zealots, idiots,
and assholes.</p>

<hr>

<p>All of this doesn’t mean that “best practice” are bad advice. Many are worth
reading, and some should always be followed. But many are little more “this
thing someone said” and/or “just someone’s opinion”.</p>

<p>Take Postel’s “law” – what if I break this “law”? Will the police come and
arrest me? Will I get the Nobel prize in physics as I’ve discovered new laws of
nature? It’s not a “law” in any meaningful sense: it’s just a thing this Postel
guy said in 1980, which may or may not be applicable to whatever you’re doing.</p>

<p><em>Postel’s quip</em> was probably good advice in 1980 in the context of TCP. There
were tons of little incompatibilities between existing implementations and
Postel was working on the first effort to actually standardize it all. Back then
it was typically harder to write fully correct implementations (no internet with
tons of examples, little to no testing, less access to other implementations,
etc.)</p>

<p>There are other cases where it’s the reasonable and practical thing to do. But
as a general concept applied to all protocols or all software development I find
it’s mostly a bad idea. I’m hardly the first to critique it, and it’s been
controversial for decades.</p>

<p>In spite of that, people citing <em>Postel’s quip</em> as if it’s somehow a “law” are
still plentiful. My law is that everyone who does so is an idiot, asshole, or
some combination of both.</p>

<p>There are many more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Don’t use globals” is obviously good, but “never use globals under any
circumstances” is just silly. I’ve seen people throw a hissy fit over
“globals” in simple CLI tools with a few functions. Whoop-dee-doo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Don’t use unstructured GOTO” has turned into “never use goto”, “don’t use
continue because it’s like a hidden goto”, and “use single point of exit”, and
that kind of absolute insane bollocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) is basically good advice, but sometimes just
copy/pasting things is just the more pragmatic thing to do, and not really a
big deal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think “12 factor app” has some okay ideas, some dubious ideas, and some
outright bad ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the basic ideas of “SOLID” are okay, I generally find that strong
adherence does not lead to particularly good code. It’s typically 80% fucking
about with <em>how</em> to do things, and 20% actually doing the stuff you want to do
(which makes things harder to understand and change, not easier).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>etc. etc. etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can disagree with any of the above, and that’s fine. But citing “laws” or
“best practices” are just a fallacious arguments from authority.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the difficulties with argueing against “best practices” is that it often
goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>“X is not according to best practices”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>“I think X is better because Y”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>“But it’s not following best practice Z! Here is a book about it! Why don’t
you follow it?! Do you want to write bad code?!”</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is kind of a gaslighting effect here, because it’s very natural to assume
that maybe you <em>should</em> be following the “best practice”, especially when
declared with great arrogance.</p>

<p>This is the same fallacious argument people use for safety:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>“I don’t X will improve safety.”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><em>“What?! You don’t care about safety?!”</em></li>
  <li>or: <em>“Better safe than sorry!”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Which is why safety regulation only grows and never shrinks, even when the
regulation just makes no sense eat all: arguing against it is hard, because the
look of things is against you. I call this the <em>Safety Fallacy</em>.</p>

<p>If you hear the term "black company", what kind of company do you imagine? As we all know, black is the darkest color, so if you pictured an evil company with a dark side then you would be on the right track. A black company (aka "black corporation" or "black business") is <i>buraku kigyō</i> <ruby>ブラック<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby><i></i> <ruby>企業<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> in Japanese. In general, it is a term used to refer to an unacceptably exploitative employment system.</p>

<p>Now, maybe you're thinking this is a word to describe a factory somewhere in China, but you'd be wrong. The term is actually usually associated with white-collar industries rather than blue-collar ones. It was coined by young IT workers in the early 2000's and, being the IT workers that they were, spread this nickname around the internet as an internet meme. Now, thanks to its fame, it is a term that can be used for other industries that are not IT.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-company-and-a-film">The Black Company And A Film</h2>

<p>As the popularity of the term grew, the black company problem received more and more attention in Japan. In 2009, a drama film called "A man on the verge at a BLACK company" was released. It was based on an office worker who started a 2ch thread about the black company he worked at. This company's ruthless and unethical work environment was duplicated in the film.</p>

<p><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebxD-KJNFwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="ブラック会社に勤めてるんだが、もう俺は限界かもしれない"></iframe></p>

<p>As you can see in the film clip, the workers are being pushed to their limit and obviously not in good shape. Can you imagine working someplace like that for real? Well, bad (black) companies are really out there and this sparked a move towards calling them out. Still, there was a long way to go to bring about public awareness.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-company-awards">The Black Company Awards</h2>

<figure><img alt="A skyscraper housing a Japanese Black Company" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/black-company-building.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharif/3299531471" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">Beshef</a></figure>

<p>In 2012, a group of people that included journalists, activists, and university professors formed a special committee to create the "Black Corporations Award" where the public could vote on "the most evil corporations of the year." The award name may sound silly, but its creators were not joking. They were hoping to raise awareness of black company issues as well as expose some of the evil abusers of employees. This is now an annual award.</p>

<figure><img alt="Graphic with Japanese text saying Most Evil Corporation Award" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/most-evil-corporation-award.jpg"></figure>

<p>The most recent award, which took place on June 17th of 2013, nominated eight companies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Watami Foodservice Co., Ltd (Restaurant Chain)</li>
  <li>Cross Company Inc. (Clothing Retailer)</li>
  <li>Benesse Corporation (Education and Publishing)</li>
  <li>Sun Challenge Corporation (Steak Restaurant Chain)</li>
  <li>Ohsho Food Service Corporation (Restaurant Chain)</li>
  <li>Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (Transportation Service)</li>
  <li>Tokyu Hands Inc. (Department Store)</li>
  <li>Tohoku University</li>
</ol>

<p>All nominations were made on the following basis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Actual public records on occupational problems such as a long work time, sexual harassment, or abuse of power.</li>
  <li>Long intense work hours.</li>
  <li>Low pay.</li>
  <li>Compliance violations.</li>
  <li>Flaws in the system, such as lack of childcare leave or maternity leave.</li>
  <li>Hostility to unions.</li>
  <li>Discrimination against temporary workers.</li>
  <li>Temporary worker dependance.</li>
  <li>npaid overtime (and lies about paid overtime in the job advertisements).</li>
</ol>

<p>Most black companies already have the above problems, so the nominees were chosen for being especially bad. After the nominations, there was a period in which people could vote. The winner? Watami Foodservice Co., and by a wide margin. They got 21,899 votes, 72% of the total. This was followed by Tohoku University (3,475 votes), Benesse Corporation (1,258 votes), Cross Company Inc (1,220 votes), Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (1,000 votes), Ohsho Food Service Corporation (744 votes), Sun Challenge Corporation (649 votes), and Tokyu Hands Inc (346 votes). Watami has won this award for two years in a row so far.</p>

<figure><img alt="A chart displaying the worst Japanese black companies" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/notorious-black-companies-chart.png"></figure>

<p>Watami's winning streak is due to its notoriously abysmal mistreatment of young workers. In 2008, Mina Mori, a female employee of Watami, committed suicide at the age of 26 after reportedly working 141 hours of overtime in one month. It happened just two months after joining the restaurant chain. Some people may think committing suicide is an individual matter and that a company cannot be held responsible. However, it is reasonable to assume Mori would not have chosen suicide for herself had she not been forced into such a desperate situation. Furthermore, it is apparent just how "black" the Watami company is simply by the cold reaction of Watami founder Miki Watanabe's reaction to the case. He not only refused to meet with her family but also refused to apologize to them until last month. He finally did offer an apology in court on March 27, 2014, though he still has denied liability.</p>

<p>According to an interview with a former Watami restaurant manager conducted by Takarajima magazine (September 2013 edition), upon hearing the news of Ms. Mori's suicide, the ex-manager wondered if it was really <em>just</em> 141 hours. During his time at Watami, he regularly worked from 7am to 12am with almost no break, making his monthly overtime over 300 hours. He also revealed that Miki Watanabe gives extreme messages to workers on every payday, such as: "Regret as hard as you die!" He even received a personal letter from the evil president in his paycheck envelope saying: "you should reflect on your sales this month by killing yourself."</p>

<figure><img alt="The exterior of a Watami Bar during the evening" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/watami-bar-at-night.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/miyo/2473313816" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">Miyo Sekimoto</a></figure>

<p>There was also an illegal but mandatory 1,000 yen deduction from every payment and workers were told that it was for "social contribution." When Watanabe published his own book, the price of the book was automatically deducted from the payment and workers were forced to buy them as well. Although there wasn't any physical violence, he remembered that there was much verbal violence, often relating to "killing himself."</p>

<p>That sounds pretty awful, right? These workers were not treated like human beings… more like robots. Though even robots shouldn't have to work this hard. Obviously a lot of other people felt the same way and anti-Watami movements have risen. On the same day that Watami apologized to Ms. Mori's family, Watami decided to temporarily close 60 restaurants (about 10% of the total) to improve their work environment. I hope this will really be the start of some reform so that others won't have to endure the same mistreatment.</p>

<p>Perhaps thanks to this and the awareness brought about by the Black Company Awards, the term <i>buraku kigyō</i> <ruby>ブラック<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby><i></i> <ruby>企業<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> made the final 10 of the most popular or influential Japanese buzzwords in 2013! So, consider the checkbox of "raising awareness" filled in, though there's still much work to be done.</p>

<h2 id="what-colors-a-company-black">What Colors A Company Black?</h2>

<figure><img alt="Black paint chipping off a wall" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/black-wall.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dg_pics/3938829378" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">David Gunter</a></figure>

<p>So what are the exact qualifications for a company to be considered a black company? You can get some idea from the stories of Watami, but a lawyer named Yoshiyuki Iwasa, who is also the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/o/ASIN/4907292090/itmedia-makoto-22/">ブラック<i></i> <ruby>企業<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>に<i></i> <ruby>倍返<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>しだ!</a> (which means "to take double revenge on the black company") <a href="http://bizmakoto.jp/makoto/articles/1401/23/news018_2.html">created a checklist for a website called Business Media</a> to find out whether the company is "black" or "not black." There are thirty items on the list and if none of them apply to the company, it is pure white. If 1-9 items are applicable, it is considered gray. 10-14 is dark gray. 30 out of 30 is pitch black. You get the picture. Now let's take a look at the list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I do work overtime, but overtime is never paid.</li>
  <li>It's usual to work more than 80 hours overtime a month.</li>
  <li>I don't have a break, or at the most, 10 minutes a day.</li>
  <li>I work on my days off. Actually, I'm not even sure when my days off are.</li>
  <li>There is no paid time off system or if there is such a system, I am never allowed to use it.</li>
  <li>I never get reimbursed for expenses and always have to pay out of pocket.</li>
  <li>There is no social insurance, benefits, or pension. If I ask about this, I would be bullied.</li>
  <li>If I converted my monthly wage into an hourly rate equivalent, it would be less than minimum wage.</li>
  <li>Regardless of how long I work overtime, the overtime payment is a fixed amount.</li>
  <li>The company is constantly hiring new employees.</li>
  <li>The advertised job wage is different from the actual amount paid.</li>
  <li>There are no time cards or someone else punches you in and out.</li>
  <li>There are one or more workers who can't come to the office due to psychotic depression or nervous breakdown.</li>
  <li>I'm so busy that I often can't get adequate sleep.</li>
  <li>There is no union or company regulations.</li>
  <li>Some employees are promoted to an administrative position right after joining the company, but there is no extra remuneration for that.</li>
  <li>Employees have to run private errands for their employers.</li>
  <li>There is a slogan saying "work until you die" on the company wall.</li>
  <li>Abuse of power and sexual harassment are very common.</li>
  <li>There are so many affiliate companies and subsidiaries, though I don't even know what those companies do.</li>
  <li>Whenever some incident happens, the company changes its name.</li>
  <li>There are training sessions, which use what can be considered brainwashing or hazing.</li>
  <li>Threats such as "I'm going to kill you" can be commonly heard at the office.</li>
  <li>Violence is rampant.</li>
  <li>All the supervisors are relatives of the CEO.</li>
  <li>I was told to quit the company in a roundabout way like, "you may not be cut out for this position."</li>
  <li>I can't quit the job. If I say I'm going to quit, I'll be threatened that I will have to pay damages for quitting.</li>
  <li>They don't provide the necessary documents such as the separation slip to those who try to quit.</li>
  <li>The worker's average age is really young.</li>
  <li>The rate of people leaving their jobs within 3 years is really high.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now after looking through them, do any of these conditions apply to your company? Many of the items may sound ridiculous, but I have worked under some of these conditions before and I have some friends who work for such companies. However, I'm not sure if their companies are pitch black. Maybe just very, very dark?</p>

<figure><img alt="Black paint trailing down a white wall" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/dripping-black-paint.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandbacon/4600142725" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">rockandbacon</a></figure>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/2r985200000339uj.html">Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>, the number of cases delivered to the General Labor Consultation Center in 2012 was 1,067,210. 254,719 of them involved troubles at work such as encouragement of early retirement, worsening work conditions, the lowering of pay, long periods of overtime without payment, or mean, abusive bosses and/or coworkers. A decade ago, only around 100,000 cases were reported. This number has increased about 2.5x, showing that either black companies are increasing in number, or, what is more likely, more people are coming forward. These companies are finally having their true colors exposed (black).</p>

<p>In September, 2013, the Labor Ministry began a crackdown on black companies, too. They examined 5,111 such companies based on their high turnover rates of young workers, their past violations, and complaints from employees. Then it was revealed that over 80% of them, 4,189 companies, were indeed actually black companies engaged in illegal business practices. They were flagged for violations against the Labor Standards Act. The ministry intends to discipline the companies in question and if those companies continue to violate the Labor Standards laws, their names will be made public.</p>

<p>So, now that the Labor Ministry is getting involved, can we call this the end of the story? Well, I'm afraid it's not over yet. This was only the ministry's first survey on black companies and there are over 4 million companies in Japan. So, the exciting fight has only just begun! We're counting on you, Black Company Awards and Japan's Labor Ministry!</p>

<p><a href="https://career-research.mynavi.jp/reserch/20241003_86953/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>A new survey from Mynavi Corp.</em></a><em> shows a significant rise in resignation agencies across Japan that help people quit their jobs. But why?</em></p>



<p>With deep remorse, Mr. Iida sank to the floor. His knees touched the cold concrete, and he bowed so profoundly that his head almost met the ground. “Dogeza,” the most sincere way to apologize for a serious offense, performed by a salaryman in his boss’s office. The reason? Mr. Iida submitted his resignation. But, after a brief silence, there was a tearing sound, and he realized his boss had ripped his resignation letter to shreds. The message was clear: <em>you are not allowed to quit.</em></p>



<p>In Japan, leaving a job can be challenging. Traditionally, employment is considered a lifelong commitment. Though Japan is moving away from this outdated mentality, many traditional companies still expect employees to work until retirement without changing jobs.</p>



<p>For some older generations, there is still a deep sense of shame in switching jobs, as work ethic in Japan is closely tied to loyalty and respect. Japanese law technically guarantees the right to quit, but doing so is often seen as disrespectful, as companies invest time and money in training employees. It is a mutual investment — the company invests in you, and you, in turn, commit to advancing within the organization over time.</p>



<h2>“I Can’t Take This Anymore”</h2>



<p>Mr. Iida performed the dogeza three times before his boss, apologizing for “letting him down,” yet his resignation still wasn’t accepted. He had to find another way out.</p>



<p>He contacted the resignation agency Momuri, whose name translates to “I Can’t Take This Anymore.” For around ¥22,000, they handle the entire resignation process, contacting the boss on behalf of the client, negotiating with the company, and even recommending lawyers if legal disputes arise.</p>



<p>According to Yujin Watanabe, a spokesperson from Albatross Corp., which manages Momuri’s services, their typical client profile is young people in their 20s who work for small to medium-sized companies, often in corporate or welfare industries.</p>



<p>Mr. Iida is far from alone in seeking outside help to resign. Since 2022, Momuri, just one independent resignation agency, has received 35,000 requests from people needing assistance quitting their jobs.</p>



<h2>1 in 5 in Their 20s Use Resignation Agencies</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="611" src="https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-1000x611.png" alt="" srcset="https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-1000x611.png 1000w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-654x400.png 654w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-250x153.png 250w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-768x470.png 768w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan.png 1220w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>Mynavi Corporation: use of resignation services in the past year by age group and occupation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new survey by the employment information provider Mynavi Corp. found that nearly 1 in 5 people in their 20s who quit their jobs in Japan last year used agencies like Momuri to help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey, which included employees ages 20-50 who quit jobs between June 2023 and June 2024, shows that 18.6% of those in their 20s used these services, 17.6% were in their 30s and 17.3% were in their 40s. Only 4.4% were in their 50s, indicating that older employees tend to stay in jobs longer—even if conditions are poor—as the younger generation is more likely to adjust to their needs and wishes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top-cited reason for using resignation agencies, at 40.7%, was that companies refused to let them quit. Other reasons included fear of backlash if they resigned alone or their work environment discouraged employees from quitting independently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mynavi Corp. also surveyed workplaces and asked managers how often employees under their supervision had used resignation agencies. Between January and June 2024, 23.2% reported that they had employees who used resignation agencies. The most common fields were insurance, finance and IT.</p>



<h2><strong>Resignation Agencies Reflect Japan’s Mental Health Crisis</strong></h2>



<p>According to Momuri, most Japanese people in corporate roles have a low awareness of mental health. Social norms often discourage <a href="https://metropolisjapan.com/japanese-books-mental-health-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking help for mental challenges</a>—many of which stem from their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This lack of support is one reason more Japanese people now turn to resignation agencies. They quit to avoid damaging their mental health and use resignation agencies to sidestep the stress of handling the process themselves.</p>



<p>Mr. Iida’s experience of his boss tearing up his resignation letter is not unique. In fact, it’s far from the most extreme case. Momuri confirms stories of companies forcing employees to visit temples to ‘cure’ their desire to quit. Sometimes they even receive home visits from managers pressuring them to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those fortunate enough to leave are sometimes asked to send apology letters to colleagues or deliver speeches expressing regret for their “selfishness” and “disrespect.” Of course, these are the most extreme cases–but they do occur, according to Momuri.</p>



<p>Some companies are notorious for resignation difficulties, excessive overtime and intense work pressure. So much so that they are labeled as “black companies.” The problem has become so severe that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s Labor Standards Bureau has published a list of these companies to warn potential job seekers.</p>

<h2><strong>Generational Change Could Be Japan’s Savior</strong></h2>



<p>A generational shift is underway in Japan, one that may eventually ease work-related pressures and their sometimes fatal consequences. Physical strain and mental stress contribute to both <em>karojisatsu</em>, or ‘overwork suicide,’ and <em>karoshi</em>, or ‘death by overwork’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.niph.go.jp/journal/data/73-1/202473010003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare</a>, the number of Japanese people who committed suicide due to their work rose from 1,935 cases in 2021 to 2,968 in 2022. This marked a record high. While the figure has since slightly decreased, the strain on workers remains severe.</p>



<p>Since they first appeared in 2018, resignation agencies have become an essential ally in Japan’s work culture shift. These agencies empower young workers to prioritize their mental well-being and advocate for change, providing a way out for those trapped in restrictive work environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This growing reliance on resignation services underscores a generational pushback against outdated norms and signals a potential transformation in Japan’s work culture. If these shifts continue, Japan’s younger generation may indeed pave the way toward a more balanced and sustainable future for the country’s workforce. Let’s hope they succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In perhaps the largest swatting case to ever be prosecuted, an 18-year-old from Lancaster, California, has pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from a nationwide spree of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">hundreds of shooting and bomb threat hoaxes</a> that sent police scrambling to high schools, courthouses, and the homes of law enforcement officials and prominent politicians.</p><p>Alan Winston Filion now faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each of four counts of making interstate threats to injure the person of another, according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/california-teenager-pleads-guilty-florida-making-hundreds-swatting-calls-across-united">United States Department of Justice</a>.</p><p>Early this year, Filion was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">arrested and extradited</a> to Seminole County, Florida. At the time, state prosecutors charged Filion with four state-level felony counts stemming from a single incident in which, prosecutors allege, Filion told a Sanford Police Department dispatcher that he was armed with pipe bombs and an AR-15 rifle and was walking into Masjid Al Hayy Mosque to kill everyone he saw.</p><p>Filion, whom authorities believe operated online as “Torswats,” has been in jail without a trial for nearly a year. He entered a plea of not guilty to the state charges.</p><p>The federal charges announced on Wednesday, along with interviews from people connected to the investigation—and Filion himself—allege his swatting activities reached far beyond Florida’s borders.</p><p>Between approximately August 2022 to January 2024 Filion made more than 375 swatting calls, according to the plea agreement. These included incidents where he claimed to have planted bombs or threatened to conduct mass shootings at targeted locations that included religious institutions, high schools, and historically black colleges and universities.</p><p>“This prosecution and today’s guilty plea reaffirm the Justice Department’s commitment to using all tools to hold accountable every individual who endangers our communities through swatting and hoax threats,” deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “For well over a year, Alan Filion targeted religious institutions, schools, government officials, and other innocent victims with hundreds of false threats of imminent mass shootings, bombings, and other violent crimes. He caused profound fear and chaos and will now face the consequences of his actions.”</p><p>According to court records, Filion was also part of a high-profile international swatting group that targeted several prominent figures between December 2023 and January 2024. Among the victims were US Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly, Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Republican senator Rick Scott of Florida. Investigators say they linked the scheme to roughly 100 calls, one of which targeted an unnamed former president of the United States.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In August, the Department of Justice <a data-offer-url="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/2-men-charged-with-swatting-members-of-congress-00176675" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/2-men-charged-with-swatting-members-of-congress-00176675&quot;}" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/2-men-charged-with-swatting-members-of-congress-00176675" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">charged two European men,</a> Tomasz Szabo and Nemanja Radovanovic, in connection with the widespread swatting operation, which led to at least one car accident with injuries. During interviews with the US Secret Service in January and February, both men admitted their roles in the scheme. Radovanovic, however, claimed that he was directed by a third party who provided detailed scripts and selected the targets.</p><p>According to the plea agreement, Filion admitted to orchestrating the operation, supplying the names, addresses, and phone numbers of many of the targeted individuals.</p><p>“I shot my wife in the head with my AR-15,” a man identifying himself as "James" said in one such call. He told dispatchers in Georgia that he caught his wife sleeping with another man and, after killing her, had taken the man hostage. “I’ll release him for $10,000 in cash,” he added, threatening to detonate pipe bombs and blow up the house if his demands weren’t met. This call targeted the home of Georgia state senator John Albers.</p><p>The case against Filion, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">first reported by WIRED</a>, was built on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">trail of digital evidence</a> left across platforms like Telegram, YouTube, and Discord, and pieced together by Brad “Cafrozed” Dennis, a private investigator. Dennis had been hired by two high-profile Twitch stars, both victims of Torswats’ calls, to find the person responsible.</p><p>For months, Dennis had posed online as a vengeful ex-husband looking to troll and harass his former wife. He used this persona to infiltrate <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/764-com-child-predator-network/">private Discord servers and Telegram groups</a> where Torswats and affiliates hung out. These were chats dedicated to extortion plots and racist memes; channels filled with child sexual abuse material, self-harm, and animal abuse—some of the worst content he'd ever seen, Dennis told WIRED.</p><p>On New Year's Eve 2022, Dennis sent Torswats a private message on Telegram: “You wanna make some real cash? Add me on Tox,” he wrote, referring to the peer-to-peer messaging service, under the pretense of arranging a swatting.</p><p>Using network monitoring tools, Dennis then captured the IP address linked to the Torswats account and uncovered a new username: "Paimon Arnum." In January 2023, Dennis handed this critical piece of evidence, along with other usernames and active Discord servers he had tracked over several months, over to the FBI.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>According to emails reviewed by WIRED, that information was central to how the FBI broke the case and was the basis of subpoenas sent to Discord and Google in April of 2023 seeking information on accounts Dennis had identified. By early May, the FBI had successfully pinpointed Torswats’ identity and location.</p><p>That month, Torswats privately took responsibility for swatting incidents in Telegram chats reviewed by WIRED. These incidents affected up to 25 schools in Washington state, impacting approximately 18,116 students and costing taxpayers an estimated $271,173 in lost instructional time, according to Don Beeler, CEO of <a data-offer-url="https://tdrtechnologysolutions.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://tdrtechnologysolutions.com/&quot;}" href="https://tdrtechnologysolutions.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TDR Technology Solutions</a>, a company specializing in school surveillance and threat analysis.</p><p>Additionally, 911 audio and other police records obtained by WIRED corroborate that the same individual made the calls for more than a dozen of these swatting incidents. In some instances, the caller told dispatchers he had been commanded by Satan to kill students. In others, he said he had been mistreated because he was gay. In others, he seemed to have become bored enough with the game that he didn’t bother to make up a reason.</p><p>On July 12, the Torswats handle announced a new swatting operation dubbed the “Grand Offensive,” targeting a dozen senators. Three days later, the FBI raided Filion’s home and seized his electronic devices.</p><p>But the raid didn’t stop the swatting.</p><p>On November 6, 2023, someone using the Torswats handle took responsibility for a bomb threat aimed at North Beach High School in Ocean Shores, Washington, through a Telegram message. According to police reports and call records obtained by WIRED, the caller impersonated a drug dealer who wanted to report his client to the police because he had said he had placed pipe bombs around the school and was planning a mass shooting. That same month, a person going by Torswats also admitted to swatting an <a data-offer-url="https://ubivisproject.org/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ubivisproject.org/&quot;}" href="https://ubivisproject.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">investigator and cybercrime expert</a> named Keven Hendricks in private Telegram communications.</p><p>Both threats could be attributed to the same individual, according to a law enforcement official who reviewed the recordings for WIRED but requested anonymity because they were unauthorized to speak to the press.</p><p>Details about Filion’s life outside his online activities remain sparse. Enrollment records from Lancaster’s Antelope Valley Community College show that Filion began pursuing a degree in mathematics in the fall of 2022. A former classmate, who requested anonymity due to fears of retaliation, described Filion as quiet and “forgettable.”</p><p>“He didn’t appear to have many friends,” they said.</p><p>In January 2024, an individual affiliated with the Torswats Telegram account and claiming to be a friend of Filion suggested that he was part of a group aiming to incite racial violence and that he sought money to “buy weapons and commit a mass shooting.” The allegation aligns with a written tip, placed to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center in April 2023 and obtained by WIRED, alleging that the person behind the Torswats account was involved in a neo-Nazi cult known as the Order of Nine Angles.</p><p>“He believes he is doing his part to bring about the end of days by ‘bleeding the finances and man hours of the system,’” the tipster wrote.</p><p>Filion’s family could not be immediately reached for comment. A sentencing date for the teenager has not yet been set.</p><p><em>Updated at 10:45 am EST, November, 2024: Added additional details about Filion’s involvement in swatting attacks against prominent US government officials and others.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Presented at the Web Engines Hackfest, 2024. Focus on the details of why a
data-oriented engine design is interesting, what sort of benefits it gives and
what sort of costs it has. Explores the engine at a slightly deeper level.</p>
<p dir="auto">The talk was revisited at the TC39 June meeting, 2024. No video is available,
but the slightly modified slides are.</p>
<p dir="auto">TC39 slides:

<p dir="auto">The architecture of the engine follows the ECMAScript specification in spirit,
but uses data-oriented design for the actual implementation. Records that are
present in the specification are likely present in the Nova engine as well and
they're likely found in an "equivalent" file / folder path as the specification
defines them in.</p>
<p dir="auto">Where the engine differs from the specification is that most ECMAScript types
and specification Record types are defined "twice": They have one "heap data"
definition, and another "index" definition. The heap data definition generally
corresponds to the specification's definition, in some degree at least. The
index definition is either a wrapper around <code>u32</code> or a <code>NonZeroU32</code>. Most spec
defined methods are defined on the index definitions (this avoids issues with
borrowing).</p>
<p dir="auto">The only case when direct "Record type A contains Record type B" ownership is
used is when there can be only one referrer to the Record type B.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Heap structure - Data-oriented design</h3><a id="user-content-heap-structure---data-oriented-design" aria-label="Permalink: Heap structure - Data-oriented design" href="#heap-structure---data-oriented-design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Reading the above, you might be wondering why the double-definitions and all
that. The ultimate reason is two-fold:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>It is an interesting design.</li>
<li>It helps the computer make frequently used things fast while allowing the
infrequently used things to become slow.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Data-oriented design is all the rage on the Internet because of its
cache-friendliness. This engine is one more attempt at seeing what sort of
real-world benefits one might gain with this sort of architecture.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you find yourself interested in where the idea spawns from and why, take a
look at <a href="https://github.com/trynova/nova/blob/main/nova_vm/src/heap/README.md">the Heap README.md</a>. It gives a more
thorough walkthrough of the Heap structure and what the idea there is.</p>
