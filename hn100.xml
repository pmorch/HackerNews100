Since then, I’ve been thinking about why so many of the people in this space are obsessed with blood transfusions specifically. It seemed like a strange fixation — until I looked at the evidence properly.</p>
<p>I think they’re vampires. Not metaphorically. I think the modern longevity movement is a vampire disclosure program.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="the-science">The Science</h2>
<p>In 1864, a French physiologist named Paul Bert surgically connected two mice so they shared a circulatory system.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> When he connected an old mouse to a young one, the old mouse got younger. The technique is called parabiosis, from the Greek <em>para</em> (next to) and <em>bios</em> (life), which is also how vampires have historically described feeding.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, researchers at Cornell had extended this work and found that old rats connected to young rats lived four to five months longer than controls.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> The scientific community filed this under “interesting but impractical” and moved on.</p>
<p>Then in 2005, Stanford researchers revived the technique and showed that within five weeks, old mice connected to young mice had muscle and liver tissue that resembled young tissue.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> This made international headlines. The framing was: “Scientists discover young blood reverses aging.”</p>
<p>The vampires, presumably, were not surprised.</p>
<h2 id="the-suspects">The Suspects</h2>
<h3 id="peter-thiel">Peter Thiel</h3>
<p>Consider the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pale. Gaunt. Appears to not age but also to never have been young.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Told <em>Inc.</em> magazine that he finds parabiosis “really interesting” and that his interest is personal rather than commercial.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> His company’s chief medical officer subsequently contacted Ambrosia, a startup that charged $8,000 to inject you with young people’s blood plasma.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> The company was called <em>Ambrosia</em> — the food of the gods. Subtle.</li>
<li>Has taken human growth hormones and investigated extreme calorie restriction.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup> Gawker reported he was spending $40,000 per quarter on blood infusions from an 18-year-old, though this was never confirmed.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup></li>
<li>Co-founded Palantir, a company whose name comes from the all-seeing stones in Lord of the Rings.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-9" id="user-content-fnref-9" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup> Palantír literally means “far-seeing.” You know what else is far-seeing? A creature that has been alive for centuries.</li>
<li>Destroyed Gawker, the media outlet that reported on his blood habits. He secretly funded a $10 million lawsuit that resulted in a $140 million judgement, bankrupting the company.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup> When a journalist gets too close to revealing a vampire, the vampire destroys the journalist’s entire organization. This is standard vampire operational security. It has been standard since at least the 1600s.</li>
<li>Bought a 477-acre estate on the shores of Lake Wanaka in New Zealand’s South Island.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-11" id="user-content-fnref-11" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">11</a></sup> Remote. Southern hemisphere. Minimal sunlight scrutiny. He has called New Zealand his “utopia.”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-12" id="user-content-fnref-12" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">12</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Thiel told <em>Business Insider</em> in 2012 that death is “a problem that can be solved.”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-13" id="user-content-fnref-13" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">13</a></sup> This is not the language of a man who fears death. This is the language of a man who solved it in the 1400s and is tired of pretending.</p>
<h3 id="bryan-johnson">Bryan Johnson</h3>
<p>Johnson is more complicated, because he appears to be conducting his vampirism in public. This is either a strategic error or an unprecedented act of courage.</p>
<ul>
<li>He transfused his 17-year-old son’s blood plasma into his own body. His son, Talmage, also received Johnson’s plasma in return. Johnson framed this as “multi-generational plasma exchange.”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-14" id="user-content-fnref-14" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">14</a></sup> Vampires have historically called this “turning.”</li>
<li>He discontinued the blood exchange after data showed “no benefits.”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-15" id="user-content-fnref-15" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">15</a></sup> A suspicious person might note that a vampire would say exactly this after the media got too interested.</li>
<li>His skin has the grey, translucent quality of someone who has optimised past the point of appearing human. He is 48 but looks like a very well-preserved 300.</li>
<li>He publicly tracks his erections, sleep, body fat, and organ age with the zeal of someone documenting a body he has not yet fully figured out how to operate.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-16" id="user-content-fnref-16" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">16</a></sup></li>
<li>His company is called Blueprint. As in: he is sharing the blueprint.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-historical-record">The Historical Record</h2>
<p>The longevity community presents parabiosis research as a modern scientific breakthrough. This is wrong. Blood-based life extension has been documented for millennia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roman spectators rushed into arenas to drink the blood of fallen gladiators, believing it transferred vitality.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-17" id="user-content-fnref-17" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">17</a></sup> The scientific community calls this “anecdotal.” Vampires call it “dining out.”</li>
<li>In 1489, the Italian philosopher and Catholic priest Marsilio Ficino published <em>De Vita Libri Tres</em>, in which he explicitly recommended that the elderly suck the blood of a youth from a vein in the left arm. His exact words: “Why shouldn’t our old people, namely those who have no other recourse, likewise suck the blood of a youth?”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-18" id="user-content-fnref-18" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">18</a></sup> He published this. Openly. In a book. As a priest.</li>
<li>Elizabeth Báthory, a 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman, allegedly tortured and murdered hundreds of young women. Legends that she bathed in their blood to retain her youth first appeared in print over a century after her death and are likely embellished, but she was nonetheless confined — possibly walled up — in a room in her own castle until she died.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-19" id="user-content-fnref-19" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">19</a></sup> Which is exactly what you’d expect humans to do to a vampire they couldn’t kill.</li>
<li>Bram Stoker published <em>Dracula</em> in 1897. The novel features a centuries-old aristocrat who sustains himself on young blood, sleeps in unusual conditions, has extraordinary physical abilities for his apparent age, and is eventually destroyed by a group of people who figure out what he is. Stoker, a theatre manager with no medical background, somehow described the basic mechanism of heterochronic parabiosis almost perfectly — ninety years before Stanford “discovered” it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard explanation is that Stoker drew on Eastern European folklore. The alternative explanation is that Stoker drew on Eastern European vampires.</p>
<h2 id="the-twist">The Twist</h2>
<p>Here’s what’s genuinely interesting. Recent research from UC Berkeley suggests that the benefit of young blood might not come from something <em>in</em> the young blood. It might come from <em>diluting</em> the old blood.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-20" id="user-content-fnref-20" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">20</a></sup> The young blood doesn’t add youth. It removes age.</p>
<p>If true, this reframes the entire vampire mythology. Vampires don’t drink blood because young blood contains an elixir. They drink blood because their own blood accumulates factors that accelerate aging, and they need to periodically dilute it. Feeding isn’t nutrition. It’s dialysis.</p>
<p>This also explains why vampires need to feed <em>regularly</em>. The effect is temporary. The old blood factors rebuild. This is consistent with the Stanford mouse data, where the rejuvenating effects diminished after the mice were separated.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-21" id="user-content-fnref-21" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">21</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-disclosure-timeline">The Disclosure Timeline</h2>
<p>I believe we are watching a carefully managed disclosure:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 (1864–2000):</strong> Scientific groundwork. Establish parabiosis as a legitimate research technique. Build the academic cover story.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-22" id="user-content-fnref-22" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">22</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Phase 2 (2005–2015):</strong> “Breakthrough” papers from Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley. Seed the idea that blood-based rejuvenation is <em>scientifically plausible</em> rather than supernatural.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-23" id="user-content-fnref-23" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">23</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Phase 3 (2016–2023):</strong> Early adopters go public. Thiel funds blood startups. Johnson transfuses his son on camera. The public begins to associate blood transfusion with eccentric billionaires rather than with undead predators. This is a critical narrative shift.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 4 (2024–present):</strong> Normalisation. Podcasts. Netflix documentaries.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-24" id="user-content-fnref-24" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">24</a></sup> The word “parabiosis” enters mainstream vocabulary. By the time full disclosure happens, the public will have been primed to see vampirism as a “wellness protocol” rather than a curse.</p>
<h2 id="what-dracula-got-wrong">What Dracula Got Wrong</h2>
<p>The one thing the longevity-vampire community has not yet learned from Dracula is operational security.</p>
<p>Dracula operated in silence for centuries. He didn’t have a podcast. He didn’t track his erection quality on a public dashboard. He didn’t appear on Netflix. He understood that the fundamental rule of being a vampire is: <em>don’t talk about being a vampire.</em></p>
<p>Johnson, Thiel, and their cohort have broken this rule comprehensively. Whether this represents a new era of transparency or a catastrophic strategic miscalculation remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will be monitoring their blood work with interest.</p>

<p>Ficino, M. <em>De Vita Libri Tres</em> (<em>Three Books on Life</em>), Book II: <em>De Vita Longa</em>, 1489. The full passage is remarkable: “There is a common and ancient opinion that certain prophetic women who are popularly called ‘screech-owls’ suck the blood of infants as a means, insofar as they can, of growing young again. Why shouldn’t our old people, namely those who have no other recourse, likewise suck the blood of a youth? — a youth, I say, who is willing, healthy, happy and temperate, whose blood is of the best but perhaps too abundant. They will suck, therefore, like leeches, an ounce or two from a scarcely-opened vein of the left arm.” He then adds that if they have difficulty digesting raw blood, they should cook it with sugar first. Ficino was a Catholic priest and the first translator of Plato’s complete works into Latin. See: Beiweis, S. &amp; Ockenström, L. “Aged Scholars, Screech-Owls, ‘Sagae’, and (the Power of) Human Blood in Ficino’s <em>De Vita Longa</em>.” <em>Rinascimento</em> LXIII, 205–240, 2023. <a href="#user-content-fnref-18" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 18">↩</a></p>

<p>The blood-bathing legend first appeared in print in 1729 in László Turóczi’s <em>Tragica Historia</em>, over a century after Báthory’s death. Contemporary witness accounts — despite being otherwise graphic — contain no mention of blood baths. Modern scholars increasingly believe the accusations were politically motivated, designed to allow relatives and the Hungarian crown to seize her considerable wealth and cancel debts owed to her. She was confined to a room in Castle Čachtice with only slits for air and food, where she died in 1614.

                                        <p>EL PASO, Texas (AP) — The Federal Aviation Administration is closing the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas for 10 days, grounding all flights to and from the airport.</p><p>A notice posted on the FAA’s website said the temporary flight restrictions were for “special security reasons,” but did not provide additional details. The closure does not include Mexican airspace.</p><p>The airport said in an Instagram post that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded from late Tuesday through late on Feb. 20, including commercial, cargo and general aviation flights. It suggested travelers contact their airlines to get up-to-date flight information.</p><p>The shutdown is likely to create significant disruptions given the duration and the size of the metropolitan area. El Paso, a border city with a population of nearly 700,000 and larger when you include the surrounding metro area, is hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.</p><p>The airport describes itself as the gateway to west Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico. Southwest, United, American and Delta all operate flights there, among others. </p>

<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2026-02-11</p>
<p>You don’t need to apologize for taking hours, days, or years to reply to one of my emails.</p>
<p>If we are not close collaborators, and if I didn’t explicitly tell you I was waiting for your answer within a specific timeframe, then please stop apologizing for replying late!</p>
<p>This is a trend I’m witnessing, probably caused by the addiction to instant messaging. Most of the emails I receive these days contain some sort of apology. I received an apology from someone who took five hours to reply to what was a cold and unimportant email. I received apologies in what was a reply to a reply I had sent only a couple of days earlier.</p>
<p>Apologizing for taking time to reply to my email is awkward and makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It also puts a lot of pressure on me: what if I take more time than you to reply? Isn’t the whole point of asynchronous communication to be… asynchronous? Each on its own rhythm?</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-1">I was not waiting for your email in the first place.</h2>
<p>As soon as my email was sent, I probably forgot about it. I may have thought a lot before writing it. I may have drafted it multiple times. Or not. But as soon as it was in my outbox, it was also out of my mind. </p>
<p>That’s the very point of asynchronous communication. That’s why I use email. I’m not making any assumptions about your availability.</p>
<p>Most of the emails I send are replies to emails I received. So, no, I was not waiting for a reply to my reply.</p>
<p>My email might also be an idea I wanted to share with you, a suggestion, a random thought, a way to connect. In all cases, I’m not sitting there, waiting impatiently for your answer. </p>
<p>Even if my email was about requesting some help or collaborating with you, I’ve been trying to move forward anyway. Your reply, whenever it comes, will only be a bonus. But, except if we are in close collaboration and I explicitly said so in the email, I’m not waiting for you!</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">I don’t want to know all the details of your life.</h2>
<p>Yes, you took several days to reply to my email. That’s OK. I don’t need to know that it’s because your mother was dying of cancer or that you were expelled from your house. I’m not making those up! I really receive that kind of apology from people who took several days to reply to emails that look trivial in comparison.</p>
<p>Life happens. If you have things more important to do than replying to my email, then, for god’s sake, don’t reply to it. I get it! I’m human too. If I sometimes reply to all the emails I receive for several days, I may also archive them quickly for weeks because I don’t have the mental space.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-3">If you want to reply but don’t have time, put the burden on me</h2>
<p>If I’m asking you something and you really would like to take the time to reply to my email, it is OK to simply send one line like</p>
<blockquote> Hey Ploum, I don’t have the time and mental space right now. Could you contact me again in 6 months to discuss this idea?<br></blockquote>
<p>Then archive or delete my email. That’s fine. If I really want your input, I will manage to remind you in 6 months. You don’t need to justify. You don’t need to explain. Being short saves time for both of us.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-4">You don’t need to reply at all!</h2>
<p>Except if explicitly stated, don’t feel any pressure to reply to one of my emails. Feel free to read and discard the email. Feel free to think about it. Feel free to reply to it, even years later, if it makes sense for you. But, most importantly, feel free not to care!</p>
<p>We all receive too many messages in a day. We all have to make choices. We cannot follow all the paths that look interesting because we are all constrained by having, at most, a couple billion seconds left to live.</p>
<p>Consider whether replying adds any value to the discussion. Is a trivial answer really needed? Is there really something to add? Can’t we both save time by you not replying? </p>
<p>If my email is already a reply to yours, is there something you really want to add? At some point, it is better to stop the conversation. And, as I said, it is not rude: I’m not waiting for your reply!</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-5">Don’t tell me you will reply later!</h2>
<p>Some people specialize in answering email by explaining why they have no time and that they will reply later.</p>
<p>If I’m not explicitly waiting for you, then that’s the very definition of a useless email. That also adds a lot of cognitive load on you: you promised to answer! The fact that you wrote it makes your brain believe that replying to my email is a daunting task. How will you settle for a quick reply after that? What am I supposed to do with such a non-reply email?</p>
<p>In case an acknowledgement is needed, a simple reply with "thanks" or "received" is enough to inform me that you’ve got the message. Or "ack" if you are a geek.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-6">If you do reply, remind me of the context</h2>
<p>If you choose to reply, consider that I have switched to completely different tasks and may have forgotten the context of my own message. When online, my attention span is measured in seconds, so it doesn’t matter if you take 30 minutes or 30 days to answer my email: I guarantee you that I forgot about it.</p>
<p>Consequently, please keep the original text of the whole discussion!</p>
<p>Use bottom-posting style to reply to each question or remark in the body of the original mail itself. Don’t hesitate to cut out parts of the original email that are not needed anymore. Feel free to ignore large parts of the email. It is fine to give a one-line answer to a very long question.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make my emails structured. If there are questions I want you to answer, each question will be on its own line and will end with a question mark. If you do not see such lines, then there’s probably no question to answer.</p>
<p>If you do top posting, please remind me briefly of the context we are in.</p>
<blockquote> Dear Ploum,<p>  I contacted you 6 months ago about my "fooing the bar" project after we met at FOSDEM. You replied to my email with a suggestion of "baring the foo." You also asked a lot of questions. I will answer those below in your own email:</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, that’s basic mailing-list etiquette.<br>
</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="soustitre-7">No, seriously, I don’t expect you to reply!</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing to remember, it’s that I don’t expect you to reply. I’m not waiting for it. I have a life, a family, and plenty of projects. The chance I’m thinking about the email I sent you is close to zero. No, it is literally zero.</p>
<p>So don’t feel pressured to reply. Should you really reply in the first place? In case of doubt, drop the email. Life will continue.</p>
<p>If you do reply, I will be honored, whatever time it took for you to send it.</p>
<p>In any case, whatever you choose, do not apologize for replying late!</p>

public key</a></p></li></ul><p>The problem isn’t new. In 2017, M. Weissbacher et al. research on malicious browser extensions. In 2018, R. Heaton showed that the popular “Stylish” theme manager was silently sending browsing URLs to a remote server. Those past reports cought our eye and motivated us to dig into this issue.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025: Chome Store now hosts roughly 240 k extensions, many of them with hundreds of thousands of users. We knew that we needed a scalable, repeatable method to measure whether an extension was actually leaking data in the wild.</p><p>It was shown in the past that chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa. We try to prove in this report that Similarweb is very much still active and collects data.</p><p>Why does it matter? There is a moral aspect to the whole issue. Imagine that you build your business model on data exfiltration via innocent looking extensions and using that data to sell them to big corporates. Well, that’s how Similarweb is getting part of the data. That should remind us that whatever software you are using for free and it is not open sourced, you should assume you are the product. The second aspect is that it puts the users into danger and potentially this could be used for corporate exfiltration.

It encrypts your data using that AES key. It takes that one-time AES key and encrypts it using a Public RSA Key hardcoded in the script. It bundles the encrypted key and the encrypted data together and sends them to the server. To decrypt the data, we need the AES key. To get the AES key, we need to decrypt the key blockand that is only possible with the RSA Private Key. With altering the code it would be possible to pause service worker and capture this AES generated key. We will leave this as fun exercise to the reader.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>There's a default assumption baked into how Silicon Valley builds products, and it tracks against how urban planners redesign neighbourhoods: that communities are interchangeable, and if you "lose" one, you can manufacture a replacement; that the value of a group of people who share space and history can be captured in a metric and deployed at scale.</p><p>Economists have a word for assets that can be swapped one-for-one without loss of value: fungible. A dollar is fungible. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude is fungible. </p><p>...A mass of people bound together by years of shared context, inside jokes and collective memory is not.</p><p>And yet we keep treating communities as though they are.</p><p>When a platform migrates its user base to a new architecture, the implicit promise is that the community will survive the move. When a city demolishes a public housing block and offers residents vouchers for market-rate apartments across town, the implicit promise is that they'll rebuild what they had.</p><p>These promises are always broken, and the people making them either don't understand why, or they're relying on the rest of us being too blind to see it.</p><h2 id="what-robert-moses-got-wrong">What Robert Moses got wrong...</h2><p>Robert Moses displaced an estimated 250,000 people over the course of his career, razing entire neighbourhoods to make way for expressways and public works projects. The defence of Moses, then and now, is utilitarian: more people benefited from the infrastructure than were harmed by its construction. The calculus assumed that the displaced residents could form equivalent communities elsewhere, and the relationships severed by a highway cutting through a block were replaceable with relationships formed in a new location. Jane Jacobs spent much of her career arguing that this was catastrophically wrong. The old neighbourhood was not a collection of individuals who happened to live near each other; it was a living organism with its own immune system and its own way of metabolising change. When Moses bulldozed it, he killed a community and scattered the remains.</p><p>Jacobs understood that the value of a community isn't in the people as discrete units. The value is in the specific, unreproducible web of relationships between them. You can move every single resident of a street to the same new street in the same new suburb and you will not get the same community, because community is a function of time and ten thousand microtransactions of reciprocity that nobody tracks and nobody can mandate.</p><h2 id="and-what-economists-miss">...and what economists miss</h2><p>In a model, agents are interchangeable. Consumer A and Consumer B have different preference curves, yes, but they respond to the same incentive structures in predictable ways. Community is what you get when agents stop being interchangeable to each other. When Alice doesn't need "a neighbour" but needs <em>that</em> neighbour, the one who watched her kids that time, the one who knows she's allergic to peanuts. The relationship is specific, and specificity is the enemy of fungibility.</p><p>This is why so many attempts to "build community" from scratch end up producing something that looks like community but functions like a mailing list. The startup that launches a Discord server and calls it a community // the coworking space that holds a monthly mixer and calls it a community etc. What they've actually built is a directory of loosely affiliated strangers who share a single contextual overlap.</p><p>That's a starting condition for community, but it's not community itself, and the difference is like the difference between a pile of lumber and a house. The raw materials are necessary but wildly insufficient.</p><h2 id="when-platforms-die-communities-dont-migrate">When platforms die, communities don't migrate</h2><p>The internet has run this experiment dozens of times now, and the results are consistent. When a platform dies or degrades, its community does not simply migrate to the next platform, it fragments, and the ones who do arrive at the new place find that the social dynamics are different, the norms have shifted, and a substantial number of the people who made the old place feel like home are gone. LiveJournal's Russian acquisition scattered its English-speaking community across Dreamwidth and eventually Twitter. Each successor captured a fraction of the original user base and none of them captured the culture. The community that existed on LiveJournal in 2006 is extinct and cannot be reassembled. The specific conditions that created it, a particular moment in internet history when blogging was new and social media hadn't yet been colonised by algorithmic feeds and engagement optimisation, no longer exist.</p><p>You can see the pattern in Vine's death and the migration to Snapchat x TikTok, with Twitter's degradation and the scattering to Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon. In every case, the platform's architects // successors assumed that the product was the platform and the community was an emergent feature that would re-emerge given similar conditions. They had the relationship exactly backwards. The community was the product and the platform was the container, and when the container breaks, the product spills and evaporates, and some of it is lost forever.</p><h2 id="dunbars-layers-the-archaeology-of-trust">Dunbar's layers + the archaeology of trust</h2><p>Robin Dunbar's research on social group sizes tells us that humans maintain relationships in rough layers: about five intimate relationships, fifteen close ones, fifty good friends, and a hundred and fifty meaningful acquaintances. These aren't arbitrary numbers; they mirror cognitive and emotional bandwidth constraints that are probably neurological in origin. What Dunbar's model implies about community is underappreciated. If a community is a network of overlapping Dunbar layers, then each member's experience of the community is unique, shaped by where they sit in the web. There is no "the community" in any objective sense. There are as many communities as there are members, each one a different cross-section of the same social graph, and this means that when you lose members, you lose entire subjective communites that existed literally nowhere else.</p><p>When a Roman town was abandoned, the physical structures decayed at different rates. Stone walls lasted centuries while textiles vanished in years. The social structure of a community decays the same way when it's disrupted. The institutional relationships, the stone walls, might survive: people will still know each other's names and professional roles. The close friendships might last a while, held together by active effort. But the ambient trust, the willingness to lend a tool without being asked or to tolerate a minor annoyance because you've built up enough goodwill to absorb it, that's the textile, and it goes first. Once it's gone, what's left = a skeleton that looks like a community but has lost the capacity to function like one.</p><h2 id="why-build-a-new-one-doesnt-work">Why "build a new one" doesn't work</h2><p>There's a fantasy popular among technologists and policymakers that community can be engineered. That if you identify the right variables and apply the right interventions, you can produce community on demand. This fantasy has a name in the urbanist literature: it's called "new town syndrome," after the observation that Britain's postwar new towns, carefully designed with all the amenities a community could need, produced widespread anomie and social isolation in their early decades. Stevenage had shops, schools, parks and pubs. What it didn't have was history. The residents had no shared past and no slowly accumulated social capital. They had proximity without context, and proximity without context is a crowd.</p><p>The same problem pops up in every domain where someone tries to instantiate community from a blueprint. Corporate culture initiatives and neighbourhood revitalisation programs tend to optimise for the visible markers of community, events and shared spaces, while ignoring the invisible substrate that makes those markers meaningful. It's like building an elaborate birdhouse and assuming birds will come, and when they don't, the birdhouse builders typically conclude that they need a better birdhouse, rather than questioning wether birdhouses are how you get birds.</p><h2 id="you-cant-rerun-the-history">You can't rerun the history</h2><p>The destruction of a community is largely irreversible. You can rebuild a building and you can replant a forest and, given enough decades, get something that resembles the original ecosystem. But a community that took twenty years to develop its particular structure of norms and mutual knowledge cannot be regrown in twenty years, because the conditions that shaped it no longer exist. The people are older, the context has changed, and the specific convergance of circumstances that brought those particular individuals together in that particular configuration at that particular time is gone. Communities are path-dependent in the strongest possible sense: their current state is a function of their entire history, and you can't rerun the history.</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in <em>The Dispossessed</em> about the tension between a society that valued radical freedom and the structures that emerged organically to make collective life possible. Her protagonist, Shevek, discovers that even in a society designed to prevent the accumulation of power, informal hierarchies and social obligations develop on their own, shaped by nothing more than time and proximity. Le Guin understood that community structure isn't designed, it's deposited, like sediment, by the slow accumulation of interactions that nobody planned and nobody controls.</p><h2 id="so-what-do-we-actually-owe-existing-communities">So what do we actually owe existing communities?</h2><p>If communities are non-fungible, if they can't be replaced once destroyed, then every decision that disrupts an existing community carries a cost that is systematically undervalued. The cost doesn't show up in a spreadsheet because it's not a line item, it's the loss of a particular, specific, irreproducible social configuration that provided its members with things that can't be purchased on the open market: ambient trust and the comfort of being known.</p><p>Displacement - whether physical or digital - is more expensive than anyone budgets for. The burden of proof should fall on the displacer, not the displaced, to demonstrate that the benefits of disruption outweigh the destruction of social capital that took years or decades to accumulate. And the glib promise of "we'll build something even better" should be treated with the same scepticism as a contractor who promises to replace your load-bearing wall with something decorative. It is, to be frank, bullshit. </p><p>Communities are not resources to be optimised and they're not user bases to be migrated. They're the accumulated residue of people choosing, over and over again, to remain in a relationship with each other under specific conditions that will never, ever recur in exactly the same way. </p><p>Treating them as fungible is idiotic, and we have been far too willing to let it happen unchallenged.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>
  Ok, it is over.  End of an era for me.  No more self-hosted git.  I
  had a public git server running since 2011, and a public cvs server
  before that.  AI scrapers have hammered the poor, little server to
  death by flooding the cgit frontend with tons of pointless²
  requests.  Actually a few months ago already.
</p>
<p>
  Now I finally decided to not try rebuild the server, be it with or
  without cgit web frontend.  I don't feel like taking up the fight
  with the scrapers in my spare time, I leave that to people who are
  in a better position to do so.  Most repositories had mirrors on one
  or two of the large gitforges already.  Those are the primary
  repositories now.  Go look
  at <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/kraxel/projects">gitlab</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/kraxel?tab=repositories">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Last week I've fixed all (I hope) dangeling links to the cgit
  repsitories to point to the forges instead.
</p>
<p>
  Now I'm down to one self-hosted service, which is the webserver
  hosting mainly this blog and a few more little things.  In 2018 I've
  migrated the blog from wordpress to jekyll, so it is all static
  pages.  Taking this out by AI scrapers overloading the machine should
  be next to impossible, and so far this has hold up.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless AI scrapers already managed to trigger one outage.
  Apparently millions of 404 answers where not enough to convince the
  bots that there is no cgit service (any more).  Apache had no
  problems to deliver those, but the logs have filled up the disk so
  fast that logrotate didn't manage to keep things under control with
  the default configuration.  Fixed config.  Knook wood.

  the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-security-nightmares">2025

  ² Most inefficient way to get the complete repo.  Just clone it, ok?

<p>These small boards were built to demonstrate individual devices from pinball machines.&nbsp; They all have 24v (for relays and solenoids) and 6v (for lamps) AC power wired along the back.&nbsp; Each board attaches to its neighbor on the left side to form a string of display boards wired together.&nbsp; The first board in the string attaches to a transformer which supplies power to all boards in the string.&nbsp; Using the same connectors on each board allows the boards to be laid out in any order, and makes it easy to swap out or remove a board if it breaks down.</p>

<p>Each of the display boards is shown below with its instruction card which is typically propped up behind the board.</p>

<p>Click on any thumbnail to jump to the details section for that device.</p>

<h2><a id="TheBasics" name="TheBasics"></a>The Basics</h2>

<p>These devices represent the simplest building blocks of most electromechanical pinball machines.</p>

<h3><a id="Solenoid" name="Solenoid"></a>Solenoid</h3>

<p>Solenoids drive most of the motion in a pinball machine and are featured in most of the other displays.&nbsp; This solenoid is purposely weak and slow moving to show how it can lift the steel plunger when power is applied.&nbsp; Normally solenoids move their plungers so quickly that they are hard to follow.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>This video shows how the solenoid works.&nbsp; In this case the steel plunger is attached to a wooden dowel with a round target at the top to better show the motion of the plunger as it is drawn into the solenoid.</p>

<p>For a more in depth explanation of how solenoids convert electricity into motion, visit the <a href="http://funwithpinball.com/learn/solenoids-relays-and-electromagnetism">Solenoids, Relays and Electromagnetism</a> page.&nbsp; The <a href="http://funwithpinball.com/resources/patents">Patents</a> page includes patent information about the <a href="http://funwithpinball.com/resources/patents#Solenoid">first use of a solenoid</a> in a pinball machine.</p>

<h3><a id="Relays" name="Relays"></a>Relays</h3>

<p>Relays are smaller and weaker than solenoids and are usually only used to activate or hold switches to enable features and lights, or to release mechanisms that were activated by a solenoid (as in the <a href="http://funwithpinball.com/exhibits/small-boards-page-2#DisappearingPost">Disappearing Post</a>, <a href="#ZipperFlippers">Zipper Flippers</a> and others below).&nbsp; This board includes a simple relay, an interlocking relay which can stay in either position indefinitely without power, and a relay configured as a miniature stepper that turns a cam to open and close a switch.</p>

<h3><a id="PopBumpers" name="PopBumpers"></a>Pop Bumpers</h3>

<p>Perhaps the single most recognizable feature of a pinball machine, the Pop Bumper (or Jet Bumper) can kick a ball away that is approaching from any direction.</p>

</p>

<p>Pop Bumpers can fire several times per second and are too fast to easily discern the sequence of events.&nbsp; The version below uses a microcontroller and a couple of small motors to animate the pinball and pop bumper in slow motion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Flipper" name="Flipper"></a>Flippers</h3>

<p>While flippers appear on all pinball machines now they weren't invented until the late 1940s.&nbsp; Before then players had to nudge the ball around the playfield without tilting the game or rely on ball kickers that would only fire when the ball closed the appropriate switch.</p>

<h2><a id="Steppers" name="Steppers"></a>Steppers</h2>

<p>Steppers are used to step through a number of positions sequentially.&nbsp; They use ratcheting mechanisms to advance one step at a time and some use escapement mechanisms similar to those found in clocks to retract their steps either one step at a time, or all the way back to the beginning.</p>

<h3><a id="Stepper" name="Stepper"></a>Stepper Unit</h3>

<p>Stepper units are used to track features that step through a sequence as the game is played.&nbsp; For example the game might have several features that light up one at a time in order.&nbsp; This stepper is similar to the <a href="#ScoreReels">Score Reels</a> below because it advances one step at a time, in one direction only.&nbsp; It differs from the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> and <a href="#BallCountUnit">Ball Count Unit</a> below because it can only advance; it cannot decrement or reset.</p>

<h3><a id="BallCountUnit" name="BallCountUnit"></a>Ball Count Unit</h3>

<p>The Ball Count Unit keeps track of how many balls the player has played.&nbsp; Lights wired to the Ball Count unit usually indicate the ball in play.&nbsp; The Ball Count Unit is another form of stepper that can step forward one step at a time or reset back to the beginning.&nbsp; It cannot decrement by one step like the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> below.</p>

<h3><a id="CreditUnit" name="CreditUnit"></a>Credit Unit</h3>

<p>The Credit Unit keeps track of how many game credits the player has and is usually visible through a small window in the backglass.&nbsp; Coins and replays increase the total while each new game decreases the total.&nbsp; The credit unit is a form of stepper unit that can step both forward and backward one step at a time.</p>

<span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>
</p>

<p>The video below demonstrates the mechanism that limits the credit unit to one step at a time in either direction.&nbsp; This is done with mechanical lever arms activated by the increment and decrement solenoids.</p>

<p>It also reveals how the credit unit is electrically limited to a range of values (e.g. zero to 14 credits in this case).&nbsp; The video frame below shows two pins mounted to the dark grey gear which rotates to reflect the number of game credits.&nbsp; When there are zero credits remaining, the pin on left opens the two switches in the upper left corner to cut power to the decrement solenoid of the credit unit and to the new game circuit.&nbsp; In this state the credit unit will only allow the player to increment the credit count by winning a replay or depositing a coin.</p>

<p>Similarly, when a maximum number of credits is reached, the other pin (at the bottom of the frame below) opens the third switch which disables the increment solenoid of the credit unit.&nbsp; This prevents the credit unit from over winding.</p>

<h3><a id="ScoreReels" name="ScoreReels"></a>Score Reels</h3>

<p>Score reels are simple counters similar to mechanical odometers in older cars.&nbsp; Each reel can be advanced individually (to add 10 points, or 100 points for example), or advances when it's lower neighbor rolls over from 9 to 0 (from 89 to 90 for example).&nbsp; Each reel also has a separate reset circuit used at the start of a new game that lets it advance only until it reaches 0, where it stops.</p>

<p>You may have noticed in the video that when a score reel resets to zero it advances its higher neighbor by one.&nbsp; This is not the normal behavior.&nbsp; A complete pinball machine has extra circuitry not present on this demonstration board to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h3><a id="ProjectionUnit" name="ProjectionUnit"></a>Projection Unit</h3>

<p>The Projection Unit was used to project the available game credits onto a frosted window on the backglass.&nbsp; Light from a bright bulb on the back of the unit shines through a pin hole, through the printed wheel, and through a focusing lens before reaching the glass.&nbsp; On this board the backglass is represented by a small piece of plastic held in a tube in front of the Projection Unit lens so the projection can be seen.</p>

<p>A predecessor to the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> above, the Projection Unit was used in some games until the late 1940s.</p>

<h3><a id="SpinUnit" name="SpinUnit"></a>Spin Unit</h3>

<p>The Spin Unit is a clever way for the game to randomly change a game feature.&nbsp; Ordinarily steppers can only increment, decrement or reset.&nbsp; The Spin Unit is able to randomly change from any position to any other position.&nbsp; It does this by using a pair of steppers.&nbsp; The first, larger stepper is configured like a <a href="#BallCountUnit">Ball Count Unit</a>; it steps up one step at a time and can reset back to its starting position.&nbsp; During a game this stepper advances periodically as certain targets are hit or switches close.&nbsp; It also resets periodically when other targets are hit.</p>

<p>As the first stepper resets, the teardrop shaped board attached to its axle rotates and kicks the white spinner mounted above it.&nbsp; The spinner spins for an indeterminate number of revolutions, closing a switch once for each revolution.&nbsp; (The spinner mechanism is usually used on the playfield as a target that rewards points for each revolution.)</p>

<p>Each time the switch on the spinner closes, it sends a pulse to the second, smaller stepper which is configured as a simple <a href="#Stepper">Stepper</a> (with no decrement or reset).&nbsp; While the second stepper does advance a single step at a time, it advances a step for each revolution of the spinner which effectively randomizes its final resting position.</p>

<p>The number of steps the second stepper takes is loosely correlated to the number of steps the first stepper took before it kicked the spinner because each step on the first stepper winds its spring a little tighter and will make it kick the spinner a little harder.</p>

<pre><code>A long, long time ago
I can still remember how a protocol
used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those botnets dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But January made me shiver
With every packet I tried to deliver
Bad news on the backbone
I couldn't scan a single ASN

I can't remember if I cried
When my -f root hit an ACL line
But something touched me deep inside
The day the telnet died

So bye, bye mass spreading Mirai
Drove my SYNs down on the fiber line
But the fiber line was dry
And good old bots were passing creds in the clear and dry
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die</code></pre>
<p>On January 14, 2026, at approximately 21:00 UTC, something changed in the internet’s plumbing. The GreyNoise Global Observation Grid recorded a sudden, sustained collapse in global telnet traffic — not a gradual decline, not scanner attrition, not a data pipeline problem, but a step function. One hour, ~74,000 sessions. The next, ~22,000. By the following hour, we were down to ~11,000 and the floor held.</p>
<p>Six days later, on <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2026/q1/89">January 20</a>, the security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 hit oss-security. By <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/01/26/cisa-adds-five-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">January 26</a>, CISA had added it to the KEV catalog.</p>
<p>We wrote about the <a href="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-01-22-f-around-and-find-out-18-hours-of-unsolicited-houseguests/index.html">first 18 hours of exploitation activity</a> back on January 22. This post is about something different: the structural change in global telnet traffic that preceded the CVE, and why we think the two events may not be independent.</p>
<section id="the-drop">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-drop">The Drop</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-02-10-telnet-falls-silent/media/asn-heatmap.png"></p>
<p>From December 1, 2025 through January 14, 2026, GreyNoise observed an average of ~914,000 non-spoofable telnet sessions per day across 51.2 million total sessions — let’s call that the “baseline”.</p>
<p>On January 14 at 21:00 UTC, hourly volume dropped 65% in a single tick. Within two hours it had fallen 83% below baseline. The new average settled around ~373,000 sessions/day — a <strong>59% sustained reduction</strong> that persists through the time of writing (February 10).</p>
<p>This wasn’t a taper. The hourly data around the inflection point tells the story:</p>

<p>That kind of step function — propagating within a single hour window — reads as a configuration change on routing infrastructure, not behavioral drift in scanning populations.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-went-silent">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-went-silent">What Went Silent</h2>
<p>Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (&gt;50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15. Some of the names that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vultr</strong> (AS20473) — 382K pre-drop sessions, then nothing</li>
<li><strong>Cox Communications</strong> (AS22773) — 150K sessions, gone</li>
<li><strong>Charter/Spectrum</strong> (AS20115) — 141K sessions, gone</li>
<li><strong>BT/British Telecom</strong> (AS2856) — 127K sessions, gone</li>
</ul>
<p>Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced — <em>zero</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the major cloud providers were largely unaffected or even increased. AWS went <em>up</em> 78%. Contabo <em>up</em> 90%. DigitalOcean essentially flat at +3%. Cloud providers have extensive private peering at major IXPs that bypasses traditional transit backbone paths. Residential and enterprise ISPs typically don’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="wheres-the-filter">
<h2 data-anchor-id="wheres-the-filter">Where’s the Filter?</h2>
<p>The pattern points toward one or more North American Tier 1 transit providers implementing port 23 filtering:</p>
<p>The timing — 21:00 UTC, which is 16:00 EST — is consistent with a US-based maintenance window. US residential ISPs (Cox, Charter, Comcast at -74%) were devastated while cloud providers on the same continent peered around whatever changed. Verizon/UUNET (AS701) dropped 79%, and as a major Tier 1 backbone, that’s consistent with it either being the filtering entity or sitting directly upstream of one. The 21% residual traffic on AS701 would represent paths that don’t transit the filtered links.</p>
<p>Countries that rely on transatlantic or transpacific backbone routes to reach US-hosted infrastructure got hit hardest. Countries with strong direct European peering (France at +18%, Germany at -1%) were essentially unaffected.</p>
<p>The Chinese backbone providers (China Telecom and China Unicom) both dropped ~59%, uniformly. That uniformity suggests the filter sits on the US side of transpacific links rather than within China. If this were a Chinese firewall action, we’d expect asymmetric impact across Chinese carriers and a harder cutoff.</p>

<section id="then-came-the-cve">
<h2 data-anchor-id="then-came-the-cve">Then Came the CVE</h2>
<p>CVE-2026-24061 is a critical (CVSS 9.8) authentication bypass in GNU Inetutils telnetd. The flaw is an argument injection in how telnetd handles the <code>USER</code> environment variable during telnet option negotiation. An attacker sends <code>-f root</code> as the username value, and <code>login(1)</code> obediently skips authentication, handing over a root shell. No credentials required. No user interaction. The vulnerable code was introduced in a 2015 commit and sat undiscovered for nearly 11 years.</p>

<p>The six-day gap between the telnet drop and the public CVE disclosure is the interesting part. On its face, the drop can’t have been <em>caused</em> by the CVE disclosure, because the drop happened first. But “caused by” isn’t the only relationship worth considering.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-supposition">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-supposition">The Supposition</h2>
<p>Responsible disclosure timelines don’t start at publication. The researcher who found this (<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/critical-gnu-inetutils-telnetd-flaw.html">credited as Kyu Neushwaistein / Carlos Cortes Alvarez</a>) reported the flaw on January 19, per public sources. But the coordination that leads to patches being ready, advisories being drafted, and CISA being prepared to add something to the KEV within six days of publication typically starts earlier than the day before disclosure.</p>
<p>Here’s what we think may have happened: advance notification of a trivially exploitable, unauthenticated root-access vulnerability affecting telnet daemons reached parties with the ability to act on it at the infrastructure level. A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering on transit links. The filtering went live on January 14. The public disclosure followed on January 20.</p>
<p>This would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The timing gap (advance notification → infrastructure response → public disclosure)</li>
<li>The specificity of the filtering (port 23/TCP, not a general routing change)</li>
<li>The topology of impact (transit-dependent paths affected, direct-peering paths not)</li>
<li>The sustained nature (the filter is still in place weeks later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can’t prove this. The backbone drop could be entirely coincidental — ISPs have been slowly moving toward filtering legacy insecure protocols for years (ref: Wannacry), and January 14 could simply have been when someone’s change control ticket finally got executed. Correlation, temporal proximity, and a plausible mechanism <em>absolutely do not</em> equal causation.</p>
<p>But the combination of a Tier 1 backbone implementing what appears to be port 23 filtering, followed six days later by the disclosure of a trivially exploitable root-access telnet vulnerability, followed four days after <em>that</em> by a CISA KEV listing, is worth documenting and considering.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-the-post-drop-world-looks-like">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-the-post-drop-world-looks-like">What the Post-Drop World Looks Like</h2>
<p>The telnet landscape after January 14 shows a recurring sawtooth pattern — periodic spikes followed by troughs (e.g., January 28 at 806K sessions, then January 30 at 191K). This could indicate intermittent filter application, routing flaps around the filtering infrastructure, or scanner campaigns that happen to use paths not affected by the filter.</p>

<p>If you’re running GNU Inetutils telnetd anywhere — and given the 11-year window, there are plenty of embedded systems, network appliances, and legacy Linux installations where it’s still likely present — patch to version 2.7-2 or later, or disable the service entirely. The CISA KEV remediation deadline for federal agencies is February 16, 2026. As noted, GreyNoise observed exploitation attempts <a href="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-01-22-f-around-and-find-out-18-hours-of-unsolicited-houseguests/index.html">within hours of disclosure</a> and the campaign peaked at ~2,600 sessions/day in early February before tapering off.</p>
<p>If you’re a network operator and you haven’t already filtered port 23 at your border, the backbone-level filtering we’ve documented here suggests the industry is moving in that direction regardless. Someone upstream of a significant chunk of the internet’s transit infrastructure apparently decided telnet traffic isn’t worth carrying anymore. That’s probably the right call.</p>

            <p>Some time ago, I noted that <a title="Why did the Windows 95 CD have extra fun stuff?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060103-52/?p=32853"> the Windows 95 CD contained a variety of multimedia extras</a>, partly because they were fun, and partly to show off Windows 95’s multimedia capabilities.</p>
<p>One of those multimedia extras was the music video for the song <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly_(song)">Buddy Holly</a></i> by the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer">Weezer</a>. Acquiring permission to redistribute the video took multiple steps.</p>
<p>First, Microsoft had to secure the rights to the song itself, which was negotiated directly with Weezer’s publisher Geffen Records, and apparently <a title="Knowledge Drop: Weezer Had No Idea The Music Video For " href="https://genius.com/a/weezer-had-no-idea-the-music-video-for-buddy-holly-would-be-included-with-windows-95"> without the knowledge of the band members themselves</a>. They were reportedly upset that they weren’t consulted but later realized that it was “one of the greatest things that could have happened to us. Can you imagine that happening today? It’s like, there’s one video on YouTube, and it’s your video.”</p>
<p>But that only secured the rights to the music. What about the video?</p>
<p>The video takes place in a reconstruction of a location from the <i>Happy Days</i> television program, and clips from that show were spliced into the music video to create the illusion that many of the characters from the show were part of the video. The lawyer responsible for securing the rights to the video had to contact all of the actors from <i>Happy Days</i> to get their permission. That lawyer thoroughly enjoyed the assignment. I don’t know whether he got to talk to the actors directly, or only to their agents, but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler’s telephone number (or his agent’s telephone number) with a chance of talking to The Fonz himself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I made the full switch into Linux in 2023 since I started following YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Smith</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MentalOutlaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mental Outlaw</a>
to name a few and then got into the rabbit hole of self-hosting on a budget therefore it is safe for me to say that I am somewhat experienced in this practice so I will walk you in this post on my setups over those 3 years, what I learned and what are my plans for the future.</p><h2 id="linux-as-my-main-os">Linux As My Main OS</h2><p>Back then I only had a desktop that I bought the year before and was using Windows 10 on it for gaming and work since at that time I was working with Microsoft software. Here are its specs (the only thing that remained till now is the GPU and case as I replaced everything else):</p><ul><li>Intel Core i5 10400.</li><li>16 GB DDR4 RAM.</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 8GB VRAM.</li><li>1 TB NVMe.</li></ul><p>Here is a picture of my desktop where I first bought it (apologies for the image quality):</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/desktop.webp" alt="Picture of my desktop in 2023"></p><p>For me the main reason for making the switch to Linux is that I wanted to learn it hands on and dedicate my computer for software development, I started out with Debian 11 as my first distro.
I wasn’t doing too much gaming but I came up with a solution for some of the games I was playing with friends that had Anti-Cheat and that was a VM with GPU passthrough thanks to QEMU/KVM which was built in and allowed me to have a config in such a way that Windows and the Anti-Cheat software can’t figure that they are running in a VM.</p><p>Here are guides I used back in 2024 when I updated my VM to use Windows 11 through Qemu/KVM and GPU Passthrough:</p><ul><li><a href="https://sysguides.com/install-kvm-on-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing KVM And QEMU</a></li><li><a href="https://sysguides.com/install-a-windows-11-virtual-machine-on-kvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing Windows 11 On VMs</a></li></ul><p>Other reasons that are still as important are ownership and privacy: I get to use my OS without having to have an account tied to the developers and customize it to my heart’s content all with minimal resource consumption. There are still issues with driver and software compatibility but it is getting better in the recent years thanks to projects like <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wine</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proton</a>
.</p><h2 id="self-hosting">Self-Hosting</h2><p>Previously, I had my website deployed on Vercel since back then I made it using Next.js but as I got deeper into the optimization meme I recreated my website in <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a>
which worked out pretty well and I am now more satisfied with its performance. Naturally, since I migrated away from Next.js I decided to get my own VPS and deploy the website there. I would say I got an overpowered one for my uses but I gained the capability to have more stuff in there like some of my personal projects and my own email through open source tools (check Luke Smith’s <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/emailwiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emailwiz</a>
repo). Here is the VPS specs which I got from Hostinger through a YouTuber’s affiliate link:</p><ul><li>AMD EPYC 9354P 8 Cores.</li><li>32 GB DDR4 RAM.</li><li>400 GB NVMe.</li><li>32 TB Bandwidth.</li></ul><p>Having to manage a server comes with learning more tools related to System Administration like Nginx, Certbot, GitHub Actions, Systemd services, setting up SSH and firewall rules, blocking unwanted traffic through <a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crowdsec</a>
. This made me get a better hands on understanding on how different components work in Linux since nothing is abstracted away like it was with Vercel and had to configure almost everything by hand. Here are some guides that helped me setup my website on my VPS:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmbBgXK8M5M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VPS Setup And Website Deployment</a></li><li><a href="https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/goaccess-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Based Website Analytics Written In C</a></li></ul><p>And here is a sneak peek at my latest analytics stats:</p><video autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="" loop="" preload="metadata">
<source src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/analytics.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 id="my-home-server">My Home Server</h2><p>The next thing I did was to get some sort of personal cloud that is hosted locally mainly to sync and backup files between my devices and block ads in my local network. For that I started out with a Raspberry Pi 4 that had 8 GB of RAM in which I connected a 500 GB SSD external drive and for cooling I got heatsinks and a cpu fan and kept it running 24/7 and it worked surprisingly well for a good amount of time. I used <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syncthing</a>
for file synchronization and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a>
as my local network DNS server to block unwanted incoming traffic. Here are pictures of my Raspberry Pi and how I mounted it to my old desk in 2024:</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/pi.webp" alt="Picture of my RPi"></p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/pi-boxed-ssd.webp" alt="Picture of my RPi mounted to my old desk"></p><p>Then in 2025 I got a new desktop so I used the old one as my home server. I upgraded the RAM to 32 GB and the CPU to an i5 12400 and got an SSD on which I installed <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox VE</a>
. Thanks to the <a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community scripts</a>
I was able to get the stuff I had on the Pi migrated to my home server with ease into separate LXCs and VMs. I also added the ability to connect to my home server remotely through VPN using <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireguard</a>
and since my ip at home is dynamic I registered a subdomain as a DDNS record and used <a href="https://ddclient.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ddclient</a>
on the server to automatically send the new ip every time it changes. Here are some guides I used to configure PCIe passthrough both to VMs and LXCs to pass my GPU for better performance:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hOBAGKLQkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox PCIe Passthrough</a></li><li><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/proxmox-lxc-docker-gpu-passthrough-setup-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox LXC GPU Passthrough Written Guide</a></li></ul><p>Here is my home server running 24/7 and connected to a UPS to stay up for a while in case of a power outage (the other UPS is connected to other devices like the router):</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/home-server.webp" alt="Picture of my home server"></p><p>And here is its proxmox dashboard from where I can access LXCs and VMs or monitor and manage resources:</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/proxmox.webp" alt="Proxmox dashboard"></p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>Getting into Linux and self-hosting made me better at system administration and got me excited and hopeful about having as much autonomy as possible with the tools I use especially with the current times where almost every commercial software dedicated to normal consumers hoards and sells data to be used for ads even in paid products. Although it is not for everyone since it involves a lot of configuration which requires patience but for me it is so I will continue to incoporate free and open source tools into my “personal cloud” to keep learning as a software engineer and to keep control of my digital footprint.</p><p>One step I recently took in that direction is installing my own search engine using <a href="https://docs.searxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearXNG</a>
on my VPS which I can use on all of my devices. Other steps I plan to take is to get into more Linux distros (I tried debian based, Arch and Nix) and most importantly contribute back to the open source tools in any way I can whether financially or through assistance in development.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><span>Google provided</span> Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a wide array of personal data on a student activist and journalist, including his credit card and bank account numbers, according to a copy of an ICE subpoena obtained by The Intercept.</p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/09/16/google-facebook-subpoena-ice-students-gaza/">Amandla Thomas-Johnson</a> had attended a protest targeting companies that supplied weapons to Israel at a Cornell University job fair in 2024 for all of five minutes, but the action got him banned from campus. When President Donald Trump assumed office and issued a series of executive orders targeting students who protested in support of Palestinians, Thomas-Johnson and his friend Momodou Taal went into hiding.</p>
<p>Google informed Thomas-Johnson via a brief email in April that it had already shared his metadata with the Department of Homeland Security, as The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/09/16/google-facebook-subpoena-ice-students-gaza/">previously reported</a>. But the full extent of the information the tech giant provided —&nbsp;including usernames, addresses, itemized list of services, including any IP masking services, telephone or instrument numbers, subscriber numbers or identities, and credit card and bank account numbers — was not previously known.</p>
<p>“I’d already seen the subpoena request that Google and Meta had sent to Momodou [Taal], and I knew that he had gotten in touch with a lawyer and the lawyer successfully challenged that,” Thomas-Johnson said. “I was quite surprised to see that I didn’t have that opportunity.”<ins></ins></p>

<p>The subpoena provides no justification for why ICE is asking for this information, except that it’s required “in connection with an investigation or inquiry relating to the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.” In the subpoena, ICE requests that Google not “disclose the existence of this summons for indefinite period of time.”</p>
<p>Thomas-Johnson, who is British, believes that ICE requested that information to track and eventually detain him — but he had already fled to Geneva, Switzerland, and is now in Dakar, Senegal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing Thomas-Johnson, and the ACLU of Northern California sent a letter to Google, Amazon, Apple, Discord, Meta, Microsoft, and Reddit last week calling on tech companies to resist similar subpoenas in the future from DHS without court intervention. The letter asks the companies to provide users with as much notice as possible before complying with a subpoena to give them the opportunity to fight it, and to resist gag orders that would prevent the tech companies from informing targets that a subpoena was issued.</p>
<p>“Your promises to protect the privacy of users are being tested right now. As part of the federal government’s unprecedented campaign to target critics of its conduct and policies, agencies like DHS have repeatedly demanded access to the identities and information of people on your services,” the letter reads. “Based on our own contact with targeted users, we are deeply concerned your companies are failing to challenge unlawful surveillance and defend user privacy and speech.”</p>
<p>In addition to Thomas-Johnson’s case, the letter refers to other instances in which technology companies provided user data to DHS, including a subpoena sent to Meta to “unmask” the identities of users who documented immigration raids in California. Unlike Thomas-Johnson, users in that case were given the chance to fight the subpoena because they were made aware of it before Meta complied.</p>
<p>Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo Law and a former staff attorney with ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said that by not giving prior notice, Google deprived Thomas-Johnson of his ability to protect his information.</p>

<p>“The problem is that it doesn’t allow the person whose personal information is on the line and whose privacy may be being invaded to raise challenges to the disclosure of that potentially private information,” Nash said. “And I think that’s important to protect rights that they may have to their own information.”</p>
<p>Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Tech companies’ data sharing practices are primarily governed by two federal laws, the Stored Communications Act, which protects the privacy of digital communications, including emails, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices.</p>
<p>“Under both federal law and the law of every state, you cannot deceive consumers,” said Neil Richards, a law professor at Washington University St. Louis who specializes in privacy, the internet, and civil liberties. “And if you make a material misrepresentation about your data practices, that’s a deceptive trade practice.”</p>
<p>Whether or not corporations are clear enough with consumers about how they collect and share their <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-sues-cambridge-analytica-settles-former-ceo-app-developer">data has been litigated for decades</a>, Richards said, referencing the infamous Cambridge Analytica lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that the company misled Facebook users about data collection and sharing.</p>

<p>Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#infosharing">public privacy policy acknowledges</a> that it will share personal information in response to an “enforceable governmental request,” adding that its legal team will “frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.”</p>
<p>According to Google, the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview">company overwhelmingly complied with the millions of requests</a> made by the government for user information over the last decade. Its data also shows that those requests have spiked over the last five years. It’s unclear how many of those users were given notice of those requests ahead of time or after.</p>
<p>Richards said that cases like these emphasize the need for legal reforms around data privacy and urged Congress to amend the Stored Communications Act to require a higher standard before the government can access our digital data. He also said the federal government needs to regulate Big Tech and place “substantive restrictions on their ability to share information with the government.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to know exactly how tech companies are handling our personal data in relation to the government, but there seems to have been a shift in optics, Richards said. “What we have seen in the 12 months since the leaders of Big Tech were there on the podium at the inauguration,” Richards said, “is much more friendliness of Big Tech towards the government and towards state power.”</p>
<p>From Dakar, Thomas-Johnson said that understanding the extent of the subpoena was terrifying but had not changed his commitment to his <a>work</a>.</p>
<p>“As a journalist, what’s weird is that you’re so used to seeing things from the outside,” said Thomas-Johnson, whose work has appeared in outlets including Al Jazeera and The Guardian. “We need to think very hard about what resistance looks like under these conditions… where government and Big Tech know so much about us, can track us, can imprison, can destroy us in a variety of ways.”</p>
