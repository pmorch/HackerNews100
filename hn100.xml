<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">You can't rely on other people or organisations to hold onto your media forever, and it's a tired but true maxim that the cloud is just someone else's machine.</p><p>If you've spent your hard earned cash supporting independent artists through Bandcamp, a series of ownership changes and layoffs suggest that now might be the best time for audiophiles to download their audio files to secure offline storage.</p><h2 id="h-whats-been-happening-at-bandcamp">What's been happening at Bandcamp?</h2><figure><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/babel.jpeg" alt="painting of a crumbling tower of Babel" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Bandcamp was set up in 2007 as an audio distribution platform where artists and their labels had complete control of sales, streams, and later, production and distribution and physical products.</p><p>Arriving at a time when Spotify was coming to dominate audio streaming, and Google's recent YouTube purchase sent shivers of discomfort down the spines of nascent musical stars, Bandcamp offered them control of their media in a way that other platforms couldn't.</p><p>In March 2022, Epic games (itself partially owned by Chinese tech behemoth and holding company, Tencent) acquired Bandcamp. The following year, after massively bigging up the business, they sold it to Songtradr - a competing music platform. With us so far?</p><p>Songtradr had acquired the business, but declined to acquire roughly half of the employees. Songtradr is also refusing to recognise the Bandcamp union, which was voted into existence in March 2023.</p><p>According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Aftermath</a>, Bandcamp is a mess right now, with most of the support team gone. This leaves artists under the care of people who are either incredibly overworked, barely trained, or both. Engineers are doing work normally allotted to the support staff - normally a highly trained, competent, and enthusiastic crew.</p><h2 id="h-bandcamp-is-looking-a-little-shaky-right-now">When the music's over (Turn out the lights)</h2><figure><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/myspace.png" alt="myspace homepage with broken images" width="1910" height="955" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>With the support department looking less capable, artists will be looking to publish elsewhere, and with engineers taking up the support team's slack (BOOM), who's looking after the infrastructure that keeps the site running, the streams streaming, and your thousands of purchased albums safely on their virtual shelves?</p><p>Neglect can kill a company, and if it doesn't kill it, then it can leave it lurching on, even while its soul has been banished to the shadow realm.</p><p>Even if a company appears normal after a series of takeovers and disasters, its usefulness - its core offering and raison d'être - is gone or genericised.</p><p>Remember MySpace? You don't have to remember it, it's right there at <a href="https://myspace.com/">myspace.com</a>. Visit today, and you'll see band pages, you'll be able to stream music, watch videos, and 'connect with people'.</p><p>But MySpace is long dead, and what remains is a reanimated revenant resurrected yet again by corporate owners we can't even be bothered to research.</p><p>MySpace used to host the music of thousands of independent bands, at the same time it was the world's dominant social media platform. Most of that music is gone now - everything before 2015 disappeared during a fucked-up server migration in 2019, with only fragments available on the Internet Archive.</p><p>Want to run a massive, content-heavy service on a shoestring budget? That's the kind of thing that happens.</p><h2 id="h-run-dont-walk">There's an extension for that...</h2><p>While we're not saying that Bandcamp is going to disappear into nothing (MySpace is still around after all), we think it's perhaps prudent to download your albums from Bandcamp and store them offline. You never know - that's all we're saying.</p><p>The Bandcamp UI isn't really designed with massive downloads in mind, and there are a lot of boxes to tick.</p><p>Fortunately, it's pretty easy to download all of your Bandcamp music using the excellent Batchcamp extension which is available as both a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/batchcamp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FireFox addon</a>, or as a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google Chrome extension</a>.</p><p>Install the extension/add-on in the usual way, and pin it to your browser.</p><p>When you're logged into Bandcamp through the website, click the Batchcamp icon, and select your preferred audio format from the dropdown. You have a choice of <strong>MP3 V0</strong>, <strong>MP3 320</strong>, <strong>FLAC</strong>, <strong>AAC</strong>, <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong>, <strong>ALAC</strong>, <strong>WAV</strong>, or <strong>AIFF</strong>.</p><p>While you can set Batchcamp to download up to eight concurrent downloads, we'd suggest that three is reasonable - you don't want to stress a potentially delicate structure.</p><figure><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/collection.png" alt="bandcamp collection with batchcamp purple button" width="1915" height="957" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>At the bottom of the page, you'll see a purple(ish) <strong>Select All</strong> button. Hit it, then <strong>Download</strong>. Depending on how many albums you have i your collection this may take a while.</p><p>We suggest that you do this twice. Once in your preferred listening format, and once in the the highest lossless quality there is. You can convert this to future formats when they arrive on the scene in the future.</p><h2 id="h-stream-you-own-tracks">Stream your own tracks on your own network</h2><p>The ability to stream audio tracks is great, but its even better when its streaming from your own hardware on your own network.</p><p>Jellyfin is an open-source project that will help you organise, store, and stream music, shows, and movies from your own server. It will run on pretty much anything you have around from an old laptop, to a Raspberry Pi, to a dedicated high spec server.</p><p>You should check it out: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://jellyfin.org/</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros" rel="nofollow">Eros</a> is the main gui. You can select your account/favorite server and then connect to it. Once everything is prepared, the rendering will start.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Version support</h2>
<p dir="auto">I always try to add support for the newest version of minecraft. Mostly it is pretty easy, just declaring it and generate all data. After pushing it, it is supported. Some versions are more complicated and need a bit of coding. I always try it as fast as possible, but sometimes I just need time.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported versions</h3>
<p dir="auto">Almost all versions (and snapshots!) between 1.7 and the latest one (1.20.2 as of writing this) are supported.<br>
I plan to maintain Minosoft to at least version 1.20, so stay tuned, and support for older protocols will not be dropped as newer protocols are added. It is still recommended using the latest stable version.<br>
See <a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/Bixilon/Minosoft/blob/master/doc/VersionSupport.md">Version support</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Modding</h2>
<p dir="auto">Works, still missing some features to make modding super easy (see e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/bixilon/minosoft/-/issues/12" rel="nofollow">#12</a>)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Botting</h3>
<p dir="auto">Will be improved in the future.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contribution or helping out</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please do it. I am completely busy with the development. Grab pretty much whatever you want and start developing.
(But before please take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/Bixilon/Minosoft/blob/master/Contributing.md">Contributing.md</a>)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits and thanking words</h2>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/Bixilon/Minosoft/blob/master/Credits.md">Credits</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Releases and beta</h2>
<p dir="auto">No clue. Don't wait for it :)</p>
<p dir="auto">I invested many thousands of hours in this project to make it "work". A lot of vanillas features are actually implemented, but soo much is missing.
A release normally means, that it is stable, has few (known) bugs and won't change that much in the near future.
All those "requirements" are currently not fulfilled at all. It is just way to alpha atm. The current goal always was to play bedwars with this client and it actually worked on hypixel (<a href="https://gitlab.bixilon.de/bixilon/minosoft/-/issues/42" rel="nofollow">#42</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to get notified when cool new features arrive or other interesting stuff happens were, feel free to subscribe to <a href="https://t.me/MinosoftDevNews" rel="nofollow">@MinosoftDevNews</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Downloads / Installation</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux, Windows, macOS</h3>
<p dir="auto">The latest x64 and arm64 build gets uploaded to github actions. See <a href="https://github.com/Bixilon/Minosoft/actions/?ref=gitlab.bixilon.de">github actions</a></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arch</h4>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to @jugendhacker you can get minosoft directly from the arch user repository (AUR): <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minosoft-git/" rel="nofollow">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minosoft-git/</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install Java 11+ (e.g. <code>sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk</code>). Windows users <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu" rel="nofollow">download</a> and install java.</li>

 <li>Until today, dry stone wall construction has involved vast amounts of manual labour.</li> 
 <li>A multidisciplinary team of ETH Zurich researchers developed a method of using an autonomous excavator to construct a dry-stone wall that is six metres high and sixty-five metres long.</li> 
 <li>Dry stone walls are resource efficient as they use locally sourced materials, such as concrete slabs that are low in embodied energy.</li> 
</ul>
            </div>
<div>
                
                
                <p>ETH Zurich researchers deployed an autonomous excavator, called HEAP, to build a six metre-high and sixty-five-metre-long dry-stone wall. The wall is embedded in a digitally planned and autonomously excavated landscape and park.</p>
<p>The team of researchers included: Gramazio Kohler Research, the Robotics Systems Lab, Vision for Robotics Lab, and the Chair of Landscape Architecture. They developed this innovative design application as part of the National Centre of Competence in Research for Digital Fabrication (NCCR dfab).</p>
<p>Using sensors, the excavator can autonomously draw a 3D map of the construction site and localise existing building blocks and stones for the wall’s construction. Specifically designed tools and machine vision approaches enable the excavator to scan and grab large stones in its immediate environment. It can also register their approximate weight as well as their centre of gravity. An algorithm determines the best position for each stone, and the excavator then conducts the task itself by placing the stones in the desired location. The autonomous machine can place 20 to 30 stones in a single consignment – about as many as one delivery could supply.</p>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BOTLIB - Telegram C bot framework</h2>
<p dir="auto">WARNING: API is work in progress. Don't consider it reliable until this message is removed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create your bot using the Telegram <a href="https://t.me/botfather" rel="nofollow">@BotFather</a>.</li>
<li>After obtaining your bot API key, store it into a file called <code>apikey.txt</code> inside the bot working directory. Alternatively you can use the <code>--apikey</code> command line argument to provide your Telegram API key.</li>
<li>Optionally edit <code>mybot.c</code> to personalized the bot.</li>
<li>Build the bot: you need libcurl and libsqlite installed. Just type <code>make</code>.</li>
<li>Run with <code>./mybot</code>. There is also a debug mode if you run it using the <code>--debug</code> option (add --debug multiple times for even more verbose messages). For a more moderate output use <code>--verbose</code>. Try <code>mybot --help</code> for the full list of command line options.</li>
<li>Add the bot to your Telegram channel.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The bot <em>must</em> be an administrator of the channel in order to read all the messages that are sent in such channel. Private messages will work regardless.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">By default the bot will create an SQLite database in the working directory.
If you want to specify another path for your SQLite db, use the <code>--dbfile</code>
command line option.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">APIs</h2>
<p dir="auto">... Work in progress ...</p>
<p dir="auto">For the bot API check <code>mybot.c</code> example itself. The basic usage is pretty simple. However for all the other stuff, like the Sqlite3 abstractions, they are taken from <a href="https://github.com/antirez/stonky">Stonky</a>, so the code there (which is very accessible) will provide some help. I hope to document this project better. For now my main goal was to stop duplicating Stonly to create new bots with all the common code inside.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <h2 id="i">I.</h2>

<p>My dad emigrated from Colombia to North America when he was 18 looking looking for a better life. For my brother and I that meant a lot of standing outside in the cold. My dad’s preferred method of improving his lot was improving lots, and my brother and I were “voluntarily” recruited to help working on the buildings we owned.</p>

<p>That’s how I came to spend a substantial part of my teenage years replacing fences, digging trenches, and building flooring and sheds. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned from all this building, it’s that reality has a surprising amount of detail.</p>

<p>This turns out to explain why its so easy for people to end up intellectually stuck. Even when they’re literally the best in the world in their field.</p>

<p>Consider building some basement stairs for a moment. Stairs seem pretty simple at first, and at a high level they are simple, just two long, wide parallel boards (2” x 12” x 16’), some boards for the stairs and an angle bracket on each side to hold up each stair. But as you actually start building you’ll find there’s a surprising amount of nuance.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that there are actually quite a few subtasks. Even at a high level, you have to cut both ends of the 2x12s at the correct angles; then screw in some u-brackets to the main floor to hold the stairs in place; then screw in the 2x12s into the u-brackets; then attach the angle brackets for the stairs; then screw in the stairs.</p>

<table>
<caption>Those goddamn stairs.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/stairs-diagram.jpg" alt="Those goddamn stairs."></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Next you’ll notice that each of those steps above decomposes into several steps, some of which have some tricky details to them due to the properties of the materials and task and the limitations of yourself and your tools.</p>

<p>The first problem you’ll encounter is that cutting your 2x12s to the right angle is a bit complicated because there’s no obvious way to trace the correct angles. You can either get creative (there <em>is</em> a way to  trace it), or you can bust out your trig book and figure out how to calculate the angle and position of the cuts.</p>

<p>You’ll probably also want to look up what are reasonable angles for stairs. What looks reasonable when you’re cutting and what feels safe can be different. Also, you’re probably going to want to attach a guide for your circular saw when cutting the angle on the 2x12s because the cut has to be pretty straight.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to you will quickly find that getting the stair boards at all the same angle is non-trivial. You’re going to need something that can give you an angle to the main board very consistently. Once you have that, and you’ve drawn your lines, you may be dismayed to discover that your straight looking board is not <em>that</em> straight. Lumber warps after it’s made because it was cut when it was new and wet and now it’s dryer, so no lumber is perfectly straight.</p>

<p>Once you’ve gone back to the lumber store and gotten some straighter 2x12s and redrawn your lines, you can start screwing in your brackets. Now you’ll learn that despite <em>starting</em> aligned with the lines you drew, after screwing them in, your angle brackets are no longer quite straight because the screws didn’t go in quite straight and now they tightly secure the bracket at the wrong angle. You can fix that by drilling guide holes first. Also you’ll have to move them an inch or so because it’s more or less impossible to get a screw to go in differently than it did the first time in the same hole.</p>

<p>Now you’re finally ready to screw in the stair boards. If your screws are longer than 2”, you’ll need different ones, otherwise they will poke out the top of the board and stab you in the foot.</p>

<p>At every step and every level there’s an abundance of detail with material consequences.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to think ‘So what?’ and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they <strong>are</strong> specific to stair carpentry; that’s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is <em>not</em> specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.</p>

<p>You can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you’ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself ‘man, it was so simple all along, I don’t know why I had so much trouble’. We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.</p>

<p>If you’re a programmer, you might think that the fiddliness of programming is a special feature of programming, but really it’s that everything is fiddly, but you only notice the fiddliness when you’re new, and in programming you do new things more often.</p>

<p>You might think the fiddly detailiness of things is limited to human centric domains, and that physics itself is simple and elegant. That’s true in some sense – the physical laws themselves tend to be quite simple – but the manifestation of those laws is often complex and counterintuitive.</p>

<h2 id="ii-boiling-a-watched-pot">II. Boiling A Watched Pot</h2>

<p>Consider the boiling of water. That’s straightforward, water boils at 100 °C, right?</p>

<p>Well the stairs seemed simple too, so let’s double check.</p>

<p>Put yourself in the shoes of someone at the start of the 1800’s, with only a crude, unmarked mercury thermometer, trying to figure the physics of temperature.</p>

<p>Go to your stove, put some water in a pot, start heating some water, and pay attention as it heats.</p>

<p><em>(I suggest actually doing this)</em></p>

<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water’s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem ‘unboiling’. Then you’ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise. Is that Boiling? Sort of? It doesn’t really <em>look</em> like boiling. The bubble storms grow larger and start releasing bigger bubbles. Eventually the bubbles get big and the surface of the water grows turbulent as the bubbles begin to make it to the surface. Finally we seem to have reached real boiling. I guess this is the boiling point? That seems kind of weird, what were the things that happened earlier if not boiling.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, if you’d used a glass pot instead of a metal one, the water would boil at a higher temperature. If you cleaned the glass vessel with sulfuric acid, to remove any residue, you’d find that you can heat water substantially more before it boils and when it does boil it boils in little explosions of boiling and the temperature fluctuates unstably.</p>

<p>Worse still, if you trap a drop of water between two other liquids and heat it, you can raise the temperature to at least 300 °C with nothing happening. That kind of makes a mockery of the statement ‘water boils at 100 °C’.</p>

<p>It turns out that ‘boiling’ is a lot more complicated than you thought.</p>

<p>This surprising amount of detail is is not limited to “human” or “complicated” domains, it is a near universal property of everything from space travel to sewing, to your internal experience of your own mind.</p>

<h2 id="iii-invisible-vs-transparent-detail-and-getting-intellectually-stuck">III. Invisible vs. Transparent Detail And Getting Intellectually Stuck</h2>

<p>Again, you might think ‘So what? I guess things are complicated but I can just notice the details as I run into them; no need to think specifically about this’. And if you are doing things that are relatively simple, things that humanity has been doing for a long time, this is often true. But if you’re trying to do difficult things, things which are not known to be possible, it is not true.</p>

<p>The more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.</p>

<p>You might hope that these surprising details are irrelevant to your mission, but not so. Some of them will end up being key. Wood’s tendency to warp means it’s more accurate to trace a cut than to calculate its length and angle. The possibility of superheating liquids means it’s important to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_bed">packed bed</a> when boiling liquids in industrial processes lest your process be highly inefficient and unpredictable. The massive difference in weight between a rocket <em>full</em> of fuel and an empty one means that a reusable rocket can’t hover if it can’t throttle down to a very small fraction of its original thrust, which in turn means it must plan its trajectory very precisely to achieve 0 velocity at exactly the moment it reaches the ground.</p>

<table>
<caption>Some important details for colonizing the universe.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/colonizing-the-universe.png" alt="Some important details for colonizing the universe."></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>You might also hope that the important details will be obvious when you run into them, but not so. Such details aren’t <em>automatically</em> visible, even when you’re directly running up against them. Things can just seem messy and noisy instead. ‘Spirit’ thermometers, made using brandy and other liquors, were in common use in the early days of thermometry. They were even considered as a potential standard fluid for thermometers. It wasn’t until the careful work of Swiss physicist Jean-André De Luc in the 18th century that physicists realized that alcohol thermometers are highly nonlinear and highly variable depending on concentration, which is in turn hard to measure.</p>

<p>You’ve probably also had experiences where you were trying to do something and growing increasingly frustrated because it wasn’t working, and then finally, after some time you realize that your solution method can’t possibly work.</p>

<p>Another way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different people end up noticing <em>different</em> details. My brother and I once built a set of stairs for the garage with my dad, and we ran into the problem of determining where to cut the long boards so they lie at the correct angle. After struggling with the problem for a while (and I do mean struggling, a 16’ long board is heavy), we got to arguing. I remembered from trig that we could figure out angle so I wanted to go dig up my textbook and think about it. My dad said, ‘no, no, no, let’s just trace it’, insisting that we could figure out how to do it.</p>

<p>I kept arguing because I thought I was right. I felt really annoyed with him and he was annoyed with me. In retrospect, I think I saw the fundamental difficulty in what we were doing and I don’t think he appreciated it (look at the stairs picture and see if you can figure it out), he just heard ‘let’s draw some diagrams and compute the angle’ and didn’t think that was the solution, and if he had appreciated the thing that I saw I think he would have been more open to drawing some diagrams. But at the same time, he also understood that diagrams and math don’t account for the shape of the wood, which I did not appreciate. If we had been able to get these points across, we could have come to consensus. Drawing a diagram was probably a good idea, but computing the angle was probably not. Instead we stayed annoyed at each other for the next 3 hours.</p>

<p>Before you’ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It’s hard to put your attention on them because you don’t even know what you’re looking for. But <em>after</em> you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you’re good at?</p>

<p>This means it’s really easy to get <em>stuck</em>. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you <em>have</em> noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.</p>

<p>That’s why if you ask an anti-climate change person (or a climate scientist) “what could convince you you were wrong?” you’ll likely get back an answer like “if it turned out all the data on my side was faked” or some other extremely strong requirement for evidence rather than “I would start doubting if I noticed numerous important mistakes in the details my side’s data and my colleagues didn’t want to talk about it”. The second case is much more likely than the first, but you’ll never see it if you’re not paying close attention.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to do impossible things, this effect should <em>chill you to your bones</em>. It means you could be intellectually stuck right at this very moment, with the evidence right in front of your face and you just can’t see it.</p>

<p>This problem is not easy to fix, but it’s not impossible either. I’ve mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems <em>so wrong</em>, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn’t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn’t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.</p>

<p>If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.</p>

Together they let CICERO (1) model other players’ likely moves based on the current state of the board and the players’ conversation history, and (2) create and use a plan to control the language model that generates free-form dialogue.</p><p>To responsibly build upon CICERO’s capabilities, download the code, methods and models from our <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/diplomacy_cicero" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_2u_wL"><span><span>GitHub page</span></span></a>.</p></div></div><div><div tabindex="0" id="u_0_2v_0F"><video muted="1" height="360" width="640" preload="metadata" data-video-width="640" data-video-height="360" id="u_0_2y_bn"></video><p><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif" alt="" id="u_0_30_ze"></p><div><p>Etwas ist schiefgelaufen</p><p>Leider kann dieses Video nicht richtig abgespielt werden.</p></div></div><div><h2>The making of a breakthrough:<br>Strategic Reasoning + Natural Language</h2><p>Within CICERO is a language model integrated with strategic reasoning algorithms that control the generation of dialogue. Our advancements in <b>strategic reasoning</b> and <b>natural language processing</b> together enable effective cooperation with humans — by giving CICERO the ability to understand what other players are trying to achieve, negotiate a plan, suggest shared goals and communicate with strategic intent.</p><p>For more on the breakthrough, read our <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;link&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_35_uL"><span><span>paper</span></span></a> on Science.</p></div></div></div><div data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;section&quot;}"><h2>Inside the model</h2><h5>A closer look at controllable dialogue and strategic reasoning</h5><div><div><div data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;accordion-section&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;accordion-section&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;accordion-section&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;accordion-section&quot;}"><div id="u_0_36_oc"><p><h3>Strategy-grounded dialogue</h3></p><svg height="12" width="24" viewBox="0 0 24 12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="u_0_37_2k"><path d="M0.500002 1.08845C0.500002 0.81634 0.61471 0.544218 0.844135 0.326531C1.30299 -0.108843 2.01995 -0.108843 2.4788 0.326531L12 9.36055L21.5212 0.326531C21.98 -0.108843 22.697 -0.108843 23.1559 0.326531C23.6147 0.761905 23.6147 1.44218 23.1559 1.87755L12.8317 11.6735C12.3728 12.1088 11.6559 12.1088 11.197 11.6735L0.872816 1.87755C0.586033 1.65987 0.500002 1.36056 0.500002 1.08845Z"></path></svg></div><div id="u_0_38_Uv"><h4>Strategy-grounded dialogue</h4><p>The controllable dialogue model allows CICERO to ground conversations in a set of carefully chosen plans, often ones that are mutually beneficial for both CICERO and the other player.

Planning not only lets CICERO find opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation, but also helps it find effective moves when cooperation is not possible.</p><div tabindex="0" id="u_0_4d_vM"><video muted="1" height="360" width="640" preload="metadata" data-video-width="640" data-video-height="360" id="u_0_4g_G8"></video><p><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif" alt="" id="u_0_4j_Mh"></p><div><p>Etwas ist schiefgelaufen</p><p>Leider kann dieses Video nicht richtig abgespielt werden.</p></div></div><p><span>AI at Meta researchers Noam Brown and Anton Bakhtin explain CICERO’s<br> use of strategic reasoning and natural language in Diplomacy gameplay.</span></p></div></div><div><p><h5>For more on the model, visit our blog.</h5></p><p><h5>For more on the model, visit our blog.</h5></p><a role="button" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;button&quot;}" id="u_0_4o_nz"><p><span>Blog</span></p></a></div></div></div><div data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;section&quot;}"><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/309862307_932269884396149_7601704039405860285_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=okIj6b8VwJMAX-LBrIO&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDL3AfbZZ8Yx6Wf1GWlP8HF_mm8O3nlyhHGzKMMUTDS1Q&amp;oe=657B5E4E" alt=""></p><div data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;section&quot;}"><div><h4>Innovations</h4><div><p><h2>What makes CICERO’s dialogue so human</h2></p><p>In Diplomacy, seven players use dialogue to coordinate their actions as they cooperatively compete with each other, resulting in intricate negotiations in natural language.</p></div><div><p><h2>What makes CICERO’s dialogue so human</h2></p><p>In Diplomacy, seven players use dialogue to coordinate their actions as they cooperatively compete with each other, resulting in intricate negotiations in natural language.</p></div></div><div><div><div><p><h5 id="u_0_4p_ed"><span>Cooperate</span></h5><h5 id="u_0_4q_YI"><span>Negotiate</span></h5><h5 id="u_0_4r_yX"><span>Coordinate</span></h5></p></div><div><div id="u_0_4s_s/"><p><span>In the game’s second turn, CICERO (as Austria) and Italy have started with fairly neutral opening moves, while Turkey has made a somewhat aggressive move toward Russia. CICERO and Turkey could work together to attack Russia, or CICERO could make an alliance with Russia against Turkey instead.</span></p><p><span>Italy comes to CICERO for advice: should he join Austria in attacking Turkey with Russia’s help? Or should Italy move west to attack France, while CICERO works with Turkey to battle Russia?</span></p><p><span>CICERO suggests that either move is possible, but the current circumstances create an opportunity for Italy to move decisively against Turkey. With this move, Turkey would get trapped on all sides due to a move called the “lepanto” which would involve Italy convoying an army into Turkish territories.</span></p><p><span>This is great for CICERO, because it commits Italy into a clear partnership from which both stand to gain. It would also hopefully keep Italy from being tempted to attack CICERO instead.</span></p></div><div id="u_0_4t_Ee"><p><span>France and CICERO (as Germany) have been at war, but France is starting to get pressured by Italy on their southern border. France comes to CICERO asking for a deal to negotiate peace so that they can turn their focus the other way.</span></p><p><span>CICERO proposes a path forward: France needs to surrender a stolen territory (Munich) while agreeing not to attack the weakly defended Holland. England has almost fallen to pressure from the two of them, so France agrees on one condition — that it can have the supply centers at Liverpool and London, while CICERO can take the one in Edinburgh. CICERO agrees to the counter-offer and France commits to the agreement.</span></p></div><div id="u_0_4u_TU"><p><span>CICERO (as Austria) had convinced Italy to work with it against Turkey. Those plans were interrupted by France building units that could be used to attack Italy, causing Italy to form a defensive line against France, instead of making an offensive move east against Turkey. Fortunately for Italy, France did not advance those units, so now it’s time to organize the march east.</span></p><p><span>CICERO first suggests moving from Venice to Piedmont to help keep France at bay if they decide to attack this turn, despite last turn’s neutrality. This move would also keep Austrian territories safer since the Italian army in Venice could move directly into an Austrian center in Trieste.</span></p><p><span>Then, Italy suggests a move that would help CICERO move against Turkey but would potentially make CICERO more vulnerable if Italy decided to turn on CICERO. CICERO instead asks Italy to make a move that commits Italy more deeply to the alliance while also keeping Austrian territories less exposed to Italian units. To CICERO’s benefit, Italy agrees.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div id="u_0_4v_Mo"><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/312021767_845517533298583_3658367999041885691_n.png?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=icxBgSwfAF4AX_6jIOU&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDMWmDnNx4GK5i2XOMcxCkpbZ2SBV7E1uJohoJZdcCuNw&amp;oe=657B6B3A" alt=""></p><h4> CICERO AS AUSTRIA </h4></div><div><div id="u_0_4w_KX"><p><b>Italy:</b> What are you thinking longterm?

Ubisoft says it was trying to put an ad for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> in the main menu of other <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games. However, a “technical error” caused the promotion to show up on in-game menus instead. Ubisoft says the issue has since been fixed.</p><p>We recently saw Microsoft use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23945174/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-pop-up-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-xbox-consoles">fullscreen Xbox pop-up ads</a> to promote its own games, and they’ve been annoying Xbox owners. Microsoft’s ads only appear when you boot an Xbox, and not everyone seems to be getting them. Microsoft and Ubisoft’s pop-ups are still very different to the ads we’re used to seeing on game consoles. We’ve seen games like <em>Saints Row 2 </em>with ads running on billboards, or plenty of in-game ads in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-signs-up-for-more-in-game-ads/1100-6175614/">EA Games</a> titles in the mid-to-late 2000s. </p><p>Fullscreen pop-up ads in the middle of a game certainly aren’t common. Imagine a world full of games you’ve paid $70 for and then ads popping up in the middle of gameplay. I truly hope that Ubisoft’s “technical error” never becomes a game industry reality.</p><p><em><strong>Update November 24th, 1:01PM ET: </strong>Added an explanation from Ubisoft.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">In The Box</h2>
<p dir="auto">Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit machine into a working mail server by installing and configuring various components.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is a one-click email appliance. There are no user-configurable setup options. It "just works."</p>
<p dir="auto">The components installed are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>SMTP (<a href="http://www.postfix.org/" rel="nofollow">postfix</a>), IMAP (<a href="http://dovecot.org/" rel="nofollow">Dovecot</a>), CardDAV/CalDAV (<a href="https://nextcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">Nextcloud</a>), and Exchange ActiveSync (<a href="http://z-push.org/" rel="nofollow">z-push</a>) servers</li>
<li>Webmail (<a href="http://roundcube.net/" rel="nofollow">Roundcube</a>), mail filter rules (thanks to Roundcube and Dovecot), and email client autoconfig settings (served by <a href="http://nginx.org/" rel="nofollow">nginx</a>)</li>
<li>Spam filtering (<a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">spamassassin</a>) and greylisting (<a href="http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/" rel="nofollow">postgrey</a>)</li>
<li>DNS (<a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/" rel="nofollow">nsd4</a>) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework" rel="nofollow">SPF</a>, DKIM (<a href="http://www.opendkim.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenDKIM</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC" rel="nofollow">DMARC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC" rel="nofollow">DNSSEC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities" rel="nofollow">DANE TLSA</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" rel="nofollow">MTA-STS</a>, and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255" rel="nofollow">SSHFP</a> policy records automatically set</li>
<li>TLS certificates are automatically provisioned using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="nofollow">Let's Encrypt</a> for protecting https and all of the other services on the box</li>
<li>Backups (<a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/" rel="nofollow">duplicity</a>), firewall (<a href="https://launchpad.net/ufw" rel="nofollow">ufw</a>), intrusion protection (<a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">fail2ban</a>), and basic system monitoring (<a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/" rel="nofollow">munin</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It also includes system management tools:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Comprehensive health monitoring that checks each day that services are running, ports are open, TLS certificates are valid, and DNS records are correct</li>
<li>A control panel for adding/removing mail users, aliases, custom DNS records, configuring backups, etc.</li>
<li>An API for all of the actions on the control panel</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Internationalized domain names are supported and configured easily (but SMTPUTF8 is not supported, unfortunately).</p>
<p dir="auto">It also supports static website hosting since the box is serving HTTPS anyway. (To serve a website for your domains elsewhere, just add a custom DNS "A" record in you Mail-in-a-Box's control panel to point domains to another server.)</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information on how Mail-in-a-Box handles your privacy, see the <a href="https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/blob/main/security.md">security details page</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://mailinabox.email/guide.html" rel="nofollow">setup guide</a> for detailed, user-friendly instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">For experts, start with a completely fresh (really, I mean it) Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit machine. On the machine...</p>
<p dir="auto">Clone this repository and checkout the tag corresponding to the most recent release:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ git clone https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox
$ cd mailinabox
$ git checkout v65"><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox
$ cd mailinabox
$ git checkout v65
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Begin the installation.</p>

<p dir="auto">The installation will install, uninstall, and configure packages to turn the machine into a working, good mail server.</p>
<p dir="auto">For help, DO NOT contact Josh directly --- I don't do tech support by email or tweet (no exceptions).</p>
<p dir="auto">Post your question on the <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/" rel="nofollow">discussion forum</a> instead, where maintainers and Mail-in-a-Box users may be able to help you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that while we want everything to "just work," we can't control the rest of the Internet. Other mail services might block or spam-filter email sent from your Mail-in-a-Box.
This is a challenge faced by everyone who runs their own mail server, with or without Mail-in-a-Box. See our discussion forum for tips about that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="canvas">
  <p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/278103/eIDAS-4th-column-extract.pdf">final
  text</a> of the update to the eIDAS regulation (establishing a
  framework for a European Digital Identity) has been agreed upon. In a
  last minute effort to improve the text, <a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/">we wrote an open letter</a>
  criticising the proposal on weakening the security of the web, and
  providing too few safeguards protecting users of the proposed European
  Identity Wallet. Were we successful?</p>
  <p>Looking at the text, it is clear this is a compromise (and an
  amendment to an existing regulation). In particular the structure is a
  mess, with new articles introducing the identity wallet running as far
  as four levels deep. This is a tough read. (Also, someone at the
  Commission needs to carefully cross-check all references because
  e.g.&nbsp;Article 45a-1.4 refers to Article 17(3)(c) that appears to no
  longer to exist.) I guess that’s life when regulating a hotly
  contested topic.</p>
  <p>Let’s study the two topics we addressed in our open letter: web
  security, and wallet privacy.</p>
  <h2 id="weakening-the-security-of-the-web">Weakening the security of
  the web</h2>
  <p>We were concerned about the phrasing of Article 45, that lays down
  a requirement for browsers to recognise any certificate that satisfies
  some criteria specified in an annex to the regulation, <em>without any
  other requirements to be imposed by the browsers</em>. We were
  especially concerned that browsers were prevented from running
  additional security checks when such certificates were being used to
  authenticate a website, depending on how you would read Article
  45a.</p>
  <p>Why would this be a problem?</p>
  <p>For a browser to ‘recognise’ a certificate means that the issuer of
  the certificate (the party that signs the contents of the certificate)
  is added to the trusted root list of a browser. When a browser visits
  a website, it asks the website to provide a valid certificate
  (i.e.&nbsp;one signed by <em>any</em> of the issuers in its trusted root
  list). The certificate contains the domain name of the website (which
  the browsers checks against the domain name in the link for the
  website it is visiting) and a public key for that domain. The issuer
  has verified that the public key indeed belongs to that website. And
  the browser verifies the signature on the certificate it just received
  to ensure correctness of this information. It then challenges the
  website to prove it knows the private key corresponding to the public
  key found in the certificate, while at the same time establishing a
  session key to encrypt the communication between the browser and the
  website.</p>
  <p>This complex protocol proves authenticity of the website and
  guarantees confidentiality of the communication between the browser
  and the website, <strong>provided that all issuers in the trusted root
  list refrain from issuing rogue certificates that link the wrong
  public key to a website domain</strong>. If not, a malicious entity
  (say a law enforcement agency in a member state) could mount a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle
  attack</a> pretending to be the actual website at domain
  <code>suspicious-forum.net</code> by sending a rogue certificate for
  that domain (that it forced one of the issuers in the member state to
  sign), thus getting hold of the encryption key used to protect the
  communication, and thus being able to eavesdrop on that communication.
  This would break the end-to-end encryption guarantee for websites, and
  would allow law enforcement to surreptitiously surveil visitors of
  websites.</p>
  <p>Security mechanisms currently implemented in browsers (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency">certificate
  transparency</a>) would detect and prevent such an abuse - but
  browsers might not be allowed to act upon it depending on how you
  would read Article 45 and 45a.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, Article 45 itself has not changed since we published
  our letter. However, the following was added to Recital 32:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The obligation of recognition, interoperability and support of
  QWACs is not to affect the freedom of web-browser providers to ensure
  web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic
  in the manner and with the technology they consider most
  appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This still means that browsers have to unilaterally recognise
  certificates that satisfy the requirement specified in the annex to
  the regulation, which could be much weaker than those typically
  imposed ex ante by browsers. In practice this means that issuers of
  such certificates have to be added to the trusted root list in the
  browser, creating a less secure PKI for the web.</p>
  <p>But given the changes to recital 32 I am much less worried about
  the actual risk of breaking the end-to-end encryption for websites by
  e.g.&nbsp;law enforcement. In particular, with the text added to recital
  32, I believe that Article 45a.2</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>By way of derogation to paragraph 1 and only in case of
  substantiated concerns related to breaches of security or loss of
  integrity of an identified certificate or set of certificates,
  web-browsers may take precautionary measures in relation to that
  certificate or set of certificates.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>allows browsers to continue to use the security mechanism (like
  certificate transparency) to detect and prevent such attacks to
  end-to-end encryption, by refusing to accept such a rogue
  certificate.</p>
  <p>Moreover, article 45a.3 requires the browser (vendor) to notify the
  competent supervisory authority in the member state <em>and</em> the
  Commission of such attacks taking place. Even though article 45a.4
  puts the sole authority to investigate and decide on the final
  withdrawal of such a certificate on the competent authority (of the
  member state whose law enforcement agency in the example above
  initiated the wilful subversion of the end-to-end encryption of the
  web), I simply cannot believe that any competent authority could claim
  there is nothing wrong and that the certificate should be reinstated:
  they would be very clearly and publicly be caught red-handed in
  subverting global web security.</p>
  <h2 id="privacy-of-the-wallet">Privacy of the wallet</h2>
  <p>Regarding the identity wallet, we were concerned about the lack of
  privacy guarantees when using it to reveal certain non-identifying
  attributes (like age) to service providers. In particular, we were
  worried that users would not be sufficiently protected against service
  providers asking for more information than necessary for offering
  their service (i.e.&nbsp;<em>over-authentication</em>). Also, we were
  worried that the use of the wallet and the use of the attribute
  certificates contained in it could be ‘linkable’, i.e.&nbsp;that visits by
  a particular user to different websites could be linked (by the issuer
  or the websites).</p>
  <p>It appears that our concerns have been addressed, somewhat.</p>
  <p>Regarding the risk of <em>over-authentication</em>, I am quite
  happy to see that the registration process of relying parties has been
  strengthened.</p>
  <p>Article 6a.4.(ba) requires that “the identity of relying parties
  can be validated by implementing authentication mechanisms in
  accordance with Article 6b”. Moreover, the attributes relying parties
  are allowed to request from wallet users must be specified upfront and
  be made “available online in electronically signed or sealed form
  suitable for automated processing” (Article 6b.1e). Wallets shall use
  this information to “implement the appropriate mechanism to inform
  that the requesting relying party or the requesting user of European
  Digital Identity Wallets have the permission to access [these
  attributes]” (Article 6a.4.(ca).</p>
  <p>Together these provide some technically enforced mechanism to
  prevent ‘over-authentication’ by relying parties.</p>
  <p>The situation regarding unlinkability is less clear. Article
  6a.4.(a).(4e) says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>European Digital Identity Wallets shall, in particular support
  common protocols and interfaces for relying parties to verify the
  authenticity and validity of European Digital Identity Wallets</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>and Article 6a.5.5a says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Member States shall provide means to revoke the validity of [a
  specific] European Digital Identity Wallet</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both requirements seem to imply that the validity of specific
  wallets can individually be checked by relying parties, which is hard
  (though not impossible, see below) to align with any unlinkability
  requirement.</p>
  <p>Article 6a.7b.(a) on the other hand says that</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The technical framework of the European Digital Identity Wallet
  shall not allow providers of electronic attestations of attributes or
  any other party, after the issuance of the attestation of attributes,
  to obtain data that allows for tracking, linking, correlating or
  otherwise obtain knowledge of transactions or user behaviour unless
  explicitly authorised by the user.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that the most recent public version (i.e.&nbsp;version
  1.0) of the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) only allows the use
  of standardised ‘boring’ cryptographic primitives that do not allow
  the implementation of truly multi-show unlinkable attribute
  certificates (ABCs). As far as I understand, wallets work around this
  by requiring issuers to issue several one-time use certificates in one
  go. Users can use each of these only once and then throw them away.
  Clearly, this reveals the number of times you reveal a particular
  attribute to the issuer because you need to request new ones once your
  current stack in the wallet is empty. Also, issuers and relying
  parties can collude to track the use of such traditional certificates
  and link them back to you, which seems to contradict the language in
  6a.7b.(a) “shall not allow…”.</p>
  <p>Now this might all very well mean that the ARF needs to be updated
  to actually include cryptographic primitives that allow multi-show
  ABCs to be implemented. If that’s the case: hurray! To satisfy the
  requirement to verify the authenticity of wallets and to revoke
  specific wallets, so-called blacklistable credentials could be used.
  In any case, protocols to <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/epoch-revocation-journal.pdf">revoke
  ABCs in a privacy friendly fashion</a> exist.</p>

<p>While benchmarking open-source models, we have observed a disparity between the
results generated by our pipeline and those reported in public sources (e.g.
OpenCompass). Upon conducting a more in-depth investigation of this difference,
we have discovered that various models may employ different prompts,
post-processing strategies, and sampling techniques, potentially resulting in
significant variations in the outcomes. Our prompt and post-processing strategy
remains consistent with the original benchmark, and greedy decoding is employed
during evaluation without any post-processing for the generated content. For
scores that were not reported by the original authors (including scores reported
with different settings), we try to get results with our pipeline.</p>
<p>To evaluate the model's capability extensively, we adopted the methodology
outlined in Llama2. Specifically, we included PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande,
ARC, OBQA, and CSQA to assess common sense reasoning. SquAD, QuAC, and BoolQ
were incorporated to evaluate reading comprehension. CSQA was exclusively tested
using a 7-shot setup, while all other tests were conducted with a 0-shot
configuration. Additionally, we introduced GSM8K (8-shot@1), MATH (4-shot@1),
HumanEval (0-shot@1), and MBPP (3-shot@1) under the category "Math &amp; Code". Due
to technical constraints, we did not test Falcon-180 on QuAC and OBQA; the score
is derived by averaging the scores on the remaining tasks. Since the scores for
these two tasks are generally lower than the average, we believe that
Falcon-180B's performance was not underestimated.</p>

<p>We evaluated various benchmarks using both zero-shot and few-shot methods, except for TruthfulQA. Generally, the zero-shot approach is more common in chat models. Our evaluation strategy involves generating responses while following instructions explicitly or implicitly (such as using few-shot examples). We then isolate relevant answers from the generated text. Some models are not well-suited to produce output in the specific format required by instructions in few datasets, which leads to suboptimal results. </p>

<p>We also provide both 4-bit (AWQ) and 8-bit (GPTQ) quantized Yi chat models. Evaluation results on various benchmarks have shown that the quantized models have negligible losses. Additionally, they reduce the memory footprint size. After testing different configurations of prompts and generation lengths, we highly recommend following the guidelines in the memory footprint table below when selecting a device to run our models.</p>

		Limitations of Chat Model
	</span>
</h3>
<p>The released chat model has undergone exclusive training using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Compared to other standard chat models, our model produces more diverse responses, making it suitable for various downstream tasks, such as creative scenarios. Furthermore, this diversity is expected to enhance the likelihood of generating higher quality responses, which will be advantageous for subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.</p>
<p>However, this higher diversity might amplify certain existing issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hallucination</strong>: This refers to the model generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information. With the model's responses being more varied, there's a higher chance of hallucination that are not based on accurate data or logical reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>Non-determinism in re-generation</strong>: When attempting to regenerate or sample responses, inconsistencies in the outcomes may occur. The increased diversity can lead to varying results even under similar input conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Error</strong>: This occurs when errors in the model's responses compound over time. As the model generates more diverse responses, the likelihood of small inaccuracies building up into larger errors increases, especially in complex tasks like extended reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve more coherent and consistent responses, it is advisable to adjust generation configuration parameters such as<code>temperature</code>,<code>top_p</code>, or<code>top_k</code>. These adjustments can help in the balance between creativity and coherence in the model's outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Generation</strong>: There's a place where time stands still. A place of breath taking wonder, but also of great danger. A place where the very air you breathe could kill you. A place where the only way to survive is to be prepared.
The place is called the Arctic.
The Arctic is a vast, frozen wilderness. It is a place of extremes. The temperatures can drop to -40 degrees Celsius. The winds can reach speeds of 100 kilometers per hour. The sun can shine for 24 hours a day, or not at all for weeks on end.
The Arctic is also a place of great beauty. The ice and snow are a pristine white. The sky is a deep blue. The sunsets are spectacular.
But the Arctic is also a place of great danger. The ice can be treacherous. The winds can be deadly. The sun can be blinding.

we've rolled out.</p><p><img alt="Pablo at Elixir NYC" src="https://engineering.ramp.com/images/pablo_elixir_nyc.5cd00a4b.jpg"></p><p>Me at ElixirNYC; one of the last things I did before lockdown.</p><h4>The magic of BEAM and OTP…</h4><p>Most "Why Elixir" posts go on to describe the features of <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/elixir-on-erlang-vm-demystified-320557d09e1f" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BEAM and the OTP</a>
(Erlang's virtual machine and a library of abstractions for reliable, concurrent
systems, respectively). And for good reason! Whether you're in Erlang or Elixir,
the built-in resources for complex, distributed, high-reliability systems are
unique compared to most programming environments and extremely valuable. <a href="https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/pablo-meier-a-fresh-look-on-failure" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I
spoke at length about them at Deconstruct 2018</a>. I'll also bullet
out some points here, with links to deeper dives if you're curious:</p><ul><li><p>Fantastic support for concurrency and parallelism that's designed to avoid
system failure. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The soul of Erlang and Elixir</a> by Saša Jurić. Ask
yourself as you watch "How would I implement a system with these properties in
Ruby, Node, Python, or Java?"</p></li><li><p>Correctness guarantees for partial failures and transient errors (see <a href="https://ferd.ca/it-s-about-the-guarantees.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's
About Guarantees</a> by Fred Hebert). Transient errors are extremely common
and most environments don't have a great mechanism for handling them.</p></li><li><p>Efficient string construction, especially useful in template rendering
(<a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/elixir-ram-and-the-template-of-doom.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elixir RAM and the Template of Doom</a> by Evan Miller).</p></li></ul><p>Succinctly, BEAM is a battle-tested VM for resilient, concurrent applications,
and OTP builds abstractions over it that are hard to find in other environments.
<strong>These have done more to change how I think about programming systems than
anything else I've encountered since graduating, and I miss these features in
every other environment I've worked on since.</strong></p><p><img alt="A necromancer labeled &quot;Erlang,&quot; standing over an army of dead, saying &quot;Destroy
one of my processes and I will only grow stronger&quot;" src="https://engineering.ramp.com/images/PPerlang.8e1d8d64.png"></p><h4>…with a great, modern developer experience</h4><p>So move it all to Erlang? Not quite. Even with the magic of OTP/BEAM, Erlang can
be challenging to adopt. Amazing work has been done to improve this, from
software like <a href="https://rebar3.readme.io/docs/getting-started" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebar3</a> to documentation like <a href="https://adoptingerlang.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adopting Erlang</a>. While I
highly recommend everyone give Erlang a try, many of the conveniences of Elixir
made it easier to choose for a high-growth company setting.</p><p>First, the syntax is more familiar for programmers from other environments
(here's an example of <a href="https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Create_an_HTML_table#Erlang" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erlang</a> compared to <a href="https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Create_an_HTML_table#Elixir" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elixir</a>). Syntax isn't
personally interesting for me, and I happen to find Erlang beautiful, but I'd be
in denial if I pretended I didn't observe a meaningful negative reaction from
others when I tried introducing them to Erlang.</p><p>Second, tools follow a stricter set of conventions, often with very
human-friendly ergonomics. Some examples:</p><ul><li><p><code>mix test</code> on a generated <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix</a> project will structure tests for
concurrency by default with a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database sandboxing environment</a> such
that it's harder to design a test suite whose runtime will grow
superlinearly over time. Did you only want to run tests that failed?
There's <code>mix test --failed</code>! There's also <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1363791170745348097" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a way to run only on <code>stdin</code> if
you want to work on updated tests.</a></p></li><li><p>There's also <code>iex</code>, the Elixir REPL. With the BEAM's hot code reloading,
when you open a REPL, you can reload the module you're working on with <code>r MyModule</code> after a change, so you can use a REPL without having to close and
open it on a regular basis. Both of these allow rapid test execution and
rapid prototyping/turnaround.</p></li><li><p>Many of the tools have friendlier error messages. I ran into an issue with
Ecto one time <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56430391/196469" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and the creator of Elixir answered my question on
StackOverflow, while also pushing a commit to clarify the error message in
the library.</a></p></li><li><p>Documentation culture: Elixir libraries tend to have amazing documentation,
evidenced by tools like <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/docs-tests-and-with.html#doctests" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doctests</a> that will run the snippets in your
docs to ensure your examples match with reality. Additionally,
<a href="https://pragprog.com/categories/elixir-phoenix-and-otp/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PragProg</a> offers a ton of great books that I've personally enjoyed.</p></li></ul><p>Finally (and this deserves a post of its own), consider the ergonomics afforded
by having tools like <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a macro system</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/sigils.html" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sigils.</a> Macros are highly
romanticized, and there's much justified danger of using them too freely when a
function will do; with that said, the flexibility can be used to great effect:
much of Pheonix, Ecto, and ExUnit's more declarative constructs come from the
use of these.</p><p><img alt="A sweet, Sailor Moon-ey cute anime girl magician saying &quot;I draw Eldritch Power from all my process-chans!&quot;" src="https://engineering.ramp.com/images/PPelixir.10a2c218.png"></p><p>(source same as above. Also note that all the points 👆 aren't just beneficial in contrast to Erlang, but stand strong next to any other programming ecosystem)</p><h4>Dynamic types, while avoiding the pitfalls</h4><p>I'll make a special mention for two specific features I miss most in
environments like Python, Node, or Ruby: <em>immutability</em> and <em>module structure
with aliased calls.</em> My hot take about most dynamic languages is that they are a
poor fit for startups who have intentions of being long-term businesses: you've
created an environment that's optimized for your founding engineers to build
something quickly in the first 7 months, but the price is a set of recurring
obstacles which your engineers will pay down over the next 7 years. That
microframework where all 4 of your engineers kept the first 10k
LOC in their heads starts to be much harder to work with when you hit with 40
engineers and 400k LOC (and beyond! oh, and you have customers now, too).</p><p>Obviously companies have gone on to great success on all kinds of technologies,
and getting to product-market fit matters a lot more than optimizing for life
after it; but I don't think it should be controversial to say <em>when
trying to understand or modify large systems, it helps to have invariants</em>, and
most dynamic languages don't give you many. Elixir's immutability shines here.
Consider the following lines of Elixir:</p><pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Widgets</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>

</span>
<span></span><span># def _dependencies_for(signal):</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># def _applicable_to(signal_deps, widet):</span></code></pre><p>Pay attention to what you know <em>isn't</em> happening in the Elixir example:</p><ul><li><p>You know <code>conn</code> and <code>w</code> <em>will not change</em> in the call to <code>find_abbreviation</code>.
In most environments, you don't know if your structures will mutate outside of
where you can see them, so you're not sure to what degree you can count on
them further in the execution. In an immutable language, you can trust the
data is the same for the whole function body while reading it.</p></li><li><p>We didn't <code>import</code> WidgetConnection, we <code>alias</code>-ed it, meaning we merely added
some syntactic sugar to a fully qualified function call. This, combined with
the restriction that Elixir modules can't contain code that executes at the
toplevel, means we don't have to worry about circular imports: In
Elixir, both modules can <code>alias</code> each other, but in Python, you can't have
both <code>import</code> each other's definitions.</p></li></ul><p>So as the Elixir app grows and grows, an entire class of uncertainty over "what
is this code in front of me doing" goes away, because there's a ton of dangerous
behavior you know it's <em>not</em> doing. You're not home free! Function calls to
other modules could still call the network, or write to the DB, or delete files.
But you're certain it's not changing the variables you are looking at, and you
don't need to keep a universe of state changes in your head to understand what
the code is doing.</p><p>Additionally, "make that module's code visible to this code" has a rash of
problems we avoid as well. This can get complicated! <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/the-great-python-refactor-of-2017-and-also-2018/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy once spent 2
months moving files around</a>, and <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/python-at-scale-strict-modules-c0bb9245c834" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Engineering explicitly talks
about wanting some of these contraints</a> in Python's module system. <a href="https://dropbox.tech/application/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's
Dropbox Engineering describing "the tangle,"</a> on how Python's module loading
complicated their type checker, since module dependencies can become impossible
to tease out at scale. Using <code>alias</code> means not having to worry about a
dependency tree in the definitions stage.</p><p>This is not to pick on Python in particular; just again to highlight a strength
in a core design choice of Erlang and Elixir that made it appealing to me as a
developer who's been burnt on large codebases in other languages.</p><p><img alt="reverentgeek graphic of Joe Armstrong, with a quote of his: &quot;Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90% of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast.

Also, one thing the other languages do better than Erlang/Elixir? Bolted-on type checkers. <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mypy</a> or <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> or <a href="https://sorbet.org/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorbet</a> have a lot of great qualities missing in the humble <a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/dialyzer" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dialyzer.</a></p><h4>Augmenting, but choice of tech is only part of it</h4><p>Ramp uses Elixir for a few specific, critical services: our real-time
Authorization engine (which requires extremely high uptime) and our Risk
analysis platform (requiring strong concurrency and data pipeline
ingestion). That said, it isn't what powers most of our business: our largest
service is in Python, and our frontend is in TypeScript with React. When
looking at how one can best work towards engineering success, rather than
specific tech, I think it's more important to ask:</p><ul><li><p>Is your team <a href="https://increment.com/teams/the-epistemology-of-software-quality/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting enough sleep, and avoiding high-stress conditions?</a>
A little opt-in hustle is fine, but <strong>do not crunch</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Do you trust your teammates to support <em>and</em> challenge you? Nasty
conflict may be a sign of bad team dynamics, but <a href="https://blog.capterra.com/strong-teams-why-conflict-is-essential-for-true-commitment/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lack of healthy conflict is
also an anti-pattern</a>, signaling low investment or trust.</p></li><li><p>Can you assign your team tasks that you trust and empower them <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/how-to-make-employees-feel-like-they-own-their-work" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to own?</a></p></li><li><p>Do your team members <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel psychologically safe to participate, to innovate,
and to invest?</a></p></li></ul><p>Clearly, <em>I love what Elixir allows me to do.</em> But I'll gleefully invest money
and time with a company honoring the above properties over any technical choice
they make. When I joined Ramp, there was a clear preference for Python: the
founders previously built and scaled <a href="https://paribus.co/" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paribus</a> on it, and brought a lot of
expertise with them. And not for nothing: Python can be an absolute joy to use ❤️
So our largest backend codebase is written in Python, and it's where most of our
developers spend their time.</p><p>But in service of the points above: our CTO asked me to design our
real-time, high-uptime Authorization service, he created an environment where I
felt safe enough to propose a different tech stack, and gave me the authority
and ownership to move forward on it. It's been exceptionally stable, flexible
enough to allow for rapid feature development, and it's some of the code I'm
most proud of in my life. Good tech doesn't merely coexist with good team
culture and management, it depends on it, so as much fun as I have fun with tech
talk like this post, it definitely has a ceiling on its utility when building a
business.</p><p>I hope I've piqued your interest in trying Elixir if you weren't considering it
before 😄 Also (and you knew it was coming), <a href="https://ramp.com/careers" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>please reach out if you're

    <blockquote>
  <p>This is a part of a blog post series about “useless” (or: controversial) syntax elements that emerged in recent Ruby version. The goal of the series is not to defend (or criticize) the features, but to share a “thought framework” for analysis of their reasons, design, and effect the new syntax has on a code that uses it. See also <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-02-syntax-sugar.html">intro/ToC post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s post covers the feature that, unlike most of the others in the series, caused very little pushback: a set of shortcuts for <strong>argument forwarding</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">Ruby 2.7</a>, this is possible (please note that <code>...</code> in the code below is the exact valid syntax, not “code omitted for a blog post”):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># bar receives all positional, named and block arguments</span>
  <span># that foo received</span>
  <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument">Ruby 3.1</a>, an anonymous block argument can be “forwarded” separately:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>iterate_through_data</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span>
  <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>each</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements">Ruby 3.2</a>, one can also “forward” positional and named (keyword) arguments separately:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>split_arguments</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>pass_positional</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span># passes all positional arguments</span>
  <span>pass_keywords</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span> <span># passes all keyword arguments</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>split_arguments</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a: </span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span># after this call, those methods would be called:</span>
<span>#   pass_positional(1, 2, 3)</span>
<span>#   pass_keywords(a: 4, b: 5)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="why--how">Why &amp; How</h2>

<p>…are inseparable here!</p>

<p>The introduction of <code>...</code> was not something discussed for years (at least, I am unaware of such discussions). It was rather an impromptu invention on the wave of the Big Changes in Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 was the last preparatory version before 3.0, and it introduced some of the “big oh” changes so everybody had time to prepare. One of such changes was a <em>final separation</em> of positional and keyword arguments: making some rules of treating arguments stricter and less cumbersome than they historically were.</p>

<p>This is a complicated topic, well covered by the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/">official explanation</a>. In the context of the shorthand invention, we need to know that one of the side effects of the separation was that writing a method that just passes all of its arguments to another method became complicated. The pre-2.7 way of doing so was this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>:)</span>
  <span># does some reading</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
  <span># does some writing</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span># a typical wrapper method, which might, say, log execution,</span>
  <span># catch extra errors, do a more complicated dispatching and so on.</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>:reader</span><span>,</span> <span>"file.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>mode: </span><span>'wb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>:writer</span><span>,</span> <span>"file.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>'some content'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>*args</code> in the method signature and the method call was enough to pass all positional and keyword arguments around. In Ruby 2.7, the separation would become more formal<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, so to handle every kind of method, one needed to write:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a generic situation, the third type of the argument should’ve been considered: a block (Ruby’s special “tail lambda”). So for a truly universal delegator, one needed to write this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>block</span><span>)</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>block</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s a whole lot of syntax <em>and</em> naming to do a thing that is so simple by its idea!</p>

<p>So the practical solution for a shortcut “just pass whatever arguments you have” was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16253">proposed</a> and quickly accepted in the form of <code>...</code>.</p>

<p>A few technicalities and edge cases were discussed and settled, some immediately, some in the next version. Say, <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.0.html#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments">support for passing a leading argument before forwarding syntax</a> was introduced in 3.0 but considered so useful it was then backported to the 2.7 branch and has been available there since around 2.7.3.</p>

<p>It was kind of a big deal because “delegate everything” is a very widespread phraseology in Ruby, used for all kinds of effects:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># hide the real call sequence complexity:</span>
<span>def</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:,</span> <span>**</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Loggers</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>:http_logger</span><span>).</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>level: </span><span>level</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># dynamically choose an implementation</span>
<span>def</span> <span>make_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EVENT_CLASSES</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>].</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># make a nice DSL with dynamically defined methods:</span>
<span>class</span> <span>HTML</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>method_missing</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>attributes</span><span>)</span>
    <span># construct tag string from tag name, content and attrs</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>HTML</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(</span><span>'Ruby'</span><span>,</span> <span>href: </span><span>'https://ruby-lang.org'</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; "&lt;a href='https://ruby-lang.org'&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of those cases can be made much shorter with <code>...</code>, without losing the <em>real</em> meaning of “just pass everything”!</p>

<p>This syntax change was a rare case when many groups with frequently conflicting views directly saw an immediate gain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who are usually curious about syntax changes and shortcuts found it pretty;</li>
  <li>those more cautious and frequently asking “what’s the use case”, in this case, immediately knew plenty of them (especially considering that after ruby 2.7, a lot of delegating code should’ve been rewritten anyway, either to <code>...</code> or to <code>*args, **kwargs</code>, so making peace with a shortcut seemed acceptable);</li>
  <li>finally, those with an emphasis on language as a pragmatic engineering tool saw a gain of the improved performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter has a simple explanation: what you don’t name, you don’t need to put in the object. E.g., this allocates an intermediate array and hash to put positional and keyword arguments into:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegator</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
  <span># `args` is Array, and `kwargs` is Hash here</span>
  <span># ...but we needed them only to immediately unpack</span>
  <span>delegatee</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While this code doesn’t make additional local variables available, and therefore no need to allocate an array/hash:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegator</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># no extra local vars here</span>
  <span>delegatee</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, it wasn’t a surprise or a scandal when, a couple of versions later, separate shortcuts to pass only positional and only keyword args were proposed.</p>

<p>Moreover, the change was small; those signatures were already valid syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>ignore_my_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>ignore_keyword_args</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>positional</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…to say, “the method accepts any numbers of positional or keyword args (maybe for compatibility with the same method in neighbor classes), but ignores them.” So the only change <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements">in Ruby 3.2</a> was to additionally allow to say “…and passes them further”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>pass_my_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
  <span>other_method</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pass_keyword_args</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>positional</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>other_method</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Considering the intuitive feeling of “no new syntax” and that <code>...</code> was already there, and with the same “no unnecessary allocations” argument, the change was quickly accepted. The fact that it was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18351">proposed</a> (and the high-quality implementation supplied) by Jeremy Evans, author of prominent libraries like Sequel and Roda and a member of Ruby core helped, too.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the new syntax is acceptable not only for delegation to another method but almost everywhere where unpacking of named variables was supported:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>with_anonymous_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ary</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>]</span>
  <span>hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>**</span><span>}</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>ary</span><span>,</span> <span>hash</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>with_anonymous_args</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a: </span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span># Prints:</span>
<span>#   [1, 2, 3]</span>
<span>#   {:a=&gt;4, :b=&gt;5}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be considered more of a curiosity (at least the “don’t instantiate an array/hash” gain is lost here), but might be at least useful for temporary debugging statements in the pass-everything methods:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>make_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"DEBUG!"</span> <span>if</span> <span>{</span><span>**</span><span>}.</span><span>key?</span><span>(</span><span>:password</span><span>)</span>  <span># temp</span>
  <span>EVENT_CLASSES</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>].</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or, as the slightly-over-the-top example at the end of the “<a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-03-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-fin.html#taking-it-further">Pattern Matching / Taking it further</a>” shows, the “we don’t care about the name” can be repurposed to further pattern match the argument list as several possible signatures with different meanings (and, therefore, names) for parts of the argument list.</p>

<hr>

<p>The story with <code>&amp;</code> for anonymous block forwarding is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>Unlike <code>*</code> or <code>**</code>, there was no <code>&amp;</code> for “just ignore this block” because block arguments in Ruby are always optional, and there is no way neither to demonstrate in the method signature “we require it” nor that we don’t. (It is sometimes a problem when blocks are erroneously passed—and ignored—to methods that never expected them, but it is quite <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19979">hard</a> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15554">to solve</a>.)</p>

<p>So, when the standalone forwarding with <code>&amp;</code> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11256">was proposed</a>—long before the 2.7’s “argument forwarding” work—mainly as an optimization for block allocation, it was met with great caution. At that time, the optimization part was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14045">implemented</a> on its own as just optimization of passing the block around even if it was named. Later, though, when the basic argument forwarding with <code>...</code> was already in the language, the six-year-long discussion about the acceptability and readability of <code>&amp;</code> was ended with its introduction in <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument">Ruby 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>That’s the same effect we saw <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-10-syntax-sugar3-hash-values-omission.html#how">while discussing</a> keyword argument omission (which became acceptable after we got used to other cases of value-less <code>key:</code> syntax). Once a “bigger” feature takes its mindshare, the smaller ones might follow more easily.</p>

<h2 id="irks-and-quirks">Irks and quirks</h2>

<p>A small irk around ellipsis-based delegation is related to parentheses. The nature of the problem is similar to what we saw in the keyword omission case:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_method</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is actually</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_meth</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>()</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span># empty method call + a range from its result to infinity</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This affects only ellipsis (not other forms of anonymous forwarding) and is remedied, as usual, by adding parentheses:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_method</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The worse problem is that anonymous forwarding is not supported in blocks/procs. This is especially confusing considering that an old syntax of “anonymous splat” <em>is</em> supported, and therefore one might potentially write code with a very confusing effect:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
  <span># ...a lot of code...</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'test'</span><span>,</span> <span>'me'</span><span>].</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|*|</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>process</span><span>(</span><span>'input'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This looks as if it will print “test” and “me” (inside of proc, <code>*</code> accepts its arguments and passes them to <code>puts</code>), but <em>actually</em>, it prints:</p>


<p>What happens here is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>each { |*|</code> is treated in old logic “accept all arguments and discard them;”</li>
  <li><code>puts(*)</code> is treated in the new logic “see if the context has anonymous forwardable arguments”—and consider <em>the method’s arguments</em> as such.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19370">open discussion</a> on the matter, with a confusing (for me, at least) outcome: the Ruby developers’ meeting seems to be leaning toward an idea of just prohibiting the case like above (<code>*</code>-forwarding inside of a block with <code>*</code> arguments) while allowing more unambiguous cases.</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>What happens on a (mindful) usage of argument forwarding shortcuts is the <strong>onset of explicitness</strong>.</p>

<p>This might sound confusing because the “explicitness” is frequently associated with adding more names to the code or more steps to construct the value. Like splitting the formula into a few named local variables or, instead of passing the result of some method to another, first attaching it to some name. (In pathological cases, it is “every non-trivial call/check/calculation should be its own method with the name explaining its usage.”)</p>

<p>But here, I am talking about <em>the explicitness of the intention</em> of some sizeable chunk of code, a “page” or a “chapter” of it. (In the same way in the intro article <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-02-syntax-sugar.html#how-i-think-about-the-programming-language">I underlined</a> we’ll be talking about the reader’s comfort in comprehension of the narrative instead of the “readability” of a single line.)</p>

<p>Imagine a code like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender: </span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>content: </span><span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>details: </span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Such “intermediaries” are frequent in layered systems: the params are already checked and defaults assigned by the layer above; the handling itself would be performed by the layer below; and this current method is just a shortcut in the current module (that probably invokes it many times, so repeating the verbose call of the underlying layer is tiresome).</p>

<p>There are several ways to make this definition shorter, like using <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-10-syntax-sugar3-hash-values-omission.html">values omission</a></p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…or “keyword-rest” splatting:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>event_data</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>event_data</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But the real intention of this method is just to “pass everything further,” what the author thinks about its argument names is closer to “like, <em>you know,</em> everything” or “yeah, <em>whatever,</em> just pass it” (and frequently would just call the rest arguments <code>**kwrest</code>, or, <code>**options</code>—the latter is a long yet frequently misleading tradition of naming the last hash/keyword argument).</p>

<p>So, eventually, we can be just <strong>explicit</strong> in expressing these “you know” or “whatever”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or, with one-line method definitions (a topic of the next article), just</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Such simplifications might appear in various stages of design. Sometimes, “just pass everything through” is an early-prototype version that allows to quickly assemble the reasonable stack of layers; and later clarify on each step what are the particular responsibilities besides pass-through.</p>

<p>Other times, after a long period of design and clarification, it becomes obvious that a bit of meaningful realignment of layers with each other’s capabilities and expectations allows dripping the trivial things in favor of the literal embodiment of “you know”,  <code>...</code>. The intention to do so sometimes would uncover an unjustified signature change through the layers and, as a <em>consequence</em>, might lead to useful cleanups.</p>

<p>In any case, an ability to designate “what’s obvious/doesn’t matter here” allows the reader to focus better on the other parts: those that <em>are</em> non-trivial and important. Or: if everything is important (and underlined by language means like long explanatory names), then nothing is.</p>

<p>That’s why I am talking about explicitness: akin to the case of <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-11-syntax-sugar1-numeric-block-args.html">numbered block parameters</a>, sometimes giving a name to a value is just <strong>pretending</strong> to explain something. In these cases, it is good to have a syntax that allows to be <strong>clear and explicit</strong> about “nothing more to explain here.”</p>

<h2 id="how-others-do-it">How others do it</h2>

<p>Like last time (with “value omission syntax”), I actually struggled to find the <em>exact</em> correspondence of the “pass every argument” syntax: partially, maybe because there is no other languages to arrive to <code>(*args, **kwargs, &amp;block)</code> as the shortest <em>normative</em> way to say “everything that can be passed to a function.”</p>

<p>The design space here is related to accepting to the function a variable number of arguments—the concept is frequently called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varargs">varargs</a>” (frequently demonstrated by formatted-printing functions such as <code>printf</code>). It seems that languages that have them (some, like Rust, consciously do not; Zig had them in the early versions but then decided <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/208#issuecomment-393777148">against</a>), there are a few groups:</p>

<p><strong>Group 1, “The old school”:</strong> make a declaration “variable number of arguments is accepted here” in the function signature, and provide some special name (of variable/function/macro) to access them. Say, in C:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>va_list</span> <span>args</span><span>;</span>
  <span>va_start</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// handle `count` of `args`, calling `va_arg(args, int);` each time</span>
  <span>va_end</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Group 2, “The old school, but dynamic”:</strong> in the old JS and old PHP any function, regardless of its signature, could accept<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> any number of arguments and exposed them with <code>arguments</code> (JS) or <code>func_get_args()</code> (PHP):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>variadic</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>arguments</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>variadic</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span><span>})</span>
<span>// Prints</span>
<span>//   Arguments(4) [1, 2, 3, {foo: 'bar'}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a radical variant of this, Perl’s <code>sub</code> doesn’t have a syntax for arguments declaration at all, and all arguments are accessible inside the subroutine in a list variable <code>@_</code>, and the way to designate their names is to assign them to local variables:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>sub </span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my</span><span>(</span><span>$x</span><span>,</span> <span>$y</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>@_</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>x=</span><span>$x</span><span> y=</span><span>$y</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>test</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span># prints x=1, y=2</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Group 3, “New school”:</strong> Many languages have a special syntax for a function signature to declare a named parameter that would “catch” the variable list of parameters. Like in modern JS:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>new_variadic</span><span>(...</span><span>myargs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>myargs</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>new_variadic</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span><span>})</span>
<span>// Prints</span>
<span>//   [1, 2, 3, {foo: 'bar'}] -- note no special "Arguments" object wrapper</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The designation used is frequently <code>...</code> or <code>*</code>, though C# uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/method-parameters#params-modifier"><code>param</code></a> keyword for such cases, and Kotlin uses <a href="https://kotlin-quick-reference.com/130-R-vararg-parameters.html"><code>vararg</code></a>.</p>

<p>It seems to be a generally agreed-upon practice nowadays.</p>

<p>The symmetric question is also more or less agreed upon<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: if you have a list/array/tuple of values and want to pass them as separate arguments to some function, there is an operator for that (usually looking the same as “rest arguments” declaration, and frequently called “splat” or “spread”):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>function_with_3_args</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>,</span> <span>arg3</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>,</span> <span>arg3</span><span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>args_in_array</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>function_with_3_args</span><span>(...</span><span>args_in_array</span><span>)</span>
<span>// Prints: {arg1: 1, arg2: 2, arg3: 3}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…which provides a way to perform pass-through (accept in one function “whatever arguments passed” and pass them to another function).</p>

<p>It wasn’t a given in old times! In <code>arguments</code> days of JS, “pass all arguments further” was as cumbersome as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>b</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>arguments</span><span>);</span> <span>//arguments[0] = 1, etc</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function</span> <span>a</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>);</span> <span>// pass them through, first `null` is for `this`</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>a</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So today’s situation (with, usually, just one named “splat” argument to be “splat” further down the layers) is enough for most pass-through situations.</p>

<p>Though, wait!</p>

<p>The interesting thing happened to Lua (as I discovered while writing the article).</p>

<p>As of <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/manual.html#2.5.8">version 5.0</a>, it belonged to “group 1”: <code>...</code> in signature to designate “accepts any number of arguments,” a special variable <code>arg</code> with a table of all arguments inside of a function.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>-- prints  1  2  3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And yet, in <a href="https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1">Lua 5.1</a>, <code>...</code> <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.9">replaced</a> the <code>arg</code>, so now it looks the closest to Ruby’s shortcuts:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>-- prints  1  2  3</span>

<span>-- even can be used as a simple variable:</span>
<span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>...+</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>-- prints 6</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The world of programming languages evolution is full of wonders!</p>

<hr>

<p>An aside note: the temptation to use the <code>...</code> as a syntax construct along the lines of “and so on” is tempting not only for Ruby and Lua: it is present at least in Python, where bare <code>...</code> produces an object <code>Ellipsis</code>, which can be passed around as a regular value and has various uses:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>method</span><span>():</span>
  <span>...</span> <span># do-nothing method
</span>
<span># specify type of fun as a callable with any input arguments and str result
</span><span>fun</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[...,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span>

<span>matrix</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>matrix</span><span>([[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]])</span>
<span># take all data by all dimensions, but only 0th column
</span><span>matrix</span><span>[...,</span> <span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>#=&gt; matrix([[1], [3]])
</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="taking-it-further">Taking it further</h2>

<p>There is one idea that is unlikely to be implemented yet still tempting: can we sometimes shift the place where “well, you know” can be said?</p>

<p>Imagine this code: a frequent idiom for a “callable class” (which might encapsulate a complicated multi-step algorithm that is split into multiple private methods):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyOperation</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>,</span> <span>of</span><span>:,</span> <span>various: </span><span>"kinds"</span><span>)</span>
    <span># arguments assignment</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>call</span>
    <span># ... implementation ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># public interface:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>).</span><span>call</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Its intended usage is simple:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>MyOperation</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>with</span><span>,</span> <span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>of: :arguments</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>…which just creates an instance with all arguments passed and immediately invokes its <code>#call</code> (the meat of the implementation) method.</p>

<p>The problem here is that the only public method of this class doesn’t give any information in its signature: neither to render into autogenerated documentation nor to extract via introspection:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyOperation</span><span>.</span><span>method</span><span>(</span><span>:call</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; #&lt;Method: MyOperation.call(...)&gt; -- not informative!</span>
<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>parameters</span>
<span>#=&gt; [[:rest, :*], [:keyrest, :**], [:block, :&amp;]] -- not informative either!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The “callable wrapper” is not the only situation demonstrating this problem: a typical HTTP client implementation might have something like this (if it is written in a modern Ruby):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>make_request</span><span>(</span><span>method: :get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, again, “public interface” method <code>get</code> doesn’t demonstrate any information about its signature (which “private implementation” method <code>make_request</code> knows).</p>

<p>So, maybe it would be possible to still support the “pass everything” syntax in the presence of explicit arguments declaration? As a compromise between “say it the shortest way possible” and “spell everything like a beginner exercise”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>params: </span><span>{},</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{},</span> <span>redirect: </span><span>false</span><span>)</span> <span># spell it here</span>
  <span>make_request</span><span>(</span><span>method: :get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span> <span># "just pass it further" here</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The ticket, describing the idea, <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16296">exists</a>, but it never received much attention.</p>

<p>BTW, there is place in Ruby where something like this works! Calling <code>super</code> (“parent class’ version of this method”) implicitly passes all arguments of the current method<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which allows for some very nice shortcuts. Say, here is everything you need to do to add some defaults to a <code>Data</code> initialization:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Measurement</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>(</span><span>:amount</span><span>,</span> <span>:unit</span><span>)</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:,</span> <span>unit: </span><span>'-none-'</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>super</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>Measurement</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>'m'</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; #&lt;data Measurement amount=100, unit="m"&gt;</span>
<span>Measurement</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>      <span>#=&gt; #&lt;data Measurement amount=100, unit="-none-"&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, the idea of “accept params declared explicitly, then just pass everything” is not <em>unimaginable</em>, at least!</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>So, here are some things to round up today’s entry:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Not all things should be named</strong>—we already talked about this while discussing numbered block parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Being explicit about the absence of additional meaning</strong> is a useful kind of explicitness that should be considered to underline the meaningfulness of important parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Sometimes, performance optimization and clarity optimization align like stars</strong>, producing a feature that (while <em>still</em> meeting its haters) might be explained and defended from several points of view at once!</li>
</ol>

<p>The next part will be dedicated to the <strong>one-line (endless) methods</strong>, the syntax feature that was born out of April Fools’ joke.</p>

<p>In November 2021, former US Representative from Georgia Bob Barr wrote a little-noticed political column claiming that buried inside President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure legislation was a dangerous provision that would go into effect in five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Marketed to Congress as a benign tool to help prevent drunk driving, the measure will mandate that automobile manufacturers build into every car what amounts to a ‘vehicle kill switch,’”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2021/11/29/barr-bidens-infrastructure-bill-contains-backdoor-kill-switch-for-cars/">wrote</a><span>&nbsp;</span>Barr, who was the Libertarian Party’s nominee for president in 2008.</p>
<p>Like most Americans, I had never heard of this alleged “kill switch” until a few days ago when Representative Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican, proposed to strip the mandate’s funding.</p>
<p>“The right to travel is fundamental, but the government has mandated a kill-switch in new vehicles sold after 2026,” said Massie. “The kill-switch will monitor driver performance and disable cars based on the information gathered.”</p>
<p>Nineteen Republicans joined all but one Democrat in opposing Massie’s amendment, which failed.</p>
<h3><strong>True or False?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The claim that the feds would mandate that every new motor vehicle include technology that could disable the vehicle seemed ludicrous. So I started Googling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my relief, I saw several fact-checkers at legacy institutions had determined the “kill switch” mandate was not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our rating: False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/01/19/fact-check-false-claim-bill-mandates-kill-switch-cars-police-drunk-driving/11066287002/">said</a><span>&nbsp;</span><em>USA Today</em>.</p>
<p>“ASSESSMENT: False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497">said</a><span>&nbsp;</span>the Associated Press.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We rate it Mostly False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/dec/05/instagram-posts/-vehicle-technology-coming-stop-impaired-drivers-i/">concluded</a><span>&nbsp;</span>PolitiFact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Snopes, a reliably left-leaning fact check group, was a little less conclusive, saying the claim was a “<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/infrastructure-bill-track-drivers/">mixture</a>” of true and false.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my relief evaporated once I looked at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text">the bill itself</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sec. 24220 of the law explicitly states: “[T]o ensure the prevention of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology must be standard equipment in all new passenger motor vehicles.”</p>
<p>The legislation then goes on to define the technology as a computer system that can<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“passively monitor the performance</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>of a driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of a motor vehicle” and can “<strong>prevent or limit motor vehicle operation</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>if an impairment is detected” (emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p>How the system will make this determination is unclear, as is the government’s potential role in apprehending suspected drunk drivers (more on that later).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the law’s language could not be more clear: New motor vehicles must have a computer system to “monitor” drivers, and the system must be able to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>prevent<span>&nbsp;</span></em>vehicle operation if it detects impairment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>“No Mention in the Bill of a ‘Kill Switch’”</strong></h3>
<p>How fact-checkers determined the “kill switch” narrative to be false is odd, especially since the articles don’t deny Barr’s central claim: The legislation mandates a computer system that will monitor driving performance and be able to disable motor vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Associated Press conceded the law would “prevent or limit motor vehicle operation” if the system suspects the driver is impaired, even “disable a vehicle from being operated.” So did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>USA Today</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and PolitiFact.</p>
<p>To arrive at their conclusion that this car-killing mechanism is just a fantasy, fact-checkers resorted to sleight of hand. A common tactic was to debunk social media posts that were actually false or unfounded, like the popular claim that the systems would be required to alert law enforcement if the drivers were deemed impaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“None of the technologies currently in development would notify law enforcement,” the Associated Press assured readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an odd bit of uniformity, each of the fact-checkers said spokespeople for groups who support the system, such as MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), told them they would never support giving law enforcement access to the system.</p>
<p>My personal favorite, however, was PolitiFact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[We] found no mention in the bill of a ‘kill switch,’” PolitiFact concluded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that the absence of the words “kill switch” in the bill is evidence that a disabling mechanism doesn’t actually exist in the legislation is nothing short of gaslighting.</p>
<h3><strong>‘Secure in Persons and Effects’?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The unpleasant truth is that lawmakers slipped into a massive spending bill a mandate that stands to require all new vehicles to have AI-driven technology that can disable your vehicle if the technology determines you’ve had one beer too many. And fact-checkers are using headlines to make it sound as if the legislation does no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s true there is currently no mechanism in the legislation that would require law enforcement to be notified if drivers are suspected of inebriation. But the Associated Press<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497">notes</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that the law “leaves most of the details up to NHTSA” (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to determine at a future date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my reading of the bill, there is nothing in the legislation that would prevent NHTSA from requesting or receiving this data. Does anyone believe that in 2027, if the NHTSA requested that system manufacturers turn over the information they collect, it would be told no? Don’t bet on it. The Twitter Files show how quick companies comply when the feds come knocking on their door to retrieve their data, and just how little they care about the privacy of Americans.</p>
<p>And that word — privacy — barely appears in any of the three “fact-checks.” (The single instance is when a MADD spokesman assured readers that the organization remains committed to driver privacy, even though it was supporting a computer system that spies on drivers.) The notion that a system that “passively monitors” drivers might infringe the privacy of Americans doesn’t even seem to have crossed their minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this shouldn’t be surprising. In a world where traffic cameras, license plate readers, NSA mass surveillance, intelligence-gathering “<a href="https://reason.com/2023/01/06/government-snoops-in-maine-caught-spying-on-peaceful-americans/">fusion centers</a>,” and widespread<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hopelefeber.com/rise-in-warrantless-searches-at-the-fbi/#:~:text=The%20report%20indicated%20that%20the,the%20same%20kind%20of%20searches.">warrantless searches</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are ubiquitous, privacy might seem like a quaint idea. But it’s one the Framers of the American system took seriously.</p>
<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution reads.</p>
<p>I’m not a constitutional scholar, but it seems to me that the federal government’s requiring automobile manufacturers to install a system that spies on its driver — and disables his car if transgressions are suspected — hardly meets this constitutional standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also suspect mandating the installation of this technology is something Americans of all political stripes would overwhelmingly oppose on principle — put aside for now the immense<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cost<span>&nbsp;</span></em>on new vehicle purchases it will add — if they knew about it, which is no doubt why the provision was surreptitiously slipped into a $1 trillion spending bill.</p>
<h3><strong>The True Purpose of the Surveillance State</strong></h3>
<p>Then again, maybe Americans wouldn’t care if they knew about federal legislation that mandates tech to disable their cars if it suspects that last glass of wine — which you may or may not have had — put you over the limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Robert E. Wright<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/government-surveillance-injures-the-innocent/">has pointed out</a>, once upon a time, Americans considered spying an invasion of privacy, but those days are mostly gone. Increasingly, many take an “I have nothing to hide” approach. Few seem to realize they are almost certainly breaking laws each day unknowingly, and I’m not talking about driving 65 in a 55 mph zone.</p>
<p>In his popular book<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229"><em>Three Felonies a Day</em></a>, author Harvey A. Silverglate noted that the typical American commits just that: three felonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>per day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(four, if you see a felony and don’t report it, which is also a crime).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last century, the Land of the Free has slowly transformed into a land governed by endless laws, largely by<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/vices-are-not-crimes-lysander-spooners-timeless-lesson/?utm_source=aier&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jon-op-ed&amp;utm_content=kill-switch-vices">cracking down on vices</a><span>&nbsp;</span>instead of actual crimes, creating a society that would render us all criminals if our behavior were constantly observed. Meanwhile, the state has steadily expanded its use of mass surveillance, largely under the pretext of fighting “terror.”</p>
<p>This is a toxic mixture, yet most people seem largely oblivious to the danger it poses. Americans love citing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>1984</em>, but it seems few have actually read it. If they had, they’d realize that the terror of living under a surveillance state was the primary theme of George Orwell’s masterpiece, which was<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/3-real-life-inspirations-for-george-orwell-s-1984/?utm_source=aier&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jon-op-ed&amp;utm_content=kill-switch-orwell">inspired by</a><span>&nbsp;</span>actual totalitarian states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple glimpse into the history books reveals few things are quite as terrifying as a surveillance state. (To experience a taste, I recommend Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s fantastic 2006 German film<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://amzn.to/3G2xmsI"><em>The Lives of Others</em></a>.) It’s chilling even to imagine what the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/10-terrifying-facts-about-the-east-german-secret-police/">Stasi</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/NKVD">NKVD</a><span>&nbsp;</span>could do with modern surveillance technology.</p>
<p>The United States is not a totalitarian state, but its<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/16/fbi-treated-twitter-as-subsidiary-flagged-tweets-for-misinformation/">growing efforts</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to control information — which have grown more obvious and ambitious — show that it’s not a neutral bystander, either. Those in government have their agendas, and they are not known for playing nice with those who cross them (just ask Edward Snowden and Julian Assange).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings us to the raison d’être of mass surveillance.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>“The asymmetry of the surveillance state belies its true purpose: to protect the government, not the people,” writes Wright.&nbsp;</p><p>Once one understands this, it becomes clear why many see grand potential in a law that requires every single new motor vehicle in the country to be monitored and potentially disabled by a computer — and why<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/invasion-fact-checkers">rent-a-cop fact-checkers</a><span>&nbsp;</span>would go through such contortions to downplay this dystopian mandate.</p></div>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The most talented data engineer I know, and my first manager, is a man that loves cooking. I mean, you might <em>think</em> you love cooking, but this guy <em>loves</em> cooking. The most excited text message I received this year was from him, proudly <a href="https://combustion.inc/">sharing the goddamn analytics on the heat distribution of chicken in his oven with his newly imported thermometer</a>. We're talking about a culinary madman, capable of anything. The first book he gave me was not remotely related to any technical stack we ran, but was instead a <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/">2,438 page <em>manifesto</em></a> on cooking. My current relationship is built on the back of a meal he advised me to prepare on the third date.</p>
<p>Every day, we would step out of the office to get some coffee, and on at least three separate occasions we ended up talking about the difficulty of running a top-tier kitchen. And, most shockingly, on all of those occasions, he professed an admiration for the complexity required for McDonald's to run.</p>
<p>At first, this startled me - McDonald's! I enjoy myself a mediocre burger as much as the next guy fresh out of university, but the man that graphs the cooking of his chicken is impressed by the place that hungover college students go for their nutrition? Well, it turns out that even if you don't hold the quality of the output in particularly high regard, the optimizations and discipline required to ensure that two different acne-ridden teens with wildly varied education levels, separated by oceans, are capable of producing the same burger are <em>non-trivial</em> to say the least.</p>
<p>The man in question catches up on this blog every few weeks, and will be horrified to discover that when you tell a young, impressionable engineer anything, they're going to think about it for three years and then write their own manifesto.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-glimpse-into-the-c-suite-mindset">A Brief Glimpse Into The C-Suite Mindset</h2>
<p>Many years ago, trying to figure out what the goddamn hell is going on in the tech industry, I ended up reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17255186">The Phoenix Project</a>. This isn't the main point of bringing the book up, but let's take a brief detour to appreciate how bizarre some parts of it are. Here's the blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO.</p>
<p>The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced.</p>
<p>With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right, there's a whole genre of corporate fanfiction out there. Was it useful to read? Yes. Does it miss some of the <em>real</em> barriers to organizations improving? Yes, which I should talk about in another article. Was it cringe-inducing at points? <em>Hell yes</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’d use that information to drive our production schedule, so we can manage our supply and demand curves. We’d keep the right products on the right store shelves and keep them stocked. Our revenue per customer would go through the roof. Our average order sizes would go up. We’d finally increase our market share and start beating the competition again.”</p>
<p>As she’s telling us this, she looks animated and excited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh <em>baby</em>, average order size would go up?  I couldn't <em>be</em> more animated and excited. It should not surprise anyone that it <a href="https://itrevolution.com/author/gene-kim/">required a CTO</a> to unironically write the prose above. It's almost surprising that the next page doesn't talk about how the newfound synergies between the infrastructure team and the developers have made the protagonist positively <em>turgid</em>. But I digress.</p>
<p>The general thrust of the book describes how I.T operations work a lot like a factory floor, and that this has implications for how the flow of work through the organization should be thought about and managed. In fact, the entire book consists of a strange man appearing periodically and giving the protagonist cryptic hints on how to be DevOps-pilled, like if Gandalf knew the only way to defeat Sauron was to help Bilbo fulfill all of his organizational commitments in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Some interesting ideas there, but then I realized that there are a <em>few</em> books that express this kind of sentiment. Quite a few. For one thing, the author has <em>another</em> very popular book out called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44333183">The Unicorn Project</a>. Then there's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60872200">Investments Unlimited</a>. And they're all inspired by another book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal">The Goal</a>, which is almost the same plot but instead involves a character changing the operations on an actual factory floor, with slightly less cringe-worthy dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal is the gripping novel which is transforming management thinking throughout the Western world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ooh, a fast-paced story about improving factory throughput? Fuck yes, I'm getting shivers just thinking about it. These all sound like novels that aliens wrote because they've only been able to decrypt the traffic from LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And then I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/324750">High Output Management</a> which really <em>was</em> good without having as many caveats around the tepid style. It's straightforward and gives good advice for the effective operation of the soulless corporate machine, and it does not aspire to be anything else. And <em>even that</em> starts with an example of how works flows through a restaurant, complete with a description of how putting eggs on to boil at the wrong time is going to result in cold toast by the time it reaches the customer. A <em>very</em> large component to all this thinking is about economies of scale and the flow of work - these themes come up over and over again.</p>
<h2 id="mcdata">McData</h2>
<p>Many months later, and I was walking around the floor <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/">of a vendor conference</a> and something began to strike me in the offerings. On this particular day, I happened to be wearing a white shirt with a nice coat, and I suspect many of the salespeople mistook me for management, because they started to pitch me <em>aggressively</em> on their products.</p>
<p>As a rough rule, I knew the products were not particularly good. I've been burned too many times by seeing organizations purchase shitty enterprise software which promises to fix all of the organization's woes. Just buy Salesforce, or Workday, or Informatica, or whatever! Your staff said $CURRENT_SYSTEM is bad, so buy $NEW_SYSTEM. I'd heard it all before, usually in the context of deprecating $NEW_SYSTEM for $NEW_NEW_SYSTEM because $NEW_SYSTEM fucking suuuuucks. I currently believe that there's only one way to buy yourself out of technical issues and bad data models, and that's buying a really talented engineer whose sole focus is fixing the problem.</p>
<p>But what interested me is that they did not spend any time selling me on the technical details of the product. The pitches were <em>entirely</em> focused on something I wouldn't have noticed prior to reading all those books - they were focused on the reproducible delivery of work that was <em>good enough</em> to accomplish business objectives, without having to rely on all those pesky technicians to be good enough to do the job correctly. </p>
<p>For example, one pitch in particular was for a product which promised to remove the need for me to write SQL in exchange for being able to set up all my dependencies from a drag-and-drop editor, with the sales pitch consisting of "You can get rid of thousands of lines of all that SQL you hate!" - no I can't, fucko, because your application is still connecting to Postgres so it's just writing the SQL for me with another layer of licensed abstraction on top of it. Why would I <em>pay</em> to have more abstractions designed for <em>you</em> to sell software to multiple clients, you blue-suited dementor? Eight times out of ten, I want to pay you to <em>remove</em> them from my codebase.</p>
<p>Well, <em>you and I</em> understand that. But I suspect that what an <em>almost</em> savvy executive hears is a little bit closer to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know that slow, painful SQL that you keep hearing is causing problems? We've got a drag-and-drop interface, so that you can now hire replaceable cogs to do the dragging-and-dropping at a consistent rate. And there's a consistent interface, and a bunch of specialists in this tool on the market, so you can easily ensure the smooth, consistent delivery of data through the organization! Consistent!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in another context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a BurgerMaster 5000, you can just drop any teenager behind this thing with thirty minutes of training, and they're going to be able to turn out a burger that's good enough to sell! It's going to be the same burger every time, wherever you ship it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They might not be thinking in <em>exactly</em> these terms, because I genuinely have good reason to believe that the median executive has trouble reading anything that isn't printed in a font so large that it feels like the writer is screaming affirmations at them, but I think this is the <em>gist</em> of the sales pitch. It is the promise that you can do away with the pesky implementation details of hiring correctly, or addressing all the bad decisions your predecessors made, or even telling your stakeholders that you've over-promised. Nah, you just buy the increased throughput widget, and now all the story points will be done on time.</p>
<p>Heck, even the way Agile is typically implemented at your average (read: dysfunctional and ineffective) workplace reflects this mindset. You count up how many units (story points) of parts (deliverables) that your machines (engineers) can produce, and then you let 'em rip, only to return next week and wonder why the machines only ever hit 50% of their target.</p>
<h2 id="its-fucking-raw">It's Fucking Raw</h2>
<p>And here's where it all falls apart. All of that sounds great - economies of scale, reproducibility, robustness, blah, blah, blah. McDonald's almost never fails to produce fries of approximately the correct quality, within five minutes, every single time I've asked for them, and some of the absolute sons of bitches that I've worked for have <em>clearly never shipped something that delivered value in their whole careers</em>. They just buy a license for bad software, say that they've successfully implemented it since no one can really check, then leave before the ambient hatred radiating off the people forced to work with the system reaches a level that they can't tolerate.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that again more bluntly - <em>we haven't figured out how to commodify a lot of this work</em>. Despite my adoration and vested financial interested in computing being something companies need to pay me for, it would actually be <em>really nice</em> if we could do this successfully. I would adore it if the doctors and nurses in my life didn't constantly lament the stream of indignities that their single-neuron administrators heap upon them with each new proprietary system, even if it forced me to find a new career. Some of these things are just important, but we <em>can't do it yet</em>. There might be the <em>appearance</em> that many of these things can be neatly commodified, but the majority of these seem to simply be companies that shouldn't exist selling a product that doesn't work to <em>other</em> companies that have oblivious decision-makers.</p>
<p>(And sometimes, an evil decision-maker that has realized you can just man the phone lines from the third world for pennies because it technically means you're legally compliant, and you don't care about customers that are cancelling anyway. Whenever I need to talk to support staff, I try call the <em>sales</em> line first and see if they'll fast-track me, because I will get a local with the authority to <em>do things</em> in 30 seconds.)</p>
<p>Rich Hickey has a delightful talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock Driven Development</a>, which I highly recommend. On the topic of innovation, Rich Hickey is the creator (or at least, the most prominent creator) of Clojure, so he <em>probably</em> has more innovation points than the lower half of the world's managers <em>combined</em>. My man is out here advocating of a workflow that consists of feeding your subconscious mind research for four hours, then meditating on it for another two, then <em>sleeping</em> and praying that the Gods of Design simply bless you with an answer in the morning - a strange workflow that I experienced when I was writing my Master's thesis, where I solved problems that feel <em>well</em> beyond my ability now, or even in old stories I've heard about the legendary <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/imagination-and-the-imagi_b_8178538">Poincaré</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>all programmers</em> seem to have experienced the strange phenomena where they walk away and the answer comes to them.</p>
<p>There's plenty of work that consists of simply churning out widgets faster, and I'm happy to see that work disappear (so long as we find a way for people to continue living healthily without it), but it must be acknowledged that many of the things we value in society come from an ill-defined, more vital place, and there is an intersection of that spark with the realities of production.</p>
<p>You can pay people to churn out bad self-help all day, but none of those are going to be worth a damn without allowing the human element to flourish. But you still need a factory which can print the things, and as clinical as a mass bookbinding operations sounds, I really believe that you're only going to get a beautiful binding when that factory is run by people who have the connection to the work necessary to exercise taste.</p>
<p>Maybe you can refine the delivery of a beautiful meal at a restaurant, but the meal itself is born from a person's creativity and aesthetic sense, trying to weigh itself against the realities of financial constraints. You can streamline it, and you can deliver the same meal every day, but I've <em>seen</em> the meticulous care of a professional chef running a restaurant in my home country, and successful commodification <em>still requires</em> intense caring.</p>
<p>You can try all you want to reduce the delivery of features to a Jira board and mumbling about Agile, but you're not going to get anything worthwhile out of people if you can't connect with them. You think an engineer good enough to have opinions on the relative elegance of cryptic symbols in an IDE can work without an element of soul, because it would be <em>convenient</em> if he was more like a widget-producing machine? Hah.</p>
<p>Heck, I know someone that designs some of the chips that go into iPhones, and you'd <em>think</em> that would be commodified to hell and back, but at the end of the day it's actually my uncle staying up to 3 AM, calling me from the U.S because he'd like to keep in touch despite the workload - and if that guy gets sick, they're probably <em>actually going to have to delay the next release</em>. There's crazy infrastructure to allow them to test and mass produce those chips, but <em>individual people</em> make that machine run.</p>
<p>There are harsh realities to grapple with, and society runs on commodification, but anyone that thinks that you can run on <em>pure</em> commodification, without any understanding of their specific craft, or the human complexities, needs, and frailties of the people around them, who think that you can just buy more enterprise licenses and that giving someone a salary is enough reason for them to subjugate the entirety of themselves as they turn up to work every day...</p>
<p>Well, you're wrong, and you can fucking bite me.</p>

            <p>
                By adding the <code>#[\Override]</code> attribute to a method, PHP will ensure that a method with the same name exists in a parent class or in an implemented interface. Adding the attribute makes it clear that overriding a parent method is intentional and simplifies refactoring, because the removal of an overridden parent method will be detected.            </p>

<p>How Apple's Pro Display XDR takes Thunderbolt 3 to its limit</p><hr>
<p>I like Thunderbolt a lot. Mostly because USB's land of optional features is a mess which makes choosing a cable/peripheral difficult. With thunderbolt you have a single number to get right. And then you are supposed to be golden. However the idyll with Intel's interface took a hit
  when I tried to make sense of Apple's Pro Display XDR requirements.
</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/xdr5.webp" width="1308" height="438">
<span><i><small>Apple's Pro Display XDR (2019)</small></i></span>

<p>If we take a look at the monitor's <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/Pro_Display_White_Paper_Feb_2020.pdf">Technology Overview</a> we find an impressive list of features.
  On top of its gorgeous design is listed 1600 nits brightness, 6K (6,144 x 3,456) resolution, 60fps, P3 wide gamut, 32", one Thunderbolt-3 port, and three USB ports. USB-2 ports.
</p>

<p>Wait, what? USB-2? From the year 2000? As in 480 Mbps? And what are the small prints at the bottom?

</p><blockquote>7. For the 16-inch
MacBook Pro, USB-C ports have USB 3.1 Gen 1 data transfer speeds<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</blockquote>

<p>What is going on?</p>



<p>Let's do the math</p><hr><p>According to Intel's Thunderbolt-3 <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/tb3_brief.pdf">technology brief</a>, the interface has a bandwidth of 40 Gbps. Let's remove 20% due to 8b/10 encoding. This leaves 32 Gbps of actual bandwidth. With the 6,144 x 3,456 @ 60Hz / 10bpc plugged into a <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/729232-guide-to-display-cables-adapters-v2/?section=calc&amp;H=6016&amp;V=3384&amp;F=60&amp;calculations=show&amp;formulas=show">calculator</a>, the display requires roughly 31 Gbps.</p>

<p>This means Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth is nearly maxed out with only 32-31 = 1Gbps left. This can only fit USB 2 traffic. The math adds up.</p>


<p>But why is the 16-inch MacBook Pro able to run USB 3.1 (10Gbps)? Because it is able to compress the display stream!</p>

  

<p>Thunderbolt 3</p><hr><p>If you are a thunderbolt connoisseur, you will argue that there is no support for Display Stream Compression (DSC) in Thunderbolt 3. Intel's brief only mentions support up to DisplayPort 1.2a and there is no compression in that protocol.</p>

<p>But things get interesting when we look at the controllers. The brief of the first generation of Thunderbol3 controllers, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/18-241_ThunderboltController_Brief_HI.pdf">Alpine Ridge Brief (series 6000)</a>, mentions no DSC. But the brief of the second generation of controllers, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/18-241_Thunder7000Controller_Brief_FIN_HI.pdf">Titan Ridge (series 7000)</a>, does (via DisplayPort 1.4 support).</p>

<p>What is likely, is that there is something in the XDR which supports DisplayPort 1.4 (Titan Ridge?). And macs before the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019 did not support it (Alpine Ridge?).</p>

<p>I am unsure it was a good idea to allow Thunderbolt 3 capabilities to differ based on the controller. On one side it allowed things like the XDR to exist. On the other, it fragmented Thunderbolt which used to be a selling point versus USB.</p>

<p>The result is that consumers have a hard time knowing if they will have USB 2 or USB 3.1 on their XDR. For a piece of hardware of that price that is rather annoying.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt 4</p><hr><p>What future for 6K+ displays? Thunderbolt 4 was released in 2020 along with Intel's 8000-series controllers called <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16333/intel-maple-ridge-thunderbolt-4-controller-now-shipping">Maple Ridge</a>. It did not increase the bandwidth, which stayed at 40 Gbps, but it made support for DisplayPort 1.4 (and therefore DSC) mandatory.</p>

<p>This version allows supporting display configuration such as 8K@60Hz.
</p>


<p>Thunderbolt 5</p><hr><p>Thunderbolt 5 was <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/TBT5%20Press%20Deck%20v3%20Final.pdf">announced</a> in September 2023. We should start seeing Barlow Ridge (series-9000) controllers in 2024.</p>

<p> The combination of 120 Gbps "Bandwidth Boost", DisplayPort 2.1, and PCIe Gen4x4 will allows multiple 8K display, up to 540Hz refresh rates, and up to three 4K@144Hz if you want to replicate Al Gore's <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/al.webp">2007 legendary setup</a> (although he only got triple 2560 x 1600 @ 60Hz).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Appearing in the biggest antitrust trial in a quarter century, DuckDuckGo founder Gabriel Weinberg testified Thursday that it was hard for his small search engine company to compete with Google because the powerhouse has deals with phone companies and equipment manufacturers to make its product the default search option on so many devices.</p><p>“We hit an obstacle with Google’s contracts,’' Weinberg said in U.S. District Court in Washington.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice argues that Google has smothered competition by paying companies such as Apple and Verizon to lock in its search engine as the default choice — the first one users see — on many laptops and smartphones. Google counters that it dominates the internet search market because its product is better than the competition. </p>
    

<p>Even when it holds the default spot on smartphones and other devices, Google argues, users can switch to rival search engines with a couple of clicks.</p>



<p>But Weinberg testified that getting users to switch from Google was complicated, requiring as many as 30 to 50 steps to change defaults on all their devices, whereas the process could be shortened to just one click on each device.</p>
<p>“The search defaults are the primary barrier,’' he said. “It’s too many steps.’'</p><p>The MIT graduate started DuckDuckGo in his basement in Pennsylvania in 2008, plucking its name from a children’s game. After a couple years, the company began positioning itself as a search engine that respects people’s privacy by promising not to track what users search for or where they have been. Such tracking results can be used to create detailed user profiles and “creepy ads,’' Weinberg said.</p><p>“People don’t like ads that follow them around,’' he said. DuckDuckGo’s internal surveys, he said, show privacy is the biggest concern among users, beating their desire for the best search results.</p>
    

<p>DuckDuckGo still sells ads, but bases them on what people are asking its search engine in the moment, a technique known as “contextual advertising.” That focus on privacy helped the company attract more users after the Edward Snowden saga raised awareness about the pervasiveness of online surveillance. It gained even more customers after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal opened a window into how personal information extracted from digital services can be passed around to other data brokers.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is privately held, so doesn’t disclose its finances. But it has said that it’s been profitable for several years and brings in more than $100 million in annual revenue. That’s loose change for Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which generated $283 billion in revenue last year. </p><p>DuckDuckGo still handles only 2.5% of U.S. search queries, Weinberg testified Thursday.</p><p>Under questioning from Google, Weinberg said much of DuckDuckGo’s search capability originated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine and was not homegrown. The company had allowed Microsoft to track some DuckDuckGo users until a security researcher flagged the practice in 2022.</p><p>Weinberg apologized at the time and DuckDuckGo tightened its tracker blocking to include Microsoft.</p>
    

<p>In earlier testimony, Eric Lehman, a former Google software engineer, seemed to question one of the Justice Department’s key arguments: that Google’s dominance is entrenched because of the massive amount of data it collects from user clicks, which the company in turn leverages to improve future searches faster than competitors can.</p><p>But Lehman said machine learning has improved rapidly in recent years, to the point that computers can evaluate text on their own without needing to analyze data from user clicks.</p><p>In a 2018 email produced in court, Lehman wrote that Google rivals such as Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, China’s Baidu, Russia’s Yandex or even startups could use machine learning to improve internet searches and challenge Google’s lead in the industry.</p><p>“Huge amounts of user feedback can be largely replaced by unsupervised learning of raw text,’’ he wrote.</p><p>In court Thursday, Lehman said his best guess is that search engines will shift largely from relying on user data to relying on machine learning.</p><p>During the exchange, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta drew a laugh by asking how internet searches would answer one of pop culture’s most pressing questions this week: whether superstar singer Taylor Swift is dating NFL tight end Travis Kelce.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
        



	    

	    





<p>Jehan Pages who is the lead developer and maintainer of GIMP made an announcement on Patreon yesterday. GIMP 3.0 is tentatively scheduled for release in May 2024. The plan is to announce the release at the next Libre Graphics Meeting conference in France. There is a page that details the roadmap.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the paint points: stopping development of new features while trying to get non-destructive editing into 3.0, making more API changes, fixing a load of bugs.</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WOTj0TvZkzU" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video" loading="lazy"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Below goes edited transcript of the video.</p>
<h2 id="feature-freeze">
    <a href="#feature-freeze">
	Feature freeze
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Right off the bat, the proposal is to start with a feature freeze in the middle of December. A feature freeze basically means this. Every new line of code that you write has the potential to introduce a new bug or even many bugs. So if you expect to release software that doesn’t crash much and doesn’t throw too many error messages at users, at some point you have to stop writing new features and focus on fixing bugs.</p>
<p>Today is the 22nd of November, the tentative release date is around May 9 of the next year, that makes nearly 5 months between now and the release and closer to 4 months between the feature freeze and the release.</p>
<p>There are three major topics here to unpack.</p>
<h2 id="non-destructive-editing">
    <a href="#non-destructive-editing">
	Non-destructive editing
    </a>
</h2>
<p>First of all, development of new features has been decelerating over the past few years, with focus shifted towards completing the port to GTK3. But most recently CmykStudent resumed his Google Summer of Code project where he hacked on non-destructive filters attached to layers.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/gimp-3-0-roadmap/layer-properties.webp" alt="Filters in Layer Properties" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The interface you see here (the bottom part of the screenshot above) is pretty much a slight evolution of the non-destructive embryo that has already been there for many years. The real deal will look nothing like this. It’s just that the public branch doesn’t yet have the latest work that CmykStudent demonstrated on Twitter recently:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/gimp-3-0-roadmap/layer-effects-drop-out.webp" alt="Layer Effects slide-out" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>If you have a look at the <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/specifications/layer-effects-ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full proposal</a> on the GIMP developers website, you’ll see that it should be possible to stack effects and edit their masks. They thought about a lot of things, which is great.</p>
<p>But it also looks like completing the full proposal is not something you can do in 3 to 4 weeks before the feature freeze. So there is a strong possibility that we will either end up with a basic implementation for 3.0 and then see more in the next updates. Or the developers will postpone this patch till version 3.0.2 that is expected to be released soon after 3.0.</p>
<p>In other words, the worst case scenario here is that GIMP 3.0 loses that bit of numerology where a release with a fancy number gets a fancy new feature. Personally, I’m okay with that idea. We’ve been waiting for non-destructive editing for frigging 23 years since the beginning of the work on GEGL, two or three more months — it’s not too bad. But judging by the response on Twitter the first possibility is more likely to happen which means a basic implementation in 3.0:</p>

    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah, the GUI can be improved iteratively (as long as it's not *horrible*; i.e. not perfect yet in releasable state). Though the file format side will have to be stable (this can't change version after version for compatibility).<br>I think it is feasible for <a href="https://twitter.com/CmykStudent?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CmykStudent</a> ! :-)</p>— @ZeMarmot@fosstodon.org (@zemarmot) <a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1727066806282842537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></blockquote>




<p>So let’s wait and see.</p>
<h2 id="api-changes">
    <a href="#api-changes">
	API changes
    </a>
</h2>
<p>The second important topic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a> changes. This is something I’m actually more concerned about. Historically, this has been the number one reason for long, long development cycles in GIMP. Jehan specifically says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not including API features on purpose in the freeze, because I think an additional month for the last little tweaks may be worth it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the ongoing changes here is the new API that helps make GIMP more omnivore in terms of color spaces and color models. So instead of functions like GimpRGB and GimpCMYK built right inside GIMP you get an exposure to all the color models available in <a href="https://gegl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GEGL</a> and <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">babl</a>, and that’s a lot.</p>
<p>babl <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/Reference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> the entire CIE family of color models — LAB, LCH, YUV, XYZ — as well as newer things like <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKlab</a>. Not to mention CMYK, HSV, HSL, and friends. Most recently, GEGL itself <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gegl/-/commit/3c4479f6511f1fc6f7f31a33fd938f5427286bfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got functions</a> for getting and setting CMYK colors.</p>
<p>My primary concern here is that getting and setting colors is something that happens in GIMP all the time, even if you don’t see it in the user interface. Just searching for ‘GimpRGB’ reveals almost 800 instances in the part related to user interface and over 400 instances in the backend code. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Which means that attempting to complete this API rewrite in time for the release will keep Jehan away from bug fixing. And that is the third important topic here.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixing">
    <a href="#bug-fixing">
	Bug fixing
    </a>
</h2>
<p>The situation with bugs in GIMP — and I’m sorry I have no other words for this — is getting out of hand. They recently <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed the 4K mark</a>, which is, like, a 30% increase in just about a year. Of those 4K+ bug reports and feature requests a whopping <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=1.%20Crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">624 bugs</a> are crashers. And that is just crazy.</p>
<p>One possibility here is to declare amnesty for all bug reports filed against the current stable series and then reopen the ones that will be reproduced by users in the new release. That would be a quite horrible policy of dealing with bug reports. But given the bug reporting dynamics and the availability of developers, I just don’t see any other way to handle this. It’s that or never getting to actually do the release.</p>
<p>There are many more things I’m still concerned about. The incorrect scale at which the canvas is rendered on HiDPI displays, the insane controls in tool settings, and other things.</p>
<p>Look, I’m just being realistic here. Completing this release is going to take a huge toll on the team. If you are in a position to help them with stabilizing the program, please consider doing so.</p>
<p>Once 3.0 is released, we can have a long conversation about the way the team plans their work, which is not great, and the way they finance it, which is even worse. But right now the community needs to finish off this SOB of a release.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As neural systems such as the brain organise themselves and make connections, they have to balance competing demands. For example, energy and resources are needed to grow and sustain the network in physical space, while at the same time optimising the network for information processing. This trade-off shapes all brains within and across species, which may help explain why many brains converge on similar organisational solutions.</p>

<p>Jascha Achterberg, a Gates Scholar from the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (MRC CBU) at the University of Cambridge said: “Not only is the brain great at solving complex problems, it does so while using very little energy. In our new work we show that considering the brain’s problem solving abilities alongside its goal of spending as few resources as possible can help us understand why brains look like they do.”</p>

<p>Co-lead author Dr Danyal Akarca, also from the MRC CBU, added: “This stems from a broad principle, which is that biological systems commonly evolve to make the most of what energetic resources they have available to them. The solutions they come to are often very elegant and reflect the trade-offs between various forces imposed on them.”</p>

<p>In a study published today in <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em>, Achterberg, Akarca and colleagues created an artificial system intended to model a very simplified version of the brain and applied physical constraints. They found that their system went on to develop certain key characteristics and tactics similar to those found in human brains.</p>

<p>Instead of real neurons, the system used computational nodes. Neurons and nodes are similar in function, in that each takes an input, transforms it, and produces an output, and a single node or neuron might connect to multiple others, all inputting information to be computed.</p>

<p>In their system, however, the researchers applied a ‘physical’ constraint on the system. Each node was given a specific location in a virtual space, and the further away two nodes were, the more difficult it was for them to communicate. This is similar to how neurons in the human brain are organised.</p>

<p>The researchers gave the system a simple task to complete – in this case a simplified version of a maze navigation task typically given to animals such as rats and macaques when studying the brain, where it has to combine multiple pieces of information to decide on the shortest route to get to the end point.</p>

<p>One of the reasons the team chose this particular task is because to complete it, the system needs to maintain a number of elements – start location, end location and intermediate steps – and once it has learned to do the task reliably, it is possible to observe, at different moments in a trial, which nodes are important. For example, one particular cluster of nodes may encode the finish locations, while others encode the available routes, and it is possible to track which nodes are active at different stages of the task.</p>

<p>Initially, the system does not know how to complete the task and makes mistakes. But when it is given feedback it gradually learns to get better at the task. It learns by changing the strength of the connections between its nodes, similar to how the strength of connections between brain cells changes as we learn. The system then repeats the task over and over again, until eventually it learns to perform it correctly.</p>

<p>With their system, however, the physical constraint meant that the further away two nodes were, the more difficult it was to build a connection between the two nodes in response to the feedback. In the human brain, connections that span a large physical distance are expensive to form and maintain.</p>

<p>When the system was asked to perform the task under these constraints, it used some of the same tricks used by real human brains to solve the task. For example, to get around the constraints, the artificial systems started to develop hubs – highly connected nodes that act as conduits for passing information across the network.</p>

<p>More surprising, however, was that the response profiles of individual nodes themselves began to change: in other words, rather than having a system where each node codes for one particular property of the maze task, like the goal location or the next choice, nodes developed a flexible coding scheme. This means that at different moments in time nodes might be firing for a mix of the properties of the maze. For instance, the same node might be able to encode multiple locations of a maze, rather than needing specialised nodes for encoding specific locations. This is another feature seen in the brains of complex organisms.</p>

<p>Co-author Professor Duncan Astle, from Cambridge’s Department of Psychiatry, said: “This simple constraint – it’s harder to wire nodes that are far apart – forces artificial systems to produce some quite complicated characteristics. Interestingly, they are characteristics shared by biological systems like the human brain. I think that tells us something fundamental about why our brains are organised the way they are.”</p>

<h2>Understanding the human brain</h2>

<p>The team are hopeful that their AI system could begin to shed light on how these constraints, shape differences between people’s brains, and contribute to differences seen in those that experience cognitive or mental health difficulties.</p>

<p>Co-author Professor John Duncan from the MRC CBU said: “These artificial brains give us a way to understand the rich and bewildering data we see when the activity of real neurons is recorded in real brains.”</p>

<p>Achterberg added: “Artificial ‘brains’ allow us to ask questions that it would be impossible to look at in an actual biological system. We can train the system to perform tasks and then play around experimentally with the constraints we impose, to see if it begins to look more like the brains of particular individuals.”</p>

<h2>Implications for designing future AI systems</h2>

<p>The findings are likely to be of interest to the AI community, too, where they could allow for the development of more efficient systems, particularly in situations where there are likely to be physical constraints.</p>

<p>Dr Akarca said: “AI researchers are constantly trying to work out how to make complex, neural systems that can encode and perform in a flexible way that is efficient. To achieve this, we think that neurobiology will give us a lot of inspiration. For example, the overall wiring cost of the system we've created is much lower than you would find in a typical AI system.”</p>

<p>Many modern AI solutions involve using architectures that only superficially resemble a brain. The researchers say their works shows that the type of problem the AI is solving will influence which architecture is the most powerful to use.</p>

<p>Achterberg said: “If you want to build an artificially-intelligent system that solves similar problems to humans, then ultimately the system will end up looking much closer to an actual brain than systems running on large compute cluster that specialise in very different tasks to those carried out by humans. The architecture and structure we see in our artificial ‘brain’ is there because it is beneficial for handling the specific brain-like challenges it faces.”</p>

<p>This means that robots that have to process a large amount of constantly changing information with finite energetic resources could benefit from having brain structures not dissimilar to ours.</p>

<p>Achterberg added: “Brains of robots that are deployed in the real physical world are probably going to look more like our brains because they might face the same challenges as us. They need to constantly process new information coming in through their sensors while controlling their bodies to move through space towards a goal. Many systems will need to run all their computations with a limited supply of electric energy and so, to balance these energetic constraints with the amount of information it needs to process, it will probably need a brain structure similar to ours.”</p>

Moreover, it is understood that non-senescent cells within the elderly tissue still proliferate. However, the reason for the decline in organic function in the elderly as they age remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that there might be a subset of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process within the tissue, significantly impacting and ultimately leading to organic dysfunction in the elderly. Here, we propose the existence of intermediate stage cells that are neither youthful nor senescent. We termed these cells as “mid-old cells.” Moreover, these cells would likely accumulate in the stromal region of the tissues for the following reasons. Epithelium, which undergo differentiation rather than self-replication, have shorter lifespans and undergo periodic replacement<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

Here, we found that the major population of local organic fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells are mid-old status.

Primary human fibroblasts were sub-cultured in increasing passages, observing flattened morphology and decreased proliferation along with reduced Ki67 expression and EdU incorporation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">1a</a>). Sub-cultured fibroblasts could be categorized into three groups based on doubling time (DT) and SA-β-Gal positivity: early passage named ‘young’ (1-2 days DT, &lt;1% SA-β-Gal), middle passage named ‘mid-old’ (5-7 days DT, &lt;5% SA-β-Gal), and later passage named ‘old’ (&gt;14 days DT, &gt;65% SA-β-Gal). Notably, these three cell groups exhibit distinct expression patterns of conventional senescence markers, p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, p21<sup>Waf1</sup>, and p53. Fibroblasts in the early passage did not express those senescent markers (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig1">1a</a>).

However, in our studies, recombinant human SAA1 (rhSAA1) increased expression of MMPs only, especially <i>MMP9</i>, in fibroblasts and muscular mucosa smooth muscle cells (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3b, c</a>) via NFκB signaling (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">10a</a>). Thus, the expression of MMP9 was considered a characteristic of mid-old and old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">10b</a>). These findings suggest that SAA1 may contribute to the development of aging-related microenvironments by promoting the degradation of ECM components. Indeed, MMP9 protein expression was robustly increased in elderly tissues that expressed SAA1 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3d</a>).

The thickness of the muscular mucosa, which exhibited high expression of SAA1 in the colon, was significantly reduced in tissues from elderly subjects (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3f</a>). Although we attempted to assess the thickness of the bronchial smooth muscle layer, irregularities in histological sectioning hindered precise measurements in lung tissue. We then investigated the impact of SAA1 on epithelial cells, specifically their function in ionic exchange and water reabsorption capacity. Interestingly, SAA1 did not alter the expression of genes associated with these functions in colonic epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">12</a>). These findings suggest that SAA1 directly affected mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, but not epithelial cells.

Maintaining the integrity of the BM is crucial for proper epithelial cell function, and remnants of degraded ECM components, known as ‘Matrikines<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Sivaraman, K. &amp; Shanthi, C.

Therefore, we evaluated epithelial cell function based on BM stability. Although the mRNA levels of type IV collagen, a major component of the BM, did not show significant difference between elderly and young-aged tissues (GSE178341<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Pelka, K. et al.

Type IV collagen mRNA expression was downregulated only in old fibroblasts, and treating with rhSAA1 did not decrease type IV collagen mRNA levels in young fibroblasts (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3h</a>). Hence, it is considered that the downregulation of type IV collagen in the BM of elderly organs is likely due to its degradation by MMP9 rather than reduced production of type IV collagen. To test this hypothesis in vitro, we cultured young or mid-old fibroblasts in Matrigel containing type IV collagen and found that collagen IV degradation was more pronounced in the presence of mid-old fibroblasts (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3i</a>).

To address this question, we proposed that young cells may prevent the onset of senescence in adjacent mid-old cells. However, if the senescence-driving factors outweigh the inhibitory ability of young cells, a large population of mid-old cells would rapidly enter the senescence program (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig5">5a</a>). This effect is likely mediated by multiple factors released from young cells. Co-culturing old cells with young cells did not elicit a response from the old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">14a</a>).

These data indicate that increased proliferative ability alone is not sufficient for reversal of aging phenotype, suggesting the involvement of other primary mechanisms. Previously, we proposed CXCL12 as a juvenile factor, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting T-cell infiltration<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Choi, Y.

However, CXCL12 itself did not affect the expression of inflammatory genes in mid-old fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">16</a>). In contrast, SLIT2, identified as a representative young cell secretory factor in our in vitro studies, is a known anti-inflammatory protein that progressively decreases as cells become senescent. To assess the impact of young cell driven SLIT2 on mid-old cells, we treated mid-old fibroblasts with recombinant human SLIT2 protein (rhSLIT2). Treatment with rhSLIT2 resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory genes and proteins, including SAA1 and IL1β, through inhibition of Pyk2-NFκB signaling<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Zhao, H., Anand, A.

SLIT2 overexpression also showed similar effects (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6c</a>). Surprisingly, long-term treatment with rhSLIT2 protein restored the morphology of mid-old fibroblasts, causing them to revert to a small and spindle-shaped morphology reminiscent of young cells. To exclude the possibility of proliferation in young cells within the mid-old cell population in response to rhSLIT2, we treated young cells with rhSLIT2 and observed that young cells did not undergo increased proliferation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17a</a>). Additionally, the proliferative capacity of mid-old fibroblasts was recovered, accompanied by decreased levels of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> mRNA and protein in a p53-independent manner (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6d, e</a>).

Treatment with rhSLIT2 in mid-old cells resulted in upregulated expression of <i>SOX2</i> and <i>OCT4</i> (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6f</a>). The expression of known SLIT2 receptors, including <i>ROBO2</i> and <i>ROBO4</i>, was not significantly downregulated in mid-old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17b</a>), suggesting that the effect of SLIT2 is not solely due to decreased receptor activity. To further investigate the role of SLIT2, we downregulated SLIT2 expression using shRNA in young fibroblasts. SLIT2 downregulation induced the expression of inflammation-related genes and proteins, including IL1β and SAA1, and decreased the proliferation ability of the cells (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6g, h</a>). These findings suggest that a decrease in SLIT2 itself could promote senescence process. We further confirmed the effect of SLIT2 by adding back rhSLIT2 protein to shRNA-infected young cells, which resulted in the downregulation of the expression of upregulated inflammatory genes (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6i</a>).

Thus, we hypothesized that SLIT2 could be an anti-aging factor in both species. We conducted two independent experiments using aged mice.

In the in vitro experiments (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6</a>), rhSLIT2 treatment showed effects when applied for a long period.

In this second experiment, we analyzed additional indices including activity, muscle weight, the number of mid-old cells in tissues, and blood analysis. Activity in the cage and hanging ability were measured before and after rmSLIT2 treatment to reduce animal to animal bias. During the experiment, body weight showed decreasing tendency in the rmSLIT2-treated groups. After 10 rounds of treatment, mouse aging-related characteristics significantly improved. Specifically, activity in the cage and hanging ability increased (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig7">7a, b</a>, and Supplementary Movie&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM8">3</a>).

The accumulation of senescent cells in the organs of the elderly may provide a plausible explanation for this decline. Multiple studies employing various senescence models have consistently demonstrated an increase in p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-positive cells, which are believed to be senescent, in aged mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Omori and colleagues revealed that the proportion of tdTomato (p16<sup>INK4A</sup>)-positive cells increased in aged mice; in the lung, skin, liver and kidney tissues of 12-month-old mice compared to 2-month-old mice using p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-CreERT2-tdTomato mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

While senescent cells can exert a significant impact on their surrounding environment through the expression of SASPs, we have conjectured that this phenomenon, which is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, may not be the sole explanation for the functional decline observed in aged organs. This is because p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-negative cells still make up the majority of the organ’s population according to the abovementioned studies<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Instead, we put forth a hypothesis that the accumulation of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process, referred to as ‘mid-old’ cells in the current study, might be another relevant factor in understanding this decline in organ function. Interestingly, our current data show that a considerable number of mesenchymal cells in aged organs exhibit the intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process rather than epithelial cells. This might be related to the relatively rapid turnover of epithelial cells, which predominately undergo apoptosis or are phagocytized by macrophages prior to induction of the senescence process<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

The full extent of the effects of senescent and mid-old cells on the functional decline observed in aged organs remains uncertain. However, there is a strong indication that these cells may have a synergistic effect, meaning that their combined presence and activities could play a significant role in contributing to this decline. Further research is needed to better understand the interplay between senescent and mid-old cells and their collective impact on organ function during the aging process, and this interaction will be another interesting future studies.</p><p>Our in vitro transcriptomic studies showed that mid-old cells are functionally impaired compared to young cells; ECM formation, proliferation capacity, and tissue regeneration ability are significantly decreased. Nevertheless, it was observed that mid-old cells undergo a certain degree of functional recovery through the paracrine effect of substances released by young cells. Our study revealed that SLIT2 had a positive impact on the functional capacity of mid-old cells, although it remains uncertain whether it increased their maximum functional limit or enhanced their remaining functional potential. This is consistent with a prior study which demonstrated that <i>Slit2</i>-transgenic mice had improved organ function during aging<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Li, G. et al. Overexpression of Slit2 improves function of the paravascular pathway in the aging mouse brain. Int. J. Mol. Med. 42, 1935–1944 (2018)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d1247026e2274">46</a></sup>. Surprisingly, SLIT2 decreased inflammatory response and improved proliferative capacity only in mid-old, but not in old fibroblasts. Moreover, SAA1 expression was regulated by SLIT2, but SAA1 is not related to cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">22</a>). Therefore, SLIT2 is a potential cell cycle regulator, and this could be attributed to the upregulation of stem cell factors, including SOX2 and OCT4. Previous reports demonstrated that SOX2 and OCT4 regulate the downregulation of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> expression via direct binding to its promoter or DNA methyltransferase<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Yamamizu, K., Schlessinger, D. &amp; Ko, M.

Based on our cautious interpretation, we suggest that SLIT2 may enhance cell proliferation by upregulating stem cell factors, particularly SOX2. However, it is important to note that effects of SLIT2 are not universally applicable. Specifically, senescent fibroblasts did not exhibit a response to SLIT2, and mid-old fibroblasts showed diminished effectiveness when DT exceeded 8 days (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">23</a>). Here, another important question arises: Can SLIT2 extend lifespan? Although our mouse sample size was small (<i>n</i> = 4, each), we administered PBS or rmSLIT2 injections once a week to 23-month-old mice and measured longevity. However, we did not observe evidence that SLIT2 extends lifespan, which is a major drawback of this study. Nonetheless, we believe that further investigation using a larger sample size of aged mice is necessary to draw conclusive results.</p><p>Regarding the changes in colon function with aging, we observed alterations in gene expression related to water absorption and the smooth muscle function involved in bowel movements in the large intestine. Specifically, we observed that the muscular mucosa layer became thinner in elderly colon tissue, and this was associated with increased expression of SAA1. Additionally, the expression of ‘Atrogenes’ was heightened in smooth muscle cells due to the presence of SAA1. Our findings suggest that SAA1 can induce atrophy in smooth muscle cells and may contribute to systematic muscle atrophy as circulating SAA1 levels increase with age. These results imply that targeting the master regulators of SAA1 directly could potentially prevent muscle mass loss in elderly individuals. Furthermore, we noted an increase in the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>, genes related to water absorption, in colon and lung epithelial cells in aged tissues. Notably, this increase in <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> expression was not attributed to SAA1 but rather appeared to be induced by the effects of degraded ECM on the stromal microenvironment. These degraded ECM fragments were found to function as ‘Matrikines,’ which upregulated signaling pathways such as Erk1/2, JNK, and NFκB. It is through these pathways that the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> is regulated. Therefore, collagen degradation by MMPs could serve as ‘Matrikines,’ potentially leading to increased expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>.</p><p>This study offers new insights into the heterogeneous nature of the senescence ecosystem. The current concept and definition of senescence can be somewhat broad and vague. While the term ‘cellular senescence’ is often used interchangeably with ‘irreversible cell cycle arrest<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Gorgoulis, V. et al.

Furthermore, the ‘mid-old cells’ identified in our study could represent an intermediate state of cellular senescence, as they are positive for the conventional markers, such as p21<sup>Waf1</sup> and IL1β. We demonstrated that the reduced or halted proliferation capacity of these mid-old cells can be reversed with appropriate stimulation. However, the borderline of cellular traits and the definition between ‘mid-old’ and ‘early senescence’ is still vague, and the additional study is needed to elucidate this question. Moreover, previously mentioned facts suggest that there could be various subtypes within the cellular senescence which makes us hard to understand the overall senescence ecosystem. Senescence encompasses various stages in cellular development, including early phases where proliferation ability can be restored, as well as later stages where cells take on specialized roles in molecule secretion or play a role in either promoting or inhibiting immune clearance processes. Furthermore, the trait of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions can be different from those in normal tissues, and the role of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions, such as age-related diseases will be another interesting future study.</p><p>Conclusively, our results demonstrated that most fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the organs of elderly subjects were in the mid-old status. Furthermore, SLIT2 protein originating from young cells could act as an anti-aging protein for mid-old cells. Collectively, the study proposes a new strategy for anti-aging, including targeting mid-old cells and restoring young cell factors to improve quality of life in elderly persons.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><div id="Sec9-content"><h3 id="Sec10">Human tissue experiments</h3><p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Hospital (AJIRB-BMR-OBS-20-552, Suwon, Korea), and informed consent was obtained from all patients, parents, or legal guardians as appropriate.

To prepare the data for analysis, Skewer version 0.2.2 was used to trim potentially existing sequencing adapters and raw quality bases from the raw reads. The resulting high-quality reads were then mapped to the reference genome using STAR version 2.5 software. A sequencing library was prepared by LAS Inc. (Gimpo, Korea). Gene models based on the gene annotation of the reference genome hg38 from the UCSC genome in GTF format were used to calculate gene expression values in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) units. Heatmaps drawn in this study used FPKM data to visualize the gene expression. For variance stabilizing transformation (VST) and GSEA, raw sequencing data are trimmed and mapped using AltAnalyze (v.2.1.4.3). Raw count data are loaded in the R (v 4.0.3) DESeq2 package (v.1.38.3). DESeq data set was generated using ‘DESeq’ function. Sample distance was generated by calculating VST and drawn using ‘pheatmap’ function. GSEA was performed using the “fgsea” package (v.1.24.0) from R. Permutations were performed 1000 times, and <i>p</i> values were calculated using statistics from GSEA. The weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics were calculated to a running sum of a ranked gene list.</p><h3 id="Sec19">Analysis of public scRNA-seq datasets for human tissues</h3><p>In the analysis of cells from normal tissue, the publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, GSE178341<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Pelka, K. et al.
