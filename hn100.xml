Patty and her husband enjoy the kind of neighborhood so many of us would like - connected, helpful, fun - but it wasn’t that way two years ago. A simple tradition changed their neighborhood and is a good reminder of how small, consistent actions can have outsize results. It also shows you don’t have to share a kitchen or a roof to live in community. </em></p><p>18 months ago, I wasn’t planning on spending more time hanging out with my neighbors than with friends I’d known for decades. It started with a simple goal: my husband Tyler and I wanted that sense of community that feels like it’s only possible in the suburbs, but we believed we could achieve this while living in San Francisco. We brainstormed: should we make cookies and knock on doors? Should we invite neighbors over for dinner? Ultimately, we landed on sipping coffee on our “stoop”.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb8c21-aa8c-4ef1-94b7-60434d27763e_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Tyler (left) and Patty (me! right) on one of our first stoop coffees</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Hanging out on a stoop is not a novel concept. Unfortunately, an increasing trend of isolation has resulted in fewer and fewer neighbors gathering to connect with one another. Stooping has provided benefits to so many communities. Why not bring this concept to my own neighborhood?</p><p>Tyler and I were already having leisurely weekend morning coffees in our house, so it was an easy pivot to sit outside with our coffees and enjoy the sunshine. And thus our tradition began. Every weekend, we would bring our folding chairs out onto the street – we had to make do since our house doesn’t have a stoop – and enjoy our caffeine. As we saw people entering or exiting their homes, we'd enthusiastically wave them down, introduce ourselves, and write down their names in our shared spreadsheet. I wore a goofy tie-dyed Six Flags hat so people would remember us as “those people” and we started calling this our brand awareness campaign (but of course, we live in SF).</p><p>We met Luke a month or two after we’d been “stooping” on a regular basis. He came by to introduce himself and asked to exchange numbers so we could let him know if we’d be out there in the future, he’d love to join. At the time we didn’t realize how important this moment was for us. We’d been meeting many neighbors in passing but Luke was the first person to offer to sit with us and he wanted to know how to coordinate. In retrospect we should have been trying to get peoples’ numbers all along but hey, we were new to this!</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A typical weekend stoop hang</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>As soon as Luke started coming to stoop we actually started to resemble a group. It was validating to see a few neighbors getting together and this quickly attracted more! We learned to bring extra folding chairs for people who wanted to drop in for “just a minute” (or ninety) and Luke started bringing homebrew coffee to share. After a while, we realized it was starting to become unwieldy texting everyone when we were going to be outside. Thus, the WhatsApp group was born. At first this was just a place to announce when we’d be out having stoop coffee, but we soon realized people wanted to connect over more things than just coffee. So we ended up converting the group into a </span><a href="https://www.cooby.co/en/post/whatsapp-communities" rel="">WhatsApp Community</a><span> where we could have chats dedicated to certain topics or groups and plan other types of events together. Things were starting to get fun!</span></p><p>The first larger event that our “stoopers” wanted to host together was a block party that soon got scoped down to a pancake party. We made a spreadsheet, assigned tasks, and acquired obscene amounts of pancake mix. We decided to host the party on the sidewalk in front of our neighbor’s garage to keep things easy and so we didn’t have to apply for permits. Gathering tables, chairs and an electric griddle was quick work with so many neighbors invested in making the party a success. The most important thing we did in preparation for this party was to print out 100 door drops to deliver to the nearest set of neighbors and post party fliers up on telephone poles. It was old school but it worked! Most of the new faces we saw were people who found out about the event through our paper invitations.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png" width="1172" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:1172,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Pancake Party in full swing</figcaption></figure></div><p>The event was a resounding success. 70+ people came by, and we added over 50 new numbers to our WhatsApp Community. From that point forward, each stoop coffee started seeing at least 10-15 faces and new people were volunteering to host. A few neighbor gatherings later – including an epic “Dipsgiving” sidewalk potluck where everyone brought a dip to share – the momentum has continued and we now have multiple events every week. During the span of a recent week in December, we had a neighborhood trash pickup, a cookie swap, a TV show watch party, a parent hang at a neighborhood brewery, and—of course—a stoop coffee.</p><p>As I write this post, I realize that the “we” from earlier in the post has grown from just Tyler and me to a “we” that represents many more people who are invested in our community. It feels like our neighborhood is thriving. The in-person gatherings continue even without much intervention from the original few who got the ball rolling. The daily chatter on our WhatsApp is so gosh darn wholesome. Someone even sold a car in our ‘classifieds’ chat! Tyler and I have made many new friends in the neighborhood, and our neighbors who never knew each other before are becoming friends with each other. Our neighborhood community is now a group of people that we rely on and who rely on us for emotional support, last-minute childcare, home-cooked meals, general comradery, and much more. The best part is that I can tell we are still early in our growth, there are still many people to meet, and I feel a palpable sense of awe when I learn about a new skill or talent that exists right next door.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Keeping it simple</strong><span>: we’ve realized that some of our best events require the smallest amount of effort. To avoid burnout, we’ve intentionally kept our community building as low-lift as possible, which has the added benefit of creating space for other people to step up.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Broadening vs. deepening</strong><span>: we bucket our events into “broadening” events which have the purpose of meeting new neighbors and “deepening” events which allow us to get to know our existing neighbors better. Being aware of that classification has helped us be strategic depending on what feels needed for the time and season.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Seasonal events</strong><span>: Naturally, the colder months have become a better time for deepening events that often occur in someone’s home (e.g. TV show watch parties, cookie swaps, potlucks), while warmer events are better for getting together outside and broadening our community (e.g. sidewalk chalk murals, pancake parties, bonus evening stoop beers).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The street as a third space</strong><span>: most of our stoop coffees are held in the street in front of someone’s driveway. This has the benefit of being visible and inviting to other neighbors, while making use of a previously underutilized space. It’s also got us thinking of other unused spaces that we can turn into community-gathering spots, such as turning a nearby parking spot into a parklet or a transit stop into a community gathering space.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Relying on the community:</strong><span> It can often feel overwhelming to take on planning a big event. We started using the phrase “the universe provides” because the real magic is found in asking and giving freely within the community. It’s a daily treat to see neighbors stepping up for one another in unexpected ways now that more of us are connected!</span></p></li></ul><p>Our biggest goal in the coming year is to help more people organize in-person events and build towards a future where the community is sustainable even if we ever (god forbid!) move away. We’ve also been looking to connect with local businesses and influence policy matters that impact our local footprint. A few of us met recently to ideate on how we can keep vibrant commerce happening at our local businesses and how to best connect with the city decision-makers responsible for issues that impact our neighborhood community. To inform where we spend our energy, we’ve been starting with the issues that folks in the community care about and want to change (yes, we asked people at a recent block party!). We are also trying to find quick wins in collaborating with the city government to show that our voices can be heard and have a positive impact.</p><p>I cherish the neighbors I’ve met and am so grateful for the many people who put time and effort into building our community (Luke and Tyler, in particular, deserve a special shoutout). As we continue to grow, I’m excited to keep learning from others – please reach out if you want to brainstorm about neighborhood community building!</p><p><em><span>Thanks Patty for sharing your story!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes we invite artists, writers, and other friends to take over <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/newsletter">our newsletter</a> and write about fonts from a cultural perspective. And this time, New York-based writer and editor <em>Whitney Mallett</em> took a deep dive into the 1997 Towa Tei track <strong>GBI (German Bold Italic),</strong> for which Kylie Minogue sang from the perspective of a typeface.</p><div><p>Whitney is the editor of <a href="https://www.whitneyreview.org/">The Whitney Review of New Writing</a>, a biannual print bulletin of new criticism, and she was also the co-editor of <a href="https://www.pinupmagazine.org/articles/barbie-dreamhouse-architectural-survey">Barbie Dreamhouse: An Architectural Survey</a>.  Below, she enlightens us on the highly under-appreciated history of Towa Tei’s data-track font release.</p></div><section id="i-contrast-its-cool-when-kylie-minogue-was-german-bold-italic" tabindex="0"><p><h2>“I Contrast, It’s Cool”: When Kylie Minogue Was German Bold Italic</h2></p><figure></figure><div><p>Kylie Minogue announces “I am a typeface” in a 1997 song she made with producer Towa Tei. As this lyric suggests, the techno-pop track in question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fw2Labli4k">“GBI (German Bold Italic)”</a>, is delivered from the perspective of a font. Minogue’s breathy, almost robotic vocals bring the absurdist premise to life, reciting declarations of design compatibility over a minimalist reverb-drenched beat. <em>“You will like my sense of style”</em> is her most oft-repeated refrain.</p><p>German Bold Italic (three words Minogue intones throughout the track with staccato punctuation) is a real typeface, which was created to accompany the musical release. To develop it, Tei tapped artist <em>Hiro Sugiyama</em>, who had that same year launched the commercial design studio Enlightenment. The high-impact techno typography not only defined the record’s text-centric cover, but a glyph set was made available as a data track on Tei’s Sound Museum CD and also downloadable from both Tei’s and Minogue’s official websites. Extra-thick and geometric, the font had something in common with the heavy black frames that were Tei’s hallmark at the time. Another line from the song: <em>“I contrast, it’s cool.”</em></p></div><figure></figure><div><p>When this offbeat track came out, Minogue was one of the biggest pop stars in the world. The Australian “I Should Be So Lucky” singer rose to fame as a teenager in the late 1980s for clear vocals that complemented the precision of disco and dance-pop perfectly. She’s like Donna Summer in that way, a vessel for songs that can be hugely innovative and futuristic without compromising mainstream appeal. By her fifth studio album, the eponymously titled <em>Kylie Minogue (1994)</em>, she was starting to show she was curious about experimenting with different sounds and high-concept visuals. In 1995 she collaborated on a murder ballad duet with Nick Cave, and by the time she joined forces with Tei, she was dating music video director (and Björk ex) Stéphane Sednaoui, who’s often credited with influencing Minogue’s art-pop risk-taking. Sednaoui directed the video for “GBI (German Bold Italic).” In it, Minogue is dressed like a geisha roaming the streets of Tokyo (despite Tei’s involvement, the video no doubt reads today as cultural appropriation.)</p><p>Tei was a big deal back then too. Originally from Japan, he had moved to New York to study fashion in the 1980s and became one of the founding members, along with <em>Lady Miss Kier</em> and <em>DJ Dmitry</em>, of the dance music group <em>Dee-Lite</em>. Their breakthrough hit, <em>“Groove is In the Heart” (1990)</em>, undeniably one of the decade’s defining house music tracks, peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. A few years before Tei’s collaboration with Minogue, at Dee-Lite’s height, he decided to quit the group and move back to Japan to focus on solo projects — in part because he’d suffered a back injury from a fall which affected his ability to tour. Sound Museum — which “GBI” the song and glyph set feature on — was his second solo album. In addition to Minogue, he recruited an eclectic group of artists for the project, from rappers Biz Markie and Mos Def to bossa nova royalty Bebel Gilberto. “GBI,” however, is the only song about a font.</p></div><figure></figure><p>Leading up to the turn of the millennium, typography trends included a revival of thick, rounded, condensed, futuristic san-serifs from the late ’60s and early ’70s. German Bold Italic feels part of this wave. So does <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> logo, designed for the TV show which first aired in 1998, a year after Tei and Minogue’s song. <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25101/german-bold-italic-towa-tei-ft-kylie-minogue-">In the comments section of fontsinsuse.com</a>, the site’s editor Florian Hardwig compares German Bold Italic to <em>Futura Extra Bold Italic</em>. He points out, however, that while Futura is German, released by the Bauer Foundry in Frankfurt in 1927, Futura Extra Bold isn’t German at all: “It was added by Edwin W. Shaar for Intertype in the US in 1952, based on Paul Renner’s design. The oblique followed in 1955, made by Shaar together with Tommy Thompson.” Another user named Thiago, points out that, rather ironically, the glyph set for German Bold Italic doesn’t support the German language.</p><figure></figure><p>Despite being made available for anyone to download (you can still download it via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041130183630/http://www.kylie.co.uk/desktop/gbi.TTF">an old version of Minogue’s website</a>, accessible using the Wayback Machine), German Bold Italic’s only documented usage outside of Tei and Minogue’s promo is by artist <em>Cory Arcangel</em>. In 2015, Arcangel used the font for merch he designed for the Brooklyn pop group Wet. Heather grey sweatshirts were screenprinted <em>“WWW. / KANYEWET / .BIZ”</em> in super chunky black all-caps. (The band long used this URL for their website as a cheeky gag, though today the domain is dead.) In an interview with The Fader, Arcangel explained:</p><p>I’ve used the font a few times in the past for artworks (I showed some drawings on paper watermarked with my name in GBI at my Whitney show in 2011) but I’ve always wanted to use it to make a shirt for a pop group… one pop group used to advertise the next. Also it’s a sick classic vector techno font, and super rare these days.</p><div><p>It’s a style that’s less rare today. But still, German Bold Italic in particular, I’d love to see it more.</p><p>Minogue sings, “Let me adorn you / The bold design of you.”</p></div><figure></figure></section><section id="more" tabindex="0"><p><h2>More</h2></p></section></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-03-25</p><section><p>7 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1SXiWOhmwfDs86m6u84i8l/7b6b0874f6f2f91964b87383349c7785/image2.png" alt=""><div><p>OPKSSH makes it easy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><u>SSH</u></a> with single sign-on technologies like OpenID Connect, thereby removing the need to manually manage and configure SSH keys. It does this without adding a trusted party other than your identity provider (IdP).</p><p>We are excited to announce <a href="https://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh/"><u>OPKSSH (OpenPubkey SSH)</u></a> has been open-sourced under the umbrella of the OpenPubkey project. While the underlying protocol <a href="https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/"><u>OpenPubkey</u></a> became <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-openpubkey-project"><u>an open source Linux foundation project in 2023</u></a>, OPKSSH was closed source and owned by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2024/cloudflare-acquires-bastionzero-to-add-zero-trust-infrastructure-access/"><u>BastionZero (now Cloudflare)</u></a>. Cloudflare has gifted this code to the OpenPubkey project, making it open source.</p><p>In this post, we describe what OPKSSH is, how it simplifies SSH management, and what OPKSSH being open source means for you.</p>
          <p>
            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
            
          </p>
          <p>A cornerstone of modern access control is single sign-on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sso/"><u>(SSO)</u></a>, where a user authenticates to an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/"><u>identity provider (IdP)</u></a>, and in response the IdP issues the user a <i>token</i>. The user can present this token to prove their identity, such as “Google says I am Alice”. SSO is the rare security technology that both increases convenience — users only need to sign in once to get access to many different systems — and increases security.</p>
          <p>
            <h3 id="openid-connect">OpenID Connect</h3>
            
          </p>
        <p><a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/"><u>OpenID Connect (OIDC)</u></a> is the main protocol used for SSO. As shown below, in OIDC the IdP, called an OpenID Provider (OP), issues the user an ID Token which contains identity claims about the user, such as “email is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7c1d10151f193c19041d110c1019521f1311">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>”. These claims are digitally signed by the OP, so anyone who receives the ID Token can check that it really was issued by the OP.</p><p>Unfortunately, while ID Tokens <i>do </i>include identity claims like name, organization, and email address, they <i>do not</i> include the user’s public key. This prevents them from being used to directly secure protocols like SSH or <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-end-to-end-encryption/"><u>End-to-End Encrypted messaging</u></a>.</p><p>Note that throughout this post we use the term OpenID Provider (OP) rather than IdP, as OP specifies the exact type of IdP we are using, i.e., an OpenID IdP. We use Google as an example OP, but OpenID Connect works with Google, Azure, Okta, etc.</p>

          </p>
        <p>OpenPubkey, shown below, adds public keys to ID Tokens. This enables ID Tokens to be used like certificates, e.g. “Google says <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="67060b0e040227021f060a170b024904080a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> is using public key 0x123.” We call an ID token that contains a public key a <i>PK Token</i>. The beauty of OpenPubkey is that, unlike other approaches, OpenPubkey does not require any changes to existing SSO protocols and supports any OpenID Connect compliant OP.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Shows a user Alice signing in to Google using OpenID Connect/OpenPubkey and then producing a PK Token</i></sup>
While OpenPubkey enables ID Tokens to be used as certificates, OPKSSH extends this functionality so that these ID Tokens can be used as SSH keys in the SSH protocol. This adds SSO authentication to SSH without requiring changes to the SSH protocol.</p>

          </p>
          <p>OPKSSH frees users and administrators from the need to manage long-lived SSH keys, making SSH more secure and more convenient.</p><blockquote><p><i>“In many organizations – even very security-conscious organizations – there are many times more obsolete authorized keys than they have employees. Worse, authorized keys generally grant command-line shell access, which in itself is often considered privileged. We have found that in many organizations about 10% of the authorized keys grant root or administrator access. SSH keys never expire.”</i>&nbsp; 
- <a href="https://ylonen.org/papers/ssh-key-challenges.pdf">Challenges in Managing SSH Keys – and a Call for Solutions</a> by Tatu Ylonen (Inventor of SSH)</p></blockquote><p>In SSH, users generate a long-lived SSH public key and SSH private key. To enable a user to access a server, the user or the administrator of that server configures that server to trust that user’s public key. Users must protect the file containing their SSH private key. If the user loses this file, they are locked out. If they copy their SSH private key to multiple computers or back up the key, they increase the risk that the key will be compromised. When a private key is compromised or a user no longer needs access, the user or administrator must remove that public key from any servers it currently trusts. All of these problems create headaches for users and administrators.</p><p>OPKSSH overcomes these issues:</p><p><b>Improved security:</b> OPKSSH replaces long-lived SSH keys with ephemeral SSH keys that are created on-demand by OPKSSH and expire when they are no longer needed. This reduces the risk a private key is compromised, and limits the time period where an attacker can use a compromised private key. By default, these OPKSSH public keys expire every 24 hours, but the expiration policy can be set in a configuration file.</p><p><b>Improved usability:</b> Creating an SSH key is as easy as signing in to an OP. This means that a user can SSH from any computer with opkssh installed, even if they haven’t copied their SSH private key to that computer.</p><p>To generate their SSH key, the user simply runs opkssh login, and they can use ssh as they typically do.</p><p><b>Improved visibility:</b> OPKSSH moves SSH from authorization by public key to authorization by identity. If Alice wants to give Bob access to a server, she doesn’t need to ask for his public key, she can just add Bob’s email address <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="87e5e8e5c7e2ffe6eaf7ebe2a9e4e8ea">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> to the OPKSSH authorized users file, and he can sign in. This makes tracking who has access much easier, since administrators can see the email addresses of the authorized users.</p><p>OPKSSH does not require any code changes to the SSH server or client. The only change needed to SSH on the SSH server is to add two lines to the SSH config file. For convenience, we provide an installation script that does this automatically, as seen in the video below.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Shows a user Alice SSHing into a server with her PK Token inside her SSH public key. The server then verifies her SSH public key using the OpenPubkey verifier.</i></sup></p><p>Let’s look at an example of Alice (<code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="187974717b7d587d60797568747d367b7775">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>) using OPKSSH to SSH into a server:</p><ul><li><p>Alice runs <code>opkssh login</code>. This command automatically generates an ephemeral public key and private key for Alice. Then it runs the OpenPubkey protocol by opening a browser window and having Alice log in through their SSO provider, e.g., Google.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If Alice SSOs successfully, OPKSSH will now have a PK Token that commits to Alice’s ephemeral public key and Alice’s identity. Essentially, this PK Token says “<code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0465686d676144617c65697468612a676b69">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> authenticated her identity and her public key is 0x123…”.</p></li><li><p>OPKSSH then saves to Alice’s <code>.ssh </code>directory:</p><ul><li><p>an SSH public key file that contains Alice’s PK Token&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>and an SSH private key set to Alice’s ephemeral private key.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When Alice attempts to SSH into a server, the SSH client will find the SSH public key file containing the PK Token in Alice’s <code>.ssh</code> directory, and it will send it to the SSH server to authenticate.</p></li><li><p>The SSH server forwards the received SSH public key to the OpenPubkey verifier installed on the SSH server. This is because the SSH server has been configured to use the OpenPubkey verifier via the AuthorizedKeysCommand.</p></li><li><p>The OpenPubkey verifier receives the SSH public key file and extracts the PK Token from it. It then verifies that the PK Token is unexpired, valid, signed by the OP and that the public key in the PK Token matches the public key field in the SSH public key file. Finally, it extracts the email address from the PK Token and checks if <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5c3d30353f391c39243d312c3039723f3331">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> is allowed to SSH into this server.</p></li></ul><p>Consider the problems we face in getting OpenPubkey to work with SSH without requiring any changes to the SSH protocol or software:</p><p><b>How do we get the PK Token from the user’s machine to the SSH server inside the SSH protocol?</b>
We use the fact that SSH public keys can be SSH certificates, and that SSH certificates have <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL.certkeys?rev=1.4&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup"><u>an extension field</u></a> that allows arbitrary data to be included in the certificate. Thus, we package the PK Token into an SSH certificate extension so that the PK Token will be transmitted inside the SSH public key as a normal part of the SSH protocol. This enables us to send the PK Token to the SSH server as additional data in the SSH certificate, and allows OPKSSH to work without any changes to the SSH client.</p><p><b>How do we check that the PK Token is valid once it arrives at the SSH server?
</b>SSH servers support a configuration parameter called the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#AuthorizedKeysCommand"><i><u>AuthorizedKeysCommand</u></i></a><i> </i>that allows us to use a custom program to determine if an SSH public key is authorized or not. Thus, we change the SSH server’s config file to use the OpenPubkey verifier instead of the SSH verifier by making the following two line change to <code>sshd_config</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/opkssh verify %u %k %t
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser root</code></pre>
            <p>The OpenPubkey verifier will check that the PK Token is unexpired, valid and signed by the OP. It checks the user’s email address in the PK Token to determine if the user is authorized to access the server.</p><p><b>How do we ensure that the public key in the PK Token is actually the public key that secures the SSH session?</b>
The OpenPubkey verifier also checks that the public key in the public key field in the SSH public key matches the user’s public key inside the PK Token. This works because the public key field in the SSH public key is the actual public key that secures the SSH session.</p>

<p>The week of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stood tall next to the president as he made a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/tech/openai-oracle-softbank-trump-ai-investment/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (dramatic announcement)">dramatic announcement</a>: the launch of Project Stargate, a $500 billion supercluster in the rolling plains of Texas that would run OpenAI’s massive artificial-intelligence models. Befitting its name, Stargate would dwarf most megaprojects in human history. Even the $100 billion that Altman promised would be deployed “immediately” would be much more expensive than the Manhattan Project ($30 billion in current dollars) and the COVID vaccine’s Operation Warp Speed ($18 billion), rivaling the multiyear construction of the Interstate Highway System ($114 billion). OpenAI would have all the computing infrastructure it needed to complete its ultimate goal of building humanity’s last invention: artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Art for this story was created with Midjourney 6.1, an AI image generator.</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>But the reaction to Stargate was muted as Silicon Valley had turned its attention west. A new generative AI model called DeepSeek R1, released by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, sent a threatening tremor through the balance sheets and investment portfolios of the tech industry. DeepSeek’s latest version, allegedly trained for just $6 million (though <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106612-deepseek-ai-costs-far-exceed-55-million-claim.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (this has been contested)">this has been contested</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (matched)">matched</a> the performance of OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model o1 <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (at 95 percent lower cost)">at 95 percent lower cost</a>. R1 even learned o1 reasoning techniques, OpenAI’s much-hyped “secret sauce” to allow it to maintain a wide technical lead over other models. Best of all, R1 is open-source down to the model weights, so anyone can download and modify the details of the model themselves for free.</p>

<p>It’s an existential threat to OpenAI’s business model, which depends on using its technical lead to sell the most expensive subscriptions in the industry. It also threatens to pop a speculative bubble around generative AI inflated by the Silicon Valley hype machine, with hundreds of billions at stake.</p>

<p>Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q2-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (about $200 billion into generative AI)">about $200 billion into generative AI</a>. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (71 percent of the total gains)">71 percent of the total gains</a> in the S&amp;P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI.

If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown.</p>

<h3><b>OpenAI’s Ever-Increasing Costs</b></h3>

<p>The basic problem facing Silicon Valley today is, ironically, one of growth. There are no more digital frontiers to conquer. The young, pioneering upstarts—Facebook, Google, Amazon—that struck out toward the digital wilderness are now the monopolists, constraining growth with onerous rentier fees they can charge because of their market-making size. The software industry’s spectacular returns from the launch of the internet in the ’90s to the end of the 2010s would never come back, but venture capitalists still chased the chance to invest in the next Facebook or Google. This has led to what AI critic Ed Zitron calls the “<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (rot economy)">rot economy</a>,” in which VCs overhype a series of digital technologies—the blockchain, then cryptocurrencies, then NFTs, and then the metaverse—promising the limitless growth of the early internet companies. According to Zitron, each of these innovations failed to either transform existing industries or become sustainable industries themselves, because the business case at the heart of these technologies was rotten, pushed forward by wasteful, bloated venture investments still selling an endless digital frontier of growth that no longer existed. Enter AGI, the proposed creation of an AI with an intelligence that dwarfs any single person’s and possibly the collective intelligence of humanity. Once AGI is built, we can easily solve many of the toughest challenges <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2025/01/30/the-stargate-project-trump-touts-500-billion-bid-for-ai-dominance/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (facing humanity)">facing humanity</a>: climate change, cancer, new net-zero energy sources.</p>

<p>And no company has pushed the coming of AGI more than OpenAI, which has ridden the hype to incredible heights since its release of generative chatbot ChatGPT. Last year, OpenAI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (completed)">completed</a> a blockbuster funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, making it the third most valuable startup in the world at the time after SpaceX and ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November 2022, now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-157-billion-in-funding-round-ee220607" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (sees)">sees</a> 250 million weekly active users and about 11 million paying subscribers for its AI tools. The startup’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up more than 1,700 percent since the start of 2023, and it expects to clear $3.7 billion for the year. By all accounts, this is another world-changing startup on a meteoric rise. Yet take a deeper look at OpenAI’s financial situation and expected future growth, and cracks begin to show.</p>

<p>To start, OpenAI is burning money at an impressive but unsustainable pace. The latest funding round is its third in the last two years, atypical for a startup, that also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/03/openai-gets-4-billion-revolving-credit-line-on-top-of-latest-funding.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (included)">included</a> a $4 billion revolving line of credit—a loan on tap, essentially—on top of the $6.6 billion of equity, revealing an insatiable need for investor cash to survive. Despite $3.7 billion in sales this year, OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion due to the stratospheric costs of building and running generative AI models, which includes $4 billion in cloud computing to run their AI models, $3 billion in computing to train the next generation of models, and $1.5 billion for its staff. According to its own numbers, OpenAI loses $2 for every $1 it makes, a red flag for the sustainability of any business. Worse, these costs are expected to increase as ChatGPT gains users and OpenAI seeks to upgrade its foundation model from GPT-4 to GPT-5 sometime in the next six months.</p>

<p>Financial documents reviewed by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-reportedly-in-talks-to-raise-6-5-billion-at-150-billion-valuation" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (The Information)">The Information</a> confirm this trajectory as the startup predicts its annual losses will hit $14 billion by 2026. Further, OpenAI sees $100 billion in annual revenue—a number that would rival Nestlé and Target’s returns—as the point at which it will finally break even. For comparison, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, only cleared $100 billion in sales in 2021, 23 years after its founding, yet boasted a portfolio of money-making products, including Google Search, the Android operating system, Gmail, and cloud computing.</p>

<p>OpenAI is deeply dependent on hypothetical breakthroughs from future models that unlock more capabilities to boost its subscription price and grow its user base. Its GPT-5 class models and beyond must pull godlike capacities for AI out of the algorithmic ether to create a user base of hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. Yet, with the release of the open-source DeepSeek R1 model earlier this month, OpenAI has no moat for its increasingly expensive products. The R1 matched its performance across math, chemistry, and coding tasks, independently learned OpenAI’s reasoning techniques, and can be downloaded, modified, and deployed for free. Why would people continue to pay $20, let alone the $200 tier OpenAI reserves for its latest, greatest models, rather than use something that can deliver the same performance at a 95 percent lower price?</p>

<blockquote><p>Venture capital funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><b>Silicon Valley Is All In on AI</b></h3>

<p>Wall Street asked itself the same question after the release of DeepSeek R1 and panicked, wiping more than 15 percent ($600 billion) off Nvidia’s stock price, the largest single-day loss for a company ever. And that’s not the only bad sign Altman received about OpenAI’s future. OpenAI <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openaiin-talks-for-huge-investment-round-valuing-it-up-to-300-billion-2a2d4327" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (is in talks again)">is in talks again</a> to raise more money (less than a year after raising $10 billion) at a proposed $340 billion valuation. In most cases, a startup doubling its valuation would be great news. But for OpenAI, the money may make things worse. It signals a desperate need for cash and puts more pressure on a company that today loses $2 for every dollar it makes. As Zitron pointed out, at $340 billion, few companies have the liquidity to acquire OpenAI, and public investors expect strong returns and profitability to justify an IPO anywhere near that price. Plus, the latest round of funding is being led by Masayoshi Son, a billionaire investor known more for losing money than making it. Given Son’s Vision Fund’s disastrous investing record, Zitron said, it’s as bearish a signal as you could find. Hanging over all this for OpenAI <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/subprimeai/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (is the fact that)">is the fact that</a> Microsoft’s investments in the company, which run north of $10 billion, are not standard equity investments but “profit participation units” that will convert to debt in a year and a half.</p>

<p>It’s not just OpenAI that’s burning through billions. Silicon Valley has hyped AI as the next internet or iPhone, and has invested like it cannot afford to miss out on the next big tech revolution. In 2021, with the last gasp of zero-interest-rate loans paired with trillions in COVID relief spending, venture capitalists <a href="https://www.ccn.com/analysis/ai-companies-raised-50b-2023-vc/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (poured a record $78.5 billion)">poured a record $78.5 billion</a> into the AI space. And, despite a broader slowdown in venture activity, the second quarter of 2024 set the record for quarterly venture investing in AI <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q2-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (at $23.3 billion)">at $23.3 billion</a>. In fact, 33 percent of VC portfolios <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/33346/ai-share-of-vc-investments-in-the-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (are committed)">are committed</a> to AI, another worrying sign of concentration.</p>

<p>Even so, Big Tech companies are the biggest spenders on AI. While VCs dropped approximately $200 billion into AI between 2021 and 2024, Big Tech is on pace to surpass that amount this year alone. According to Goldman Sachs research, cloud computing giants are expected to plow over $1 trillion over the next five years into graphics processing units (GPUs) and to build data centers to power generative AI. AI is an expensive technology like few before it.</p>

<p>All those racks of GPUs and supercluster data centers need power, and the power industry is also embarking on a once-in-a-generation investment spree to keep up. The scale of expected data centers to power generative AI is difficult to wrap your head around. Oracle recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (announced)">announced</a> plans to build a gigawatt-scale data center just for AI, powered by a trio of nuclear reactors, while OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (pitched)">pitched</a> the White House on the necessity of five-gigawatt data centers, which would be enough power for about three million homes consumed by a single AI data center. A recent report from McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (expects)">expects</a> the electricity going to fuel AI data centers will triple from 3 to 4 percent of the country’s electricity to 11 to 12 percent by 2030. The power industry typically grows 2 to 3 percent a year, far too little to meet the predicted jump in demand. McKinsey estimates that power utilities would have to spend $500 billion on top of their planned capital expenditure to keep up with AI needs. If true, this presents a serious bottleneck for not just OpenAI but the expected growth of the AI industry.</p>

<h3><b>Where’s the Money, Lebowski?</b></h3>

<p>Between VCs, Big Tech, and power utilities, the bill for generative AI comes out to close to $2 trillion in spending over the next five years alone. Adding all this up, some are starting to question the economic fundamentals of generative AI. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (doubts)">doubts</a> the technology can recoup what’s been invested as, unlike the internet, it fails to solve complex business problems at a lower cost than what’s available today. Plus, he argues, the most expensive inputs for generative AI, GPUs and energy, are unlikely to decline meaningfully for the tech industry over time, given how far demand outstrips supply for both. While AI-fueled coding could definitely boost productivity, it’s hard to see how it could become a multitrillion-dollar industry.</p>

<p>Surveys confirm that for many workers, AI tools like ChatGPT <i>reduce</i> their productivity by increasing the volume of content and steps needed to complete a given task, and by frequently introducing errors that have to be checked and corrected. A <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3540579/devs-gaining-little-if-anything-from-ai-coding-assistants.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (study by Uplevel Data Labs)">study by Uplevel Data Labs</a> tracked 800 software engineers using Copilot on GitHub and found no measurable increase in coding productivity, despite this exact use case being the one pointed to the most by AI companies. And even productivity gains may come at a cost: Microsoft researchers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (concluded)">concluded</a> that workers became more productive using generative AI tools but their critical thinking skills declined, presumably because they were offloading the thinking to AI. Looking past the hype, the business case for generative AI two years after the stunning success of ChatGPT appears weaker by the day.</p>

<p>Even worse, as AI expert Gary Marcus <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/five-things-most-people-dont-seem" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (pointed out)">pointed out</a>, DeepSeek’s R1 model <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/openai-is-highly-overvalued-and-deepseek-just-blew-up-their-business-model-says-nyu-s-gary-marcus/vi-AA1y0qgI" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (spells serious trouble)">spells serious trouble</a> for OpenAI and the cloud giants. The only way OpenAI could hope to recoup the billions it was spending on GPUs to train bigger and bigger models was to maintain a large enough technical lead over other AI companies to justify charging up to $200 for paid subscriptions to its models. That lead <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-race-for-ai-supremacy-is-over" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (just vaporized)">just vaporized</a> and was given to the entire industry for free. In response, Altman has already twice cut the prices of his subscriptions in an effort to stay competitive. But without millions of paid subscriptions, it’s difficult to see the pathway to profitability for a company that loses $2 for every $1 it brings in and expects costs to continue to grow approximately tenfold in five years. OpenAI has set $100 billion as its break-even point, which would require it to increase its revenue by a factor of 25 in just five years, an incredible feat of scale that its current business model does not justify.</p>

<p>OpenAI is, however, the perfect kind of growth-at-all-costs story investors need to think still exists—capable of not only achieving Meta- or Amazon-like growth again, but becoming an indispensable part of growth and innovation in every industry in the future, too. No industry could escape, and software would close its jaws around the world, finally, as Marc Andreessen <a href="https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (predicted)">predicted</a> in 2011.</p>

<p>For his part, Gary Marcus has taken to calling OpenAI the WeWork of AI—WeWork, of course, is the poster boy for wasteful, nearly fraudulent, growth-at-all-costs investing that led to a spectacular downfall. Marcus is so confident current approaches cannot take us to the promised land of AGI that he bet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei $100,000 that AGI would not be achieved by the end of 2027. Without AGI, the valuations of leading AI startups like OpenAI ($340 billion) and Anthropic (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/anthropic-closes-in-on-3point5-billion-funding-round-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window ($61.5 billion))">$61.5 billion)</a> stop making sense. If GPUs are no longer the most capital-efficient or effective way to build better AI models, then the expected AI computing “supercycle” that the hundreds of billions in capital expenditure is premised on never arrives. Instead, the underlying asset bubble of a multitrillion-dollar bet on GPUs as the necessary component to an internet-like era of growth vanishes into thin air.</p>

<blockquote><p>For many workers, AI tools reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of steps needed to complete a given task.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><b>Just How Big Will the Blast Be?</b></h3>

<p>OpenAI’s incredible burn rate, the trillions in capital expenditure by cloud giants and utilities to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI, the supply bottlenecks ahead from the power and semiconductor industries, and the questionable economic gains from these tools all point to a generative AI bubble. Should the bubble burst, startups and venture funds alike face possible extinction, and a big enough drop from the Magnificent Seven could spark skittish markets to panic, leading to wider economic contagion, given how dependent on the growth of the top technology companies the public markets have become.</p>

<p>In 2024, the Magnificent Seven <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/how-magnificent-7-affects-sp-500-stock-market-concentration.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (were responsible)">were responsible</a> for the lion’s share of the growth of the S&amp;P 500, with the returns of the other 493 companies flat. When Nvidia hit its peak valuation of $3 trillion over the summer, just five of the seven—Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon—accounted for 29 percent of the total index’s value, <a href="https://www.inc.com/phil-rosen/stock-market-outlook-nvidia-apple-microsoft-amazon-recession-fed-rates.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (surpassing)">surpassing</a> the concentration of the five top technology companies just before the dot-com crash. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/echoes-dotcom-bubble-haunt-ai-driven-us-stock-market-2024-07-02/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Nvidia)">Nvidia</a> has been on an incredible bull run over the last five years, its shares <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/echoes-dotcom-bubble-haunt-ai-driven-us-stock-market-2024-07-02/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent)">gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent</a>, reminiscent of how network equipment maker Cisco grew about 4,500 percent in the five years leading up to its peak just before the dot-com crash in 2000.</p>

<p>Nvidia and the other Magnificent Seven members are in a codependent relationship when it comes to AI hype. They are Nvidia’s biggest customers, feeding the bull run by pushing demand for GPUs beyond even what chipmaker TSMC can supply. At the moment, Nvidia can pass those prices on to their customers, the only clusters big enough for AI computing. But should demand for AI fall, all seven will tumble with it.</p>

<p>For the tech industry, DeepSeek is a threat to its incredible bull run because it proved three things. First, frontier AI models could be trained much more cheaply and efficiently than the current Silicon Valley approach of building massive models requiring hundreds of thousands of GPUs to train. From a capital perspective, the U.S. strategy is wasteful, relying on at least ten times the investment to make similar model progress. Second, DeepSeek showed you could train a state-of-the-art model without the latest GPUs, calling into question the current demand for the latest GPUs that is so hot customers have been facing delays of six months to a year to get their hands on them. Finally, the high valuations of leading AI startups depend on a technical lead in their models to charge prices anywhere near what they need to recoup their computing costs, but that technical lead, enabled by a combination of closed-source models, billions in capital expenditure, and export controls blocking Chinese companies like DeepSeek from accessing the latest GPUs, is gone. Should demand for GPUs fall or even not hit the exponential increases the billions invested are betting on, the bubble will pop.</p>

<p>Given the stock market’s dependence on tech companies for growth, the trigger may not come from the AI industry itself, but any pullback in spending will crater the current trajectory of the AI industry. Many potential triggers abound: a crypto crash; President Trump’s trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; the stated goal to cut more than $1 trillion of government spending by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (nearly 70 percent)">nearly 70 percent</a> of the world’s advanced computer chips are manufactured. You can tell Wall Street is worried about a bubble, because Nvidia is hit the hardest by any bearish AI news, and even when the market panic has nothing to do with the tech industry, like when the Japan currency trade happened last summer, the Magnificent Seven suffer punishing losses.</p>

<p>The AI bubble wobbles more precariously by the day. Some bubbles, like that of the dot-com crash, end up being positive in the long run, despite the short-term economic pain of it bursting. But some, like the 2008 housing bubble, leave permanent scars on the economy and can knock an entire industry off its growth trajectory for years. To date, the U.S. housing industry <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/home-building-in-the-u-s-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-last-recession-heres-why-51568282700" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (has not recovered)">has not recovered</a> to pre-2008 growth trend lines, a major contributor to the housing crisis gripping the U.S. That is the fire that the tech industry is playing with today.</p>

<p>This is not the Silicon Valley of lore. Venture investors, for all their tech manifestos celebrating “<a href="https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (little tech)">little tech</a>” and entrepreneurship, have come to <a href="https://www.irmagazine.com/shareholder-targeting-id/how-sovereign-wealth-funds-are-inflating-silicon-valley-bubble" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (resemble)">resemble</a> more traditional financial firms, raising money from pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Silicon Valley has gone corporate and managerial; even private equity invests in the Valley today. The fusion of venture capital and Wall Street threatens to bring the unbridled speculation of unregulated finance and the breathless tech industry hype together in a single, massive bubble. Inimical to the old ethos of the Valley and emblematic of a bloated, rotten investing strategy, in Silicon Valley now the money chases founders rather than founders chasing money. Maybe, after the fallout of the AI bubble is felt and the sun sets on Silicon Valley for a bit, the tech world can do a hard reset and return to its more innovative days again.</p>

<p>The official numbers from ACEA are out, and they confirmed that Tesla deliveries have crashed by 43% in Europe so far this year.</p>



<p>It should be concerning for Tesla as electric vehicle sales are up 31% during the period.</p>



<p>Based on the main European auto markets already having reported vehicle registrations earlier this month, we already had <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/05/tesla-tsla-sales-crash-continues-in-europe-with-germany-down-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good idea of Tesla’s performance in the market</a>, but now the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) has made it official.</p>



<p>ACEA has released February registration numbers confirming that Tesla only delivered 16,888 units in the EU, EFTA, and UK markets in February 2025, compared to 28,182 units in 2024.</p>	
	



<p>For the first two months of the year, it totals 26,619 units, or 42.6% less than the 46,343 units delivered during the same period in 2024.</p>



<p>This is amid a 3.4% decline in automotive sales in Europe, but Tesla can hardly use that as an excuse since ACEA is reporting a 28.4% (31% in EU, EFTA, and UK) increase in battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales this year despite Tesla’s erosion in the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Across the first two months of 2025</strong>, new battery-electric car sales grew by 28.4%, to 255,489 units, capturing 15.2% of total EU market share. Three of the four largest markets in the EU, accounting for 64% of all battery-electric car registrations, recorded robust double-digit gains: Germany (+41%), Belgium (+38%), and the Netherlands (+25%). This contrasted with France, which saw a slight decline of 1.3%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the EU, EFTA, and UK markets, BEVs account for 17% of the entire auto market, with PHEVs adding another 7%.</p>



<p>Tesla had the worst performance of all automakers in the market:</p>

<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla fans are holding on to the idea that this is not a real problem because it is mostly due to the Model Y changeover, but that’s simply not true.</p>



<p>Model 3 registrations are also down in most European markets, despite Tesla having a similar situation as Model Y for Model 3 during this time last year.</p>



<p>In fact, Model 3 is down 29.4% in Europe so far this year despite plenty of inventory.</p>



<p>The shift to the new Model Y design is certainly having an effect, but it cannot account for the 43% drop in deliveries.</p>



<p>With deliveries of the new Model Y having started this month in Europe, we can see Tesla is still suffering in markets that report registration daily.</p>



<p>Tesla has only delivered 655 cars so far in March in Sweden compared to 2,524 for the whole month of March in 2024.</p>



<p>In Norway, Tesla is at 1,444 deliveries compared to 2,334 units for the whole month of March in 2024.</p>



<p>Tesla is already down 20,000 units in Europe for the first two months of the year compared to its 2024 performance, and that number could grow to 30,000 units by the end of the quarter.</p>

During the meeting, Han <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/samsung-ceo-says-company-will-pursue-deals-as-it-struggles-for-growth.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:apologized;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">apologized</a> to the shareholders, telling them that Samsung "failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market." He also told the shareholders that Samsung was having difficulties when it came to semiconductor-related mergers and acquisitions due to regulatory issues, but that the company was "determined to produce some tangible results this year."</p><p>Based on the notice Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/ir/reports-disclosures/public-disclosure-view.84335/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">published</a>, Han's co-CEO Young-Hyun Jun is now the sole CEO of the company.

<p dir="auto">Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT, CVPR 2025) is a feed-forward neural network that directly infers all key 3D attributes of a scene, including extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters, point maps, depth maps, and 3D point tracks, <strong>from one, a few, or hundreds of its views, within seconds</strong>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Furthermore, if certain pixels in the input frames are unwanted (e.g., reflective surfaces, sky, or water), you can simply mask them by setting the corresponding pixel values to 0 or 1. Precise segmentation masks aren't necessary - simple bounding box masks work effectively (check this <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt/issues/47" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/facebookresearch/vggt/issues/47/hovercard">issue</a> for an example).</p>

More recently, he was seen internally as X’s defacto head of engineering and product, especially with Musk recently focusing more of his time on xAI and DOGE. It’s unclear why Wang is departing now<em>. </em>Neither he nor a company spokesperson responded to a request for comment in time for publication.</p><p>X recently added other engineering leadership: Mike Dalton and Uday Ruddaraju, both previously technical leads at Robinhood, joined in January. Their LinkedIn profiles show that they also work at xAI, which has become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339249/elon-musk-xai-x-twitter">increasingly intertwined</a> with X over the last year.</p><div><div><p id="do-you-work-at-x-or-xai"><h2><strong>Do you work at X or xAI?</strong></h2></p></div><p> I’d love to chat.

The company reportedly just <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d4616dec-c4c7-417f-8549-134710bbc5b1">obtained a $44 billion valuation</a> from investors — the same price Musk paid for Twitter in 2022.

Those plans haven’t come to fruition, though my sources say that work is still underway to launch the X Money payments platform (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/599137/x-money-payments-service-2025-launch">it’s slated to come</a> “later this year”).</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The year was 2010.  “Ke$ha's Tik Tok”  was topping the Billboard charts.  Steve Jobs has just introduced a goofy new oversized iPhone called an “iPad”.  And in running forums across the internet far and wide, hoards of enthusiasts preached the gospel of a new way of running: without shoes.</p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/01/barefoot.png" alt="A graph of Google search interest in barefoot running showing a huge spike around 2010, which trails off by 2013" loading="lazy" width="1136" height="580" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/barefoot.png 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/barefoot.png 1000w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/01/barefoot.png 1136w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Google Trends interest in "Barefoot Running" from 2004 to present</span></figcaption></figure><p>The “Great Barefoot Running Hysteria of 2010”, as I call it, took the amateur running world by storm.  Propelled by dramatic claims of performance improvements and injury prevention, barefoot running gave rise to a vocal (and often militant) contingent of enthusiasts and entirely new classes of footwear.  And then over the course of a several years, it faded away almost as quickly as it came, leaving behind changes in running shoes and culture forever.  In this post, we'll explore the history and legacy of the barefoot running movement.</p><h3 id="the-barefoot-running-movement-how-it-started">The Barefoot Running Movement &amp; How It Started</h3><p>Barefoot running is–of course–as old as humanity itself. In fact, people have run barefoot throughout most of human history, with the practice continuing today in several cultures, such as Kenya and indigenous peoples in Mexico.  </p><p>In this sense, before addressing the modern origins of <em>barefoot </em>running, we need to talk about the origins of <em>shod </em>running<em>.</em>  The concept of running shoes as we understand them today, specifically designed to improve running efficiency and comfort, did not emerge until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This evolution coincided with the rise of organized sports and recreational running, which spurred the development of footwear tailored to the specific needs of runners. </p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/05/lord-spencers-shoes-the-first-specialized-running-shoes-ever-made-from-1865-2.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="460" height="347"></figure><p>The first breakthrough came in 1865 when an English shoemaker brilliantly suggested adding spikes to otherwise normal-looking dress shoes to make them suitable for cross-country running. Later, in the early 20th century, shoes with rubber soles were introduced, offering improved grip and shock absorption, marking a significant advancement in the design of running shoes.</p><blockquote>The result of these running shoe trends was running shoe stores filled with bulky, over-engineered clown shoes that promised to prevent running injuries, but probably didn't.</blockquote><p>Into more modern times, running shoes continued to evolve past their humble beginnings into heavier, more complex footwear with exotic materials like plastics &amp; EVA foam.  In the 80s and 90s, many shoemakers became fixated on <em>stability </em>and the notion that pronation, the natural roll of the foot after it lands, was a cause for running injuries.  Running shoes were increasingly designed to try to prevent this movement with wedges of foam that support and stabilize the arch of the foot, a high heel-to-toe drop, and other questionable features like plastic air bubbles in the heel to cushion the foot with each step.</p><p>The result of these running shoe trends was running shoe stores filled with bulky, over-engineered clown shoes that promised to prevent running injuries, but probably didn't, and were mostly just uncomfortable to use. You can see an example of this kind of design in action in the Nike Air Max 90, which is now also available in a more tasteful re-issue.  While the original was marketed as a running shoe, the modern re-issue is a nostalgic fashion shoe that you should definitely <em>not </em>run in.</p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/geqhdlqounif1d4bvgz2.jpg" alt="A bulky black leather running shoe from the 90s with an air bubble in the heel" loading="lazy" width="670" height="464" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/geqhdlqounif1d4bvgz2.jpg 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/geqhdlqounif1d4bvgz2.jpg 670w"><figcaption><span>The original Nike Air Max 90</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png" alt="A blue &amp; whit modern re-issue of the Air Max 90 running shoe with an air bubble in the heel" loading="lazy" width="1580" height="877" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png 1000w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png 1580w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A modern re-issue of the Nike Air Max 90 (from </span><a href="https://nike.com/?ref=api.needto.run" rel="noreferrer"><span>Nike.com</span></a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The barefoot running renaissance can thus be understood as a backlash to the dominant running shoe trends at the time.  The revival was driven by a growing dissatisfaction with traditional running shoes, which many believed contributed to injuries and impeded natural foot movement. Proponents of barefoot running argued that it encouraged a more natural gait, reducing the impact on the legs and back and enhancing the overall running experience.</p><p>In 2004, inspired by Stanford athletes training barefoot, Nike introduced the <em>Nike Free</em>, a running shoe that bucked the bulky running shoe trends of the time with a super flexible sole and a minimal heel-to-toe offset.</p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2025/03/Nike_Free-_3_running_shoe.jpg" alt="A picture of blue Nike running shoes with a flexible sole and a small height difference between the toe and heel" loading="lazy" width="400" height="280"><figcaption><span>The original Nike Free (via Wikipedia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, in 2006, Vibram launched the 5-Fingers: a shoe intended to be as close to barefoot as possible, with a thin rubber sole and glove-like fit for the toes.  This was the shoe that truly ushered in the <em>minimalist </em>mindset: running shoes should enable a "natural" gait and that <em>less is more</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/vibram.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1101" height="695" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/vibram.jpg 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/vibram.jpg 1000w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/vibram.jpg 1101w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Vibram 5 Fingers (via Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The barefoot-inspired <em>Nike Free </em>and <em>Vibram 5 Fingers</em> set the stage, but the real barefoot running revolution began not with a pair of shoes, but with a book about an indigenous tribe of Native Mexicans.</p><h3 id="christopher-mcdougalls-born-to-run">Christopher McDougall's "Born to Run"</h3><p>While the over-engineered running shoe backlash had already started with shoes like the Nike Free and the Vibram 5 Fingers, the spark that lit the barefoot running powder keg was Christopher McDougall's 2009 bestseller, "Born to Run". The book, which explores the running habits of the Tarahumara Native Mexican tribe, known for their long-distance running ability, captivated the imagination of runners–and non-runners–everywhere. </p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/01/51-Ry-ireXL._SL500_.jpg" alt="A book cover for &quot;Born to Run&quot; featuring an illustration of a barefoot and a man running" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"><figcaption><span>Book cover for "Born to Run" by Christopher McDougall</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Tarahumara, or Rarámuri, as they refer to themselves, are an indigenous people who reside in the rugged and remote Copper Canyon region of Northwestern Mexico. Renowned for their extraordinary long-distance running abilities, the Tarahumara have garnered international attention and admiration from runners and researchers alike. Their running habits, deeply embedded in their culture and lifestyle, are not merely for sport but serve practical and ceremonial purposes as well.</p><p>McDougall's narrative suggested that modern running injuries were virtually non-existent among the Tarahumara.  They often ran barefoot or in minimal footwear, sandals crafted from leather and tire strips called <em>huaraches.  </em>The sandals provide minimal cushioning and protection, promoting a natural running form that many attribute to their low incidence of running-related injuries according to McDougall.  </p><p>The popularity of McDougall's book sparked widespread curiosity and enthusiasm for barefoot running, and many readers happily ditched their bulky running shoes for new, minimalist alternatives.  As the barefoot running movement evolved, so did the market for running footwear, leading to the development of minimalist shoes designed to mimic the barefoot running experience while providing some protection from the hazards of rough terrain. </p><p>Bolstered by the popularity of "Born to Run", barefoot running was suddenly <em>everywhere.  </em>This period saw a surge in barefoot running clinics, forums, and social media groups where enthusiasts shared tips and experiences.  </p><p>And as often happens, what started as a perfectly reasonable idea took on a life of its own and became dogmatic: barefoot running was <em>the way to run</em>.  The movement gave rise to a series of increasingly lofty and strongly worded claims: barefoot running prevented injuries; barefoot running was more efficient; heel striking was evil; barefoot running was the natural and therefore "correct" way to run.  The idea transcended running communities and seeped into popular culture prompting lofty headlines like this New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/running-christopher-mcdougall.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=api.needto.run">The Once and Future Way to Run</a>.</p><p>The idea even transcended the sport of running itself.  To many, the barefoot running movement was not merely about the act of running without shoes; it represented a broader philosophy seeking to embrace simplicity, natural form, and mindfulness in the pursuit of physical fitness and well-being.  The fervor around barefoot running bordered on religious.</p><p>Despite the smug sense of superiority that some barefoot proponents projected, many of the most enthusiastic adopters of barefoot running were, in fact, novice and inexperienced runners.  While barefoot running enthusiasts were eager to point out elite runners training or racing barefoot, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zola_Budd?ref=api.needto.run">Zola Budd</a>, these barefoot elites are the exception rather than the rule.  Most serious and elite runners generally sat out the barefoot trend, or at least took a more nuanced approach.  Many advanced runners already gravitated towards less bulky shoes, and many that did adopt barefoot running did so as part of isolated workouts on soft surfaces.</p><p>It's difficult to quantify this claim, but my personal memory of this period was that online discourse around running form and footwear was dominated by an aggressive mob mentality around barefoot running.   If you were running with shoes on, you were–according to the online mob–"doin' it wrong", as the internet was fond of saying at the time.  </p><p>Though it generally didn't represent the opinions of more experienced runners, the barefoot running crowd was certainly the loudest. Opinions that didn't completely jive with the all-minimalist approach were often brutally and violently downvoted.</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm and claims of the benefits of barefoot running, research into the practice was thin.  While some of the claims seemed logical, most of the evidence around the benefits of barefoot running was anecdotal.  Much of the argument hinged around barefoot running being the <em>natural </em>and thus correct way to run, and that running with over-engineered running shoes was <em>unnatural</em> and thus incorrect.</p><p>Some will recognize this line of reasoning as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature?ref=api.needto.run#Examples"><em>appeal to nature fallacy</em></a>: a logical fallacy in which a subject is claimed to be <em>good </em>simply because it is <em>natural</em>.  The fallacy pops up frequently in health &amp; medical settings when people extol the virtues of "all-natural" products or alternative medicines.  Sure, some natural products are healthy and beneficial; but so are a lot of deadly poisons.  Similarly, diet, where the appeal to nature is used to justify all sorts of sometimes conflicting food choices (throughout history humans have eaten wildly versatile diets).  This doesn't mean that natural is <em>bad, </em>it simply means that it's not a valid argument in and of itself for the benefits of barefoot running.</p><p>As time went on and the research caught up with the trend, the results were mixed at best: some studies showed potential benefits, while others highlighted increased risks. Critics of barefoot running point to evidence showing an increased incidence of certain types of injuries, such as Achilles tendinitis and metatarsal stress fractures, among runners transitioning to barefoot or minimalist running without proper adaptation. Additionally, there's an obvious concern about the lack of protection from environmental hazards (e.g., sharp objects, rough terrain) when running without traditional footwear, which can lead to acute injuries. </p><p>At the same time, many fledgling barefoot runners soon faced a reality check. Reports of injuries began to surface, casting doubt on the benefits of running without shoes. Podiatrists and sports medicine professionals started warning about the potential risks, especially for those with pre-existing foot conditions, those who transitioned too quickly, or those who tried to run too much. </p><p>Many who stuck with the sport and aspired to run longer distances such as the marathon soon learned that it's simply difficult to put in the mileage required to excel at these distances without proper footwear.  Though you're sure to find counterexamples (I still see a small handful of barefoot runners at major running events like the Boston Marathon), most runners who are putting in 50, 60, 70, or more miles a week to race a marathon are doing so with shoes designed to help cushion the impact.</p><h2 id="long-lasting-changes-to-running-shoes">Long-Lasting Changes to Running Shoes</h2><p>Despite the decline in barefoot running's popularity, its impact on the running shoe industry was undeniable. Recognizing the demand for a more natural running experience, shoe manufacturers began developing more lightweight, minimalist running shoes with less cushioning and a lower heel-to-toe drop. </p><p>More importantly, the minimalist movement helped end the dominance of needlessly overbuilt running shoes.  Of course, highly supportive &amp; motion control running shoes are still available, and some runners prefer to run in them, but it's no longer the dominant paradigm.</p><p>Ironically, the minimalist shoe movement triggered its own backlash with the <em>maximalist </em>shoe movement of mega-cushioned shoes, ushered in by brands like HOKA.  But the maximalist trend is not a return to the <em>overbuilt </em>shoes of the 90s–in fact, it still incorporates minimalist concepts like lower heel-to-toe drop, lightweight materials, and placing less emphasis on the support and motion control that earlier running shoes relied on.  </p><p>These innovations aimed to combine the benefits of barefoot running with the protection and support of traditional running shoes. Today, many of these features remain integral in modern running shoe design, marking a lasting legacy of the barefoot running movement.</p><p>So in the end, while the barefoot running hysteria of 2010 may have been a short-lived trend, it sparked crucial conversations about running health and led to significant advancements in running footwear. Though no longer in the limelight, its impact continues to influence how we run and think about our running gear.</p>

<p>The C++ standard library (also know as the STL) is, without a doubt, an astounding piece of work. Its scope, performance and incredible backwards compatibility have taken decades of work by many of the world's best programmers. My hat's off to all those people who have contributed to it.</p><p>All of that is not to say that it is not without its problems. The biggest one being the absolutely abysmal compile times but unreadability, and certain unoptimalities caused by strict backwards compatibility are also at the top of the list. In fact, it could be argued that most of the things people really dislike about C++ are features of the STL rather than the language itself. Fortunately, using the STL is not mandatory. If you are crazy enough, you can disable it completely and build your own standard library in the best Bender style.</p><p>One of the main advantages of being an unemployed-by-choice open source developer is that you can do all of that if you wish. There are no incompetent middle damagers hovering over your shoulder to ensure you are "producing immediate customer value" rather than "wasting time on useless polishing that does not produce immediate customer value".</p><p>It's <i>my</i> time, and I'll waste it if I want to!</p><h2>What's in it?</h2><p>The biggest design questions of a standard library are scope and the "feel" of the API. Rather than spending time on design, we steal it. Thus, when in doubt, read the Python stdlib documentation and replicate it. Thus the name of the library is <span>pystd</span>.</p><h2>The test app</h2><p>To keep the scope meaningful, we start by writing only enough of stdlib to build an app that reads a text file, validates it as UTF-8, splits the contents into words, counts how many time each word appears in the file and prints all words and how many times it appears sorted by decreasing count.</p><p>This requires, at least:</p><ul><li>File handling</li><li>Strings</li><li>UTF8 validation</li><li>A hash map</li><li>A vector</li><li>Sorting</li></ul><h2>The training wheels come off</h2><p>The code is available in <a href="https://github.com/jpakkane/pystd">this Github repo</a> for those who want to follow along at home.</p><p>Disabling the STL is fairly easy (with Linux+GCC at least) and requires only these two Meson statements:</p><blockquote><p><span><span>add_global_arguments('-nostdinc++', language: 'cpp')
</span><br>add_global_link_arguments('-nostdlib++', '-lsupc++', language: 'cpp')<br></span></p></blockquote><p>The <span>supc++</span> library is (according to stackoverflow) a support library GCC needs to implement core language features. Now the stdlib is off and it is time to implement everything with sticks, stones and duct tape.</p><h2>The outcome</h2><p>Once you have implemented everything discussed above and auxiliary stuff like a hashing framework the main application looks like this.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEpKmdPLSQOlvqiROHQIOEFf96ejCzNHnIReu06sLvUVAtlIcenIWOKCBcT0smhJHsxktrgR63nzQsU3ZrW_-JNnwd3b-rOw-nn6pEilsioc-G2LuMKR4LHYnbUOAo_uVfRRBpFgyEMv_z7vEHbAkFwovyH_RWWPd6-A6sk9qlZeLOKl6Dgczt8ORMBeo/s728/pystd_main.png"><img data-original-height="529" data-original-width="728" height="233" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEpKmdPLSQOlvqiROHQIOEFf96ejCzNHnIReu06sLvUVAtlIcenIWOKCBcT0smhJHsxktrgR63nzQsU3ZrW_-JNnwd3b-rOw-nn6pEilsioc-G2LuMKR4LHYnbUOAo_uVfRRBpFgyEMv_z7vEHbAkFwovyH_RWWPd6-A6sk9qlZeLOKl6Dgczt8ORMBeo/s320/pystd_main.png" width="320"></a></p><p>The end result is both Valgrind and Asan clean. There is one chunk of unreleased memory, but that comes from <span>supc++</span>. There is probably UB in the implementation. But it should be the good kind of UB that, if it would actually not work, would break the entire Linux userspace because <i>everything</i> depends on it working "as expected".</p><p>All of this took fewer than 1000 lines of code in the library itself (including a regex implementation that is not actually used). For comparison merely including <span>vector</span> from the STL brings in 27 thousand lines of code.</p><h2>Comparison to an STL version</h2><p>Converting this code to use the STL is fairly simple and only requires changing some types and fine tuning the API.&nbsp; The main difference is that the STL version does not validate that the input is UTF-8 as there is no builtin function for that. Now we can compare the two.</p><p>Runtime for both is 0.001 to 0.002 seconds on the small test file I used. Pystd is not noticeably slower than the STL version, which is enough for our purposes. It almost certainly scales worse because there has been zero performance work on it.</p><p>Compiling the pystd version with <span>-O2</span> takes 0.3 seconds whereas the STL version takes 1.2 seconds. The measurements were done on a Ryzen 7 3700X processor.&nbsp;</p><p>The executable's unstripped size is 349k for STL and 309k for pystd. The stripped sizes are 23k and 135k. Approximately 100 k of the pystd executable comes from <span>supc++</span>. In the STL version that probably comes dynamically from <span>libstdc++</span>&nbsp;(which, on this machine, takes 2.5 MB).</p><h2>Perfect ABI stability</h2><p>Designing a standard library is exceedingly difficult because you can't ever really change it. Someone, somewhere, is depending on every misfeature in it so they can never be changed.</p><p>Pystd has been designed to both support perfect ABI stability <i>and</i> make it possible to change it in arbitrary ways in the future. If you start from scratch this turned out to be fairly simple.</p><p>The sample code above used the <span>pystd</span> namespace. It does not actually exist. Instead it is defined like this in the cpp file:</p><blockquote><p><span>#include &lt;pystd2025.hpp&gt;</span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>namespace pystd = pystd2025;</span></p></blockquote><p>In pystd all code is in a namespace with a year and is stored in a header file with the same year. The idea is, then, that every year you create a new release. This involves copying all stdlib header files to a file with the new year and regexping the namespace declarations to match. The old code is now frozen forever (except for bug fixes) whereas the new code can be changed at will because there are&nbsp;<i>zero existing lines of code that depend on it</i>.</p><p>End users now have the choice of when to update their code to use newer pystd versions. Even better, if there is an old library that can not be updated, any of the old versions can be used in parallel. For example:</p><p><span>pystd2030::SomeType foo;<br>pystd2025::SomeType bar(foo.something(), foo.something_else());</span></p><p>Thus if no code is ever updated, everything keeps working. If all code is updated at once, everything works. If only parts of the code are updated, things can still be made to work with some glue code. This puts the maintenance burden on the people whose projects can not be updated as opposed to every other developer in the world. This is as it should be, and also would motivate people with broken deps to spend some more effort to get them fixed.</p>

					<h2>About searchmysite.net</h2>
					<p>
						What is the search engine and why should I use it?
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						The searchmysite.net search engine is a niche search, focussing on the "indieweb" or "small web" or "digital gardens", i.e. non-commercial content, primarily personal and independent websites.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						If you want to research people's personal experiences of or deep-dives into certain topics, hobbies or interests, then you may find the searchmysite.net public search useful to avoid having to wade through all the marketing websites and blog spam that fill the big search engines. It differs from the commercial search engines because it:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Indexes only user-submitted and moderated sites, rather than indexing the entire internet with all of its spam, "search engine optimisation" and "click-bait" content.</li>
						<li>Does not show adverts and promotes advert-free results pages, to remove the incentives for spam and surveillance capitalism.</li>
						<li>Aims to have a sustainable and user-aligned operating model, planning to pay running costs via the "search as a service" features, rather than relying on advertising which could put it in conflict with user needs.</li>
						<li>Offers an unusually high level of privacy for a search engine, thanks to the operating model which is not based on advertising or collecting personal information for sale to advertisers (see the Privacy Policy for full details).</li>
						<li>Is fully open source, for even greater transparency of the searching, ranking and indexing processes, and for greater community involvement in improving the service.</li>

Goldberg reported on how he was inadvertently added to a discussion of a military strike on Houthi militias in Yemen, conducted over the encrypted messaging app Signal. In essence, a reporter was invited to listen while the nation’s top security officials weighed and debated a military action, and was sent detailed information about the strike.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Even President Donald Trump seemed unaware of the breach. “You’re saying that they had what?” he replied when asked about the news. Trump added that he is “not a big fan of <i>The Atlantic</i>,” something he’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-attacks-atlantics-jeffrey-goldberg-over-hitler/680422/">previously made clear</a>, and which makes the unintentional leak all the more remarkable. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said, “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I called Goldberg this afternoon to learn more about how the story came about and what the disclosure reveals about the Trump administration. This interview has been condensed and edited.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David A. Graham: </b>Has anything like this ever happened to you before?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey Goldberg:</b> I think that on one level, this is very relatable. Everyone has sent a text or an email to an unintended recipient, and sometimes they’ve embarrassed themselves by doing that. This is, I would say, at a different level—but it kind of proves a point, which is that there’s a reason people who work on sensitive issues in the government aren’t supposed to use Signal, even though it is end-to-end encrypted. Anyone can use Signal, so if you’re not careful, you might pull into your conversation a Houthi sympathizer or a magazine editor.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our colleague <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/shane-harris/">Shane Harris</a> points out that the phones of top senior defense and national-security and intelligence officials are targets of intelligence operations. Imagine what you can do if you saw everything that the CIA director may be texting, even on a secure phone—especially on a secure phone. I’m mindful of the fact that the Trump team has already dealt with a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/classified-documents-trump-case/681327/">serious issue</a> in the securing of sensitive documents in Mar-a-Lago. If you’re going to make a big deal about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/but-his-emails/533274/">Hillary Clinton’s emails</a>, you may want to have excellent communication hygiene.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David:</b> Tell me how you came to conclude that this group was real.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>It was actually chilling: 11:44 a.m., Saturday the 15th, eastern time, in my car in a parking lot, just checking my phone, and I see a text from Pete Hegseth, or somebody who’s hoaxing me as Pete Hegseth. It provides information about upcoming military operations with timings attached: <em>T</em><i>his is going to happen. Then this happens, then this happens, and this happens.</i> I’m sitting there in my car and thinking I’m about to find out if this was an elaborate scam or not. So I thought to myself,<i> I’m sitting here for the next two hours with my hands around my phone.</i> I check on X around 1:55, and yes, Sanaa is being bombed, so then I have the realization that this is almost certainly a real channel and not just an elaborate fakery of some sort. And that’s when I began to realize that I had to write about this massive security breach.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David: </b>You have done a lot of sensitive national-security reporting. Have you ever received any information like this?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>No, nothing like this. This was like an intravenous drip of information that no one in the government thinks journalists should have. Until almost the very last minute, I could not believe that this was actually happening, that there could be a Mack-truck-size breach, that somehow, the editor in chief of <i>The Atlantic</i> was invited into a conversation with the intelligence agencies, secretaries, the national security adviser. Like most reporters, I’ve been a recipient of leaks. A leak is a totally different thing. That’s a whistleblower trying to make complaints. This is just reckless.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David: </b>There’s the horror that something like this would happen on an operational level, but in terms of what we learn from the substance of the conversation, what are the most important things that people should take away?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>The actual conversation that they have is fascinating, and in a certain way impressive. It’s nice to see that they’re disagreeing with one another. It’s very useful for the public to know that the vice president has a more hands-off approach than other members of the administration. One of the things that I found interesting was that when a person named “S M” in the chat, who I took to be Stephen Miller, comes in and says, “As I heard it, the president was clear,” this kind of shuts down the conversation. It suggests that Stephen Miller can be in a conversation with, among others, the vice president of the United States and still can get his way. (Miller did not reply to a request for comment or confirm that he is “S M.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David: </b>In addition to the question of how secure Signal is, this is also notable, because without this report, none of these conversations might be preserved for posterity. You note that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz set some messages to disappear after a week or so.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>This is an interesting question: Are they using Signal because it’s convenient? Are they using Signal because it disappears? According to the experts Shane interviewed, the administration should not have established a Signal thread for such conversations in the first place, but once it did, what one is supposed to do legally is copy an official government account, and that government account will then send these threads to the National Archives for posterity, for research, for accountability. But if you’re using a disappearing-text app, I don’t know. That’s one of the questions that I’ve asked and have not gotten answered yet.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David:</b> It is remarkable that this would happen with any reporter. It’s even more remarkable that this would happen with someone like you, and with a publication that has been specifically singled out by the president. Do you have any sense of how this happened?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>I literally have no idea. The remarkable thing is that no one in the group asked, <i>Who’s JG?</i>, and when I removed myself from the group, seemingly nobody said, <i>Hey, why did JG leave?</i></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David:</b> Are you concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration because of this story?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>It’s not my role to care about the possibility of threats or retaliation. We just have to come to work and do our jobs to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, in our society today—we see this across corporate journalism and law firms and other industries—there’s too much preemptive obeying for my taste. All we can do is just go do our jobs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"><b>Read the full article he</b></a><b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">re</a></b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"><b>.</b></a></p></section></div>]]></description>

    <p>Every day, researchers search for optimal solutions. They might want to figure out where to build a major airline hub. Or to determine how to maximize return while minimizing risk in an investment portfolio. Or to develop self-driving cars that can distinguish between traffic lights and stop signs.</p>
<p>Mathematically, these problems get translated into a search for the minimum values of functions. But in all these scenarios, the functions are too complicated to assess directly. Researchers have to approximate the minimal values instead.</p>
<p>It turns out that one of the best ways to do this is by using an algorithm that Isaac Newton developed over 300 years ago. This algorithm is fairly simple. It’s a little like searching, blindfolded, for the lowest point in an unfamiliar landscape. As you put one foot in front of the other, the only information you need is whether you’re going uphill or downhill, and whether the grade is increasing or decreasing. Using that information, you can get a good approximation of the minimum relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Although enormously powerful — centuries later, Newton’s method is still crucial for solving present-day problems in logistics, finance, computer vision and even pure math — it also has a significant shortcoming. It doesn’t work well on all functions. So mathematicians have continued to study the technique, figuring out different ways to broaden its scope without sacrificing efficiency.</p>
<p>Last summer, three researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06374">announced the latest improvement</a> to Newton’s method. <a href="https://aaa.princeton.edu/">Amir Ali Ahmadi</a> of Princeton University, along with his former students <a href="https://chaudhrya.github.io/">Abraar Chaudhry</a> (now at the Georgia Institute of Technology) and <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jeffrey-zhang/">Jeffrey Zhang</a> (now at Yale University), extended Newton’s method to work efficiently on the broadest class of functions yet.</p>
<p>“Newton’s method has 1,000 different applications in optimization,” Ahmadi said. “Potentially our algorithm can replace it.”</p>

                            <p>In the 1680s, Isaac Newton developed an algorithm for finding optimal solutions. Three centuries later, mathematicians are still using and honing his method.</p>

<h2><strong>A Centuries-Old Technique</strong></h2>
<p>Mathematical functions transform inputs into outputs. Often, the most important feature of a function is its minimum value — the combination of inputs that produces the smallest possible output.</p>
<p>But finding the minimum is hard. Functions can have dozens of variables raised to high powers, defying formulaic analysis; graphs of their solutions form high-dimensional landscapes that are impossible to explore from a bird’s-eye view. In those higher-dimensional landscapes, said <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/coralia.cartis">Coralia Cartis</a> of the University of Oxford, “We want to find a valley. Some are local valleys; others are the lowest point. You’re trying to find these things, and the question is: What info do you have to guide you to that?”</p>
<p>In the 1680s, Newton recognized that even when you’re dealing with a very complicated function, you’ll still always have access to at least two pieces of information to help you find its deepest valley. First, you can calculate the function’s so-called first derivative, or slope: the steepness of the function at a given point. Second, you can compute the rate at which the slope itself is changing (the function’s second derivative).</p>

<p>Say you’re trying to find the minimum of some complicated function. First, choose a point on the function that you think might be close to the true minimum. Compute the function’s first and second derivatives at that point. These derivatives can be used to construct a special quadratic equation — a parabola if your function lives in a 2D plane, and a cuplike shape called a paraboloid if your function is higher dimensional. This quadratic equation, which is called a Taylor approximation, roughly resembles your function at the point you chose.</p>
<p>Now calculate the minimum of the quadratic equation instead of the original — something you can do easily, using a well-known formula. (That’s because quadratic equations are simple; it’s when equations get more complicated that calculating the minimum becomes prohibitive.) You’ll get a point. Then plug the coordinates of that point back into your original function, and you’ll get a new point on the function that is, hopefully, closer to its true minimum. Start the entire process again.</p>
<p>Newton proved that if you keep on repeating this process, you’ll eventually home in on the minimum value of the original, more complicated function. The method doesn’t always work, especially if you start at a point that’s too far away from the true minimum. But for the most part, it does. And it has some desirable attributes.</p>

<p>Other iterative methods, like gradient descent — the algorithm used in today’s machine learning models — converge toward the true minimum at a linear rate. Newton’s method converges toward it much faster: at a “quadratic” rate. In other words, it can identify the minimum value in fewer iterations than gradient descent. (Each iteration of Newton’s method is more computationally expensive than an iteration of gradient descent, which is why researchers prefer gradient descent for certain applications, like training neural networks. But Newton’s method is still enormously efficient, making it useful in all sorts of contexts.)</p>
<p>Newton could have written his method to converge toward the true minimum value even faster if, instead of taking just the first and second derivatives at each point, he had also taken, say, the third and fourth derivatives. That would have given him more complicated Taylor approximations, with exponents greater than 2. But the whole crux of his strategy was to transform a complicated function into a simpler one. These more complicated Taylor equations were more than Newton could handle mathematically.</p>

<p>“Newton did it for degree 2. He did that because nobody knew how to minimize higher-order polynomials,” Ahmadi said.</p>
<p>In the centuries since, mathematicians have worked to extend his method, to probe how much information they can squeeze out of more complicated Taylor approximations of their functions.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, for instance, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev proposed a version of Newton’s method that approximated functions with cubic equations (which have an exponent of 3). But his algorithm didn’t work when the original function involved multiple variables. Much more recently, in 2021, Yurii Nesterov (now at Corvinus University of Budapest) demonstrated <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-019-01449-1">how to approximate functions</a> of any number of variables efficiently with cubic equations. But his method couldn’t be extended to approximate functions using quartic equations, quintics and so on without losing its efficiency. Nevertheless, the proof was a major breakthrough in the field.</p>
<p>Now Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang have taken Nesterov’s result another step further. Their algorithm works for any number of variables and arbitrarily many derivatives. Moreover, it remains efficient for all these cases — something that until now wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>But first, they had to find a way to make a hard math problem a lot easier.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Wiggle Room</strong></h2>
<p>There is no fast, general purpose method for finding the minima of functions raised to high exponents. That’s always been the main limitation of Newton’s method. But there are certain types of functions that have characteristics that make them easy to minimize. In the new work, Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang prove that it’s always possible to find approximating equations that have these characteristics. They then show how to adapt these equations to run Newton’s method efficiently.</p>
<p>What properties make an equation easy to minimize? Two things: The first is that the equation should be bowl-shaped, or “convex.” Rather than having many valleys, it has just one — meaning that when you try to minimize it, you don’t have to worry about mistaking an arbitrary valley for the lowest one.</p>

<p>The second property is that the equation can be written as a sum of squares. For example, 5<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 16<em>x</em> + 13 can be written as the sum (<em>x</em> + 2)<sup>2</sup> + (2<em>x</em> + 3)<sup>2</sup>. In recent years, mathematicians have developed techniques for minimizing equations with arbitrarily large exponents so long as they are both convex and a sum of squares. However, those techniques were of little help when it came to Newton’s method. Most of the time, the Taylor approximation you use won’t have these nice properties.</p>
<p>But Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang figured out how to use a technique called semidefinite programming to wiggle the Taylor approximation just enough to make it both a sum of squares and convex, though not so much that it became unmoored from the original function it was supposed to resemble.</p>
<p>They essentially added a fudge factor to the Taylor expansion, turning it into an equation that had the two desired properties. “We can change the Taylor expansion a bit to make it simpler to minimize. Think of the Taylor expansion, but modified a little bit,” Ahmadi said. He and his colleagues then showed that, using this modified version of the Taylor expansion — which involved arbitrarily many derivatives — their algorithm would still converge on the true minimum of the original function. Moreover, the rate of convergence would scale with the number of derivatives used: Just as using two derivatives allowed Newton to approach the true minimum at a quadratic rate, using three derivatives enabled the researchers to approach it at a cubic rate, and so on.</p>
<p>Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang had created a more powerful version of Newton’s method that could reach the true minimum value of a function in fewer iterations than previous techniques.</p>
        
        
<p>Like the original version of Newton’s method, each iteration of this new algorithm is still computationally more expensive than methods such as gradient descent. As a result, for the moment, the new work won’t change the way self-driving cars, machine learning algorithms or air traffic control systems work. The best bet in these cases is still gradient descent.</p>
<p>“Many ideas in optimization take years before they are made fully practical,” said <a href="https://jasonaltschuler.github.io/">Jason Altschuler</a> of the University of Pennsylvania. “But this seems like a fresh perspective.”</p>
<p>If, over time, the underlying computational technology needed to run Newton’s method becomes more efficient — making each iteration less computationally expensive — then the algorithm developed by Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang could eventually surpass gradient descent for all sorts of applications, including machine learning.</p>
<p>“Our algorithm right now is provably faster, in theory,” Ahmadi said. He’s hopeful, he added, that in 10 to 20 years, it will also be so in practice.</p>
