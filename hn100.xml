            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/microsoft_maia_dc/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/microsoft_maia_dc/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45463642">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft buys a lot of GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD. But moving forward, Redmond's leaders want to shift the majority of its AI workloads from GPUs to its own homegrown accelerators.</p>
<p>The software titan is rather late to the custom silicon party. While Amazon and Google have been building custom CPUs and AI accelerators for years, Microsoft only <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/15/microsoft-holds-chip-makers-feet-to-the-fire-with-homegrown-cpu-and-ai-chips/">revealed</a> its Maia AI accelerators in late 2023.</p>
<p>Driving the transition is a focus on performance per dollar, which for a hyperscale cloud provider is arguably the only metric that really matters. Speaking during a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html">fireside</a> chat moderated by CNBC on Wednesday, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott said that up to this point, Nvidia has offered the best price-performance, but he's willing to entertain anything in order to meet demand.</p>

    

<p>Going forward, Scott suggested Microsoft hopes to use its homegrown chips for the majority of its datacenter workloads.</p>

        


        

<p>When asked, "Is the longer term idea to have mainly Microsoft silicon in the data center?" Scott responded, "Yeah, absolutely."</p>
<p>Later, he told CNBC, "It's about the entire system design. It's the networks and cooling, and you want to be able to have the freedom to make decisions that you need to make in order to really optimize your compute for the workload."</p>

        

<p>With its first in-house AI accelerator, the Maia 100, Microsoft was able to free up GPU capacity by shifting OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to its own silicon back in 2023. However, with just 800 teraFLOPS of BF16 performance, 64GB of HBM2e, and 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth, the chip fell well short of competing GPUs from Nvidia and AMD.</p>

<p>Microsoft is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-scales-back-ambitions-ai-chips-overcome-delays">reportedly</a> in the process of bringing a second-generation Maia accelerator to market next year that will no doubt offer more competitive compute, memory, and interconnect performance.</p>
<p>But while we may see a change in the mix of GPUs to AI ASICs in Microsoft data centers moving forward, they're unlikely to replace Nvidia and AMD's chips entirely.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google and Amazon have deployed tens of thousands of their TPUs and Trainium accelerators. While these chips have helped them secure some high-profile customer wins, Anthropic for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/04/project_rainier_deep_dive/">example</a>, these chips are more often used to accelerate the company's own in-house workloads.</p>
<p>As such, we continue to see large-scale Nvidia and AMD GPU deployments on these cloud platforms, in part because customers still want them.</p>

        

<p>It should be noted that AI accelerators aren't the only custom chips Microsoft has been working on. Redmond also has its own CPU called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html">Cobalt</a> and a whole host of platform security silicon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/microsoft_silicon_security/">designed</a> to accelerate cryptography and safeguard key exchanges across its vast datacenter domains. ®</p>

<p dir="auto">Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.</p>
<p dir="auto">The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.</p>

<p dir="auto">Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#niri:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">Matrix channel</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> page.
Have your <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">waybar</a>s and <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel" rel="nofollow">fuzzel</a>s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out <a href="https://github.com/Vortriz/awesome-niri">awesome-niri</a>, a list of niri-related links and projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some points you may have questions about:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Multi-monitor</strong>: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.</li>
<li><strong>Fractional scaling</strong>: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: seems to work fine.</li>
<li><strong>Floating windows</strong>: yes, starting from niri 25.01.</li>
<li><strong>Input devices</strong>: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use <a href="https://opentabletdriver.net/" rel="nofollow">OpenTabletDriver</a>.
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.</li>
<li><strong>Wlr protocols</strong>: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on <a href="https://wayland.app/" rel="nofollow">wayland.app</a> at the bottom of each protocol's page.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee&nbsp;PC&nbsp;900 from&nbsp;2008, of all things.</li>
<li><strong>Xwayland</strong>: <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite" rel="nofollow">integrated</a> via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.</li>

<p dir="auto">If you'd like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inspiration</h2><a id="user-content-inspiration" aria-label="Permalink: Inspiration" href="#inspiration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Niri is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a> which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way we consume content on the internet is increasingly driven by walled-garden platforms and black-box feed algorithms. This shift is making our media diets miserable. Ironically, a solution to the problem predates algorithmic feeds, social media and other forms of informational junk food. It is called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and it is beautiful.</p><p>RSS is just a format that defines how websites can publish updates (articles, posts, episodes, and so on) in a standard feed that you can subscribe to using an RSS reader (or aggregator). Don’t worry if this sounds extremely uninteresting to you; there aren’t many people that get excited about format specifications; the beauty of RSS is in its simplicity. Any content management system or blog platform supports RSS out of the box, and often enables it by default. As a result, a large portion of the content on the internet is available to you in feeds that you can tap into. But this time, you’re in full control of what you’re receiving, and the feeds are purely reverse chronological bliss. Coincidentally, you might already be using RSS without even knowing, because the whole podcasting world <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/business-of-podcasting/podcasts-need-an-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs on RSS</a>.</p><p>There are many amazing articles about the utility and elegance of RSS, and I do not think the world needs another, so I will spare you and instead focus on my personal experience and tips. If you are interested in a deeper dive, I highly recommend Molly White’s article <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curate your own newspaper with RSS</a>. It is a convincing, well-written article that you can also listen to in Molly’s own voice if you wish to.</p><h2 id="broken-distribution-models">Broken distribution models</h2><p>Here’s a little story about the promise of social media. In 2011, my <a href="https://somnusaeternus.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">band</a> was getting a little more serious and preparing to record our first album. Facebook was rapidly growing all over the world, so I created an account - mostly to manage my band’s Facebook page. Back then, social media (and Facebook in particular) felt very different: vibrant and full of promise for the brave new future of web 2.0. I looked up all my favorite bands so that every time they put out an album or tour near me, I wouldn’t miss it. Many bands either lacked proper websites or rarely updated them in a useful way, so this felt like the perfect use case for Facebook.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to start seeing the cracks. As Facebook would push for more engagement, some bands would flood their pages with multiple posts per day, especially if they were touring or had a new release coming up. Others would be more restrained, but then their posts would often be lost in the feed. There was no way to opt in only for a certain type of updates from my followed pages, and the increasingly algorithmic feed would simply prioritize posts by engagement. I realized that I wouldn’t be able to get just the <strong>important</strong> updates; instead, I’d get a wild mish-mash of engagement-bait that I wasn’t willing to work my way through. And don’t get me started about how over time, page owners had to pay to promote their posts to get any reach on the platform - that is simply extortion.</p><p>I no longer use Facebook (or any similar social media for that matter) for many reasons, though algorithmic feeds are at the top of the list. Algorithms on social media are very unlikely to be written with your best interest in mind: The goal of social media is to keep you glued to the feed for as long as possible. It optimizes for the most time spent, for engagement, for serving the most ads. It will not necessarily optimize for keeping you well informed, showing you balanced opinions, giving you control or even showing you all the information you’d like. The misalignment of incentives has become very apparent in the last few years, but the problem goes deeper. Any type of curation (because algorithmic feeds are simply curation machines) will never be flexible enough to account for every person’s needs. The story we are sold with algorithmic curation is that it adapts to everyone’s taste and interests, but that’s only true until the interests of the advertisers enter the picture.</p><p>My RSS journey starting many moons ago with Opera and Thunderbird, continued with Google Reader (RIP) and <a href="https://www.theoldreader.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Old Reader</a>, and finally led me to running my own instance of <a href="https://www.freshrss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshRSS</a>. However, in the last year, I have read most of the content from my RSS feeds on my phone via the <a href="https://github.com/seazon/FeedMe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeedMe</a> app. I find that it scratches the itch of unlocking your phone and wanting to see something novel (probably gravitating towards social media). On the upside, it feeds me only articles and media that a) I have picked upfront and nothing more, b) is typically longer-form and more thoughtful than your typical social media posts.</p><p>Also, unlike algorithmic feeds, it allows me to pick what category of my interests I am in the mood for. If I’m in the mood for something lighter, I can just look into my “Fun” folder to check out new stuff from <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oatmeal</a> or <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xkcd</a>. If I feel like reading something more thoughtful, I’d dive into my “Reads” folder for <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Marginalian</a> or <a href="https://sentiers.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentiers</a>. Feeling like catching up on the newest AI research? I can browse the latest research papers from <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv</a> that have specific keywords in the abstracts (such as prompt injection). Or I could just browse everything at once to see what piques my interest. I am the master of what information I consume, how and in what order, and no one can take that away from me by rearranging my feed or tweaking the algorithm.</p><p>One of the many small advantages is the consistency of the interface and the lack of distractions when reading. Modern browsers support reader modes, but you need to enter the mode manually and some pages might not be displayed correctly. I don’t have any attention problems (that I know of), but reading articles on certain newspaper sites feels like a cruel joke: the text of the article is often drowned by ads, suggested articles, polls, and other visual smog. Not a pleasant reading experience. Your RSS reader always uses the same font, font size, screen real estate and never shows anything but the article itself.</p><p>The focused, reductive nature of RSS readers means you don’t get the full website experience, but that is arguably for the better in a lot of cases. We already mentioned the lack of suggested articles with engagement bait that could easily draw you in, but another notable omission is the comments section. It is very easy to slip into the comments section at the bottom of an article and spend far too much time reading those. You can still do that in an RSS reader by opening the article in your browser, scrolling down to the comments and diving in. At least in my case, that is a safe amount of friction to prevent me from doing it most of the time. Less is more!</p><h2 id="tips-to-get-you-going">Tips to get you going</h2><ul><li>Many of the websites you open regularly, follow on social media or get a newsletter from, likely have an RSS feed. Look out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feed-icon.svg#/media/File:Feed-icon.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSS icon</a> or the words RSS or feed. There are also tools like <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a> that can sniff out the feed for you. That said, my experience is that simply adding the homepage URL of the website into an aggregator usually works.</li><li>Remember my frustration with Facebook as a source of news for new music releases? Turns out there is a much better free solution called <a href="https://muspy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muspy</a>, where you enter all your favorite artists and it will notify you of their new releases. And guess what? You either get notified via email, or you use your personal RSS feed. Highly recommended!</li><li>Start easy with something like <a href="https://www.theoldreader.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Old Reader</a> or <a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedly</a> - both offer relatively generous free tiers. And if you outgrow them or want to try something else, you simply export an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPML</a> file with all your feeds and import them into your new RSS solution. This is the upside of open standards: freedom, ownership, and portability.</li><li>Once you have more than 5-10 feeds, start putting them into folders/categories. No need to overthink it, but doing this will help you be more selective about the content you read if you’re in a specific mood.</li><li>RSS readers can be great when traveling or whenever your internet connection might be down or spotty. You can set up your RSS client in a way that automatically fetches new content, so when you board the plane and go dark, you can still read through the already downloaded articles. (Beware, though: not all RSS feeds include full content - sometimes they’re more like teasers.)</li><li>Some websites that limit how many articles you can browse for free are actually less strict about content accessed through RSS feeds. There are obvious ethical concerns with abusing this, but it is still an upside, and you are only consuming what they provide.</li><li>If you want to tinker, you can set up an RSS aggregator like <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshRSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/torne/Tiny-Tiny-RSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiny tiny RSS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/fossar/selfoss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selfoss</a> on a shared web hosting service. If you want to go full self-hosted, there are <a href="https://selfh.st/alternatives/rss-readers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more options available</a>.</li><li>Get a good mobile app. Try a few before you settle! This is a highly personal choice because even small UI quirks and differences may bother you. If you’re anything like me, you’ll do most of the reading on your phone, so make sure it feels good.</li><li>RSS readers/clients often have bookmarking/starring system which works much like dedicated bookmarking apps.</li><li>Bigger publications often have separate feeds for individual categories or tags - check those to avoid getting your main feed flooded.</li><li>Some websites have very elaborate RSS APIs which allow you to query for specific types of content. For example, <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/basics.html#quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv</a> has a really elaborate one, allowing you to only follow specific topics. The documentation is quite complex, so here is a quick example to kick start you:<ul><li><code>https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=abs:LLM+AND+multilingual&amp;sortBy=submittedDate&amp;sortOrder=descending</code></li><li>The query searches through the most recently submitted papers with the words LLM and multilingual in the abstract.</li></ul></li><li>Do a little cleanup from time to time: unsubscribe from feeds that no longer seem to interest you. It’s fine, no one will take offense, and your attention is too precious to be wasted on stuff that is not for you.</li><li>Don’t know where to start? Check out <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/rss-feeds-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list of 100 most popular RSS feeds</a>, <a href="https://rss.feedspot.com/best_rss_feeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedspot’s 70 most popular feeds</a> or <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/blog-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hostinger’s list of 55 popular blogs</a>. Apart from that, Google is your friend (especially if you start searching for specific topics or niches), and good blogs often link to other blogs - all you need to do is to follow the breadcrumbs.</li></ul><p>Happy RSS-ing!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>From <a href="https://awsm.nz/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/">https://awsm.nz/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/</a></p>



<p>The world is entering an era where identity is no longer a matter of personal relationships, lived experience, or even paperwork. Increasingly, it is reduced to biometric scans, algorithmic verification, and digital tokens. Across the globe, governments and corporations are rolling out digital identification systems, facial recognition passports, biometric driver’s licences, app-based vaccine passes, QR-coded welfare access, and unified digital wallets. The language that accompanies these projects is familiar – efficiency, convenience, modernisation, inclusion. We are told that digital ID will make life easier, reduce fraud, and open new opportunities.</p>



<p>The reality, however, is far more sinister. Identification has never been neutral, it has always been a weapon of power, wielded by states and capitalists to monitor, control, and discipline populations. From passports to colonial passbooks, from welfare cards to border regimes, the apparatus of identification has always been tied to domination. Digital ID is simply the latest iteration of this long history, but with a scale and sophistication that makes its dangers even more profound. Far from liberating us, it is forging new chains and binding us more tightly to systems of surveillance, exclusion, and exploitation.</p>



<p><strong>Identification as Domination</strong></p>



<p>To grasp what digital ID represents, we must situate it within the longer history of identification as a tool of authority. The passport, now normalised as a necessary object of travel, was originally a way for states to restrict movement. In medieval Europe, peasants and serfs required written permission to leave their estates. Colonial regimes across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific perfected these systems of control, forcing indigenous people to carry passes while settlers roamed unhindered. In apartheid South Africa, the “pass laws” criminalised Black South Africans for existing outside their assigned zones, reducing life itself to a bureaucratic calculation of permission.</p>



<p>Identification has never been about protecting the individual; it has been about protecting property relations. States have needed to know who people are in order to tax them, conscript them, and deny them rights. Employers demanded papers to guarantee that workers were legally exploitable. Landlords used identification to screen tenants, banks to gate-keep credit, police to track dissenters. The notion of “identity” under capitalism has always been bound up with surveillance and discipline.</p>



<p>Digital ID does not break from this tradition but it intensifies it. What once required a physical stamp or signature now demands a biometric scan or QR code. Where once a police officer demanded to see your papers, now an algorithm silently determines your access. The shift is not from control to freedom, but from analogue domination to digital domination.</p>



<p><strong>The Logic of Digital ID</strong></p>



<p>Behind the rhetoric of convenience lies the hard logic of capital and the state. Digital ID is not being built for us, it is being built to extend the power of those who already govern our lives.</p>



<p>At its core, digital ID represents the enclosure of access. Increasingly, the essentials of life, healthcare, housing, employment, welfare, travel, are gated behind digital checkpoints. Without the correct identification, people are excluded. This transforms existence itself into a series of permissions, each mediated by algorithmic verification. Access to food, shelter, or work becomes conditional on whether a machine recognises your fingerprint or face.</p>



<p>It also expands surveillance capitalism. Every scan, swipe, or login generates data. This data is stored, tracked, and monetised. Digital ID reduces human beings to data streams, feeding the profits of corporations like Microsoft, Mastercard, and Accenture, companies deeply embedded in global ID initiatives. Far from empowering individuals, digital ID empowers corporations by turning our lives into commodities to be sold.</p>



<p>Digital ID also disciplines labour. By tying welfare payments, work permits, or banking access to digital identity, states and corporations acquire powerful new tools to coerce populations. In India, the Aadhaar biometric system has left millions excluded from rations and pensions when fingerprints failed to scan, producing not efficiency but hunger. Migrant workers across the world are increasingly monitored through digital verification, making precarious labour even more vulnerable.</p>



<p>Perhaps most insidiously, digital ID normalises surveillance itself. By embedding digital checkpoints into daily life, whether entering a building, logging into a service, or accessing healthcare, surveillance becomes routine. What once might have provoked outrage becomes ordinary. Control does not need to be imposed violently when it is integrated seamlessly into the everyday functions of existence.</p>



<p>The consequences of digital ID are not abstract. Around the world, its implementation reveals the sharp edges of exclusion and control.</p>



<p>As already mentioned India’s Aadhaar project, the largest biometric ID system in history, covers over a billion people. It was presented as a means of reducing corruption and expanding access to welfare. In reality, it has excluded millions of poor and rural people from food rations and pensions because their fingerprints did not register. Reports have documented starvation deaths when families were denied grain for lack of proper authentication. For the poor, the system is not convenience, it is a death sentence.</p>



<p>In Europe, digital ID takes a different but equally insidious form. The EU is developing a unified “digital identity wallet” for banking, healthcare, and travel, promoted as freedom for citizens. At the same time, the Eurodac database stores the fingerprints of asylum seekers to enforce deportations and prevent secondary movement. Digital ID here is double-edged, advertised as seamless mobility for the privileged, but functioning as chains for migrants.</p>



<p>Across Africa, the World Bank and multinational corporations are funding digital ID projects under the guise of “financial inclusion.” Tied to mobile money systems, these IDs are less about inclusion than about expanding debt markets and integrating populations into circuits of extraction. They replicate colonial practices where identification was a prerequisite for resource exploitation and labour discipline.</p>



<p>In settler-colonial states like New Zealand and Australia, digital driver’s licences and facial recognition technologies are being trialled under the language of security and convenience. But both countries maintain extensive databases of their populations, and both have long histories of surveillance and repression against indigenous peoples and political activists. Digital ID here strengthens existing patterns of racialised and political control, embedding them in everyday transactions.</p>



<p><strong>The Role of the State</strong></p>



<p>For anarchists, it is no surprise that the state is at the centre of these developments. The state has never been a neutral provider of services. It is a machinery of class rule, designed to enforce property relations and maintain hierarchy. Digital ID offers the state new levels of efficiency in population management. Welfare can be rationed through digital checkpoints, ensuring that only the “deserving” poor receive aid. Policing is strengthened through biometric databases, making dissent and protest more dangerous. Borders become omnipresent, extending into every workplace, clinic, and street corner. Even the ritual of voting is increasingly tied to digital verification, further legitimising the state’s hold.</p>



<p>But the state does not act alone. The infrastructure of digital ID is outsourced to corporations, tech giants and consultancy firms whose profits depend on extracting and selling data. ID2020, the flagship global digital ID initiative, is a partnership between Microsoft, Accenture, Gavi, and Mastercard. This fusion of state power and corporate capital creates a techno-bureaucratic regime that is incredibly difficult to resist at the level of the individual. It is not simply your government demanding your data, it is a web of global corporations embedding control into the infrastructure of daily life.</p>



<p><strong>Resistance and Its Possibilities</strong></p>



<p>And yet, systems of domination are never total. The chains of digital ID can be resisted, but the struggle requires collective defiance. Individuals cannot simply opt out when access to food, housing, or healthcare is increasingly contingent on digital verification. Resistance must be social, coordinated, and rooted in solidarity.</p>



<p>It begins with exposing the lie of convenience. The marketing of digital ID depends on people believing it is in their interests. By revealing its function as surveillance, exclusion, and profit-making, we can puncture the narrative that it is a neutral technological advance. Convenience is the sugar that coats the poison pill.</p>



<p>Resistance also means standing with those most affected by exclusion. When people are denied access to food or healthcare because a machine rejects them, solidarity demands that communities step in. Mutual aid networks, food distribution, and grassroots healthcare can undermine the state’s monopoly on survival. By caring for each other without demanding documents, communities demonstrate the possibility of life beyond identification.</p>



<p>Direct action has its place as well. Surveillance infrastructure can be disrupted, whether through physical sabotage, digital hacktivism, or leaks that expose the collusion of states and corporations. Every act that slows the expansion of digital ID chips away at its inevitability.</p>



<p>Perhaps most crucially, resistance means refusing to internalise the normalisation of surveillance. We must continue to feel anger each time a new checkpoint is introduced, each time a new biometric system is trialled, each time a new database is constructed. The greatest victory of power is not when it controls us, but when it convinces us that control is natural.</p>



<p>Digital ID is not a neutral innovation. It is the frontier of capitalist surveillance and state control. It deepens exploitation, excludes the vulnerable, and integrates every aspect of life into the machinery of profit and domination. Identification has always been a tool of authority, from medieval passes to apartheid laws, and digital ID is the most sophisticated form yet.</p>



<p>The ruling class wants us to believe digital ID is inevitable. But inevitability is the language of power. Systems of domination can be resisted, sabotaged, dismantled. The struggle against digital ID is not about nostalgia for the days of paper documents; it is about defending the very possibility of living without being constantly monitored, verified, and reduced to data.</p>



<p>What is at stake is not simply privacy, but freedom itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://blender.org/">Blender</a> 4.5 LTS <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/">was released</a>
on July 15, 2025, and will be supported through 2027. This is the last
feature release of the 3D graphics-creation suite's 4.x series; it
includes quality-of-life improvements, including work to bring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> backend up to
par with the default OpenGL backend. With 4.5 released, Blender
developers are turning their attention toward Blender 5.0, planned for
release later this year. It will introduce substantial changes,
particularly in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction.html">Geometry
Nodes</a> system, a central feature of Blender's procedural
workflows.</p>

<h4>Brief introduction</h4>

<p>Blender is an open-source creative application released under the GPLv3.
The <a href="https://www.blender.org/foundation/">Blender Foundation</a>
stewards development, with significant funding from the <a href="https://fund.blender.org/">Blender Development Fund</a> as well
as backing from individual contributors and industry sponsors. Its
code is primarily written in C and <span>C++</span>,
with Python used extensively for scripting and add-ons.</p>

<p>While Blender is often known as a 3D modeling and animation tool,
it has grown into a comprehensive open-source suite for digital
content creation. Alongside powerful 3D tools, it features
compositing, <a href="https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/">nonlinear
video editing</a>, and 2D animation in 3D space. This integrated suite
of tools enables designers, animators, and other creators to work with
a single application across their digital pipeline. Blender also
provides access to its core functions through <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/nodes/introduction.html">Nodes</a>,
a visual programming system that enables procedural workflows for
complex operations. The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/grease_pencil/introduction.html">Grease
Pencil tool</a>, also accessible through the Geometry Nodes system, is
used for 2D animation, cut-out animation, motion graphics, and more. Blender's procedural systems rely heavily
on these node-based graphical interfaces, and the 4.5 LTS focuses on
their continued evolution. These systems enable fully non-destructive
workflows, preserving all original data at every stage of the editing
process.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Blender strives to be compatible with visual-effects (VFX) industry
standards through alignment with the <a href="https://vfxplatform.com/">VFX Reference Platform</a>, which is
updated annually. This allows Blender to be run on the same systems as
other VFX software, as well as share files with them. 4.5 brings <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/136540">a
slew of library updates</a> to maintain alignment with the reference
platform.</p>

<h4>A solid foundation</h4>

<p>Historically, Blender has relied
on <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> for drawing its user
interface and powering its 3D-display capabilities. However, efforts
are underway to modernize this aspect of its core functionality
by <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/gpu/">abstracting
away the rendering backend</a>, bringing support for running on additional
graphics APIs, including Vulkan
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_%28API%29">Apple's
Metal API</a>. The Vulkan API is a
low-overhead, cross-platform standard that allows applications like
Blender to communicate more directly with GPU hardware than OpenGL. Being the
final feature release of the 4.x series, this LTS brings a critical
step in the maturity of
the <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#vulkan">Vulkan
backend</a>. Though still not enabled by default due to multiple
outstanding issues, it now rivals the OpenGL backend in both features
and performance.</p>

<p>Vulkan is built on a <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/17_Multithreading.html">parallel-execution model</a>, allowing applications to send multiple commands
to the GPU simultaneously, while OpenGL relies on a sequential
model. Vulkan's execution model makes better use of the increased number
of cores found in modern GPUs. This is a <a href="https://code.blender.org/2023/10/vulkan-project-update/">crucial
step</a> toward smoother viewport performance and more responsive
interaction with complex scenes.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#limitations">known
limitations</a> still blocking the new backend from being adopted as
the default. Notably, large meshes with 100-million vertices or
more are not yet supported, resulting in poor performance on the
Vulkan backend for virtual reality and other high-mesh-count
applications. Future driver updates may address some of these
issues.</p>

<p>The viewport in Blender is an interactive view space where 3D
scenes are displayed and constructed. Rendering converts 3D scenes
into 2D images or video, producing the final output with Blender's
built-in engines or third-party renderers. Rendering can also be
performed without the graphical interface by running Blender in
headless mode, both on individual systems and at scale on render
farms. The viewport and rendering upgrades in Blender 4.5 extend
beyond the improvements to its Vulkan backend. Specifically, work
continues
on <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/eevee/introduction.html">EEVEE</a>,
the realtime rendering engine built for rapid, interactive rendering
on modern GPUs. EEVEE 2.0, also known as EEVEE Next, receives several
critical improvements focused on stability and visual
accuracy. Shadows now render more smoothly thanks to the addition
of <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/81c00bf272f22dc732b0fc8c9d7db39c5f916a07">shadow
terminator normal bias</a>. This is an area where EEVEE has struggled
to match other renderers, including Blender's
own <a href="https://www.cycles-renderer.org/">Cycles rendering
engine</a>.</p>

<p>Two settings control shadow termination bias: "Geometry Offset" and "Shading
Offset", <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/cycles/object_settings/object_data.html#shading">found
in the "Shading" tab</a> of the "Object Properties" panel. This gives
artists greater control over the position and angle of
shadows. However, due to the difficulties of creating shadows that work
equally well for all projects, the default for these settings is
"no bias". These visual improvements coincide with fixes for rendering
problems such as <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/b01cdf7df2ba62c66cf0fce4521d65afa46acf52">light
leaking from large light sources</a>. Light leaking is a phenomenon
where light incorrectly passes through or around solid objects,
creating unrealistic bright spots in the rendered scene. Overall,
these changes aim to bring EEVEE Next closer to parity with other
renderers.</p>

<p>Beyond rendering quality, this LTS release delivers 
improvements to workflow fluidity. Texture loading, shader
compilation, and startup times all contribute to overall performance
and user experience, and all
three <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#performance">have
been improved</a>. Textures are now loaded
using <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1d638c0f5e8b90c41fec92147d9fcd286aec015c">a
deferred, multithreaded process</a>, resulting in more than double the
speed of the previous method. This change introduces a small CPU
overhead due to loading textures before redrawing the viewport, but
the cost is not significant enough to severely impact performance.</p>

<p>Shaders
are <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1c47e31367b78a770d8ad5452d2e80cab5b51e94">also
now compiled in parallel</a>. Crucially, this
optimization is independent of the viewport backend in use, whether
Vulkan or OpenGL, translating to immediate benefits from these core
improvements. That said,
a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/preferences/system.html#:~:text=Shader%20Compilation-,method,-Defines%20the%20method">new
preference</a> allows users to revert to sub-process shader
calculation, if desired, which is faster but consumes more RAM. Additionally, by skipping unnecessary shading
steps during viewport initialization, startup times have been improved
significantly.</p>

<p>With ongoing efforts to improve the workspace, users can
now <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/properties_editor.html#:~:text=Visible-,tabs,-Allows%20hiding%20specific">control
which tabs are visible</a> in the Properties Editor through the
right-click pop-up
menu. The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/asset_browser.html">Asset
Browser</a>, used for importing and organizing assets (including
scenes, 3D objects, textures, and more), has been
continually refined throughout the 4.x series. In 4.5 LTS, it receives
some key usability enhancements, particularly in how assets are
displayed, such as wrapping long lines used for asset labels, and
making it easier to create thumbnails for assets.</p>

<h4>Nodes, Grease Pencil, and modeling polish</h4>

<p>Rather than focusing solely on fixes
and <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/geometry_nodes/#performance">performance
gains</a>, this cycle emphasized tighter
integration between the various node systems in Blender. The result is
that <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/shader_editor.html">Shader
Nodes</a>, <a href="http://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/compositor.html">Compositor
Nodes</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/geometry_node.html">Geometry
Nodes</a> (including Grease Pencil Nodes) now share more capabilities
and have a more consistent workflow.</p>

<p>The common nodes (including mathematical operations)
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/materials/legacy_textures/introduction.html">procedural
textures</a> available with Shader Nodes and Geometry Nodes
are <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/0a80f470f8">now
available</a> for use in the Compositor. This change enables effects
such as procedurally generated visual noise or cloudiness applied to
an image or video during post-processing. Common nodes can be copied
across Shader and Geometry Node setups, further aligning node logic
and capability design across the toolset. In Geometry Nodes, the new
"Set Mesh Normal" node grants artists direct control over custom
normals, which are perpendicular vectors that are used to represent
the orientation of a surface. By allowing users to define normals via
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/fields.html">Fields</a>,
Blender provides <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/mesh/write/set_mesh_normal.html">fine-grained
procedural controls</a> for surface shading. For instance, an animator
could drive this node with a value to simulate a material seamlessly
transitioning from a soft, smooth surface to a rough, hard-edged one,
all without the need for manually editing the mesh.</p>

<p>In
4.5, <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/point_cloud/index.html">Point
Clouds</a> debut
as <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/75717">a
new object type</a>, accessible from the "Add" menu in the viewport or
through various Geometry Nodes. Point Clouds represent objects as a
group of points in 3D space and have long been used in scientific and
industrial 3D scanning. According to the Blender <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/objects/pointcloud/#point-cloud-object">developer
documentation on Point Clouds</a>, this new object
type supports motion graphics, physics simulations (including particle systems),
granular materials (such as sand and gravel), and 3D scanning. To this
end, Blender
includes <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/modeling/point_cloud/tools.html">comprehensive
tools</a>
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/modeling/point_cloud/editing.html">editable
object attributes</a>, including standard transformations like
rotation and scale. It
also <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/objects/pointcloud/#rendering">maintains
high rendering performance</a> through EEVEE and Cycles, putting point
clouds on par with meshes.</p>

<h4>Looking ahead</h4>

<p>With 4.5 LTS out the door, the Blender developers have shifted
focus to 5.0, the next major release, which is now
under active development. As the beginning of a new, feature-breaking series,
5.0 <a href="https://cgcookie.com/posts/blender-5-0-release-what-do-we-know-and-what-to-look-forward-to">introduces</a>
significant refinements and modernized workflows without abandoning the
<a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/2.80/ui/">user
interface paradigm established by Blender 2.80</a> in 2019. The <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/">release
notes</a> outline several key features planned for the release. Among
these improvements is the ability to <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/ba3eaf3a841388a6e5e44677662be4bffd787e04">mark
scenes as assets</a>, allowing entire scenes with their contents and
setup to be pulled directly into the visual scene editor using the asset browser.</p>

<p>The Grease Pencil
tool in 5.0 <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/f7a000345201f259b94e754341d1b4925c25e8d1">supports</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur_%28media%29">motion
blur</a> effect, controlled by the new "Motion Blur Steps" setting in
the "Grease Pencil" render panel. Linux users now benefit from <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/140277">HDR
support in the viewport</a> on Wayland when using the Vulkan
backend. Additionally, <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/59a759b98d1">a
change to the <tt>.blend</tt> file format to handle larger content</a>
allows Blender to store meshes with
more than a few hundred million vertices. This feature <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/core/#large-buffers-in-blend-files">required
a change</a> to the file structure of the <tt>.blend</tt> file format, meaning
that files created in version 5.0 are incompatible with Blender 4.4
and prior releases, but can be loaded in 4.5 LTS. While the new format
supports meshes with hundreds of millions of vertices, working with
such files still demands powerful hardware, specifically large amounts
of system RAM and GPU memory.</p>

<p>Blender
5.0 <a href="https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gsoc-2025-edit-mesh-mirror-improvements/40369">improves
symmetry</a> in Edit Mode by ensuring mirrored operations no longer
fail or produce inconsistent
results. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping">UV
mapping</a>, the process of unfolding the surface of a 3D model onto a
2D image for applying textures, sees improvements in Blender 5.0
thanks to improved synchronization. This change ensures selections
remain aligned between the viewport and the UV Editor. Blender 5.0
finally resolves this longstanding limitation.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About FyneDesk</h2><a id="user-content-about-fynedesk" aria-label="Permalink: About FyneDesk" href="#about-fynedesk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">FyneDesk is an easy to use Linux/Unix desktop environment following material design.
It is built using the <a href="https://fyne.io/" rel="nofollow">Fyne</a> toolkit and is designed to be
easy to use as well as easy to develop. We use the Go language and welcome
any contributions or feedback for the project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Wu5k0xZOI" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/01f8520a2c32c022283a1311aea9b453f092192a8f0327e2d9ec7d22309af00f/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f38325775356b30785a4f492f302e6a7067" alt="FyneDesk v0.4" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/82Wu5k0xZOI/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h2><a id="user-content-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink: Dependencies" href="#dependencies"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h3><a id="user-content-compiling" aria-label="Permalink: Compiling" href="#compiling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Compiling requires the same dependencies as Fyne. See the <a href="https://developer.fyne.io/started/" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> documentation for installation steps.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running</h3><a id="user-content-running" aria-label="Permalink: Running" href="#running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For a full desktop experience you will also need the following external tools installed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>arandr</code> for modifying display settings</li>
<li><code>xbacklight</code> or <code>brightnessctl</code> for laptop brightness</li>
<li><code>connman-gtk</code> is currently used for configuring Wi-Fi network settings</li>
<li><code>compton</code> for compositor support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The desktop does work without the runtime dependencies but the experience will be degraded.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install FyneDesk using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will add <code>fynedesk</code> to your $GOPATH (usually ~/go/bin).
You can now run the app in "preview" mode like any other Fyne app.
Doing so is not running a window manager, to do so requires another few steps:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting up as a desktop environment</h3><a id="user-content-setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment" aria-label="Permalink: Setting up as a desktop environment" href="#setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use this as your main desktop you can run the following commands to set up
fynedesk as a selectable desktop option in your login manager (such as LightDM for example):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can now log out and see that it is in your desktop selection list at login.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging a window manager</h3><a id="user-content-debugging-a-window-manager" aria-label="Permalink: Debugging a window manager" href="#debugging-a-window-manager"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also run the window manager components in an embedded X window for testing.
You will need the <code>Xephyr</code> tool installed for your platform (often installed as part of Xorg).
Once it is present you can use the following command from the same directory as above:</p>

<p dir="auto">It should look like this:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/blob/master/desktop-dark-current.png"><img src="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/raw/master/desktop-dark-current.png" alt="Fyne Desktop - Dark"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">If you run the command when there is a window manager running, or on
an operating system that does not support window managers (Windows or
macOS) then the app will start in UI test mode.
When loaded in this way you can run all of the features except the
controlling of windows - they will load on your main desktop.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Runner</h2><a id="user-content-runner" aria-label="Permalink: Runner" href="#runner"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A desktop needs to be rock solid, and whilst we are working hard to get there,
any alpha or beta software can run into unexpected issues.
For that reason, we have included a <code>fynedesk_runner</code> utility that can help
manage unexpected events. If you start the desktop using the runner, then
if a crash occurs, it will normally recover where it left off with no loss
of data in your applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install the runner using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">From then on execute that instead of the <code>fynedesk</code> command for a more
resilient desktop when testing out pre-release builds.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Design concepts, and the abstract wallpapers have been contributed by <a href="https://github.com/jostgrant">Jost Grant</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shipping FyneDesk</h2><a id="user-content-shipping-fynedesk" aria-label="Permalink: Shipping FyneDesk" href="#shipping-fynedesk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are installing FyneDesk by default on a distribution, or making it available as a standard option, you should consider the following points.
You do not need to ship the library or any dependencies, but it is recommended to add the following apps as well:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>app</th>
<th>go get</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>fin</td>
<td><code>github.com/fyshos/fin</code></td>
<td>A display manager app that matches the look and feel of FyneDesk</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Please do let us know if you package FyneDesk for your system, so we can include a link from here :).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
			Honestly, I think Apple really needs to simplify the iPhone for the elderly. I know there are accessibility modes, but you don’t want to have to go through all that and spend hours trying to customize the phone. Also, the whole phone setup process needs to be delayed; having to go through it for an hour puts them off from even wanting to bother. I first set the phones up to make accounts, but it turns out none of them could understand how to unlock the phone. Entering a passcode was a nightmare because they kept forgetting it, even though it was a birthday they knew, lol.</p><p>

So, I tried Touch ID and Face ID, and that was even more complicated and kept erroring out. Then, the Siri thing kept popping up on the phones with Touch ID, despite turning it off, and the whole swiping from the button kept making the screen go down to the bottom half. :/ There were too many apps; all they wanted was the phone app, but it doesn’t default to the keypad, which was too much for them to find.</p><p>


The phones are too fiddly now, and pressing random things as they try to hold the phone meant the phone got lost in a sea of opening stuff up. So, I tried the assistive access, but why isn’t this an option from the get-go? It asks you the age of setup; why not have a 65+ or something for a senior mode?</p><p>


They don’t need passcodes, accounts, and a sea of information. It’s insane, and it’s insane how fiddly these phones are. I never noticed because I’m used to it, but for these people with hands that barely move, the fake Touch ID button and the swiping from the bottom on Face ID phones seem to be the worst! I think having a proper physical button, like iPhones used to have, would have been superior. The one complaint about the fake button was that it didn’t feel like a real button, so they couldn’t gauge it.</p><p>


I left there achieving nothing because they couldn’t figure out their old Nokia phones. The unlock thing on the keypad was too difficult, and if I turned that off, they kept dialing 999 in their pockets for some reason. That’s why I was there: they were calling emergency services 100 times a day, lol.</p><p>


I think what I’ve realized is that I need to go back with flip phones that answer and hang up when you open and close them. However, the two I tried before didn’t act like that, and they had too many features. I really thought I could make the iPhone simple, but NOPE!</p><p>


Apple should work on their phones to make them more accessible and less fiddly, without having to go through a sea of menus.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mdx-content="true"><p>Headed into 2025 I was fat, out of shape, and lazy. My three young children were running circles around me, and I was increasingly concerned not only about my health in general but about the kind of example I was setting for them. My (very) sedentary job in front of a laptop wasn't helping, nor was the fact that my favorite hobby in the world outside of work is, well, sitting in front of the laptop.</p>
<p>Adding to the general anxiety was the fact I had spent the last two years watching my parents struggle with devastating health issues. My parents had me in their early 20's, so all said they really weren't that much older than I am. My thoughts regularly turned into worry that I'd eventually wind up with my own serious health problems if I didn't get my act together.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something about it, but what? Past attempts to go to a gym weren't successful, and I <em>really</em> did not want to drive any more than I already do serving alongside my wife as a kid taxi. Also, having made half-hearted attempts in the past to get into shape (Orange Theory, P90X, etc) and winding up spending less time exercising than researching the minutiae of max VO2, bicycle construction, and fasting benefits, I knew I had to keep things simple.</p>
<p>While on a post-Christmas family vacation down in Florida I concluded it made sense to set a goal that could help me get into better shape but which also could be completed in small chunks over a long period of time. It was also important that I could do the workout at any point in the day and even in my office if necessary. And thus began the quest to complete 10,000 pushups in one year. Almost 10 months later, this harebrained goal and the many positive effects that came from it changed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>
<h2>January, 2025 - The Pushup Tracker</h2>
<p>While still in Florida I fired up a Google Sheet and added two columns to it: Date and Pushups. And on January 1, 2025 I dropped down and knocked out 30. Well not 30 in a row, mind you. I never could have done that on day 1. It was more like 10, 10, 5, 5 or something like that. Then I wrote it down. On January 2 I upped my game a bit, doing 35 and again immediately logged into the sheet and wrote it down again.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the reward very much became the opportunity to open that sheet. Can't write the pushup number down if I didn't do the pushups, right? I didn't want to break the chain (although you'll later see I did in fact break the chain plenty of times in the months ahead) and so in the first 31 days I did pushups on 24 of 31 days, logging 1,018 in total and averaging 32.84 per day.</p>
<p>I even worked up the motivation to run on a treadmill one day in January, logging 2.17 miles in 30 minutes on January 14, 2025. Other than that run and pushups, according to my spreadsheet I did no other notable exercise that month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was also in January that I stopped eating fast food of any type, and as of the day of this writing I've not reversed course on this decision. Long story short we were driving back from <a href="https://codemash.org/">https://codemash.org/</a> and pulled through a McDonalds. I had at that point been eating McDonalds all of my life; nothing over the top mind you, but probably twice a month at least for as long as I can remember. Anyway, the food that day was rancid. Legitimately nauseating. I have no idea why it was that way but I was so turned off that right there and then I swore I'd never touch it again. Coincidentally, over this past weekend I was on a walk and reflecting on some of what I'd been writing in this blog post, and my thoughts turned towards diet. When was the last time you heard somebody (including yourself) say they feel better after eating fast food? We all know the answer to this question: never. This stuff is not food and I feel so much better staying away from this poison.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>February, 2025 - Winter Blues Set In</h2>
<p>Whether it was due to the winter blues or that shiny New Year's resolution already starting to fade, I only logged 848 pushups on 21 of 28 days in February. But I definitely seemed to be getting stronger, averaging 44.63 pushups on those days, and  managed to log a daily high of 117 pushups on February 9, 2025. By the end of February I had logged 1,876 pushups. According to my spreadsheet I also managed to lift weights on February 1, 4, and 10. I have a pretty basic weight set in the basement and although I can't recall the specifics, I was probably standing around listening to CNBC on my phone most of the time.</p>
<h2>March, 2025 - Will the Sun Ever Shine Again?</h2>
<p>I'm not going to sugarcoat it; March was bad, real bad. I only logged 206 pushups on 9 days, averaging 22.9 pushups on those days. It's unclear to me why I'd tailed off so much other than to imagine old man winter was really starting to weigh on me by that point. Even so, those 206 pushups took me to a total of 2,082 pushups for the year.</p>
<h2>April, 2025 - The Sun is Shining Again</h2>
<p>In April my pace picked back up along with the improving weather and increasing sunlight. I completed 375 pushups on 13 days, averaging 28.84 pushups on those days. However I also managed to lift weights on six days in April, went on a run on April 14, and even gave fasting a go for a 28 hour period between April 2-April 3 (not sure I'll do that again).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another lifestyle change unexpectedly happened in April: I basically quit drinking alcohol, wine in particular. This decision was a pretty simple one because as I've gotten older, the hangovers have gotten worse, and my sleep quality has gotten much worse, anytime I drank more than 1-2 drinks. As of this writing (September 28, 2025) I've had maybe 2-3 glasses of wine in almost 5 months. My new alcoholic drink of choice when I feel like having something? Miller Lite. It has low calories, low alcohol content, and you can buy a 12 pack for as much as one bottle of wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding 375 pushups to the pile took me to a total of 2,457 pushups for 2025.</p>
<h2>May, 2025 - Can I Do a Split?</h2>
<p>Likely due to fear I was going to enter yet another summer rocking the "dad bod", my exercise intensity soared in May. I completed 1,281 pushups over 25 days, averaging 51.24 pushups on those days. On five of those days I completed more than 100 pushups, and on May 18 completed a YTD single day high of 150.</p>
<p>I also became mildly obsessed with the idea of doing a split. While browsing Libby as I love to do at night, I found the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Even-Stiffest-People-Can-Splits/dp/1635651786">Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits</a>. The cover showed the author smiling and doing a full split, and I thought well if Eiko says even stiff people can do it then maybe I can too.</p>
<p><img alt="Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits" loading="lazy" width="293" height="304" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=384&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Over the course of May I did the splits workout 15 times, and undoubtedly became far more flexible although I never did quite reach a complete split. This continued into June and early July however for reasons I'll explain in a moment I stopped doing the regiment out of fear I'd get hurt. However, to this day I stretch daily and of all the different exercise routines I've tried this year I think aggressive stretching has perhaps had the most ROI of them all.</p>
<p>On May 15 I ran a 5K with my daughter (well she sped ahead of me after mile 1), completing it in 32:50. Not too bad considering according to my log I ran exactly four times in 2025.</p>
<p>Headed into June I had completed a grand total of 3,738 pushups.</p>
<h2>June, 2025 and Doing Pushups at Versailles</h2>
<p>June is where things really started to get exciting. Every year <a href="https://xenon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenon Partners</a> runs a friendly intercontinental pushup contest. "Friendly" is a relative term considering I work with numerous combat veterans, retired members of the United States and Australian military services, and a former Mr. Australia contestant. I also spent some time in France with the family, attending the 24 Hours of Le Mans race (amazing btw) and sightseeing around the country, meaning I had to fit pushups in whenever possible, including at Versailles:</p>
<p><img alt="Doing pushups at the Palace of Versailles" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>In June my output soared to 2,014 pushups, and despite all of the traveling managed to do pushups on 24 of 30 days, averaging 91.55 pushups per day. I also set multiple PRs in June, doing 205 pushups on June 1, 222 on June 15, and then 300 on June 27. As of June 30 I had completed a total of 5,752 pushups.</p>
<h2>July, 2025 and the 5/15/500 Race</h2>
<p>Upon returning from Europe I got the bright idea to organize a race called the 5/15/500 Challenge. This involved running 5 miles, biking 15 miles, and then completing 500 body weight exercises. Nevermind that I'd run maybe four times in 2025 and hadn't been on my bike once. Many of my neighbors joined the fun, and we even had t-shirts printed for the occasion. Of course, <a href="https://dumbolympics-absurd-website-antics.lovable.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I also created a website</a>. I did this because I figured having an artificially imposed deadline was going to force me to exercise more often. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><img alt="My birthday race" loading="lazy" width="1595" height="921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>In July I completed 2,002 pushups, ran 48.88 miles, and biked 28.99 miles (this includes the race day numbers). The heat throughout the month was often unbearable, but I pushed through all the same knowing July 26 (race day) was coming up quick. During this period I also really began to dial in my diet, eating little more than fruit, eggs (lots of eggs), chicken, rice, and salad (lots of salad). It was during this period and August that my body began to change. I became noticeably larger and more muscular, and incredibly my abs began to show.</p>
<p>In this photo I'm completing race pushup #500. Don't judge the form, it was almost 90 degrees and the exhaustion was real from having already completed the run and bike segments. That said if you squint in the right light you can see I actually have muscles due to all the pushups and running!</p>
<p><img alt="Pushup 500 at my birthday race" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo.653130c8.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo.653130c8.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo.653130c8.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Due to all of the July training and the 5/15/500 Challenge, my YTD pushup output soared to 7,754.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was around this time that I went down a major rabbit hole regarding microplastics. A successful techie named Nat Friedman funded a study that looked into the prevalency of microplastics in food, vitamins, and other products, and published the results <a href="https://www.plasticlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'm not going to call out any products by name here (although I should because they are poisoning us), but take a moment to open this site in a new tab and search for <em>protein</em> for a glimpse into how you are being poisoned every time you take a bite of so-called health food. After spending a few weeks researching this topic I radically changed my diet and eliminated all of this nonsense. If you <em>really</em> want to go down a rabbit hole, look into the relationship between chocolate-infused health products and heavy metals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>August, 2025 - Bought a Running Watch</h2>
<p>In August I did exactly 1,000 pushups, and threw in 190 body weight squats just for fun. 525 of these pushups were completed in a single day (August 16) thanks to my neighbor, friend, and fellow 5/15/500 contestant Charlie having the bright idea that we should knock out what was originally supposed to be 400 pushups during our sons' soccer game. Of course, our competitive spirit got the best of us and I quit at 525 while Charlie pushed on to 600. I'll get him the next time!</p>
<p>The running sessions continued throughout August, with 37.48 miles completed. I started taking running much more seriously at this point because I signed up for the October 19 Columbus 1/2 Marathon. I've run 1/2 marathons before (poorly - my last finish time was 3:05) so I know what I'm getting into here, but this time around I want to actually finish at what I deem to be a respectable time which is around 2:20 (10:40/mile pace). Of course, in order to train for this I needed to know what pace I'm running in the first place, and so I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092RCLKHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garmin Forerunner 55</a> watch with GPS.</p>
<p>As mentioned before my proclivity for going down research rabbit holes hasn't really helped my previous attempts to get into shape so I chose this watch because compared to other watches it is relatively spartan in terms of features. Above all else I wanted a watch that can accurately track my running distance, pace, and route and so far I am so, so happy with this purchase. It is perfect, and the battery life is amazing.</p>
<p>On August 2 I received the watch and later that day took my son and his friend up to a local (Alum Creek) mountain bike park and while they were riding I decided to run the trails. I wound up running 4.69 miles on very hilly and bumpy trails, and paid for it dearly over the next week due to terrible foot and knee pain.</p>
<p>On August 21 I ran my first training 10K, completing it in 1:12:28. According to my fancy watch I completed the first 5K in 39:11 but then sped up and completed the second 5K in 33:11.</p>
<p>On August 25 I repeated the route, this time completing the 10K in 1:05:41. On August 28 I did it a third time, completing it in 1:02:47. Progress!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I brought some help to the the August 25 and 28 10K training runs: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DP6ZWWC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GU packs</a>. In July I read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swim-Bike-Bonk-Confessions-Triathlete/dp/1493059378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swim, Bike, Bonk: Confessions of a Reluctant Triathlete</a>, by Will McGough. In this hilarious recounting of training and competing in an Ironman triathlon, the author mentions using these mysterious "gel" pack, of which the most popular is known as a "GU pack". I subsequently picked up a few at the local Walmart and can confirm they unquestionably gave me a boost on these long runs. Now anytime I plan on running a 10K or longer I put one in my running pouch and open it 5K into the route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With another 1,000 pushups in the book my YTD output sat at 8,754 on August 31.</p>
<p>Much better endurance aside, the most obvious visible outcome of the last few months is my clothes no longer fit. My polo shirts are so baggy they look like tents, and my t-shirts are too small because I'm so much more... muscular? What in the hell is going on? This seems to be working!</p>
<h2>September, 2025 - I am a Beast</h2>
<p>With 8,754 pushups complete, I only had 1,246 to go and concluded I'd meet the milestone in September. With the 1/2 marathon around the corner my running workouts picked up and I set multiple PRs, including a 29:51 5K PR on September 8, followed by another 28:10 5K PR on September 11.</p>
<p>On September 17 I got one of the biggest motivational boosts possible. I was in Chicago for a quarterly meeting, and one of the fellow board members who I've seen in person once every 3 months (but not 3 months ago because we were on the France trip) walked up to me and introduced himself. I stared back at him completely puzzled, and watched him walk away to greet the person next to me. He suddenly wheeled around with a look of shock on his face and said something to the effect of "Holy shit! I didn't even recognize you! You look amazing!".</p>
<p>On September 21 I completed the 10,000th pushup in unceremonious fashion on my living room floor:</p>
<p><img alt="Pushup number 10,000 in the books" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>On September 24 I gobbled up a GU pack and headed outside feeling like I could tear a phone book in half. My goal was to shatter the previous 28:10 5K record, and I was on track to do exactly that, running the first 2.1 kilometers in 18 minutes flat. Then out of nowhere I felt this terrible pain in my left calf and came to an immediate stop. It wasn't until September 29 that I could comfortably run again, and even then I only ran 1 mile because I'm terrified of a nagging injury setting me back for the October 19 1/2 marathon.</p>
<p>In September I added 1,501 pushups to the pile, bringing the YTD total to 10,245.</p>
<h2>October and Beyond</h2>
<p>Today is October 1, 2025 and the pushups continue. The aforementioned 1/2 marathon is on October 19, and my neighbor Charlie and I have already agreed to walk/run a full marathon (around our neighborhood) on November 29. Although it's almost 80 degrees today, in past years we've seen snow by the end of the month so I'm thinking about getting one of those fancy stationary bikes or maybe even a treadmill so I can keep this party going over the winter.</p>
<h2>My Diet</h2>
<p>In recent months I have started to look so different that friends have asked me for some diet details. As mentioned, I no longer eat fast food, nor overconsume alcohol. But I've also almost completely cut out processed foods, eating them only very sparingly. A few months ago I did manage to go down the microplastics and heavy metals rabbit hole, and now spend some time researching anything that I plan on eating on a regular basis. Believe me, a lot of the food you think is healthy is pure garbage.</p>
<p>Every morning I eat one of two things: either a gigantic fruit smoothie or four scrambled eggs and a salad. I do not deviate from this, only very occasionally eating some protein-powder pancakes made by my wife. My smoothie consists of milk, greek yogurt, 1.5 scoops of Optimum Nutrition protein powder, a huge scoop (probably two cups) of frozen organic berries, and an entire banana:</p>
<p><img alt="My morning smoothie" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Here is the typical scrambled eggs and salad breakfast:</p>
<p><img alt="Eggs and salad" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>For lunch I eat some combination of chicken, rice, tuna, and salad. I almost never deviate from this. For dinner I eat whatever my wife decides to make, which is always healthy. Obviously we occasionally go out and I'll eat some garbage like wings or pizza, but this is pretty rare compared to the past. I also take a few vitamins and creatine daily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in this post I mentioned researching the prevalency of microplastics, heavy metals, and other poison in food. This is particularly problematic in ironically protein powder, protein bars, protein shakes, etc. I settled on Optimum Nutrition because it is one of the few powders on the market that has been tested by numerous third-parties, including <a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/protein-powder-v2-category-tested-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Clean Label Project</a>. It's pretty expensive compared to other products, but I'm happy to pay in order to avoid ingesting this garbage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Analytics</h2>
<p>Despite getting myself into incredibly good shape relative to the past, this wasn't really that hard. On 105 of 274 days (38.3%) I did no pushups at all. On 142 of 274 (51.8%) days I did between 1 and 100 pushups. On just 26 of 274 (9.4%) days did I do more than 100 pushups, and on only 8 of 274 (2.9%) days did I do 200 or greater. Interestingly, although I have no hard data to back this up I feel like my strength soared in the 67 days following the 5/15/500 race (July 26). Following that date I did more than 100 pushups on 11 days (16.4% of the days), and became noticeably more muscular. Here's a chart showing the pushup volume throughout the year:</p>
<p><img alt="Pushups chart" loading="lazy" width="882" height="547" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchart.44322d85.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchart.44322d85.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchart.44322d85.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Headed into October, I feel like a million dollars and plan on continuing these off-the-wall exercise quests for the rest of my (hopefully long) life. I obviously have no idea what I'm doing, but am happy to answer any questions and help motivate you to get in the best shape of your life.

And it’s not a good one. </p><p><span>It’s full of silent letters, as in </span><em><span>num</span><strong>b</strong></em><span>, </span><em><strong>k</strong><span>nee</span></em><span>, and </span><em><strong>h</strong><span>onour</span></em><span>.

Where’s the fun unless you have to sweat a little as you struggle to recall whether this particular word is one where “‘i’ before ‘e’ except after ‘c’” doesn’t apply?</p><p>In short, English has a complicated writing system.</p><p><span>I’ve written about the origin of some of this complexity before, blaming everyone from </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/why-english-doesnt-use-accents" rel="">the French</a><span> to </span><a href="https://colingorrie.substack.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">stingy printers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-invention-that-ruined-english" rel="">late medieval yuppies</a><span>. But I’ve not yet plumbed the depths of this complexity. To do so, I will need to tell you the story of </span><strong>yogh</strong><span>,</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-1-172153870" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> an obscure medieval letter whose rise and fall allows us to peer into this abyss.</span></p><p>But like an Icelandic family saga, we begin not with the story of yogh, but with the story of its parent. So allow me to introduce you to the letter ‘g,’ which, as you’ll soon see, is a complicated letter in its own right, dating back to Old English.</p><p>It starts with the shape of the letter. When modern editors print Old English today, they print nice, modern-looking ‘g’s — that is, the ones we use today, with an open or closed loop on the bottom, depending on the typeface.</p><p><span>This modern form of ‘g’ is called the </span><strong>Carolingian</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> It had its origin in the Carolingian minuscule, the script used by the scribes of the Carolingian Renaissance, the great revival of learning which flourished in the vast realm of Charlemagne (reigned 768–814).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-2-172153870" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>But Old English scribes didn’t write their </span><em>g</em><span>-sounds with a Carolingian ‘g.’ The Old English letter ‘g’ was written in a form called the </span><strong>insular</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> Here’s what it looked like: ‘ᵹ.’ It’s like a mix between a ‘z’ and a ‘3.’</span></p><p><span>Let’s see it in action. When the first lines of </span><em>Beowulf</em><span> are written in a modern edition, they look like this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Hwæt, we Gardena in geardagum</span><br><span>þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon,</span></em></p><p>‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’ </p><p><span>(</span><em>Beowulf </em><span>1–2)</span></p></blockquote><p>But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>HǷÆT ǷE GARDE</span><br><span>na in</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear da</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>um þeod cynin</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>a</span><br><span>þrym </span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>efrunon</span></em></p><p><em>London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’</p><p><span>Interestingly, the Anglo-Saxons </span><em>did</em><span> use the Carolingian ‘g’ — just not for Old English. They used it when writing Latin, at least after the late 10th century. This was when the Church in England underwent a set of reforms, which caused a flowering of literature both in Latin and Old English.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-3-172153870" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> As part of these reforms, the Carolingian minuscule script was adopted for Latin texts.</span></p><p>So for a period, both ‘g’ and ‘ᵹ’ were used in England, but generally speaking, each was used for writing the ‘g’ sound in a different language. Simple enough, but the stage was set for things to get a lot more complicated. </p><p>But for that, we need the help of the Normans.</p><p><em><span>You're reading </span><strong>The Dead Language Society</strong><span>.

This meant the latest, greatest, 11th-century French versions of the Carolingian minuscule. </p><p>These weren’t so different from the way Anglo-Saxon scribes had written Latin. But they were very different from the way they had written Old English, especially in the ‘g’ department.</p><p>But that wasn’t so much of an issue, since these Norman-trained scribes, and those of the generations that came after them, didn’t write much English at all. In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.</p><p>Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.</p><p>And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh. </p><p><span>Yogh is descended from a variant form of the old insular ‘ᵹ.’ But, while the insular ‘ᵹ’ was thought of as the same letter as the Carolingian ‘g’ in Anglo-Saxon times, the yogh ‘ȝ’ of the 12th century was an </span><em>entirely different letter</em><span> from the Carolingian-derived ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>And, stranger still, ‘ȝ’ was used to write two completely different sounds in Middle English, the form of English spoken from around 1100–1450: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound as in </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>oung </span></em><span>or </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>esterday</span></em><span>, and another sound that English has lost altogether.</span></p><p><span>The other sound that ‘ȝ’ once spelled is the “harsh” or “guttural” sound made in the back of the mouth, which you hear in Scots </span><em><span>lo</span><strong>ch</strong></em><strong> </strong><span>or German </span><em><span>Ba</span><strong>ch</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-4-172153870" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> This sound is actually the reason for the most famous bit of English spelling chaos: the sometimes-silent, sometimes-not sequence ‘gh’ that you see in </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><span>cou</span><strong>gh</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><span> ni</span><strong>gh</strong><span>t</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>dau</span><strong>gh</strong><span>ter</span></em><span>.

So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’</p><p><span>Each of these regularly represents two not particularly similar sounds. The letter ‘c’ sometimes represents a </span><em>k</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>at</span></em><span>, and sometimes an </span><em>s</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>ity</span></em><span>. The letter ‘g’ is similar: sometimes it writes a true </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span>, but other times, what it represents is a </span><em>j</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>em</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>If these sounds seem similar to you, pay attention to your tongue as you make each one: the </span><em>k</em><span>-sound and the true </span><em>g-</em><span>sound are made with the back of your tongue hitting against your soft palate. The </span><em>s</em><span>-sound and the ‘j’ sound are made in slightly different places, but in both cases, they use the tip of your tongue coming up against (or close to) just behind your upper teeth.</span></p><p><span>Each of our two double-sounding letters, ‘c’ and ‘g,’ has two variants, which are made at completely different ends of the mouth. This is how yogh worked too: it had one variant made at the back of the mouth (the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound) and the other made towards the front (that’s the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound).</span></p><p><span>There’s actually a good linguistic reason why this pattern keeps happening. It’s a sound change called </span><strong>palatalization</strong><span>: this happens when a sound made towards the back of the mouth, like a </span><em>k</em><span>- or </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, gets pulled forward because it’s next to another sound made at the front of the mouth. Often, these front-of-the-mouth sounds are vowels.</span></p><p><span>In Old English, these front-of-the-mouth vowels (</span><strong>front vowels</strong><span> for short) included the ones spelled ‘i’ and ‘e,’ which sounded like the vowels in </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ee</strong><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ay</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-5-172153870" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Sometime in the deep prehistory of the English language, the ‘g’ sound got pulled forward in the mouth to sound like ‘y’ whenever it was next to these front vowels.</span></p><p><span>But when it came time to spell these ‘y’ sounds in the Latin alphabet, they still seemed to the Anglo-Saxon scribes to be versions of ‘g’ sounds. So they spelled them ‘ᵹ’ just like they spelled other ‘g’ sounds. This is why, when you read Old English, you can often replace ‘ᵹ’ (or ‘g’ in modern editions) with ‘y’ and get recognizable Modern English words: </span><em><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear</span></em><span> is </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ear</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>dæ</span><strong>ᵹ</strong></em><span> is </span><em>day</em><span>, </span><em><span>we</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span> </span></em><span>is </span><em><span>wa</span><strong>y</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-6-172153870" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p>A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound. </p><p><span>This is why the Modern English ‘g’ represents two sounds, one before the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’, and the other before the other letters. It’s because we took our spelling conventions from how the Norman scribes wrote their language, which was an old form of French.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-7-172153870" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p><span>While the Norman scribes, and the later English scribes they trained, were used to the letter ‘g’ writing two different sounds, neither was a </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They needed another letter for that, and they found one: the old insular ‘ᵹ,’ or rather, its descendant, the yogh ‘ȝ.’</span></p><p><span>So that’s why ‘ȝ’ spelled a ‘y’ sound. To understand why ‘ȝ’ also spelled that vanished ‘gh’ sound, however, we need to go back into the distant history of English, long before it was ever written down. Actually, long before there even </span><em>was</em><span> an English. </span></p><p>Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.</p><p><span>In this Proto-Germanic language (as it’s called today), the sound that would become the English </span><em>g</em><span>-sound — which the Anglo-Saxons would later spell ‘ᵹ’ — was not the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we have today in words like </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>ba</span><strong>g</strong></em><span>. That came later.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the Proto-Germanic ancestor of words like </span><em>good</em><span> had a sound very similar to the later Middle English </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound at the start.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-8-172153870" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span> Only later would English harden that </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound into the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we know today. But this only happened in certain places in the word, especially at the start. At the end of the word, the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound remained. In Old English, both versions were spelled the same: ‘ᵹ.’</span></p><p><span>This means that ‘ᵹ’ actually had </span><strong>three</strong><span> pronunciations in Old English, not two: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound (next to front vowels), the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound (at the start of words), and the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound (in the middle of words). So when those Norman-trained scribes turned their attention to writing English in the 12th century, they had no problem writing the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound at the start of words with ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>But when they wanted to write the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, they ran into the same problem they had in writing the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They didn’t have a good way to write the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, which didn’t exist in French at the time, so they pressed yogh into service again.</span></p><p>And that’s why yogh has two sounds, each of which corresponds to a pronunciation of the Old English letter ‘ᵹ’ that the French scribal tradition couldn’t accept writing with ‘g.’</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1813179,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/i/172153870?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r9Fp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8246541-61f0-4f36-a4f1-49640b9762d5_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>View of the City of Edinburgh</em><span> (ca. 1822), Alexander Nasmyth</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>When you’re reading Middle English, it can get a bit confusing: Which kind of yogh is which?</p><p><span>Look at this line from </span><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Þa</span><strong>ȝ</strong><span> </span><strong>ȝ</strong><span>e </span><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself be talenttyf, to take hit to yourseluen,</span></em><br><span>‘Though you yourself are eager to accept it [a challenge] personally,’ (</span><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em><span> 350)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In this line, the first yogh makes the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound, while the second and third represent </span><em>y</em><span>-sounds. But you just have to know the words in order to figure that out.</span></p><p><span>As inconvenient as this confusion is for us </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-case-for-middle-english" rel="">modern readers of Middle English</a><span>, that isn’t the reason yogh disappeared from the English language. The fate of yogh was sealed by a conspiracy of factors.</span></p><p><span>One is that yogh was never the only alternative for writing the sounds it wrote. The </span><em>y</em><span>-sound could also be written in the way the French wrote it, that is, ‘i’ or ‘y.’ The latter is the spelling that English ended up using for this sound, hence </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ourself </span></em><span>instead of </span><em><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself</span></em><span>. The </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound could also be written ‘h,’ ‘ȝh,’ or ‘gh.’ The last of these, of course, is what English ended up adopting.</span></p><p><span>But the death blow dealt to yogh was the printing press. The earliest printing press in England was a Flemish import, as were the typefaces. But the yogh letter was unique to English, and like the </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">other letters unique to English</a><span>, it would be expensive to print. And, as we just saw, there were ready alternatives, so yogh disappeared without a trace… from English.</span></p><p><span>In Scotland, on the other hand, it stuck around for longer. Scots used the combination ‘lȝ’ to represent an ‘ly’ sequence like we have in </span><em><span>mi</span><strong>lli</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> and ‘nȝ’ to represent either the ‘ny’ sequence like in </span><em><span>ca</span><strong>ny</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> or an ‘ng’ sound like in </span><em><span>si</span><strong>ng</strong><span>er</span></em><span>. </span></p><p>And Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.</p><p><span>You still see the results of this substitution, ‘lz’ and ‘nz,’ in certain Scottish names. But the ‘z’ has led them to be pronounced in ways that have nothing to do with their traditional forms. So </span><em>Menzies</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenzie</em><span> were meant to spell things that sounded more like </span><em>Mingus</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenyie</em><span>.</span></p><p>And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated. </p><p>But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.</p><p>I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Chinese scientists have genetically engineered stem cells capable of rejuvenating the health, including the cognition, of aged macaque</p><div>
<p>Key Points:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“Super stem cells” improve the memory of monkeys while protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The super stem cells prevent age-related bone loss while rejuvenating over 50% of the 61 tissues analyzed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Treatment with stem cells reduces inflammation and senescent cells (cells that accumulate to promote aging).</li>
</ul>



<p>While small in number, our adult stem cells play a crucial role in regenerating our lost or damaged tissues, rebuilding our body cell by cell. However, with age, our bodies become riddled with inflammation, hardly providing an environment capable of keeping our stem cells healthy. Eventually, our stem cells lose their regenerative capacity, contributing to degenerative aging.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Fox, O, Three&nbsp;</h2>



<p><em>Hydra</em> are a genus of immortal beings that live forever in freshwater environments like lakes and ponds. What scientists have called “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01143.x">nothing but an active stem cell community</a>,” <em>Hydra</em> can escape death by infinitely regenerating. Their stem cells can continuously proliferate and renew by producing FoxO, a protein they share with humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In humans, the FoxO protein, specifically the FoxO3 isoform, responds to cellular stress by binding to DNA and turning genes on and off. These genes are involved in numerous cellular processes that promote healthy aging and extended lifespan. This is why the FoxO3 protein’s corresponding gene, <em>FOXO3</em>, is considered a longevity gene.</p>





<h2>Experimenting with SRCs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As FoxO3 assists cells in resisting stressful environments, such as inflamed tissue, Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers engineered human stem cells to have enhanced FoxO3 activity. As published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9"><em>Cell</em></a>, these senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs) were designed to exhibit greater resistance to age-related stress. To test this, cynomolgus monkeys, also known as crab-eating macaques, were first stratified into four groups based on age:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A1: 3-5 years (approximately equivalent to 9-15 human years)&nbsp;</li>

<p>The oldest of the monkeys, the A4 group, were the focus of the study and were subdivided into three groups. One group was injected with saline (salt and water), another group with normal stem cells, and the third with SRCs. The aged monkeys were injected every two weeks for 44 weeks, approximately equivalent to the duration of three human years. On safety, there were no serious adverse events, such as immune system rejection or tumor growth.&nbsp;</p>

The WTCs are human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harboring two copies of normal/wild-type <em>FOXO3 </em>(<em>FOXO3</em><sup>+/+</sup>), while the SRCs are edited. The genetically edited <em>FOXO3</em> gene (<em>FOXO3</em><sup>2SA/2SA</sup>) produces a modified FoxO3 protein that stays in the nucleus of cells to increase the transcriptional activity of protective genes. &nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>SRCs Improve Cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After 44 weeks of biweekly injections, a suite of biological indices was measured from the aged monkeys to assess whether SRCs slow down biological aging. One of these indices was memory retention. To assess memory, the researchers conducted a common experiment called the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this experiment, each monkey was trained to retrieve food located <em>outside</em> of one of two identical boxes. During the test session, after each monkey was trained, food was placed next to one of the boxes to keep it hidden. Subsequently, a flap was placed in front of the monkey to block the boxes from view. Three seconds later, when the flap was reopened, each monkey had to remember which of the two boxes contained the food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remarkably, the monkeys injected with SRCs remembered the location of the food with higher accuracy than the monkeys injected with saline. Moreover, the monkeys injected with normal stem cells exhibited the same level of accuracy as the monkeys injected with saline. These findings suggest that SRCs, and not normal stem cells, improve the memory of aged monkeys.&nbsp;</p>

The difference in accuracy between the saline-injected (black) and normal/wild-type stem cell-injected (blue) monkeys was not significant (ns).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, MRI-based structural analysis showed that treatment with SRCs mitigated age-related brain shrinkage. MRI-based experiments also revealed that brain connectivity was restored to that of young (A1 group) monkeys. Namely, the structural connectivity between seven brain regions, including those important for working memory (prefrontal cortex), was rejuvenated with SRC treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that SRC injections improve memory by protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Rejuvenate Many Organs and Tissues</h2>



<p>In addition to the brain, the Academy researchers found that SRC treatment rejuvenated multiple organs and tissues. This is important because the rejuvenation of a given organ or tissue could lead to the reduced risk of its corresponding age-related chronic diseases. For example, the rejuvenating effects of SRCs on the brain could reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One common age-related disease is osteoporosis, characterized by brittle and weak bones that make patients more prone to fractures and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10338097/">deadly falls</a>. Using an X-ray imaging technique called micro-CT, the researchers found evidence for the reversal of age-related bone loss. Namely, while the aged monkeys treated with saline exhibited dental bone loss, the aged monkeys treated with SRCs had teeth more similar to those of young monkeys.&nbsp;</p>


<div>

However, aged monkeys treated with wild-type stem cells (A4-WTC) show less bone loss, while aged monkeys treated with SRCs (A4-SRC) show even less bone loss.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To conduct a body-wide assessment, the researchers measured the up- and down-regulation of genes from 10 systems and 61 tissues. Elevations and reductions in gene activation reflect the function (or dysfunction) of cells, tissues, and organ systems. With that said, SRC treatment was shown to rejuvenate over 50% of the tissues examined, with maximal rejuvenation achieved in areas like the hippocampus (the memory consolidation center of the brain), fallopian tubes, and colon. In contrast, the regular stem cells rejuvenated about 30% of the tissues examined.</p>

Treatment with wild-type stem cells (WTC) rescued 31.15% of genes, while SRCs rescued 54.10% of genes altered by aging.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Confirming some of the rejuvenating effects inferred by the gene experiments, the researchers also observed structural changes to various organs and tissues from aged monkeys treated with SRCs. For example, the vascularity of the lung and heart was improved while the thickening of the aorta was reduced. Neurons had longer projections and fewer proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., beta-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau), and the kidney and brain showed less mineralization [abnormal mineral (usually calcium) deposits].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Reduce Cellular Senescence and Inflammation</h2>



<p>Modern scientists have begun to unravel the underlying causes of aging by identifying commonalities between age-related diseases at the cellular level. Two of the most prominent purported underlying causes of aging are chronic inflammation and <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/what-are-senescent-cells-and-how-do-they-drive-aging">senescent cells</a>. With age, senescent cells accumulate throughout the body, promoting inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminating senescent cells, which can be achieved through genetic manipulation or compounds called senolytics, ameliorates age-related diseases and even extends the lifespan of model organisms. Now, the Academy researchers demonstrate that SRCs reduce senescent cells, measured using a blue dye called SA-β-Gal, in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs. Along those lines, SRC treatment also reduced markers of inflammation and other underlying causes of aging, like DNA damage.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="626" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1024x626.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-300x183.jpg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-768x470.jpg 768w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1536x939.jpg 1536w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-2048x1253.jpg 2048w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senescence-1-1568x959.jpg 1568w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9">Lei et al., 2025</a>) <strong>SRCs Eliminate Senescent Cells.</strong> Senescent cells are indicated by SA-β-Gal dye (light blue) and arrows. In the lung and brain, the number of senescent cells in aged monkeys treated with SRCs (green) was similar to that of young monkeys (pink). Moreover, compared to saline-treated aged monkeys (black), wild-type stem cell-treated aged monkeys (blue) exhibited less senescence in the lungs but not the brain, suggesting normal stem cells affect the lung but not the brain.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Stem Cells Make Sense&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When it comes to combating degenerative aging, it makes sense that regenerative stem cells are a promising solution. In fact, one of the <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/hallmarks-of-aging-reversed-therapy">underlying causes of aging</a> is stem cell exhaustion, whereby stem cells lose their regenerative capacity. While normal stem cells have anti-aging effects, as shown by the Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers, they are not protected against stressors like age-related inflammation. This explains why SRCs provide enhanced regenerative capacity (they withstand the harsh microenvironments induced by aging and cellular senescence).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no serious safety concerns were raised during the study, it would seem that SRCs are well tolerated. However, the long-term effects of the SRC treatment will need further evaluation. The primary concern with injecting stem cells into the bloodstream is that they can trigger the spread of cancer almost anywhere in the body. Nevertheless, the SRCs possess tumor suppression properties, suggesting they may not induce tumor growth. If this ends up being true, we may soon see SRCs being tested in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><span>TL;DR:</span><span> We tried OKRs, they created more ceremony than clarity. Our solution: Problem Driven Development, a 4-day quarterly process focused on identifying problems (not solutions), prioritizing as a team, and committing publicly. It's kept us shipping at velocity even as we've scaled to 1.7M+ users.</span></p><p><span>For most of my friends and colleagues at mature software companies, there are usually three ways for an item of work to get put on the board to eventually be done.</span></p><ol><li><span>There is a giant ceremony that determines what gets done by a grab bag of metrics.</span></li><li><span>A deal gets blocked by a missing feature, and the engineering team scrambles jets to eliminate the blocker.</span></li><li><span>Founder feels like we have to build something.</span></li></ol><p><span>Thats not to say that every company is a disorganized mess or a bureaucratic hell scape but, I have never met any engineer who said: “Wow, I just love my company planning process.” </span></p><p><span>These words are seldom spoken in the english language. </span></p><p><span>Railway, was fast approaching 1. and 2. at the same time. </span></p><p><span>Despite us using excellent tools (shoutout Linear) planning is much as a cultural phenomena as well as an interesting engineering problem. From our perspective, we would finalize the features and the requirements what we would want to build once every 3 months and then at times get blindsided every now and then from a new business priority or an incident. Especially now serving 1.7M+ customers, we have to aggregate our taste, feedback, and opportunities and make a roadmap that will get us everything we ever wanted.</span></p><p><span>This was an issue.</span></p><p><span>Why write about something that you would read in Rand’s? It’s Q4 for those who celebrate, and we felt that reigniting the agile vs. waterfall armistice needed to be torn up. (Besides, we’re blogging like it’s 2005.)</span></p><p><span>…and we have spent the better part of 18 months to improve our planning so that we finally get to a process that is not bad, and if you’d like, you can steal it, so that you can deliver excellent products.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#why-is-most-planning-bad,-you-say"><h2><span>Why is most planning bad, you say?</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Mike Tyson asked about his fight plan against Evander Holyfield responded with; “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</span></p><p><span>And that quote ever since would be used out of context to fight the implementation of Objectives, Key Results across the world. At Railway, we aren’t Anti-Planning, we are Anti-Bad-Planning and as such, we used to avoid a lot of it because we always felt that a bad process is massively negative to the status quo. However, we did get to the point where we needed to finally harness the collective attention spans of the company and work towards a goal.</span></p><p><span>Railway at the time was (and is) a vision led company. We fundamentally believe that most infrastructure boilerplate shouldn’t exist so that you can work on what matters. Back in ‘21, we went from a world where we could do our work in weeks, to work that required us to think in months. I implemented a somewhat lighter form of SAFE which splits work between “sprints”, which were short pieces of work, then initiatives which helped grouped “epics” which are long running work-streams to deliver a feature. </span></p><p><span>Despite us having a strong founder, we still wanted the ability to have employees bring projects that they would be excited to work on. </span></p><p><span>As with most young companies, we found quickly that new work would come in and unseat the old work and we would begin anew. </span></p><p><span>So then we turned to OKRs.</span></p><p><span>We thought that having some long term objectives will help us focus the company.</span></p><p><span>We implemented them faithfully, we all read the John Doer book. …and it worked… somewhat. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#okrs-and-software;-water-and-vinegar"><h2><span>OKRs and software; water and vinegar</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We can make this a whole blog post on OKRs. But, trying to hold back here from just ranting and to give you the relevant information. </span></p><p><span>OKRs work REALLY well when you have concrete goals and really simple ways to measure them. Its why they belong at their primary birthplace, the factory. Objectives work when you have something binary or “limited”, like a product existing… or not. Or a product meeting a benchmark… or not. It’s easy to rally a team around them and conquer the world. </span></p><p><span>Where OKRs start to falter, are when you need to use them to prioritize work to meet a “unlimited” objective. Like: “Increase conversion rate of landing page”</span></p><p><span>OKRheads will notice that’s a particularly weak objective, however, teaching an entire organization to all of a sudden be great goal setters, which is what OKRs require you to do made it difficult for engineers to 1) bring them and then 2) plan work around them. Which leads to the first big issue of OKRs- which is that it really depends on the human psychology of the team. Engineers straddle the line between concrete numbers such as uptime, and more creative endeavors such as figuring out how to get a feature implemented right. Whenever the work enters the creative realm, the wheels come off.</span></p><p><span>Which is why outside of the factory, OKRs are great for Sales. You set a number, you get alignment on hitting that number, and then you pick up the phone, email, or LinkedIn until you hit it. The psychology of an account executive matches the planning process.</span></p><p><span>Where OKRs work great, is for alignment. If you are able to set great goals and if you wanted to prescribe a bunch of work toward said goal. …and most startups reach for the High Output Management book (which I love) because there is the lack of alignment between different orgs at a startup. Which is to say, I don’t shame any company reaching for them, the same way newborns have the palmar grasp reflex. We yearn for the alignment.</span></p><p><span>The second big issue for OKRs is that they are, by design, inflexible, once you commit to them. If you spend a week or two planning for them for the year or quarter, and you are midway through realizing that the “KR” part is incorrect, thats a one way door. </span></p><p><span>So we felt pressure into making sure that the OKRs were indeed correct. Which is where you enter the issues of the performative aspects of planning. It felt “mature” for Railway to be having these discussions, even though… it wasn’t productive.</span></p><p><span>At Railway, we would spend a significant amount of time discussing what is a valid OKR, only for us to realize we were two days into the planning process and we’ve yet to decide what we should build for the OKR. </span></p><p><span>This is when Christian, our Head of Operations had an answer for us.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#good-ole-projects"><h2><span>Good Ole Projects</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Instead of crowd sourcing the OKRs from the company and bubbling them up per function Jake and Christian would work on some top level guidance that would provide a macro view of our finances, priorities, and strategy that we have to keep in mind. </span></p><p><span>We then have a Hex dashboard with topline metrics from different sides of the product and business. From a GTM perspective, it’s engagement, signups, and revenue. From an Engineering perspective, it’s support tickets, uptime, and feature performance. </span></p><p><span>This data would give us a “theme”. (You may have seen them in our launch weeks.)</span></p><p><span>Whenever someone goes on Central Station and requests a feature, depending on how large the work is, that usually determines if that request becomes a “Project”. </span></p><p><span>Then around the start of 2024, Christian spun up a Notion DB, and punched in a simple template for each new entry.</span></p><div><p><img alt=""

Product Engineering which delivers features and value to our customers via the UI and terminal. Platform which supports the product with the Infrastructure and the APIs to control that Infrastructure. Then Logistics, which is a synthetic team which includes the Support, Marketing, and Sales function working to be the voice of the customer. </span></p><p><span>We would then fill out a “Project Candidate” and then go to bat on trying to figure out if was a priority that tied to the “theme” that was presented. </span></p><p><span>If something is a P0: it’s an existential company risk, we MUST deliver it.</span></p><p><span>Then, a P1: something we need to deliver for this quarter</span></p><p><span>Lastly, P2: a nice to have.</span></p><p><span>This worked well until some cracks formed.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#99-problems"><h2><span>99 Problems</span></h2></a></p><p><span>At the start of this new process, our team was small enough to list maybe 50 project candidates, discuss as a group and then be on with it but with 200. Spending all day on a call with your co-workers to discuss if something was worth it isn’t the best use of time. </span></p><p><span>Second, Project Candidates would sometimes have full on fleshed out RFC style sections where the author would have a solution ready to go. When a candidate got deprioritized, it’s understandable why someone would feel not great about their hard effort not being reciprocated. </span></p><p><span>Third, to deal with the larger amount of project candidates and additional sources of project candidates, we would set up additional meetings before the planning week that would eat into our engineering cycles. Not that we want to squeeze every engineer for what they are worth, but these negotiation calls would take longer than the main call sometimes. Worse even, was that we would completely reset the board quarter after quarter. </span></p><p><span>Lastly, which was starting to be a bigger issue, was that having Project Candidates being a bottom up process was great when the people who knew that work they needed to do can fit the whole work-stream in their head. But… we were about to embark on a multi-quarter effort that would span all parts of the business to deliver Railway Metal. This system was not great for uncovering planning gaps that required attention from a different team.</span></p><p><span>(With that said, we did ship some really good software thanks to this planning process.)</span></p><p><span>However, Jake, the team, aren’t ones to sit on their laurels so we refined it until we have our current process. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#%E2%80%A6and-a-process-ain%E2%80%99t-one."><h2><span>…and a process ain’t one.</span></h2></a></p><p><span>So we flipped the project system on it’s head. </span></p><p><span>Instead, we practice what I call: “Problem Driven Development”</span></p><p><span>Rather than spending a loaded amount of time picking feedback items from our feedback systems, and spending a loaded amount of time on trying to flesh out requirements. We collect problems on a continuous process that begins in earnest on the Friday before our planning week.</span></p><p><span>We stopped asking people to propose solutions and started asking them to articulate problems. </span><span>No more half-baked RFCs that people felt attached to. No more solution-first thinking that locked us into approaches before we understood what we were solving. Just clear problem statements.</span></p><p><span>Here's what a problem looks like in our system:</span></p><p><span>Problem Title:</span><span> "Users can't debug failed deployments without SSHing into containers"</span></p><p><span>Notice what's missing? Any mention of </span><span>how</span><span> we'd solve it. That comes later, after we've committed to solving the problem. Then we turned the two week ceremony into a lightning 4 day sprint.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#the-four-day-process"><h2><span>The Four-Day Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>After the problems are listed and filled out fully, each team on </span><span>Day 1</span><span> enters problems on their own. If a problem isn't fleshed out, it's put in the Parking Lot and we kindly nudge the idea person to fill the template.</span></p><p><span>By the time we get into a room together, everyone's had time to process what's on the board.</span></p><p><span>Then on </span><span>Day 2,</span><span> the planning captain will have a closed session with the team (with spectators from other teams) to put a best guess priority from P0, P1, and P2. If we find that a problem is contentious or requires an external dependency, we mark it so the day after, we can discuss it.</span></p><p><span>By having each team prioritize independently first, we avoid the tragedy of the commons where everything becomes P0 because someone shouted loudest on the call. Platform can look at their problems and say "yes, API reliability is more important than API versioning right now" without having to negotiate with Product in real-time.</span></p><p><span>(We have spent countless hours talking about difficult questions on a call when we have been able to diffuse rough conversations ahead of time.)</span></p><p><span>On </span><span>Day 3</span><span>, we get to a 95 percent certainty on the priorities listed and tie break the dependencies. We also confirm that we have the capacity and staffing to deal with the problems listed on the board. If not, we add a problem for hiring for a specific role.</span></p><p><span>This is where cross-team dependencies surface naturally. When Platform marks "Multi-mount volumes" as P1 and Product marks "HA DBs" as P1, we can see that one blocks the other. We're not discovering this mid-quarter when someone's already three weeks into building the wrong thing.</span></p><p><span>The capacity check is crucial too. We look at people's current commitments, oncall rotations, and whether anyone's about to take parental leave. If we have eight P1 problems and capacity for five, we have an honest conversation about what drops to P2 or what we need to hire for.</span></p><p><span>Then lastly, </span><span>Day 4</span><span>, commitment. Everyone looks at the whole list, mention final objections if we should be working on something that we aren't— or vice versa. After we confirm priorities, we assign problems to people by giving them a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual).</span></p><p><span>Then, we look into each other's eyes, as much as anyone can on a video call, and commit.</span></p><p><span>After the starting gun is off, we then write RFCs on problems to see how we can best solve them which eventually become Linear tickets.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#steal-this-process"><h2><span>Steal This Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We're working on open-sourcing our Notion templates because honestly, this isn't rocket science. It's just:</span></p><ol><li><span>Cataloguing your problems, not solutions</span></li><li><span>Let teams prioritize independently before negotiating</span></li><li><span>Front-load the hard conversations</span></li><li><span>Commit publicly</span></li><li><span>Then, </span><span>and only then</span><span>, figure out how to solve it</span></li></ol><p><span>But the real hard part was building a culture where people feel safe bringing up problems without having to defend their pet solutions.</span></p><p><span>Keep process to a minimum, focus on performance of shipping, not performative work.</span></p><p><span>And like any good product, our planning process will keep evolving. Maybe in six months we'll realize Problem Driven Development has its own cracks. </span><span>Theres always plenty to do on planning and I think we generally know how it’ll need to evolve, but we try to take small steps from cycle to cycle.  </span><span> If that happens, we'll write another blog post about what we learned and what we changed.</span></p><p><span>Until then, we're shipping.</span></p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>On Wednesday, the</span> first day of the US government shutdown, employees at the Department of Education (DOE) set their automatic out-of-office email responses to inform recipients that they would be unable to respond until after the shutdown. Hours later, many DOE employees realized their response message had been altered to contain partisan language without their consent. The automatic reply now blamed Senate Democrats for the entire shutdown.</p><p>It’s not clear who made the change to email accounts, which was first <a data-offer-url="https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3m27ovc4xm22j" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3m27ovc4xm22j&quot;}" href="https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3m27ovc4xm22j" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">posted about</a> on Bluesky by journalist Marisa Kabas. “It’s disturbing,” says a DOE employee who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Some employees changed their responses back to the more neutral language, only to have it changed yet again to the partisan response, multiple sources tell WIRED.</p><p>As government employees began to log off in preparation for a shutdown, many agencies sent out guidance, including suggested language for their out-of-office message. While some agencies offered employees neutral language, simply explaining they would not be able to reply until the shutdown concluded, employees at <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-employees-out-of-office-email-replies/">the Small Business Administration</a> and, according to sources and screenshots reviewed by WIRED, the Department of Labor, received suggested language that blamed Democrats for the shutdown.</p><p>At the DOE, human resources sent employees standard language ahead of the shutdown, and many employees used this as their OOO text. Originally, the suggested language given to DOE employees read, “Thank you for your email. There is a temporary shutdown of the US government due to a lapse in appropriations. I will respond to your message as soon as possible after the temporary shutdown ends. Please visit Ed.gov for the latest information on the Department’s operational status.” Many employees set this neutral language as their OOO status.</p><p>The new, changed message reads:</p><p>“Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed HR 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of HR 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“The Department unilaterally, and without staff knowledge or consent, went in and changed the messages to include partisan language,” claims another DOE employee, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>This is particularly problematic, because experts have alleged that the partisan language could be a violation of the <a data-offer-url="https://www.osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx&quot;}" href="https://www.osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hatch Act</a>, which sets limits to the kinds of political activity government employees can engage in. Violating the Hatch Act, which is not subject to a statute of limitations, <a data-offer-url="https://www.osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct-Federal.aspx#tabGroup51" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct-Federal.aspx#tabGroup51&quot;}" href="https://www.osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct-Federal.aspx#tabGroup51" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">could cause</a> a federal employee to face fines or lose their job entirely.</p><p>“I've never heard of any US government at the federal level or the state or local level requiring employees to use partisan language in their communication with the public,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. “Beyond the legality, this feels incredibly coercive and invasive. We hire these public servants who are supposed to serve everyone.”</p><p>In response to a request for comment from WIRED, the Department of Education’s press line returned the same OOO message that was forced on employee’s email responses:</p><p>“Thank you for contacting the press team. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations, we are currently in furlough status.

          <p><strong>I’m Ben Johnson, and I work on Litestream at Fly.io. Litestream makes it easy to build SQLite-backed full-stack applications  with resilience to server failure. It’s open source, runs anywhere, and</strong> <a href="https://litestream.io/" title=""><strong>it’s easy to get started</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Litestream is the missing backup/restore system for SQLite. It runs as a sidecar process in the background, alongside unmodified SQLite applications, intercepting WAL checkpoints and streaming them to object storage in real time. Your application doesn’t even know it’s there. But if your server crashes, Litestream lets you quickly restore the database to your new hardware.</p>

<p>The result: you can safely build whole full-stack applications on top of SQLite.</p>

<p>A few months back, we announced <a href="https://fly.io/blog/litestream-revamped/" title="">plans for a major update to Litestream</a>. I’m psyched to announce that the first batch of those changes are now “shipping”. Litestream is  faster and now supports efficient point-in-time recovery (PITR).</p>

<p>I’m going to take a beat to recap Litestream and how we got here, then talk about how these changes work and what you can expect to see with them.</p>
<h2 id="litestream-to-litefs-to-litestream"><a href="#litestream-to-litefs-to-litestream" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Litestream to LiteFS to Litestream</span></h2>
<p>Litestream is one of two big SQLite things I’ve built. The other one, originally intended as a sort of sequel to Litestream, is LiteFS.</p>

<p>Boiled down to a sentence: LiteFS uses a FUSE filesystem to crawl further up into SQLite’s innards, using that access to perform live replication, for unmodified SQLite-backed apps.</p>

<p>The big deal about LiteFS for us is that it lets you do the multiregion primary/read-replica deployment people love Postgres for: reads are fast everywhere, and writes are sane and predictable. We were excited to make this possible for SQLite, too.</p>

<p>But the market has spoken! Users prefer Litestream. And honestly, we get it: Litestream is easier to run and to reason about. So we’ve shifted our focus back to it. First order of business: <a href="https://fly.io/blog/litestream-revamped/" title="">take what we learned building LiteFS and stick as much of it as we can back into Litestream</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ltx-file-format"><a href="#the-ltx-file-format" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>The LTX File Format</span></h2>
<p>Consider this basic SQL table:</p>
<div>
    <pre><code id="code-29k7ufmt"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sandwiches</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>INTEGER</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>AUTOINCREMENT</span><span>,</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>star_rating</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>reviewer_id</span> <span>INTEGER</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre>
  </div>
<p>In our hypothetical, this table backs a wildly popular sandwich-reviewing app that we keep trying to get someone to write. People eat a lot of sandwiches and this table gets a lot of writes. Because it makes my point even better and it’s funny, assume people dither a lot about their sandwich review for the first couple minutes after they leave it. This Quiznos sub… is it ⭐ or ⭐⭐?</p>

<p>Underneath SQLite is a B-tree. Like databases everywhere, SQLite divides storage up into disk-aligned pages, working hard to read as few pages as possible for any task while treating work done within a page as more or less free. SQLite always reads and writes in page-sized chunks.</p>

<p>Our <code>sandwiches</code> table includes a feature that’s really painful for a tool like Litestream that thinks in pages: an automatically updating primary key. That key dictates that every insert into the table hits the rightmost leaf page in the underlying table B-tree. For SQLite itself, that’s no problem. But Litestream has less information to go on: it sees only a feed of whole pages it needs to archive.</p>

<p>Worse still, when it comes time to restore the database – something you tend to want to happen quickly – you have to individually apply those small changes, as whole pages. Your app is down, PagerDuty is freaking out, and you’re sitting there watching Litestream reconstruct your Quiznos uncertainty a page (and an S3 fetch) at a time.</p>

<p>So, LTX. Let me explain. We needed LiteFS to be transaction-aware. It relies on finer-grained information than just raw dirty pages (that’s why it needs the FUSE filesystem). To ship transactions, rather than pages, we invented a <a href="https://github.com/superfly/ltx" title="">file format we call LTX</a>.</p>

<p>LTX was designed as an interchange format for transactions, but for our purposes in Litestream, all we care about is that LTX files represent ordered ranges of pages, and that it supports compaction.</p>

<p>Compaction is straightforward. You’ve stored a bunch of LTX files that collect numbered pages. Now you want to to restore a coherent picture of the database. Just replay them newest to oldest, skipping duplicate pages (newer wins), until all changed pages are accounted for.</p>

<p>Importantly, LTX isn’t limited to whole database backups. We can use LTX compaction to compress a bunch of LTX files into a single file with no duplicated pages. And Litestream now uses this capability to create a hierarchy of compactions:</p>

<ul>
<li>at Level 1, we compact all the changes in a 30-second time window
</li><li>at Level 2, all the Level 1 files in a 5-minute window
</li><li>at Level 3, all the Level 2’s over an hour.
</li></ul>

<p>Net result: we can restore a SQLite database to any point in time, <em>using only a dozen or so files on average</em>.</p>

<p>Litestream performs this compaction itself. It doesn’t rely on SQLite to process the WAL file. Performance is limited only by I/O throughput.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-generations"><a href="#no-more-generations" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>No More Generations</span></h2>
<p>What people like about Litestream is that it’s just an ordinary Unix program. But like any Unix program, Litestream can crash. It’s not supernatural, so when it’s not running, it’s not seeing database pages change. When it misses changes, it falls out of sync with the database.</p>

<p>Lucky for us, that’s easy to detect. When it notices a gap between the database and our running “shadow-WAL” backup, Litestream resynchronizes from scratch.</p>

<p>The only time this gets complicated is if you have multiple Litestreams backing up to the same destination. To keep multiple Litestreams from stepping on each other, Litestream divides backups into “generations”, creating a new one any time it resyncs. You can think of generations as Marvel Cinematic Universe parallel dimensions in which your database might be simultaneously living in.</p>

<p>Yeah, we didn’t like those movies much either.</p>

<p>LTX-backed Litestream does away with the concept entirely. Instead, when we detect a break in WAL file continuity, we re-snapshot with the next LTX file. Now we have a monotonically incrementing transaction ID. We can use it look up database state at any point in time, without searching across generations.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-to-litestream-v0-5-0"><a href="#upgrading-to-litestream-v0-5-0" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Upgrading to Litestream v0.5.0</span></h2>
<p>Due to the file format changes, the new version of Litestream can’t restore from old v0.3.x WAL segment files.</p>

<p>That’s OK though! The upgrade process is simple: just start using the new version. It’ll leave your old WAL files intact, in case you ever need to revert to the older version.The new LTX files are stored cleanly in an <code>ltx</code> directory on your replica.</p>

<p>The configuration file is fully backwards compatible.</p>

<p>There’s one small catch. We added a new constraint. You only get a single replica destination per database. This probably won’t affect you, since it’s how most people use Litestream already. We’ve made it official.</p>

<p>The rationale: having a single source of truth simplifies development for us, and makes the tool easier to reason about. Multiple replicas can diverge and are sensitive to network availability. Conflict resolution is brain surgery.</p>

<p>Litestream commands still work the same. But you’ll see references to “transaction IDs” (TXID) for LTX files, rather than the <code>generation/index/offset</code> we used previously with WAL segments.</p>

<p>We’ve also changed <code>litestream wal</code> to <code>litestream ltx</code>.</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff-v0-5-0-does-better"><a href="#other-stuff-v0-5-0-does-better" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Other Stuff v0.5.0 Does Better</span></h2>
<p>We’ve beefed up the <a href="https://github.com/superfly/ltx" title="">underlying LTX file format library</a>. It used to be an LTX file was just a sorted list of pages, all compressed together. Now we compress per-page, and keep an index at the end of the LTX file to pluck individual pages out.</p>

<p>You’re not seeing it yet, but we’re excited about this change: we can operate page-granularly even dealing with large LTX files. This allows for more features. A good example: we can build features that query from any point in time, without downloading the whole database.</p>

<p>We’ve also gone back through old issues &amp; PRs to improve quality-of-life. CGO is now gone. We’ve settled the age-old contest between <code>mattn/go-sqlite3</code> and <code>modernc.org/sqlite</code> in favor of <code>modernc.org</code>. This is super handy for people with automated build systems that want to run from a MacBook but deploy on an x64 server, since it lets the cross-compiler work.</p>

<p>We’ve also added a replica type for NATS JetStream. Users that already have JetStream running can get Litestream going without adding an object storage dependency.</p>

<p>And finally, we’ve upgraded all our clients (S3, Google Storage, &amp; Azure Blob Storage) to their latest versions. We’ve also moved our code to support newer S3 APIs.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What’s next?</span></h2>
<p>The next major feature we’re building out is a Litestream VFS for read replicas. This will let you instantly spin up a copy of the database and immediately read pages from S3 while the rest of the database is hydrating in the background.</p>

<p>We already have a proof of concept working and we’re excited to show it off when it’s ready!</p>

                <p>
Every time I look at someone’s simple static site generation setup for their
blog, I feel a pang of envy. I’m sure I could make a decent blogging engine in
2,000 lines of code, and it would be something I’d understand, be proud over,
able to extend, and willing to share with others.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I write these articles in Org mode, and use mostly the standard Org
publishing functions to export them to <abbr>html</abbr>. This is <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/long-hiatus-emacs-upgrades.html">sometimes brittle</a>, but
most annoyingly, I don’t understand it. I have been asked for details on how my
publishing flow works, but the truth is I have no idea what happens when I run
the <code>org-publish-current-file</code> command.
</p>

<p>
I could find out by tracing the evaluation of the Lisp code that runs on export,
but I won’t, because just the <abbr>html</abbr> exporting code (<code>ox-html.el</code>) is 5,000
lines of complexity. The general exporting framework (<code>ox-publish.el</code> and
<code>ox.el</code>) is 8,000 lines. The framework depends on Org parsing code
(<code>org-element.el</code>) which is at least another 9,000 lines. This is over 20,000
lines of complexity I’d need to contend with.
</p>

<p>
It might seem like a no-brainer to just write that 2,000 line custom static
generator and use that instead.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Except one thing: Babel.
</p>

<p>
Any lightweight markup format (like Markdown or ReStructuredText or whatever)
allows for embedding code blocks, but Org, through Babel, can <i>run</i> that code on
export, and then display the output in the published document, <i>even when the
output is a table or an image</i>. It supports sessions that lets code reuse
definitions from earlier code blocks. It allows for injecting variables from the
markup into the code, and vice versa. As a bonus, Org doesn’t require a
JavaScript syntax highlighter, because it generates inline styles in the source
code.
</p>

<p>
It does this for a large number of languages, although I mainly use it with R
for drawing plots. Being able to do this is incredibly convenient, because it
makes it trivial to <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/intention-to-treat-experiments.html">draft data, illustrations, and text at the same time</a>,
adjusting both until the article coheres. Having tried it, I cannot see myself
living without it.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
A simple 2,000 line blogging engine would be a fun weekend project. Mirroring
the features of Babel I use would turn it into a multi-month endeavour for
someone with limited time such as myself. Not going to happen, and I will
continue to beat myself up for overcomplicating my publishing workflow.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body="" data-cms-edit="content"> <p>It’s all the rage right now. Everyone is scrambling to put AI into their products. The uncanny valley is shrinking enough that it’s hard to see how much AI was used to write something.</p> <p>This isn’t entirely new, auto-complete on my phone already suggests the most likely word when I’m typing. AI writing tools are an extension of this, but they’re also much more capable.</p> <h2 id="your-electronic-memory" tabindex="-1">Your electronic memory</h2> <p>I stand by one of the most important truths about email. It’s not only the largest and most diverse social network, <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/email-is-your-electronic-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email is your electronic memory</a>.</p> <p>In the novel 1984, the “Ministry of Truth” has a whole massive department which rewrites history. In a world where there’s enough AI capability to process the entire web and rewrite every page to remove something, the cost of “changing history” is much reduced, so we can expect more of it.</p> <p>This is where the immutability of email really shines. An email is your copy, and the sender can’t revise it later. This is frustrating when you’ve sent the wrong thing and have to send a separate correction later, but in the long term it’s insanely valuable.</p> <p>It makes a huge difference to be able to go back and double-check your memory against an email you saw years ago and know that if they disagree, the email is correct. This is already not the case with web pages — they change, and it’s only becoming worse.</p> <h2 id="adapting-to-a-changing-world" tabindex="-1">Adapting to a changing world</h2> <p>My son is studying at University now, and he’s one of a few students in his class who refuses to use AI to write his assignments. As he said “what’s the point of paying to be here if I’m not going to build the knowledge and skills for myself, and come out knowing how to do the thing” (near enough… I didn’t write the exact words down in an email, so I’m going off my own fallible memory!) I am so proud of him for having that attitude.</p> <p>I’m also pleased to see that Fastmail’s staff, and many of our customers, are wary of AI tools.</p> <p>But they are that, tools. The world is changing, and we need to adapt and understand it.</p> <h2 id="our-service-your-data" tabindex="-1">Our service, your data</h2> <p>For our service, we want you to be able to do what you desire with your own email, calendars, and contacts. We will continue to build tools and integrations to make that easier.</p> <p>You are welcome to operate your Fastmail account with AI tools, so long as that usage doesn’t otherwise breach our <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/policies/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>, or degrade the performance of our systems for other customers.</p> <h2 id="our-staff-your-privacy" tabindex="-1">Our staff, your privacy</h2> <p>For our staff, we encourage understanding the tools that exist in the world, and how to use them safely. Our policy makes it clear that any use of tools, including tools with AI in them, must follow clear privacy-preserving principles:</p> <ul> <li>Data Protection: All data protection, confidentiality, and privacy policies must be followed (our vendors for things like anti-abuse and support are moving towards using AI for translation, categorization, abuse detection – and we are ensuring that their policies continue to provide protection for our customers)</li> <li>Accountability for work: Any AI generated writing or code must be reviewed and understood by a human being, and go through our regular second-set-of-eyes processes before being used</li> <li>Bias awareness: Actively look for biases or hallucinations in AI output</li> <li>Human authority: Always have a path for appeal to a human from any decision that is made by automated tools</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-future" tabindex="-1">The future</h2> <p>Who knows what the future will bring, but we continue to be guided by the principles that we first <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/fastmails-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly articulated in 2016</a> and have held even longer. The data is yours, and we will be good stewards and good internet citizens, helping enable you to use your data in the ways you choose.</p> </div></div>]]></description>
