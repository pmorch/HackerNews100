  <div><p>We trust companies with our information every day. But many companies—even those that hold our most revealing information—are using it not just to provide the services we ask for, but to amp up their profits at the cost of our privacy.</p>
<p>That's why EFF has joined a campaign, led by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG), to call on Mastercard to limit its data collection and stop selling cardholder information.</p>
<p>Mastercard is just one company that profits from the sale of personal data collected from the people who trust them with their information. As consumer advocates, we’re calling on the company to honor the trust that cardholders place in them by committing to stop selling their information.</p>
<p>Why make this ask of Mastercard? As U.S. PIRG <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/articles/mastercard-dont-sell-my-data/">explains in its report</a> accompanying the campaign, the company’s position as a global payments technology company affords it "access to enormous amounts of information derived from the financial lives of millions, and its monetization strategies tell a broader story of the data economy that’s gone too far."</p>
<p>Knowing where you shop, just by itself, can <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dygy8k/researchers-find-anonymized-data-is-even-less-anonymous-than-we-thought">reveal a lot about who you are</a>. Mastercard takes this a step further, as U.S. PIRG reported, by analyzing the amount and frequency of transactions, plus the location, date, and time to create categories of cardholders and make inferences about what type of shopper you may be. In some cases, this means predicting who’s a “big spender” or which cardholders Mastercard thinks will be “high-value”—predictions used to target certain people and encourage them to spend more money.</p>
<p>These kinds of actions work against the trust that many people have for the company that issues their cards. In fact, the Bank for International Settlements found that people <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull42.pdf">trust traditional financial institutions</a> with their data more than big tech companies, government bodies, or fintech firms. When people get a card from Mastercard, they do not anticipate the ways the financial profile of their purchases will be remixed, repackaged, and used against them. Mastercard <a href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2021/09/13/visa-shutting-personal-data-business-advertisers">can</a> and should do better. We call on the company to respect the trust and privacy of its cardholders and change its current data practices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Kuten <a href="https://dawn.fi/uutiset/2023/10/12/suomi-csam-suuri-valiokunta">uutisoimme aiemmin tällä viikolla</a>, Suomen eduskunnan oli tarkoitus ottaa tämän viikon perjantaina <i>(13.10.2023)</i> lopullisesti kantaa <strong>Euroopan Unionin</strong> niin kutsuttuun <strong>CSAM-asetukseen</strong>.</p><p>Kyseinen asetus toteutuessaan nykymuodossa käytännössä kieltäisi vahvan, päästä päähän ulottuvan salauksen koko Euroopassa, kaikissa viestinnän muodoissa. Tavalliselle kuluttajalle kenties tunnetuin esimerkki vahvasta salauksesta ovat pikaviestimet, kuten <strong>WhatsApp</strong> ja <strong>Signal</strong>. Vahvasti salatut pikaviestimet ovat mahdottomia murtaa ja viestejä voi lukea vain viestin lähettäjä sekä sen tarkoitettu vastaanottaja.</p><p>EU haluaa, että Euroopan viranomaiset pääsisivät murtamaan tämän välin siten, että kaikkea viestintää voitaisiin seurata tekoälyn avulla ja etsiä sieltä epäilyttävää materiaalia, ilman erillistä oikeuden määräystä. Eli salaus pitäisi murtaa - ja rakentaa kaikkea viestintää seuraava massavalvonta.</p><h2>Suomen kanta</h2><p>Suomessa asiaan otettiin kantaa perjantaina, kun eduskunnan <strong>Suuri valiokunta</strong> antoi asiasta päätöksensä. Suuren valiokunnan päätös pohjautuu useilta eri tahoilta kerättyihin asiantuntijalausuntoihin, mukana mm. IT-alan edustajat, perustuslakivaliokunta, jne.</p>
			<p>Suuren valiokunnan kanta sitoo Suomen hallitusta, kun hallitus alkaa neuvottelemaan asetuksesta EU:ssa, eli hallituksen on pakko noudattaa valiokunnan ohjeistusta.</p><p><a href="https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/vaski/Lausunto/Sivut/SuVL_7+2023.aspx" target="_blank">Suuren valiokunnan päätös</a> saatiin perjantaina iltapäivällä ja sen voisi tiivistää termiin "varovainen ei".</p><p>Valiokunta kehui CSAM-esityksen taustalla olevaa ideaa, eli lasten suojelua verkon vaaroilta:</p><blockquote>Suuri valiokunta katsoo, että asetusehdotuksella on erittäin painava tavoite tehokkaasti ennaltaehkäistä ja torjua lapsiin kohdistuvaa verkkovälitteistä seksuaaliväkivaltaa EU-tason toimin. Valiokunta pitää tärkeänä, että EU-tasolla syntyy selkeä ja sitova oikeudellinen kehys, jolla voidaan tehostaa hyväksikäytön havaitsemista, ilmoittamista ja poistamista. Valtioneuvoston tavoin suuri valiokunta painottaa lapsen edun merkitystä, kun punnitaan ehdotuksen eri osien suhdetta perustuslakiin ja perus- ja ihmisoikeuksiin.</blockquote><p>Mutta siihen sitten asetuksen kanssa myötäily pitkälti loppuukin, sillä valiokunta nosti esiin CSAM-esityksen lukuisia ongelmakohtia.</p>
			<p>Ensinnäkin valiokunta on sitä mieltä, että päästä päähän salausta ei saa murtaa, sillä se murentaisi tietoturvaa:</p><blockquote>Suuri valiokunta katsoo liikenne- ja viestintävaliokunnan tavoin, että jatkoneuvotteluissa on erityisen tärkeä varmistaa, etteivät tunnistamismääräykset johda päästä päähän -salauksen tai muiden vastaavien tietoturvatoimenpiteiden yleiseen heikentämiseen, purkamiseen tai käytön rajoittamiseen ja tätä kautta viestinnän sekä viestinnän palvelujen tietoturvan ja kyberturvallisuuden tason heikkenemiseen. </blockquote><p>Lisäksi valiokunta katsoo, että ehdotusta ei voida kannattaa sellaisessa muodossa, että se sallisi massavalvonnan. Valiokunnan mukaan valvontaa pitäisi tehdä ainoastaan tunnistettuihin kohteisiin, eikä siis koko kansan tasolla. Eli valiokunta tyrmäsi ehdotuksen siitä, että kaikkien ihmisten kaikkia viestejä aletaan skannaamaan, josko sieltä löytyisi jotain epäilyttävää.</p><p>Eli Suomi ei voi suuren valiokunnan lausunnon pohjalta hyväksyä ehdotusta tällaisenaan. </p><h2>Miten asia etenee?</h2><p>EU-maat äänestävät ehdotuksesta lokakuun lopulla. Tuolloin ehdotus menee läpi, mikäli sitä ei vastusta sellainen määrä maita, jotka edustavat yhteensä vähintään 35 prosenttia EU-kansalaisista.</p>
			<center><blockquote><p lang="fi" dir="ltr">35% määrävähemmistö edustetuista EU-kansalaisista. Neuvoston sivulla on näppärä laskuri: <a href="https://t.co/JCZP43ThCX">https://t.co/JCZP43ThCX</a></p>-- Asko Metsola (@AskoMetsola) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskoMetsola/status/1712819824567484795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2023</a></blockquote> </center><p>Tiedossa on, että ainakin Saksa, Itävalta ja Viro vastustavat ehdotusta. Kannattajia on tiedossa selkeästi enemmän, mm. Espanja, Tanska, Unkari ja Irlanti kannattavat komission ehdotusta.</p><p>Päätöstä eivät ole vielä tehneet läheskään kaikki maat, sillä päätöstä odotetaan mm. Ranskan, Ruotsin, Belgian, Hollannin ja Portugalin osalta.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://without.boats/blog/why-async-rust/">https://without.boats/blog/why-async-rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37891020">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Async/await syntax in Rust was initially released to much fanfare and excitement. To quote <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21473418">Hacker
News</a> at the time:</p><blockquote><p>This is going to open the flood gates. I am sure lot of people were just waiting for this moment
for Rust adoption. I for one was definitely in this boat.</p><p>Also, this has all the goodness: open-source, high quality engineering, design in open, large
contributors to a complex piece of software. Truly inspiring!</p></blockquote><p>Recently, the reception has been a bit more mixed. To a quote a comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37436413">Hacker News</a> again,
discussing a recent blog post on the subject:</p><blockquote><p>I genuinely can’t understand how anybody could look at the mess that’s Rust’s async and think that
it was a good design for a language that already had the reputation of being very complicated to
write.</p><p>I tried to get it, I really did, but my god what a massive mess that is. And it contaminates
everything it touches, too. I really love Rust and I do most of my coding in it these days, but
every time I encounter async-heavy Rust code my jaw clenches and my vision blurs.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, neither of these comments are completely representative: even four years ago, some people
had pointed concerns. And in the same thread as this comment about jaws clenching and vision
blurring, there were many people defending async Rust with equal fervor. But I don’t think I would
be out of pocket to say that the nay-sayers have grown more numerous and their tone more strident as
time has gone on. To some extent this is just the natural progression of the hype cycle, but I also
think as we have become more distant from the original design process, some of the context has been
lost.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, I drove the design of async/await syntax, in collaboration with others and
building on the work of those who came before me. Forgive me if I am put a bit off when someone says
that they don’t know how anyone could look at that “mess” and “think that it was a good design,” and
please indulge me in this imperfectly organized and overly long explanation of how async Rust came
to exist, what its purpose was, and why, in my opinion, for Rust there was no viable alternative. I
hope that along the way I might shed more light on the design of Rust in a broader and deeper sense,
at least slightly, and not merely regurgitate the justifications of the past.</p><h2 id="some-background-on-terminology">Some background on terminology</h2><p>The basic issue at stake in this debate is Rust’s decision to use a “stackless coroutine” approach
to implementing user-space concurrency. A lot of terms are thrown around in this discussion and its
reasonable not to be familiar with all of them.</p><p>The first concept we need to get straight is the very purpose of the feature: “user-space
concurrency.” The major operating systems present a set of fairly similar interfaces to achieve
concurrency: you can spawn threads, and perform IO on those threads using syscalls, which block that
thread until they complete. The problem with these interfaces is that they involve certain overheads
that can become a limiting factor when you want to achieve certain performance targets. These are
two-fold:</p><ol><li>Context-switching between the kernel and userspace is expensive in terms of CPU cycles.</li><li>OS threads have a large pre-allocated stack, which increases per-thread memory overhead.</li></ol><p>These limitations are fine up to a certain point, but for massively concurrent programs they do not
work. The solution is to use a non-blocking IO interface and schedule many concurrent operations on
a single OS thread. This can be done by the programmer “by hand,” but modern languages frequently
provide facilities to make this easier. Abstractly, languages have some way of dividing work into
tasks and scheduling those tasks onto threads. Rust’s system for this is async/await.</p><p>The first axis of choice in this design space is between <em>cooperative</em> and <em>preemptive</em> scheduling.
Must tasks “cooperatively” yield control back to the scheduling subsystem, or can they be
“preemptively” stopped at some point while they’re running, without the task being aware of it?</p><p>A term that gets thrown around a lot in these discussions is <em>coroutine</em>, and it is used in somewhat
contradictory ways. A coroutine is a function which can be paused and then later resumed. The big
ambiguity is that some people use the term “coroutine” to mean a function which has explicit syntax
for pausing and resuming it (this would correspond to a cooperatively scheduled task) and some
people use it to mean any function that can pause, even if the pause is performed implicitly by a
language runtime (this would also include a preemptively scheduled task). I prefer the first
definition, because it introduces some manner of meaningful distinction.</p><p><em>Goroutines</em>, on the other hand, are a Go language feature which enables concurrent, preemptively
scheduled tasks. They have an API that is the same as a thread, but it is implemented as part of the
language instead of as an operating system primitive, and in other languages they are often called
<em>virtual threads</em> or else <em>green threads.</em> So by my definition, goroutines are not coroutines, but
other people use the broader definition and say goroutines are a kind of coroutine. I’ll refer to
this approach as green threads, because that’s been the terminology used in Rust.</p><p>The second axis of choice is between a <em>stackful</em> and a <em>stackless</em> coroutine. A stackful coroutine
has a program stack in the same way that an OS thread has a program stack: as functions are called
as part of the coroutine, their frames are pushed on the stack; when the coroutine yields, the state
of the stack is saved so that it can be resumed from the same position. A stackless coroutine on
the other hand stores the state it needs to resume in a different way, such as in a continuation
or in a state machine. When it yields, the stack it was using is used by the operation that took
over from it, and when it resumes it takes back control of the stack and that continuation or state
machine is used to resume the coroutine where it left off.</p><p>One issue that is often brought up with async/await (in Rust and other languages) is the “function
coloring problem” - a complaint that in order to get the result of an async function, you need to
use a different operation (such as awaiting it) rather than call it normally. Both green threads and
stackful coroutine mechanisms can avoid this outcome, because it’s that special syntax that is used
to indicate that something special is happening to manage the stackless state of the coroutine
(what specifically depends on the language).</p><p>Rust’s async/await syntax is an example of a stackless coroutine mechanism: an async function is
compiled to a function which returns a <code>Future</code>, and that future is what is used to store the state
of the coroutine when it yields control. The basic question at hand in this debate is whether Rust
was correct to adopt this approach, or if it should have adopted a more Go-like “stackful” or “green
thread” approach, ideally without explicit syntax that “colors” functions.</p><h2 id="the-development-of-async-rust">The development of async Rust</h2><h2 id="green-threads">Green threads</h2><p>A third <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37791635">Hacker News</a> comment represents well the kind of remark that I often see in this
debate:</p><blockquote><p>The alternative concurrency model people want is structured concurrency via stackful coroutines
and channels on top of a work stealing executor.</p><p>Until someone does the work to demo that and compare it to async/await with futures I don’t think
there’s any productive discussion to be had.</p></blockquote><p>Setting aside the references to structured concurrency, channels and a work stealing executor
(completely orthogonal concerns), the bewildering thing about comments like this is that originally
Rust <em>did</em> have a stackful coroutine mechanism, in the form of green threads. It was removed in late
2014, shortly before the 1.0 release. Understanding the reason why will help us get to the bottom of
why Rust shipped async/await syntax.</p><p>A big issue for any green threading system - Rust’s or Go’s or any other language’s - is what to do
about the program stack for these threads. Remember that one of the goals of a user-space
concurrency mechanism is to reduce the memory overhead of the large, pre-allocated stack used by OS
threads. Therefore, green thread libraries tend to try to adopt a mechanism to spawn threads with
smaller stacks, and grow them only as needed.</p><p>One way to achieve this is so-called “segmented stacks,” in which the stack is a linked list of
small stack segments; when the stack grows beyond the bound of its segment, a new segment is added
to the list, and when it shrinks, that segment is removed. The problem with this technique is that
introduces a high variability in the cost of pushing a stack frame onto the stack. If the frame fits
in the current segment, this is basically free. If it doesn’t, it requires allocating a new segment.
A particularly pernicious version of this is when a function call in a hot loop requires allocating
a new segment. This adds an allocation and deallocation to every iteration of that loop, having a
significant impact on performance. And it is entirely opaque to users, because users don’t know how
deep the stack will be when a function is called. Both Rust and Go started with segmented stacks,
and then abandoned this approach for these reasons.</p><p>Another approach is called “stack copying.” In this case, a stack is more like a <code>Vec</code> than a linked
list: when the stack hits its limit, it is reallocated larger so that the limit isn’t hit. This
allows stacks to start small and grow as needed, without the downsides of segmented stacks. The
problem with this is that reallocating the stack means copying it, which means the stack will now be
at a new location in memory. Any pointers into the stack are now invalid, and there needs to be some
mechanism for updating them.</p><p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-stacks-are-handled-in-go/">Go uses stack copying</a>, and benefits from the fact that in Go pointers into a stack can only
exist in the same stack, so it just needs to scan that stack to rewrite pointers. Even this requires
runtime type information which Rust doesn’t keep, but Rust also allows pointers into a stack that
aren’t stored inside that stack - they could be somewhere in the heap, or in the stack of another
thread. The problem of tracking these pointers is ultimately the same as the problem of garbage
collection, except that instead of freeing memory it is moving it. Rust could not adopt this
approach because Rust does not have a garbage collector, so in the end it could not adopt stack
copying. Instead, Rust solved the problem of segmented stacks by making its green threads large,
just like OS threads. But this eliminated one of the key advantages of green threads.</p><p>Even in a situation like Go, which can have resizing stacks, green threads carry certain unavoidable
costs when trying to integrate with libraries written in other languages. The C ABI, with its OS
stack, is the shared minimum of every language. Switching code from executing on a green thread to
running on the OS thread stack can be prohibitively expensive for FFI. Go just accepts this FFI
cost; C# recently <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/2398">aborted an experiment</a> with green threads for this reason.</p><p>This was especially problematic for Rust, because Rust is designed to support use cases like
embedding a Rust library into a binary written in another language, and to run on embedded systems
that don’t have the clock cycles or memory to operate a virtual threading runtime. To attempt to
resolve this problem, the green threading runtime was made optional, and Rust could instead be
compiled to run on native threads, using blocking IO. This was designed to be a compile time
decision made by the final binary. Thus, for a time, there were two varieties of Rust, one of which
used blocking IO and native threads, and one of which used non-blocking IO and green threads, and
all code was intended to be compatible with both varieties. This did not play out well, and green
threads were removed from Rust as a result of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230">RFC 230</a>, which enumerated the reasons:</p><ul><li>The abstraction over green and native threads was not “zero-cost,” and resulted in unavoidable
virtual calls and allocations when performing IO, which was not acceptable especially to native
code.</li><li>It forced native threads and green threads to support identical APIs, even when that didn’t make
sense.</li><li>It was not fully interoperable, because it was still possible to invoke native IO through FFI,
even on a green thread.</li></ul><p>Once green threads were removed, the problem of high performance user space concurrency remained.
The Future trait and later the async/await syntax were developed to resolve that problem. But to
understand that path, we need to take one further step back and look at Rust’s solution to a
different problem.</p><h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2><p>I contend the true beginning of the journey to async Rust is to be found in an old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716172928/https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-June/004599.html">mailing list
post</a> from 2013 by a former contributor named Daniel Micay. This post has nothing to do with
async/await or futures or non-blocking IO: it was a post about iterators. Micay proposed shifting
Rust to use what were called “external” iterators, and it was this shift - and its effectiveness in
combination with Rust’s ownership and borrowing model - that set Rust inexorably on the course
toward async/await. No one knew that at the time, obviously.</p><p>Rust had always prohibited mutating state through a binding that was aliased with another variable -
this edict “mutable XOR aliased” was as central to early Rust as it is today. But initially it
enforced it with different mechanisms, not with lifetime analysis. At the time, references were just
“argument modifiers,” similar in concept to things like the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions/#In-Out-Parameters">“inout” modifier</a> from
Swift. In 2012, Niko Matsakis had proposed and implemented the first version of Rust’s lifetime
analysis, promoting references to real types and enabling them to be embedded into structs.</p><p>Though the shift to lifetime analysis has been rightly recognized for its enormous impact in making
Rust what it is today, its symbiotic interaction with external iterators, and the fundamental
importance of that API to settling Rust into its current niche, has not received enough attention.
Before the adoption of “external” iterators, Rust used a kind of callback based approach to define
iterators, something that in modern Rust would look like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>ControlFlow</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

<code>ControlFlow::Break</code>, in which case they are meant to stop iterating. The body of a <code>for</code> loop was
compiled to a closure that was passed to the iterator being looped over. Such iterators were much
easier to write than external iterators, but there are two key problems with this approach:</p><ol><li>The language couldn’t guarantee that iteration actually stops running when the loop says to
break, so you couldn’t rely on that for memory safety. This meant things like return references
from a loop was not possible, because the loop could actually continue.</li><li>They couldn’t be used to implement generic combinators that interleave multiple iterators, like
<code>zip</code>, because the API doesn’t support iterating alternatively through one iterator and then
another.</li></ol><p>Instead, Daniel Micay proposed to shift Rust to use “external” iterators, which completely resolve
these problems and have the interface Rust users are used to today:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>trait</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>(Very well-informed readers will be aware that Rust’s Iterator has an a provided method called
<code>try_fold</code> which is functionally very similar to the internal iterator API and is used in the
definition of some other iterator combinators because it can result in better code generation. But
it isn’t the key underlying method by which all iterators are defined.)</em></p><p>External iterators integrated perfectly with Rust’s ownership and borrowing system because they
essentially compile to a struct which holds the state of iteration inside of itself, and which can
therefore contain references to data structures being iterated over just like any other struct. And
thanks to monomorphization, a complex iterator built by assembling multiple combinators also
compiled into a single struct, making it transparent to the optimizer. The only problem was that
they were harder to write by hand, because you need to define the state machine that will be used
for iteration. Foreshadowing future developments, Daniel Micay wrote at the time:</p><blockquote><p>In the future, Rust can have generators using a <code>yield</code> statement like C#, compiling down to a
fast state machine without requiring context switches, virtual functions or even closures. This
would eliminate the difficulty of coding recursive traversals by-hand with external iterators.</p></blockquote><p>Progress on generators has not moved swiftly, though an exciting <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116447">RFC</a> was recently published
that would suggest we may see this feature soon.</p><p>Even without generators, external iterators proved to be a great success, and the general value of
the technique was recognized. For example, Aria Beingessner used a similar approach in the “Entry
API” for accessing map entries. Tellingly, in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/216">RFC</a> for the API, she refers to it as
“iterator-like.” What she means by this is that the API builds a state machine via series of
combinators, which presented itself to the compiler as highly legible and thus optimizable. This
technique had legs.</p><h2 id="futures">Futures</h2><p>When they needed to replace green threads, Aaron Turon and Alex Crichton began by copying the API
used in many other languages, which has come to be called futures or promises. APIs like this are
based on what is called a “continuation passing style.” A future defined in this way takes a
callback as an additional argument, called the continuation, and calls the continuation as its final
operation when the future completes. This is how this abstraction is defined in most languages, and
the async/await syntax of most languages is compiled into this sort of continuation passing style.</p><p>In Rust, that sort of API would have looked something like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>trait</span><span> </span><span>Future</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>schedule</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>continuation</span>: <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>FnOnce</span><span>(</span><span>Self</span>::<span>Output</span><span>));</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Aaron Turon and Alex Crichton tried this approach, but as Aaron Turon wrote in an enlightening <a href="http://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/09/07/futures-design/">blog
post</a>, they quickly ran into the problem that using a continuation passing style too often
required allocating the callback. Turon gives the example of <code>join</code>: join takes two futures, and
runs them both concurrently. The continuation of join needs to be owned by <em>both</em> child futures,
because whichever of them finishes last needs to execute it. This ended up requiring reference
counting and allocations to implement, which wasn’t considered acceptable for Rust.</p><p>Instead, they examined how C programmers tend to implement async programming: in C, programmers
handle non blocking IO by building a state machine. What they wanted was a definition of Future that
could be compiled into the sort of state machine that C programmers would write by hand. After some
experimentation, they landed on what they called a “readiness-based” approach:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>),</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Instead of storing a continuation, a future is polled by some external executor. When a future is
pending, it stores a way to wake that executor, which it will execute when it is ready to be polled
again. By inverting control in this way, they no longer needed to store a callback for when a future
completes, which allowed them to represent a future as a single state machine. They built a library
of combinators on top of this interface, that all would be compiled into a single state machine.</p><p>Switching from a callback-based approach to an external driver, compiling a set of combinators into
a single state machine, even the exact specification of these two APIs: all of this should sound
very familiar if you read the previous section. <strong>The shift from continuations to polling is exactly
the same shift that was performed with iterators in 2013!</strong> Once again, it was Rust’s ability to
handle structs with lifetimes and therefore to handle stackless coroutines which borrow state from
outside themselves that allowed it to optimally represent futures as state machines without
violating memory safety. This pattern of building single-object state machines out of smaller
components, whether applied to iterators or futures, is a key part of how Rust works. It falls out
of the language almost naturally.</p><p>I’ll pause for a moment to highlight one difference between iterators and futures: combinators that
interleave two iterators, like <code>Zip</code>, are not even possible with a callback-like approach, unless
your language has some sort of native support for coroutines you’re building on top of. On the other
hand, if you want to interleave two futures, like <code>Join</code>, the continuation based approach can
support that: it just carries some runtime costs. This explains why external iterators are common in
other languages, but Rust is unique in applying this transform to futures.</p><p>In its initial iteration, the futures library was designed with the principle that users would
construct futures in much the same way that they constructed iterators: low-level library authors
would use the <code>Future</code> trait, whereas users writing applications would use a set of combinators,
provided by the <code>futures</code> library, to construct more complex futures out of simpler components.
Unfortunately, users immediately faced frustrating compiler errors when they tried to follow this
approach. The problem was that futures, when spawned, need to “escape” the surrounding context, and
therefore can’t borrow state from that context: the task most own all of its state.</p><p>This was a problem for futures combinators, because often that state needs to be accessed in
multiple combinators that form part of the chain of actions that make up the future. For example, it
was common for users to call one “async” method on an object, and then another, which would be
written like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>().</span><span>and_then</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>result</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The problem was that <code>foo</code> was borrowed both in the <code>bar</code> method and then in the closure passed to
<code>and_then</code>. Essentially, what users wanted to do was store state “across an await point,” the await
point being formed by the chaining of future combinators; this usually resulted confounding and
perplexing borrow-checker errors. The most accessible solution to this was to store that state in an
<code>Arc</code> and <code>Mutex</code>, which is not zero-cost and more importantly was very unwieldy and awkward as your
system grew in complexity. For example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Arc</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Mutex</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>));</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>().</span><span>lock</span><span>().</span><span>bar</span><span>()</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>   </span><span>.</span><span>and_then</span><span>(</span><span>move</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span>result</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>().</span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Despite the great benchmarks that futures had shown in the initial experimentation, the result of
this limitation was that users weren’t able to use them to build complex systems. This is where I
came into the story.</p><h2 id="asyncawait">Async/await</h2><p>In late 2017, it was clear that the futures ecosystem was failing to launch for reasons of bad user
experience. It was always the end goal of the futures project to implement a so-called “stackless
coroutine transform,” in which functions using async and await syntax operators could be transformed
into functions that evaluate to futures, avoiding users having to write futures by hand. Alex
Crichton had developed a macro based async/await implementation as a <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await">library</a>, but this
had gained almost no traction. Something needed to change.</p><p>One of the biggest problems with Alex Crichton’s macros was that it would produce an error if a user
attempted to have a reference to future state that was held over an <code>await</code> point. This was really
the same issue as the borrowing issue users encountered with futures combinators, appearing again in
the new syntax. It was not possible for a future to hold a reference to its own state while
awaiting, because this would need to be compiled into a self-referential struct, which Rust had no
support for.</p><p>It’s interesting to compare this to the problem of green threads. One way we’ve explained the
compilation of futures to state machines is to say that the state machine is a “perfectly sized
stack” - unlike the stack of a green thread, which must grow to accommodate the state of the unknown
sized that any thread stack may have, a compiled future (implemented by hand, with combinators, or
with an async function) is exactly as large as it needs to be. So we don’t have the problem of
growing this stack at runtime.</p><p>However, this stack is represented as a struct, and it is always safe to move structs in Rust. This
means that even though we don’t <em>need</em> to move a future around while it’s being executed, according
to the rules of Rust we need to be <em>able</em> to. Thus, the problem of stack pointers that we
encountered with green threads re-emerged in the new system. This time, though, we had the advantage
that we didn’t need to be able to move the future, we just needed to express that the future was
immovable.</p><p>The initial attempt to implement this was to try to define a new trait, called <code>Move</code>, which would
be used to exclude coroutines from APIs which can move them. This ran into some backwards
compatibility problems that I have previously <a href="https://without.boats/blog/changing-the-rules-of-rust">documented</a>. My thesis for
async/await had three main points:</p><ol><li>We needed async/await syntax in the language so that users could build complex futures using
coroutine-like functions.</li><li>Async/await syntax needed to support compiling those functions to self-referential structs, so
that users could use references in coroutines.</li><li>This feature needed to ship as soon as humanly possible.</li></ol><p>The combination of these three points led me to search for an alternative solution to the <code>Move</code>
trait, one that could be implemented without any major disruptive change to the language.</p><p>My initial plan to achieve this result was much worse than what we ended up with. I proposed that we
would just make the <code>poll</code> method unsafe, and include as an invariant that once you have started
polling a future, you cannot move it again. This was simple, immediately implementable, and
extremely brute force: it would have made every hand-written future unsafe, and imposed a difficult
to verify requirement with no assistance from the compiler. It likely would have ran aground on some
soundness issue eventually, and it would certainly have been extremely controversial.</p><p>So it was wonderful that Eddy Burtescu made a few remarks that led me in the direction of a much
better API, which would enable us to enforce the invariants required in a much more fine-grained
way. This would eventually become the <code>Pin</code> type. The <code>Pin</code> type itself has been the source of a
fair amount of consternation, but I think it was an undeniable improvement on the other options were
were considering at the time, in that it was targeted, enforceable, and also shippable on time.</p><p>In retrospect, there are two categories of problems with the pinning approach:</p><ol><li><strong>Backward compatibility:</strong> some interfaces that already existed (especially Iterator and Drop)
should have supported immovable types for various reasons, and this has limited the options in
developing the language further.</li><li><strong>Exposure to end users:</strong> our intention was that users writing “normal async Rust” would never
have to deal with <code>Pin</code>. Mostly this has been true, but there are a few notable exceptions.
Almost all of these would be fix-able with some syntax improvements. The only one that’s really
bad (and embarrassing to me personally) is that you need to pin a future trait object to await
it. This was an unforced error that would now be a breaking change to fix.</li></ol><p>The only other decisions to be made about async/await were syntactic, which I will not unsettle in
this already overly long post.</p><h2 id="organizational-considerations">Organizational considerations</h2><p>My reason in exploring all this history is to demonstrate that a series of facts about Rust led us
inevitably into a specific design space. The first was that Rust’s lack of runtime made green
threads a non-viable solution, both because Rust needs to support embedding (both embedding into
other applications and running on embedded systems) and because Rust cannot perform the memory
management necessary for green threads. The second was that Rust has a natural capacity for
expressing coroutines compiled to highly optimizable state machines while still being memory safe,
which we exploit not only for futures but also for iterators.</p><p>But there is another side to this history: <em>why</em> did we pursue a runtime system for user-space
concurrency? Why have futures and async/await at all? This argument usually takes one of two forms:
on the one hand, you have people who are used to managing user-space concurrency “by hand,” using an
interface like epoll directly; these people sometimes sneer at async/await syntax as “webcrap.” On
the other hand, some people just say “you aren’t gonna need it,” and propose using simpler OS
concurrency like threads and blocking IO.</p><p>People implementing highly performant network services in languages without facilities for
user-space concurrency like C tend to implement them using a hand-written state machine. This is
exactly what the <code>Future</code> abstraction was designed to compile into, but without having to write the
state machine by hand: the whole point of the coroutine transform to write imperative code “as if
your function never yields,” but have the compiler generate the state transitions to suspend it when
it would block. The benefits of this are not insignificant. A recent curl <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/10/11/how-i-made-a-heap-overflow-in-curl/">CVE</a> was ultimately
caused by a failure to recognize state that needed to be saved during a state transition. This kind
of logic error is easy to make when implementing a state machine by hand.</p><p>The goal of shipping async/await syntax in Rust was to ship a feature which avoided those bugs while
still having the same performance profile. Systems like this, most often written in C or C++, were
considered well within our addressable audience, given the level of control we provide and the lack
of memory management runtime.</p><p>In early 2018, the Rust project had committed to the idea of releasing a new “edition” that year, to
fix some of the syntactic issues that had emerged with 1.0. It was also decided to use this edition
as an opportunity to promote a narrative around Rust being ready for prime-time; the Mozilla team was
mostly compiler hackers and type theorists, but we had some basic idea about marketing and
recognized the edition as an opportunity to get eyeballs on the product. I proposed to Aaron Turon
that we should focus on four basic user stories which seemed like growth opportunities for Rust.
These were:</p><ul><li>Embedded systems</li><li>WebAssembly</li><li>Command-line interfaces</li><li>Network services</li></ul><p>This remark was the jumping off point for the creation of the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-2018-domain-working-groups/6737">“Domain Working
Groups”</a>, which were intended to be cross-functional groups focused on a particular
use “domains” (in contrast to the pre-existing “teams” controlling some technical or organizational
bailiwick). The concept of working groups in the Rust project has morphed since then and mostly lost
this sense, but I digress.</p><p>The work on async/await was pioneered by the “network services” working group, which eventually
become known as simply the async working group (and still exists under this name today). However, we
were also acutely aware that given its lack of runtime dependencies, async Rust could also be of
great service in the other domains, especially embedded systems. We designed the feature with both
of these use cases in mind.</p><p>It was clear, though usually left unsaid, that what Rust needed to succeed was industry adoption, so
that it could continue to receive support once Mozilla stopped being willing to fund an experimental
new language. And it was clear that the most likely path to short-term industry adoption was in
network services, especially those with a performance profile that compelled them at the time to be
written in C/C++. This use case fit the niche of Rust perfectly - these systems need high degrees of
control to achieve their performance requirements but avoiding exploitable memory bugs is critical
because they are exposed to the network.</p><p>The other advantage of network services was that this wing of the software industry has the
flexibility and appetite to rapidly adopt a new technology like Rust. The other domains were - and
are! - viable long term opportunities for Rust, but they were seen as not as quick to adopt new
technology (embedded), depended on a new platform that had not yet seen widespread adoption itself
(WebAssembly), or were not a particularly lucrative industrial application that could lead to
funding for the language (CLIs). I drove at async/await with the diligent fervor of the assumption
that Rust’s survival depended on this feature.</p><p>In that regard, async/await has been phenomenally successful. Many of the most prominent sponsors of
the Rust Foundation, especially those who pay developers, depend on async/await to write high
performance network services in Rust as one of their primary use cases that justify their funding.
Using async/await for embedded systems or kernel programming is also a growing area of interest with
a bright future. Async/await has been so successful that the most common complaint about it is
that the ecosystem is too centered on it, rather than “normal” Rust.</p><p>I don’t know what to tell users who would rather just use threads and blocking IO. Certainly, I
think there are a lot of systems for which that is a reasonable approach. And nothing in the Rust
language prevents them from doing it. Their objection seems to be that the ecosystem on crates.io,
especially for writing network services, is centered on using async/await. Ocassionally, I see a
library which uses async/await in a “cargo cult” way, but mostly it seems safe to assume that the
author of the library actually wants to perform non-blocking IO and get the performance benefits of
user-space concurrency.</p><p>None of us can control what everyone else decides to work on, and the fact of the matter is just
that most people who release networking-related libraries on crates.io want to use async Rust,
whether for business reasons or just out of interest. I’d like it to be easier to use those
libraries in a non-async context (e.g. by bringing a <a href="https://docs.rs/pollster/0.3.0/pollster/">pollster</a>-like API into the standard
library), but it’s hard to know what to say to people who’s gripe is that the people putting code
online for free don’t have exactly the same use case as them.</p><h2 id="to-be-continued">To be continued</h2><p>Although I contend there was no alternative for <em>Rust</em>, I don’t believe async/await is the right
alternative to any language. In particular, I think there is a possibility for a language which
provides the same sort of reliability guarantees that Rust provides, but less control over the
runtime representation of values, which uses stackful coroutines instead of stackless ones. I even
think - if such a language supported such coroutines in such a way that they could be used for both
iteration and concurrency - that language could do without lifetimes entirely while still
eliminating errors that arise from aliased mutability. If you read his <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html">notes</a>, you can see
that this language is what Graydon Hoare was originally driving at, before Rust changed course to be
a systems language that could complete with C and C++.</p><p>I think there are users of Rust who would be perfectly happy using this language if it existed, and
I understand why they dislike that they have to deal with inherent complexity of the low level
details. It be that these users complained about the myriad string types, now they are more likely
to complain about async. I wish that a language for this use case with the same kinds of guarantees
as Rust also existed, but the problem here isn’t with Rust.</p><p>And despite the fact that I believe async/await is the right approach for Rust, I also think its
reasonable to be unhappy with the state of async ecosystem today. We shipped an MVP in 2019, tokio
shipped a 1.0 in 2020, and things have been more stagnant since then than I think anyone involved
would like. In a follow up post, I want to discuss the state of the async ecosystem today, and what
I think the project could do to improve users’ experience. But this is already the longest blog post
I’ve ever published, so for now I will have to leave it there.</p></section></div>]]></description>

    <div>
          <p>Throughout much of the 20th century, frequentist statistics dominated the field of statistics and scientific research. Frequentist statistics primarily focus on the analysis of data in terms of probabilities and observed frequencies. Causal inference, on the other hand, involves making inferences about cause-and-effect relationships, which often goes beyond the scope of traditional frequentist statistical methods.</p>

<p>Causal inference has a long history, but it gained more prominent attention in the latter half of the 20th century. This increased interest was partly due to advancements in statistical methods and the development of causal inference frameworks. In the 1980s, the work of Judea Pearl on causal inference significantly contributed to the field which continued into the 21st century. Economists and social scientists were among the first to recognize the advantages of these emerging causal inference techniques and incorporated in their research.</p>

<p>However, based on my personal anecdote, the data science community didn’t truly prioritize causal inference until around 2015 or later. It was during this period that less technically oriented economists faced significant challenges related to the scaling of big data, prompting them to seek assistance from data scientists. Unfortunately, data scientists often lacked the necessary expertise in causal inference, resulting in limited knowledge transfer to business stakeholders. As a result, we, the data scientists, missed an important development for quite a bit, so let’s catch up on that!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-causal-inference">What is causal inference?</h3>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/ny.png" alt="New York in the parallel worlds">
<em>New York in the parallel worlds</em></p>

<p>To explain causal inference, I like an analogy of a parallel or alternative world. Nowadays, with the help of GenerativeAI, we can really simulate or create new worlds. Have you ever wondered how New York would be if the Aztecs would take over of Americas? Or what if the Roman Empire still ruled the world?</p>

<p>Now, how does this relate to data science and business decisions? Well, businesses make important choices every day, like where to invest money, who to hire or fire, and what the consequences of public policies might be. The data they collect only shows one side of reality. To really understand the results of their decisions, they need to explore an unseen or simulated reality. That’s where causal inference comes in, helping us make better decisions by considering alternative outcomes.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example to make it clear. Imagine you’re in charge of expanding the business of a company that makes snack bars for kids. Your  goal is to boost sales, and you’re considering adding more sugar to your products because you have a hunch that kids love sugar. After enchancing all your snacks with sugar, you want to measure its impact. You want to know how much your sales would be in a parallel world where kids were stuck with bland snacks compared to your sweet treats. This is where causal inference steps in to provide the solution.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/sweet.png" alt="">
<em>Sales of sweet snacks vs bland snacks</em></p>

<p>The chart above illustrates the difference between an observed scenario represented by the red line and an unobserved scenario represented by the black line. The technical term for the black line is ‘counterfactual’—it represents what the sales would be if we didn’t enhance the snacks with sugar.</p>

<p>To continue this intriguing story, let’s fast forward a bit. Now, you’re the CEO of the same company, which has gained international recognition and is traded on stock markets worldwide. However, recently, some pesky Facebook groups formed by moms and dads have launched a public campaign, claiming that your products and the entire concept behind them are making their children overweight and prone to diabetes.</p>

<p>In an effort to address these concerns and launch a PR campaign, you reach out to a university with whom you’ve collaborated in the past to improve your products. You ask them to investigate these claims. To your surprise, they request the same sales data that initially sparked the sugary product campaign. A few nights later, an underpaid PhD student conducts a causal inference analysis, constructs counterfactuals and uncovers the following findings.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/diabetes.png" alt="">
<em>Percentage of people with diabetes, simulated data</em></p>

<p>Upon seeing these results, you become convinced that there is a conspiracy against you and your company. You quickly instruct your lawyers to halt any further funding to the university and come up with a plan to take legal action against all parties threatening you. From this intriguing tale, we can take two valuable lessons about how Causal Inference played a pivotal role in two critical business scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assesing the impact on sales by adding more sugar to your products.</li>
  <li>Assessing the effects of a sugary diet on children’s health.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are more examples of causal inference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Effect of attending a data science meetup on a person’s future and earnings</li>
  <li>Air quality and free public transport</li>
  <li>Percentage of electric vehicles and air quality</li>
  <li>Impact of your campaigns (sales, marketing or support) on the revenue, profit, employees satisfaction and etc.</li>
  <li>A product or service price change on the demand</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="running-a-causal-inference-analysis">Running a causal inference analysis</h3>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/umbrellas_sun_small.png" alt="">
Looking back at our fictional story, the lawyers could raise a valid argument that association or correlation doesn’t necessarily imply causation. In simpler terms, just because there’s a correlation between high sugar consumption and an increase in the number of people with diabetes doesn’t mean that one directly causes the other. It’s another case of a spurious correlation, isn’t it? Take, for example, the high correlation between umbrellas and wet streets. Does that imply that people with umbrellas cause puddles on the streets? Of course not. It’s more likely that a common factor, in this case, a rain (or, using the technical term, a confounder), affects both variables. Now, the question is how can we estimate the impact given that there is a causal link between diabetes and a sugary diet?</p>

<p>One approach to understanding the impact of sugary snack consumption on diabetes risk would involve conducting an experiment. In this experiment, children would be randomly assigned to receive either unsweetened or sugary snacks. After a decade, we’d analyze how many children developed diabetes in each group and calculate any observed differences. If differences exist, we could confidently attribute them to causation since the random assignment eliminates biases. However, I can already see parents rolling their eyes and rightly questioning my moral values. And they’re correct - we can’t conduct cruel experiments on children or people. Secondly, it would take 10 years to figure out the difference, and thirdly, there are other biases to consider. Last but not least, it would be really expensive.</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression">Linear regression</h3>

<p>Let’s set aside for the moment the need to estimate <strong>causal</strong> impact and explore modeling the problem using linear regression. If we represent snack consumption as a binary variable (sugary or not), we can proceed as follows:</p><p>

\[diabetes_{i} = \alpha_0 + \beta * sugar_i + \varepsilon_i\]

</p><p>Now, here comes the exciting part – we can enhance our model by incorporating all the additional variables available to us. In our example, we might have access to demographic data, an individual’s activity or behavioral information. For instance, we can consider factors like how frequently and for how many hours a person exercises each week, their dietary habits, and so on.</p><p>

\[diabetes_{i} = \alpha_0 + \beta_s * sugar_i + \beta_r * race_i + \beta_g * gender_i + \beta_x * X_i  + \varepsilon_i\]

</p><p><em>\(X_i\) denotes extra variables what we might include</em></p>

<p>You might be wondering whether adding more variables to the model is a good idea, and the short answer is: it depends. When dealing with a causal question, it’s crucial to include variables known as confounders. These are variables that can influence both the treatment and the outcome. By including confounding variables, we can better isolate and estimate the true causal effect of the treatment. Failing to add or account for confounding variables may lead to incorrect estimates.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/confounder.png" alt="">
<em>Example of a confounder</em></p>

<p>Additionally, including variables that are only predictors of the outcome can be beneficial. It reduces the variance and allows for a more precise estimation of the causal effect. However, adding a variable that predicts only the treatment can lead to a less accurate estimation of causal effect. This occurs because it increases the variance, making it more challenging to estimate the causal effect accurately.</p>

<p>It is worth to emphasize, that a regression model gives an average estimate based on the given inputs. In causal inference, this outcome is referred to as the <strong>average treatment effect</strong>, \(ATE\), which provides an estimation across the entire group, rather than on an individual basis. Depending on the problem at hand, you might need to estimate an individual treatment effect. The Synthetic Control method, discussed below, allows you to assess the impact at an individual level.</p>

<h3 id="causal-graphical-models">Causal graphical models</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed the cases to consider, let’s dive into the process of deciding which variables to include and which to omit in your model. Causal graphical models, championed by Jude Pearl since the 1980s, offer an appealing approach at first glance. The fundamental concept is to construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that contains all variables in your analysis. Using this graphical representation  you can make informed decisions about which variables to retain and which to exclude.</p>

<p>In this framework, each node in the graph represents a variable, and an arrow pointing to another node signifies a causal relationship. The process of constructing this graph involves utilizing three building blocks: a pipe, a fork, and a collider, which help describe the causal flow between variables. This approach forces you to engage in a thoughtful and clarifying exploration of your model’s causal structure.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/components_small.png" alt="">
<em>From left to right: a pipe, a fork and a collider</em></p>

<p>While learning about causal graphs can be challenging, it offers substantial benefits in understanding and addressing various causal inference problems and their solutions. Some argue that this approach doesn’t scale well on a model with +20 input variables. In my experience, most of the time we start with a limited set of variables and build the derivatives of these variables. Therefore, there is an opportunity to build a structural map on the primary variables in most of the cases.</p>

<p>Additionally, to alleviate the pain and speedup process, frameworks such as DoWhy and econml have been developed. In summary, starting your modeling journey with a causal graph may indeed be a challenging task, however it is a proven framework to get a robust and insightful model.</p>

<h3 id="instrumental-variable">Instrumental Variable</h3>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/instrument_small.png" alt="">
In a nutshell, the causal graph should facilitate a solution of a causal problem. However, there many methods to tackle the problem depending what data and challenge you have at hands. Instrumental Variable (IV) method is quite unique. In theory, it seems like a magical solution — you find a variable that has a causal link to a treatment, but doesn’t impact the outcome directly, and voilà, you’ve cracked the code of causation. However, there’s a crucial requirement: the IV must remain completely unrelated to any unobservable factors. This means you need prior knowledge ensuring that the treatment and the outcome have no connections with any variables — an undertaking that can be quite challenging, if not nearly impossible, in the real world. In my experience, I haven’t come across any instances of its use, but interestingly, nearly every causal inference course dedicates a chapter to this intriguing concept.</p>

<h3 id="difference-in-differences">Difference in Differences</h3>

<p>DiD is a straightforward method that can be implemented in Excel without the need for advanced tools. The concept revolves around comparing two versions of a subject or a unit under investigation: one before a particular event or treatment and the other after. To enhance the analysis, you introduce a control group — a similar entity that remains unaffected by the treatment.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/diff-diffs.png" alt="">
<em>What are the potential effects of a young girl taking her chemistry classes seriously</em></p>

<p>Let’s consider an illustrative example: before the introduction of the free transport policy in San Diego, the average air pollution level was 10. After the policy was implemented, it decreased to 8. However, we can’t simply subtract 10 from 8, as it would yield biased results.
To address this issue, we turn to data from a neighboring city, Tijuana, located just across the border. In Tijuana, the pollution level before the policy was 11, and after its introduction, it dropped to 10. Notably, Tijuana was not affected by the policy. Applying this approach, we find that the bias reduction diminishes the impact from \(-2\) to \(-1\).</p>

<p>\(diff = (SanDiego_{after} - SanDiego_{before}) - (Tijuana_{after} - Tijuana_{before}) =\)
\((8 - 10) - (10 - 11) = -1\)</p>

<h3 id="synthetic-control">Synthetic control</h3>

<p>In our previous example, we made an assumption that the cities were similar, with the treatment being the only differing factor. Furthermore, we simplified the problem by considering only four parameters, which inevitably introduced a degree of uncertainty into our estimation. But what if we had access to a wealth of data from various units (cities in the previous example) and the ability to observe changes over time?</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/Zuckerberg_twin_small.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Enter the word of Synthetic Control. Like a magician, we build a synthetic twin for our treatment group. To do that, we take the treatment group and regress against a bunch of similar units, and with regularization, we select the most relevant features and determine their weights.</p>

<p>For instance, let’s evaluate the impact of Mark Zuckerberg having children on teenagers’ happiness in social networks. In order to construct a synthetic control group, we certainly include Bezos, Musk, and Gates, but we might also add Jon from the UK and Guiseppe from France. Never heard of the latter two? That’s precisely the point!
With this model, built from data preceding the event (Zuckerberg having children), we project the data into the future, thereby generating our imaginery future, namely counterfactuals, which gives us a way to measure the impact.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/zucker_small.png" alt="">
<em>Fictitious example</em></p>

<p>Previously, we discussed the average treatment effect, a measure that helps us estimate the overall causal impact on a treatment group. Now, with the synthetic control method, it becomes possible to estimate an individual treatment effect (in this case, the effect of Zuckerberg having children), provided that we have a sufficient amount of data to create a synthetic control.</p>

<p>Now, lets magic fade and look at disadvangates of synthetic control. The method assumes that all potential confounding variables are measured and controlled for as with linear regression. The synthetic control method assumes that the pre-treatment data accurately represent the underlying data-generating process. And on top of that, you get the standard ML problems - overfitting, difficult to validate (but not impossible) just to name few.</p>

<h3 id="double-ml">Double ML</h3>

<p>Since the ’90s, when causal inference gained popularity, the data landscape has changed significantly. More often than not, we now find ourselves dealing with enormous amounts of data for a given problem, often without a clear understanding of how all the variables interconnect. In theory, DoubleML can be helpful in such cases.</p>

<p><img src="https://dzidas.com/images/doubleml.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The DoubleML method is founded on machine learning modeling and consists of two key steps. First, we build a model \(m(X)\) that predicts the treatment variable \(T\) based on the input variables \(X\). Then, we create a separate model \(g(X)\) that predicts the outcome variable \(Y\)
using the same set of input variables \(X\). Subsequently, we calculate <strong>the residuals</strong> from the former model and regress them against <strong>the residuals</strong> from the latter model. An important feature of this method is its flexibility in accommodating non-linear models, which allows us to capture non-linear relationships — a distinctive advantage of this approach.</p><p>

\[\tilde{T}_{sugar} = T_{sugar} - m(X)\]

\[\tilde{Y}_{outcome} = Y_{outcome} - g(X)\]

\[\tilde{Y}_{outcome} = \alpha_0 + \beta_t *\tilde{T}_{sugar}\]

</p><p>Consider using DoubleML when you have high-dimensional data (many features) or when the relationships between inputs and treatment/outcome are not linear. DoubleML is particularly useful when you need to estimate treatment effects that vary across different subgroups or individuals. However, it’s essential to remember that DoubleML cannot magically eliminate the influence of poorly considered confounding variables.</p>

<p>It’s an exciting time in the Lotus 1-2-3 enthusiast community – that was a joke, there is no enthusiast community, it’s just me! 😆</p>
<p>It really is an exciting time though – that part isn’t a joke!</p>
<p>There have been some major developments in the last few weeks, and I guess that’s pretty unusual for 30 year old abandonware.</p>
<p>I’ll cut to the chase; through a combination of unlikely discoveries, crazy hacks and the 90s BBS warez scene I’ve been able to port Lotus 1-2-3 natively to Linux – an operating system that literally didn’t exist when 1-2-3 was released!<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>I really like Lotus 1-2-3, I even maintain a <a href="https://github.com/taviso/lotusdrv">driver</a> to make sure it works well on modern systems. I had to reverse engineer the driver api to make that happen, but it works beautifully.</p>
<p>Getting that driver working was quite an <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/lotus123.html">adventure</a>, but there is still one piece of the puzzle missing: add-ins. 1-2-3 was designed to be extensible with plugins (or “add-ins”) – in theory you could add support for modern spreadsheet functions or integrate with Google Finance or something!</p>
<p>The problem is add-ins had to be written in a special language called LPL, and unfortunately the compiler and SDK have been lost. This is not really surprising, this was a niche product and Lotus didn’t just give the SDK away – they charged $395 for it. I can’t imagine many people have a copy just lying around.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_OEk1QOJYw0C&amp;lpg=PT115&amp;vq=toolkit&amp;pg=PT115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><img src="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/img/pc-mag-toolkit.png" alt="Lotus Toolkit Review"></a></p>
<p>There were lots of commercial plugins available in the heyday, some were really <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/files/pcmag-apr1991-perfect-spreadsheet.pdf">impressive</a>. I emailed a few developers who worked on some to see if they had any old backups, the answer was always the same – 1-2-3 was the biggest name in software, nobody thought it was going anywhere, so why would they keep backups?</p>
<p>There were also two third-party books written about LPL, I managed to track them down from old libraries. I like the cover on this one, very serious business. It’s so frustating, I can see screenshots of the debugger, compiler output and sample add-ins - but just can’t do anything with it without the SDK!</p>

<p>Fast forward a year or two, and I found someone who used to be a sysop in the ’90s BBS scene. Check out his <a href="https://scenelist.org/">website</a>, he still has a catalogue of NFOs and a telnet BBS online if you want to see some rad ANSI art!</p>
<p>He had kept tape backups from old BBS systems, and was able to recover a warez copy of the SDK – unbelievable! It actually worked, I was able to build a few sample plugins!</p>

<p>This would already have been enough to keep me entertained for a while, but it doesn’t stop there. It turns out that the BBS also had a warez copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX. This was widely thought to be lost – I’m told it couldn’t compete with a more popular UNIX office suite called SCO Professional, so there were not many copies sold.</p>
<p>I didn’t really have any use for it, but I’m definitely curious enough to poke around on the installation media to see what’s in it!</p>

<h2>A Mystery File</h2>
<p>While poking around, this one directory caught my eye, what exactly is this?</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l
total 2.0M
-rw-r--r-- 1 taviso taviso 1.2M May 20 13:53 123.o.z_1
-rw-r--r-- 1 taviso taviso 717K May 20 13:53 123.o.z_2
-rw------- 1 taviso taviso  913 May 20 13:53 dl_init.o.z
-rwx------ 1 taviso taviso  77K May 20 13:53 ld.z*
-rwx------ 1 taviso taviso  14K May 20 13:53 mkdlobj.z*
-rw------- 1 taviso taviso  649 May 20 13:53 stub.o
-rw------- 1 taviso taviso  328 May 20 13:53 tail.o
-rw-r--r-- 1 taviso taviso 1.4K May 20 13:53 wyse50-lts123</code></pre>
<p>That <code>123.o</code> file is huge, even compressed it had to be split across two disks. Let’s take a closer look…</p>
<pre><code>$ cat 123.o.z_? | gzip -d &gt; 123.o
$ file 123.o
123.o: Intel 80386 COFF object file, not stripped, 5 sections, symbol offset=0x1efbdc, 19755 symbols, optional header size 28</code></pre>
<p>Yikes - it’s an original unstripped object file from 1-2-3. There are nearly 20,000 symbols including private symbols and debug information.</p>
<p>Why would Lotus ship this? It’s so big it must have required them to phyiscally ship an extra disk to every customer? Could it have been a mistake, accidentally left on the final release image?</p>
<p>I had so many questions, but I’m not old enough to have any experience with SysV, so I asked the greybeards on <a href="news:alt.folklore.computers">alt.folklore.computers</a> if they had seen this before and why this might have happened.</p>
<p>The answer was that this is probably deliberate - <code>dlopen()</code> was not widely available on UNIX in the early 90s, so there was no easy way to load native plugins or extensions. To solve this, vendors would ship a bunch of <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.38/ld/Options.html#:~:text=This%20is%20often%20called%20partial%20linking.">partially linked</a> object files with a script to relink them with your extensions – Clever!</p>
<section id="hacking">
<h2>Hacking</h2>
<p>I can’t tell you how useful this discovery was – the debug information answered so many questions I had about Lotus 1-2-3 internals! This was a direct source port from DOS, so it mostly worked the same way but now I had debugging data. For example, I really wanted to hook into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation">rasterizer</a> in my driver so that I could improve the appearance of graphs in the terminal… but it was just too complex to understand without documentation.</p>
<p>I now know that the rasterizer dynamically generates little bytecode programs that that are interpreted by the graphics engine. Now that I know what the opcodes are I can <a href="https://github.com/taviso/lotusdrv/blob/master/raster.c#L62">disassemble</a> and change them in my driver to improve the output!</p>
</section>
<section id="gnu-objcopy">
<h2>GNU objcopy</h2>
<p>Okay… but there is one more big question, I know that <code>objcopy</code> can convert COFF object files to ELF, the format used by Linux. It seems like a long shot, but is it possible I could link this into a native Linux program? 🐧</p>
<pre><code>$ objcopy -I coff-i386 -O elf32-i386 123.o 123elf.o
$ file 123elf.o
123elf.o: ELF 32-bit LSB relocatable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped</code></pre>
<p>Hilariously, the first version of Linux hadn’t even been released when this object file was compiled – but I think this is possible! If you want to hear about the technical challenges, read on!</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -p 123.o  | grep Date
Time/Date               Sat Sep  8 06:23:50 1990</code></pre>

<section id="porting-problems">
<h2>Porting Problems</h2>
<section id="system-calls">
<h2>System Calls</h2>
<p>The first problem is that Linux and UNIX do not use a compatible system call interface. UNIX uses the lcall7 interface, so we need to find those calls and fix them up. Here is how this object file calls <code>open()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -M intel --disassemble=open 123elf.o

123elf.o:     file format elf32-i386


Disassembly of section .text:

000e20d4 &lt;open&gt;:
   e20d4:   b8 05 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x5
   e20d9:   9a 00 00 00 00 07 00    call   0x7:0x0
   e20e0:   0f 82 c6 01 00 00       jb     e22ac &lt;_cerror&gt;
   e20e6:   c3                      ret    
   e20e7:   90                      nop</code></pre>
<p>That <code>call</code> instruction is what’s known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callgate">callgate</a>, which isn’t supported on Linux<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, it will just crash. I want to remove this and route all calls through glibc instead. My first thought was just to mark these symbols as undefined, and then let the linker fix that up by importing a replacement symbol from glibc.</p>
<section id="relocations">
<h3>Relocations</h3>
<p>Nothing is ever easy, it turns out that won’t work! If we try, <code>objcopy</code> will simply refuse:</p>
<pre><code>$ objcopy -I coff-i386 -O elf32-i386 --strip-symbol open 123.o 123elf.o
objcopy: not stripping symbol `open' because it is named in a relocation</code></pre>
<p>What is <code>objcopy</code> trying to tell us here?</p>
<p>This is a relocatable object file, which simply means it can be loaded at any address and still work. That’s possible because it contains all the necessary information – the relocations – to adjust it.</p>
<p>Relocations are really simple, the compiler just records the name of the symbol and the references to it. Now the linker can just walk through and patch each reference to point to the new location – easy.</p>
<p>So <code>objcopy</code> is saying that you can’t remove this symbol, because the linker won’t know what to patch in when it moves it. Fair enough – <strong>but</strong>, just because objcopy won’t do it doesn’t mean it’s impossible! We <em>could</em> just fix the relocations too, right?</p>
<p>I don’t know of any tool that can do that, but COFF is not a <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/coff/">complicated format</a> – I’ll write one!</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://github.com/taviso/123elf/blob/main/coffsyrup.c">coffsyrup</a>, a tiny little tool that will remove those pesky COFF symbols even if objcopy refuses!</p>
<pre><code>$ coffsyrup 123.o 123new.o open
MATCH open
RELOC rel open @0x180fa ~0xc9ede
RELOC rel open @0x4c9a1 ~0x95637
RELOC rel open @0x4d348 ~0x94c90
RELOC rel open @0x4ec13 ~0x933c5
</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="incompatible-functions">
<h3>Incompatible Functions</h3>
<p>Now that we can reroute functions, we have to worry about incompatible functions.</p>
<p>Lots of standard UNIX functions are <em>source</em> but not <em>binary</em> compatible, this is because nobody promises that structures are the same size or layout across UNIX versions. The obvious example is <code>struct stat</code>.</p>
<p>For example, this code is likely to work on any UNIX-like system you can compile it on:</p>

<p>However, the resulting object file is <em>not</em> likely to work on any other system. That’s because the size of <code>struct stat</code> and the offset of <code>st_size</code> will be different – it will probably just corrupt your stack and crash!</p>
<p>Luckily there are not really that many functions like this in UNIX. In fact, the number is small enough that I can probably write wrappers to translate them. The important ones are <code>stat()</code>, <code>times()</code>, <code>uname()</code>, <code>fcntl()</code>, <code>ioctl()</code> and so on.</p>
<p>All I have to do is rename those symbols with <code>objcopy</code>, then mark them undefined with <code>coffsyrup</code>. Now I can write a little wrapper that translates a Linux <code>struct stat</code> to a UNIX <code>struct stat</code> and it should work!</p>
</section>
<section id="termios">
<h3>Termios</h3>
<p>Well…I said “little” wrappers – but there are some big incompatabilities in places. One big nightmare was <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/termios">termios</a>. Go ahead and take a look at the <code>termios(3)</code> man page, pretty complex right? Well, everything here works differently in subtle, incompatible, and difficult to debug ways on every UNIX system.</p>

<section id="licensing">
<h3>Licensing</h3>

<p>Incredibly, after a bunch of hacking it actually runs without crashing!</p>

</figure>
<p>…and refuses to work without a license, damn! Well, I am a legitimate licensed 1-2-3 owner with a boxed copy of 1-2-3, and this is 32 year old abandonware. I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a> will forgive me for bypassing this check.</p>
<p>I can see from breaking on <code>exit()</code> that there is an internal symbol called <code>lic_init()</code> responsible for checking for a valid license. I looked at the code in IDA, and figured out the logic.</p>
<p>It is simply looking for a file called <code>LICENSE.000</code>, which contains an expiry date, username and systemname. If that all matches what the system reports, the check passes! 🏴‍☠️</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, Lotus 1-2-3 has been ported to a new operating system. There are a few kinks that need to be ironed out, and I need to port over my terminal driver, but it is 100% usable. At the moment, the DOS version running under emulation looks better - but this can be fixed!</p>

<p>The ISP was held liable for infringing 1,403 copyrighted songs, as it failed to terminate persistent pirates’ internet access.</p>
<p>District Court Judge David Ezra confirmed the judgment in January. This prompted the ISP <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/isp-grande-wants-judge-to-overrule-jurys-47-million-piracy-liability-verdict-230304/">to request</a> a do-over but that motion was ultimately declined. As a result, Grande took the matter to the appeals court.</p>
<h2>Grande Appeals</h2>
<p>Last month, Grande filed its opening brief in which it again argued that the lower court reached the wrong conclusion. Internet providers shouldn’t be held liable for pirating customers based on third-party allegations, the company argues. </p>
<p>“This appeal presents important questions of first impression in this Circuit about whether, and in what circumstances, an internet service provider may be held secondarily liable for the conduct of users of its service,” the ISP writes. </p>
<p>The ISP believes that it shouldn’t have to terminate Internet access this easily. This view is bolstered by a recent Supreme Court decision in favor of Twitter and other social media platforms, which held that they’re not liable for terrorist messages. </p>
<p>Grande is not alone in this appeal. The company is supported by several telecoms organizations, through a joint amicus curiae brief submitted by broadband association <a href="https://www.ustelecom.org/">USTelecom</a> and the <a href="https://www.ctia.org/">the CTIA</a>, which represents wireless providers.</p>
<h2>Terminating Internet Access a Basic Measure?</h2>
<p>According to Grande, the District Court went too far when it informed the jury that a provider can be found liable for contributory infringement if it didn’t take “basic measures” to terminate accounts of repeat infringers. According to Grande, this strong language lacks nuance.</p>
<p>The ISP notes that the ‘basic measures’ theory first emerged more than two decades ago in the Napster lawsuit. In that case, however, Napster failed to remove pirated tracks from its servers, while ISPs only pass on bits and bytes.</p>
<p>“The ‘simple measures’ or ‘basic measures’ theory has its roots in the Labels’ case against Napster. […] Before filing suit, the Labels notified Napster of specific infringing files available on Napster’s service, but Napster declined to remove them.”</p>
<p>The common feature of these cases is that the ‘simple measures’ standard has only been applied to defendants who directly control online content. That is because those defendants can readily remove or disable access to specific infringing content.</p>

<p>The amici support this argument while going into more detail on how Internet terminations can affect the public. They believe that Internet terminations should not be taken lightly. </p>

<p>USTelecom and CTIA point out that terminating Internet access can have a negative impact beyond the alleged wrongdoers. It could impact entire households, coffee shops, offices, schools, libraries, or hospitals. That doesn’t qualify as a “basic measure”.</p>
<p>“Termination thus prevents everyone — in a household, coffee shop, office, school, library, or hospital — who relies on a shared internet connection from using the internet for any purpose, whether remote work, accessing educational or health resources, seeking news or other information, or for entertainment.</p>
<p>“It is instead a drastic and overbroad remedy, with severe consequences for non-infringers. Yet the district court’s approach could compel internet service providers to engage in wide-scale terminations to avoid facing crippling damages, like the $1 billion judgment entered against Cox Communications,” the amici add. </p>
<p>These terminations take place with no judicial oversight and run contrary to the initiatives of lawmakers, who freed up billions of dollars to invest in American broadband infrastructure.</p>
<p>“It would also create massive disincentives for providers to invest in the new broadband networks that Congress recognizes are needed to close the digital divide,” the telecoms groups note. </p>
<h2>Supreme Court’s Terrorist Ruling</h2>
<p>Grande’s appeal also draws heavily on the aforementioned Twitter vs. Taamneh ruling, in which the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that the social media platforms aren’t liable for ISIS terrorists, who used their services to recruit and raise funds.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court rejected the claim that Twitter and others aided and abetted terrorist activity, because it didn’t “consciously and culpably” participate in the illegal activity. According to Grande, Internet providers are even further distanced from any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“The pleaded allegations in Twitter are illuminating. There, the plaintiffs alleged that Twitter, Facebook, and Google allowed ISIS to upload videos and messages for public display, and that they actively delivered ISIS’s posts to other users based on those users’ information and use history. </p>
<p>“The social media companies failed to remove known ISIS accounts, instead letting ISIS benefit from the companies’ recommendation algorithms…”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the social media companies didn’t engage in purposeful, culpable conduct. Instead, they simply offered their “infrastructure” to the parties. In addition, the Supreme Court suggested that ISPs are even further removed. </p>
<p>“[W]e generally do not think that internet or cell service providers incur culpability merely for providing their services to the public writ large,” the Supreme Court wrote. </p>

<p>The telecoms groups bring up the same case and stress that the Supreme Court ruling suggests that it was an error by the court to hold Grande liable for pirating subscribers. As such, the appeal court should overturn it. </p>
<p>Needless to say, the music companies will have a different take on the matter. They also made this clear when <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/music-pirates-are-not-terrorists-record-labels-argue-in-court-230602/">Cox brought up the Twitter ruling</a> a few weeks ago and will likely do the same here. </p>

It gets pushed by journalists because contrarian “doctors are wrong” takes are very popular, especially when they tell people what they want to hear.</p><p>The issue with flossing is that it’s hard to rigorously study over the duration needed to provide significant results. You also can’t really construct a study where you ask one cohort to not study for a couple decades to see if they do worse, because that has ethical concerns. So we’re left with self-reported flossing activity retrospectives. The problem with those is that people who floss tend to have better hygiene and self-care overall, so now we can’t isolate flossing as the reason for better dental health over a lifetime.</p><p>&gt; In the studies that do show flossing helps against cavities they are about professional flossing and not self flossing.</p><p>This is an example of what I’m talking about: There are studies out there that show positive benefits of flossing, but if you find someone aggressively searching for reasons to discredit flossing then they’ll always find a reason to dismiss the evidence. When the goal becomes to be contrarian or to disprove something, you can always find a reason to dismiss the studies.

My theory is that the gums can regenerate and regain attachment loss but only in the right conditions -&gt; in practice that would mean that they are not inflamed, and clean underneath the gum line (you can do that by flossing and getting a deep cleaning at a dentist if you need one), as well as doing your best to eliminate harmful bacteria that turn into calculus, and having a healthy diet.</p><p>The trickiest part is probably selectively eliminating the bad bacteria while retaining the good ones The mouth is full of both  and mouthwashes like Listarine, or any Alcohol based ones are sledgehammers. Some washes are too harsh on the tissue itself too which I imagine impairs healing of any kind.

My hygienist seemed happy about it. I like the fact that it's not overwhelmingly minty like most American toothpastes and doesn't foam up too much. I think if I manage to avoid needing new fillings or a redo for 6-7 years (about the frequency at which I need one) I would consider it a good switch.

  <p>This website is my answer to the question: “If I were an English speaker trying to get an idea of how Italian poetry sounds, what tool would I like to have?”</p>
<p>Well, I would like first of all to hear the poems recited out loud. Then I’d like an easy way to go back and forth between English and Italian without opening a dictionary. Also useful: some context on the choice of vocabulary, and maybe a guide to the most salient technical aspects of the Italian language.<br>
Please check the <a href="https://italianpoetry.it/guide/">guide</a> to see how all this is implemented.</p>
<p>There will be no literary criticism, for the most part, nor structured lessons in the history of Italian Literature besides some nuggets now and then. One can certainly find several resources that are better than whatever I could possibly write.</p>
<p>You may profit from <a href="https://italianpoetry.it/italian/">some information about the Italian
language</a>. In any case, feel free to read up on <a href="https://italianpoetry.it/about/">the rationale
and disclaimer</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/cloudflare-sippy-migrate-s3/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/10/cloudflare-sippy-migrate-s3/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37888135">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Cloudflare recently announced the<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sippy-incremental-migration-s3-r2/"> open beta of Sippy</a>, an incremental data migration service that copies data from Amazon S3 to Cloudflare R2 only the first time the data is requested. Sippy is designed to minimize migration-specific egress fees by leveraging requests within existing application flows while simultaneously copying objects to R2.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Cloudflare announced <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/11/cloudflare-r2-super-slurper/">Super Slurper</a>, a data migration tool to copy large amounts of data from other object storage providers to Cloudflare R2. The new option targets scenarios where developers want to move only accessed data. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipdjones/">Phillip Jones</a>, senior product manager at Cloudflare, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-krasnov-2a00a666/">Vlad Krasnov</a>, principal system engineer at Cloudflare, explain the benefits of Sippy over the existing Super Slurper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Super Slurper is perfect for cases where you want to move all of your data to R2 at once, there are scenarios where you may want to migrate your data incrementally over time. Maybe you want to avoid the one-time upfront AWS data transfer bill? Or perhaps you have legacy data that may never be accessed, and you only want to migrate what’s required?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new option acts as a middle layer between the client and the source object storage: when an object is requested from Workers, S3 API, or a public bucket, it is served from <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2">Cloudflare R2</a> if it is found. If not, the object will be returned from the source S3 bucket and copied simultaneously to R2. All other operations on R2, including put and delete, continue to work. Jones and Krasnov add:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of addressing vendor lock-in, Sippy makes stressful, time-consuming migrations a thing of the past. All you need to do is replace the S3 endpoint in your application or attach your domain to your new R2 bucket and data will start getting copied over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-migration/sippy/">documentation</a> shows how to enable Sippy for an existing R2 bucket with <em>cURL</em>:</p>

<pre><code>curl -X PUT https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets/{bucket_name}/sippy \
--header "Authorization: Bearer &lt;API_TOKEN&gt;" \
--data '{"provider": "AWS", "bucket": "&lt;AWS_BUCKET_NAME&gt;", "zone": "&lt;AWS_REGION&gt;","key_id": "&lt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;", "access_key":"&lt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;", "r2_key_id": "&lt;R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;", "r2_access_key": "&lt;R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;"}'</code></pre>

<p>Cloudflare plans on making incremental migration configurable from the dashboard and providing analytics showing the progress of the migration and how much has been saved on egress fees for objects that have been copied over.</p>

<p>Sippy is currently in open beta and supports only Amazon S3 as a migration source.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/14/nvidia-skips-return-to-office-sticks-to-remote-work-among-hottest-tech-companies/">https://fortune.com/2023/10/14/nvidia-skips-return-to-office-sticks-to-remote-work-among-hottest-tech-companies/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37887570">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Few if any companies have been hotter this year than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="">Nvidia</a>. Amid the boom in artificial intelligence, its high-powered chips are clamored over by the likes of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a>, Meta, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="">Google</a>.</p><div>



<p>Yet while those companies and many others have issued return-to-office mandates, Nvidia, which has about 26,000 employees worldwide and a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-stock-market-cap-trillion-dollars/" target="_self" rel="">valuation of over $1 trillion</a>, is bucking the trend and putting no pressure on remote workers to commute to cubicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2020, Huang said he had “no trouble with” letting employees work out of the their home indefinitely. “There’s no question we’re going to do this,” he <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-the-metaverse-working-from-home-permanently-and-raises-for-workers/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> VentureBeat at the time.</p>



<p>Today the California-based company is sticking with the policy while also offering employees luxurious office spaces (see below) in which to gather and collaborate. Nvidia leaves it up to workers whether they work at home, in a cafe, or in the office. It views the arrangement “as a way for employees to balance their personal and work obligations, while preparing for the future, so they can focus on doing their life’s work,” Beau Davidson, vice president of employee experience, <a href="https://commercialobserver.com/2023/10/nvidia-ai-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> <em>Commercial Observer.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<div><p><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=320&amp;q=75 320w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=480&amp;q=75 480w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=576&amp;q=75 576w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=75 1280w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1258974160-e1697311256291.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption>Employees inside the Voyager building at Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California, US, on Monday, June 5, 2023. </figcaption><p>Marlena Sloss/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div>



<p>In contrast, other companies have grown increasingly strident about employees working more in the office. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">warned employees</a> that “it’s probably not going to work out for you” if they continued to ignore a return-to-office mandate. That followed an earlier <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/04/amazon-unfazed-remote-workers-protest-return-to-office-mandate/" target="_self" rel="">employee walkout</a> protesting the policy, where one worker leading the charge insisted, “We can be productive, customer obsessed, we can do our good work, we can make a difference, and it does not have to be in an office building.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia’s Huang would seem to agree with that sentiment. However employees prefer to mix their work settings, “I’m perfectly comfortable with all that,” he told VentureBeat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike other CEOs, however, he’s sticking with the policy. A few years ago, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted, “We are going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale, with a thoughtful and responsible plan for how to do this.” He estimated that about half of the company’s employees would be working remotely within the next five to 10 years. Fast-forward to today and his employees must be back in the office three days a week, with their presence tracked by card keys and other tools. Those failing to comply risk being fired or taking a hit on performance reviews.</p>



<p>Yet Meta workers returning to the office have reportedly struggled to book conference rooms or even find a desk that they can use for a full day. Adam Mosseri, head of Meta’s <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" target="_blank" rel="">Instagram</a>, wrote on Threads, “We have not yet figured out hybrid work.” Meanwhile Zuckerberg<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/30/meta-return-to-office-mess-remote-work-crackdown-hybrid-work/" target="_self" rel=""> touted cutting-edge metaverse</a> headsets, saying on the <em>Lex Fridman Podcast</em>, “I think this gets us a lot closer to being able to work physically in different places…I think we’re not there today with just video conferencing and the basic technologies that we have.”</p>



<p>Other firms are resorting to preferential treatment to get employees back in the office. Of more than 400 U.S. CEOs surveyed by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/kpmg/" target="_blank" rel="">KPMG</a>, 90% said they <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/06/ceos-return-office-bribe-raises-promotions/" target="_self" rel="">would reward those</a> who work in person with favorable assignments, raises, and promotions.</p>



<p>But Rob Sadow, CEO of Scoop Technologies, maker of a hybrid-office productivity app, believes many company leaders are clinging to the past. “Sometimes that desire to return to office comes more out of fear and desire to repeat past experience than it is around optimizing for what the future is going to look like,” he told the <em>Observer</em>.</p>



<p>Another company bucking the return-to-office trend <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/12/atlassian-rto-hybrid-work-real-estate-office/" target="_self" rel="">is the software giant Atlassian</a>, which makes collaboration tools such as Jira.</p>



<p>“We expect people to be able to work from home, from a café, from an office, but we don’t really care where they do their work—what we care about is the output that they produce,” co-CEO Scott Farquhar <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/atlassian-ceo-scott-farquhar-office-once-a-quarter-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> Australia’s <em>60 Minutes</em> program in August, adding, “I might come into the office about once a quarter.”</p>



<p>The company still has ambitious plans for new offices, including in Seattle and Sydney, where it’s broken ground on a 40-story <a href="https://www.shoparc.com/projects/atlassian-hq/" target="_self" rel="">headquarters</a> featuring lush interiors and spaces designed with employee gatherings in mind. It now evaluates its real estate strategy not by card swipes, but with metrics such as cost per visit and the degree to which employees utilize an office and engage within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Nvidia’s latest headquarters addition, an airy, jaw-dropping 750,000-square-foot structure dubbed <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/nvidias-massive-techno-palace-may-have-you-questioning-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">Voyager</a> (see above), rejects boxy structures, emphasizing instead communal spaces and views for everyone.</p>



<p>Sadow believes that by letting workers choose between working remotely or collaborating in cutting-edge office space, Nvidia gains a “pretty meaningful talent advantage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed that advantage could help it attract employees alienated by harsh return-to-office mandates elsewhere. In a recent survey by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/deloitte/" target="_blank" rel="">Deloitte</a> and Workplace Intelligence, two-third of executives said they’d likely quit if forced back to the office five days a week. The report warned that companies forcing employees back to cubicles “run the risk of losing their pipeline of leaders and have difficulty recruiting fresh talent.”</p>



<p>That’s one risk Nvidia, it would appear, doesn’t need to worry about too much.</p></div><p><em>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</em></p></div>]]></description>

    <p>Google has plunged the internet into a “spiral of decline”, the co-founder of the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) lab has claimed.</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/06/deepminds-founder-leaves-britains-brightest-ai-lab-really-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mustafa Suleyman</a>, the British entrepreneur who co-founded DeepMind, said: “The business model that Google had broke the internet.”</p><p>He said search results had become plagued with “clickbait” to keep people “addicted and absorbed on the page as long as possible”.</p><p>Information online is “buried at the bottom of a lot of verbiage and guff”, Mr Suleyman argued, so websites can “sell more adverts”, fuelled by Google’s technology.</p><p>Mr Suleyman was one of three people who set up pioneering AI lab DeepMind in London 2010. The company was bought by Google for £400m and it has become the cornerstone of the search giant’s AI operations.</p><p>Mr Suleyman, 39, quit Google 18 months ago and has since set up a rival venture, Inflection AI. The company is developing a conversational chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, amid a race by AI companies to usurp Google’s dominance of the web.</p><p>The entrepreneur has developed a chatbot called Pi, which he says can act as a kind of AI confidante or coach. He has raised more than $1.5bn for the new technology.</p><p>The criticism of his former employer came as Mr Suleyman told the Telegraph about plans for a new international body to monitor AI threats.</p><p>Mr Suleyman, along with billionaire former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, plan to present proposals for an International Panel on AI Safety at Prime Minister <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/23/artificial-intelligence-safety-summit-sunak-ai-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rishi Sunak’s global summit</a> on the technology next month.&nbsp;</p><p>The DeepMind co-founder said the panel could be “modelled on the IPCC” – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – to “establish the scientific consensus around the current capabilities” of AI.</p><p>Mr Suleyman said the IPCC, which was first set up in 1988, was a “good inspiration” for establishing a “rigorous body” for making predictions about AI risks. Other backers of the plan include Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn founder, and Florentino Cuéllar, president of the Carnegie think tank.</p><p>The AI panel would provide governments with regular assessments on the level of danger posed by the technology.</p><p>The UK’s AI Safety Summit is due to take place at Bletchley Park and is expected to gather world leaders and tech entrepreneurs to address the challenges of “frontier AI” that might cause “significant harm, including the loss of life”.</p><p>The two-day summit on Nov 1 and 2 is expected to be attended by top lobbyists from the likes of Meta and Google. Kamala Harris, the US vice president, is expected to attend, while a Chinese delegation has been invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The leaders will try to find common ground on tackling AI risks. Officials are also understood to be considering setting up an international institute for AI safety.</p>

    <p>Michelle Donelan, the technology secretary, told the Telegraph the&nbsp;conference would “consider the biggest risks and biggest opportunities that come from frontier AI”, bringing together “companies, countries and also experts”.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/23/chatgpt-sam-altman-ai-regulation-risk-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concern about the technology</a> has been sparked by the overnight success of ChatGPT, which was seen as a wake-up call for world leaders about the speed at which the technology was being developed.&nbsp;</p><p>A new wave of chatbots, built on so-called “large language models”, can answer questions and have online conversations in an almost uncannily human way. They can write emails, essays, poetry or music, prompting concerns they could create upheaval in the jobs market.</p><p>Writing in his recent book, The Coming Wave, Mr Suleyman called for a “containment” of high-risk AI advances, so governments can get ahead of developments that may threaten jobs, elections and human life.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Suleyman said chatbots could “take on Google” by providing more accurate information than internet search.</p><p>However, despite recent advances, many chatbots suffer from errors and in some cases may make up false information, creating a hurdle to taking on search engines.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/02/13/google-microsofts-ai-bots-will-pollute-internet-digital-effluence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google is also developing</a> a rival AI chatbot project, called Bard.&nbsp;</p><p>Google was approached for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile on Saturday, the Government confirmed 100 winners of £5m in grant funding for AI start-ups, including a business tackling clothing waste and a company finding a use for the technology in vineyards.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Donelan also announced a further £32m in grant funding for high-growth businesses using AI, to be confirmed after the UK summit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">

                                                                                                
                
<p><span><span>I</span> have a dirty secret. When some of our friends at church nod in approval upon hearing that we haven’t got a proper television, I am happy to let them think that this is largely because we want to protect our children from all the woke nonsense in cartoons. We go to one of those scary parishes where the old Latin Mass is said twice on Sundays, and I must say the sexual proclivities of </span><i><span>Dora the Explorer </span></i><span>are a major topic of concern.</span></p>
<p><span>Our friends have a point. There is a lot of this stuff going around, and you have to wonder whether even the most progressive parents really believe their kids need to learn whether in addition to being blue and wearing a diaper, Gonzo in </span><i><span>Muppet Babies</span></i><span> is gender-queer. (Do Muppets in fact have sex? Inquiring minds don’t in fact want to know.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But in our case the objections are aesthetic as much as anything else. I have always admired the artistry of traditional hand-drawn animation, and the CGI you see on TV (usually farmed out to digital sweatshops in Asia) is even uglier than the top-shelf Disney/Pixar version. The color palette is unimaginably garish, a lot of neon fuschias, turquoises, and oranges, plus a distinct shade of cyan that looks like radioactive Mountain Dew. (Thank goodness the backgrounds are always empty.)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>In a typical episode the Paw Patrol send an entire fleet of vehicles to an attempted misdemeanor</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Then there is the sheer inanity of the dialogue, characters, and situations. When I was a child, Doug Funny was subjected to various ethical dilemmas, and even the Ninja Turtles of blessed memory had quarrels and existential crises — I recall Michaelangelo once seeking hypnotherapy for his pizza addiction — in between fighting some genuinely frightening baddies. These days we have </span><i><span>Super Truck</span></i><span>. Have you heard of </span><i><span>Super Truck</span></i><span>? It’s a quite popular show about a truck. Our three-year-old, quite perceptively, calls it “Stupid Truck.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite my best efforts, the kids have managed to see a lot of these shows, mostly at grandparents’ houses. The worst one, worse than </span><i><span>Daniel Tiger</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>PJ Masks</span></i><span> or even </span><i><span>My Little Pony</span></i><span> (which is the subject of a pedophile cult in these United States) is </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>. This program centers around a group of talking dogs who work for various emergency services: Chase is the cop, Marshall the fireman (or rather firepup), Skye the helicopter pilot, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, emergency services seem to be the only thing going on in this horrifying world. Every episode revolves around some poor citizen finding himself on the wrong side of the law or the victim of an alleged natural disaster or public health crisis. In a typical episode, the Paw Patrol send an entire fleet of vehicles — cars, trucks, boats, aeroplanes, submarines, and even, insanely, a recycling van — to respond to an attempted misdemeanor or a minor traffic accident.</span></p>
<p><span>All of this activity is carried out under the aegis of one Mayor Goodway. She is very much a ruler in the Nero fiddling or Elagabalus line, a deranged eccentric who collects chickens (curiously enough, they cannot speak in this universe otherwise full of anthropomorphic animals) and seems totally uninterested in the actual well-being of her subjects, much less the material and other costs of maintaining a rather large police force. (I say “subjects” rather than “citizens” because as far as I can tell, there is no evidence of elections ever being carried out.)</span></p>
<p><i><span>Paw Patrol </span></i><span>is Giorgio Agamben’s nightmare, a country in which a permanent state of emergency exists, under which governments have limitless power to rule unilaterally. There is no society or even commerce in </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>, only the relentless unthinking force of the police state, ostensibly responding to a never-ending crisis. It is the most influential work of fascist art since Ezra Pound.</span></p>
<p><span>Worse still than the omnidirectional sense of faux-crisis is the depiction of the offenders on the receiving end of the Paw Patrol’s mob justice. The Ruff-Ruff Pack, collar-less and dirty, are clearly working class dogs; no attempt is ever made to reform or otherwise induce them to behave better. It’s as if they exist to be brutalised. (One thinks of those lines of Auden: “Somebody chose their pain, / What needn’t have happened did.”)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I like to imagine that somewhere in Adventure Bay there is some sort of resistance movement</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>But perhaps the oddest thing of all is the fact that apart from the pups, the dictator Goodway, and the handful of people whom they routinely assault, the island seems somewhat sparsely populated. I like to imagine that somewhere in Adventure Bay there is some sort of resistance movement, a faction of poets and religious types opposed to the mayor’s tyrannical regime. Which is when it occurs to me: </span><i><span>they’re all freaking dead, aren’t they? Or maybe we are talking about a gulag situation. Where else is all the production happening? There are no visible factories, but someone has to build all the machines and tools and perform the necessary agricultural work to keep the mayor’s chickens fed.</span></i></p>
<p><span>All of this no doubt is taking a bunch of magenta pixels too seriously. Maybe. I can’t help but think that in addition to their deleterious effect on children’s imaginations, shows like </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span> are a serious political threat. I hate to go all Frankfurt School in a light column like this one, but it is always worrying when citizens of a democratic society are taught to worship the police, to accept so-called “states of exception” without question, and to delight in the machinery of punishment. This is the reason that, growing up in the 1990s, I always hated</span><i><span> Cops</span></i><span>, my love of moustaches and aviator sunglasses notwithstanding. Somehow I always wanted the guy in the wife beater shirt (invariably removed during the course of the episode for reasons that were always mysterious) with the 40 ounce bottle of malt liquor and the cigarette to get away. Like the supposed villains in </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>, he never did.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Meta-Note: I’m sorry it’s been so long between articles; for better or worse writing here is something that I do for fun, and sometimes work and family get in the way. In this case, I was spending a lot of time trying to learn SQL; you will be pleased to note I am now able to pad my resume with “Intermediate Database Language Skills” with the best of them.</strong></p><p>A few years back, my wife was at a baby shower hosted by a friend by a mutual acquaintance. In a conversation with the hostess, my wife learned they were in a tough financial position - they were always broke, and no amount of budgeting seemed to help them get ahead; they had cut every cost they could and things were just getting worse and worse. She admitted to my wife that she just felt like she was sinking further and further underwater, and didn’t see any way out for her or her family.</p><p>Note: The hostess and her husband were both doctors. They had a combined income somewhere upwards of $200,000 a year, and as the conversation developed my wife learned that their problems started and stopped with the hostess not being able to save quite as much as she’d like once the payments on their very nice house and current-year cars were made. At the time she leaned on my wife for emotional support over finances, our family of four’s income was less than $30,000 a year.</p><p>You should know the hostess wasn’t mean-spirited in the least, and we liked her then and continue to do so. But she did have a kind of tunnel vision I’ve since noticed is increasingly common: If you came from a family that did pretty well financially, went to college and then immediately started to do pretty well yourself, it’s hard to get any kind of context for what life is like at lower income levels. This isn’t a matter of the relatively-wealthy being dumb or insensitive; it’s just legitimately difficult to get a handle on what it’s like in a life you’ve never lived, and often being legitimately confused as to why anyone would opt to make less money instead of improving their lot with training and education.</p><p>In that spirit, I’d like to offer my services as a sort of has-been-poor guide, to fill you in on what it’s like on the other side of the tracks. In this role, I’m qualified in two ways. The first is common - we’ve never done exceptionally well financially. Things have been better in recent years as I’ve finally clawed towards the upper-end of lower-class, but Covid has reminded us how short-lived that kind of qualified success can be. We’ve had to economize in dozens of interesting ways, make hard choices here and there and sometimes/often do entirely without. It hasn’t been easy.</p><p><span>At the same time, I’m mostly </span><em>happy.</em><span> I have a wonderful wife who is very satisfying to be near, two kids who are about as custom-fit to my personality as possible, and dozens of friends online and off who would take a bullet for me, and vice versa. This is important because I want you to know I’m not trying to make you feel bad - I know and understand that everyone has a different set of problems, and that I’m not unique in living in an imperfect world. I’m not trying to exaggerate problems for political points or to try to get legislation passed. Take no guilt from this article - It’s informational, not a call to arms.</span></p><p>One of the bigger disconnects I run into in talking to people at or above living wage levels of income is that it’s usually assumed that the quality of things has a pretty linear association to the price. This is true at most price points, from “doing OK” all the way up to “Jeff Bezos” - if you pay a little more, you get a little more. If you pay a little less, you get a little less.</p><p><span>Because this relationship is what you’d expect, you get a lot of reasonable-sounding advice that, while not exactly wrong, fails to capture the nuance of poor-people-price-mechanics very well. According to this randomly selected article, </span><a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-much-should-i-spend-on-rent#:~:text=While%20everyone's%20circumstances%20are%20unique,30%25%20of%20your%20household%20income." rel="">I should really make sure not to spend more than 30% of my income on rent</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>While everyone’s circumstances are unique, many experts&nbsp;say it’s best to spend no more than 30% of your monthly gross income on housing-related expenses, including rent and utilities. Under that rule, it’s best to make sure that the amount you spend on rent is well below 30% of your household income. In other words, if you’re making $3,000 a month, it’s a good idea to pay no&nbsp;more than $900 for rent and other housing costs.  </p></blockquote><p>The general thinking here is that if I spend more than 30%, I’m making myself vulnerable in all other aspects of my budget; why burden yourself with more than you can handle, when I could take a slightly worse place and be that much closer to financial health? From the perspective of the 50k a year and up crowd, this makes sense - $1250, after all, will rent a reasonable house or apartment in a lot of markets.

What does 840 a month get you?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png" width="793" height="528" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:528,&quot;width&quot;:793,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:983497,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0e103a-bfea-4614-8154-9226f5dcdba3_793x528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I’m not 100% sure this is a converted Motel 6, but I’m not 100% sure it’s not. And while the first apartment I showed you was in a relatively nice, livable part of town this one is in a more gun-fire prone area ominously referred to by locals as “the triangle”. Phoenix’s mostly gravel-and-concrete landscaping style cleans up nice (note the still-wet recently hosed concrete), but make no mistake: this isn’t the kind of apartment complex where hypodermic needles are exclusively owned by diabetics.</p><p>That’s the drop-off you experience at the lower price levels - there’s nothing between “This is a tiny but acceptable apartment” and “Slum apartments in stab-ville”. </p><p>None of this is to discount the budget advice above completely - this is absolutely the kind of apartment I should be living in right now, if I was making perfect budgetary decisions. But consider that this is a choice I have to make - do I spend 50% more on an apartment and stress my budget to death, or make my wife and kids in a place where I have 5 front doors within 15 feet of ours in the murder-iest part of town? Neither choice is great, but the lack of intermediate choices forces you to do one or the other. </p><p>Whichever you choose, a person of less-than-intermediate income has to be prepared to stick with the rental long-term, should things not go well. This is because apartments at both of these levels quite accurately assume that you can’t afford a lawyer - while it’s normal to put down a month or two worth of rent as a security deposit, it’s much less normal to get it back; the apartment complex has no reason to give back thousands of dollars they can simply keep. This means every time you move, you pay something like a third to a month’s wages for the privilege. Since breaking a lease often means you lose your privilege to live anywhere non-hellish, this means if you don’t have cash reserves (more on these later*) at the exact right time of year, you might end up in the same place for another full year whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Note: It’s been pointed out to me that I completely forgot to talk about cash reserves and how they effect this kind of thing. It’s also been pointed out that these numbers only “make sense” in particular markets - i.e. it’s cheaper or more expensive to live other places, so the exact figures here don’t translate well for everyone. I’ll write a follow up post incorporating some of this kind of feedback soon to make up for it.</strong></p><p><span>I am always consistently shocked by how little people living at a decent-to-great income level fear their cars; it seems like they hardly lie awake at night thinking about their iffy alternator much, if at all. Scott Alexander does a pretty good job of explaining the obverse experience </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/" rel="">here</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>When I first started working with poor patients, I was shocked how many of the problems in their lives were car-related. For well-off people like me, having a car is background noise; you buy or lease it for a reasonable price, then never worry about it again. Poor people can’t afford to buy and don’t always have good enough credit to lease. They tend to get older, sketchier cars that constantly break down. A constant complaint I heard: “My car broke, I can’t afford repairs, and I’m going to get fired if I can’t make it to my job”. Some of them can’t afford insurance and take their chances without it. Others have had various incidents with the police that cost them their license, but they can’t just not show up to work, so they drive anyway and hope they don’t get arrested.  </p></blockquote><p>This is actually pretty close to the experience. It’s telling that Scott thinks the problem with a lease comes only from credit issues - a pretty bottom-barrel ford leases for 300-400 a month. For a person who makes 30,000-40000k a year, that’s something like 10-15% of their income, before we talk about insurance; couple that with the fact that you can’t squeak by on liability-only insurance in most leases, and we are already into a prohibitively expensive range.</p><p>But there’s other things - liability insurance, as mentioned above, is often your only option that makes sense - if your car costs $2000, paying an extra $50-100 per month for high-deductible doesn’t add up; you are still $1000 out of pocket to cover the deductible in the event you need to use it. But since you can’t afford it in the first place, you don’t think about that; you just start driving insanely carefully at all times and pray any accidents you get in aren’t your fault. One slip-up and you either can’t get to work at all, or you spend a lot more time doing it. Remember: Uber isn’t an option here; the ~$400 a month it would cost would bankrupt you.</p><p>You are also more or less forced to learn to do mechanic work. I’m an administrator by trade - I usually work in the kind of jobs that have “assistant” appended to them. One of my greatest prides is typing speed, and when people ask me my hobby I tell them “Excel”. If you were judging me by my interests and natural skillset, you wouldn’t expect me to be able to change my own tires. But over the years necessity has forced me to get pretty decent at car work - I’ve done clutch rebuilds and head gasket jobs and a bunch of other miserable (for me) work that I would have rather avoided. But this was often the only option I had - it was either figuring out how to replace an alternator or do a full brake job over the weekend or lose my ability to get to the grocery store in under an hour. Keep in mind the money saved here is just the labor - parts still have a cost that’s unavoidable. </p><p>The practical upshot of this is whenever I drive, it’s very slowly, very carefully, and listening in terror to any small noise the car makes. It’s a constant stress, and it’s limiting; we don’t go on long road trips often, and when we do my joke with my wife is usually something like “Well, if the car breaks down somewhere else, we’ll just start living there”.</p><p>It’s reasonable to ask “If cars are so terrible, why not use public transport?”. I live in a city, and this is in fact an option that would solve many of my problems: I wouldn’t have to worry about repairs, my gasoline and insurance bills would disappear and anything that happened to the bus is the city’s problem, not mine. Especially in an emergency public transit would be a godsend and might be the difference between keeping and losing my job.</p><p>But there’s other things to consider on this, as well. My commute isn’t short, and isn’t bus-friendly; it would go from about 30 minutes each way to just under 4 hours roundtrip. And when your commute starts and ends in a bad area, which is typical of a low-income family in a low-paying job, this means those four hours a day are spent surrounded by people who range from normal commuters at best to visibly mentally imbalanced and trying to speak to you the whole ride. I understand from talking to friends in “our mass transit is great!” towns that this isn’t the case everywhere but this is something that on average gets worse the poorer you get. I could make the commute shorter by taking a worse job (Maybe - the job market isn’t great right now), but that comes with career-limiting downsides of it’s own.</p><p>When I’m trying to explain to my sons how a company decides what to pay someone, it usually goes something like this: A company is looking to pay a person as little as they can and keep them, so a person’s pay is determined by how rare their skills are and how much demand there is for those skills. The value of their work doesn’t factor in as much - An administrative assistant might touch every department in the company every day and facilitate a massive amount of work, but they still don’t get paid much - it’s hard to justify when you could hire and train up someone to do the same thing nearly as well with very little difficulty.</p><p>I think this is a fairly accurate way to look at pay, but it applies to other aspects of the job. If you got sick more often than usual this year and used up your legally mandated sick days, would your company fire you for getting sick again, or demand you work sick? If the company decides it needs to cut wages, is your position the cheap-to-hire-for job the company didn’t spend a lot of money and time filling? If you don’t have rare skills, management is aware that they can ask for you to work extra hours, avoid letting you use paid time off and change your list of job duties on a whim - both they and you know that if you won’t do it, they can find somebody who will tomorrow. Not every company is bad in these ways - good people do exist - but every company is aware they could, and that tends to color every aspect of the job whether they intend it to or not. </p><p>The worst treatment you tend to get is, perhaps counterintuitively, in jobs that approach living wage despite your low value and replaceability as a worker. These jobs tend towards needing someone who can put in a lot of hours for customer interactions that require a single point of contact; they reward intense focus over long periods of time in unpleasant situations. Another way to say this is that these are high-stress jobs with a lot of mandatory overtime and very fast pacing - they pay a lot because they can’t get people to do them otherwise. Turnover in these jobs is absurd despite the pay - some people can keep up with them but it isn’t typical. In my first (and hopefully last) claims adjuster job, two people had heart attacks in my office in a six month period.</p><p>The obvious solution for the worker here would seem to be to train themselves in such a way as to be more valuable, but this is often a bit harder or less plausible than it sounds. Some of this can be personal reasons (if you are barely holding things together, it’s hard to find the time and energy to get a bachelors degree from scratch) or financial (It’s nice to think you could learn a new skill and start a new career, but if you are barely keeping your family fed as it is, you might not actually be able to take the pay cut dropping back to entry level would require. </p><p>To give you an example of how this looks, 2020 started with me in my second month at a sustainable job with a salary around 50k, the most I had ever made. When the job was disrupted by Covid, I was the first to go - I had little tenure and no rare specialty absolutely required by the company, so my responsibilities could at least theoretically be divided among the retained employees. I then took one of those high-stress high-intensity jobs in the mortgage industry, made kind of a lot of money (for me, on pace to do about 60k in a year) but eventually had a minor nervous breakdown; the company informed me I couldn’t use my paid time off without a month’s notice to handle it, and that they’d simply let my workload pile up while I was gone, leaving me in a worse place. I managed to switch to another company, but found out once I started that the job duties, pay, and hours were all misrepresented in the interview process - I’m free to leave if I don’t like it, since the job will be easy to fill. </p><p>In the meantime, I’ve added a few skills to my resume associated with better jobs and lifestyles, and I’m hopeful things get better. But “just the skill without an associated degree” means this is a slog - I’ve applied for about 100 jobs in the past month, but haven’t had a single response; there’s simply better qualified candidates at the kind of pay I can support my family with, and the kind of extremely junior positions I might have a better shot at would leave us unable to pay bills within a few months. </p><p>This isn’t evil on anyone’s part, and you shouldn’t feel bad about it - I’ve made a lot of choices in my life that led to this point and I have a lot of responsibility in terms of where I find myself. But understand that even if you are willing to sacrifice the labor and time it takes to work towards an uncertain goal, there’s still a fair amount of luck involved. And some people are at my level or below it because they simply lack the capability to do better - not everyone can or should learn to code, or would be able to successfully go back to school. </p><p>The summary here is that low-paying jobs are often uniquely bad for reasons beyond the pay itself. The people who work them aren’t unwilling to change this, but often they are unable to, either because the means to change their circumstance is outside of their control or because their attempts to do so fail. Some are lazy and unmotivated, but not all.</p><p><span>When someone is telling me they are or have been poor and I’m trying to determine </span><em>how poor exactly</em><span> they were, there’s one evergreen question I ask that has never failed to give me a good idea of what kind of situation I’m dealing with. That question is: “How many times have they turned off your water?”.</span></p><p>The reason this question works is because it lets me know whether the person I’m talking to has “felt” broke - I.E. been in a situation where they felt resource strapped for some reason or another - or has “been broke”, actually factually unable to pay for basic services they needed to survive at a minimally decent human level. </p><p>A person who feels broke might not have a lot of money, or might not have any liquid dollars in their wallet at all. But just being out of money doesn’t make you broke in the sense that they turn off your water - that takes time. Usually you can be over a month late before the water company actually goes to the trouble of sending someone out to turn off your water. Even if someone feels broke and can’t immediately pay their bills (this is rare for people who feel broke, by the way; they usually have a few hundred dollars they can get at somewhere, some space on a credit card, etc.) this only means they need to cut their spending somewhat the next month and catch up; they might not be King Midas after watching their budget for 30 days, but they won’t turn the tap some morning and finds nothing comes out.</p><p>Obviously being broke is the opposite; you are legitimately out of funds you need to cover a bill. It’s not a matter of watching your budget closer, either - you’ve cut the fat from every possible place and you still just don’t have enough to make everything work. Sometimes this is because you lost a job and your income dried up (more common these Covid days) and sometimes it’s because a surprise bill caused your budget to get behind in a way you couldn’t recover from. But as opposed to someone who simply overspent, being broke implies you have some structural problem with your income and finances that you can’t fix - all it took was a small bump of some kind to upset your apple cart, and now you’ve moved from “hanging on” to “asking your neighbor to use their hose to fill up a bucket so you can flush your toilet”.</p><p>It also implies there’s no place left to cut - you don’t have a car payment, and your insurance is minimal if it hasn’t lapsed already. You don’t have cable. You are eating a lot of rice. There’s simply nothing “extra” left to cut, and now you are choosing between things like power and internet (which you need to work and find work, these days) and water (which you need to survive).  Often you’ve already even prioritized those things, because as I’ve said they don’t turn off your water for a while; you’ve been juggling things like power and water, now with late fees, for a while. And one day your wife calls you and tells you the water is off, and there’s nothing you can do; maybe some family member can help you out, or maybe you live without utilities for a week or so until you get paid and start the next pay cycle that much more behind. </p><p>The best case scenario is you get helped, and you try to accept that graciously and thankfully, but consider the shame of this - you can’t support your family, and you’ve been forced to go to someone who can, implicitly admit you can’t fulfil your basic purpose as a human, and ask them to take away from their family to do what you can’t. And often they do - family and friends are a wonderful thing. I’m thankful more than I can say for mine; I’m blessed by them. But it’s exhausting; you understand going through it why so many people give up on trying to make things better, because you’ve already reached this point where you and everyone around you understands that you just can’t function to minimum levels as a father and husband; it’s hard to wake up the next day and go “well, I’m sure that’s all in the past - let’s learn Java!”.</p><p>If you are broke enough, you get what in some ways is very good health insurance: zero deductible, all prescriptions paid for, and no coverage limits. The reason you get this is because everyone else in the country pays for it for you - it’s government insurance, given to those at income levels so low it’s clear they have no chance at all of covering their own bills. It’s not without downsides (the doctors suck, for the most part, and referrals for anything beyond basic family care are time-consuming to get) but you  know that if your children or wife got seriously hurt or sick, there would be some level of care available that wouldn’t instantly bankrupt you.</p><p>There’s a point at which you are making too much money to get government insurance, though. As of today this number is &nbsp;$36,156, or ~138% of the federal poverty limit. This creates an interesting situation - if you were making 35k at a job and offered a job at 40k with healthcare benefits, taking the job would actually leave you in a worse place than before in most cases; insurance is expensive, and the government offers exactly zero help if you A. make more than a certain amount of money and B. work for a place with benefits. So where you had insurance and made 35k before, now you have insurance and make 32k; your step forward put you further in the hole.</p><p>This is what’s usually referred to as a perverse incentive - it’s a situation that “pays” you for doing the wrong thing. In this case, the wrong thing is rejecting jobs that pay more and offer more advancement out of fear that someone will get sick and you either won’t be able to get them care or will bankrupt yourself doing so. If you are smart, you probably take this risk - after all, you might eventually make 70k and be in a place where insurance is merely expensive rather than a complete budget disaster. But it’s a real risk you have to take as you climb towards financial security, and not everyone chooses to take it.</p><p>Dental insurance is worse. There’s an internet meme that says that teeth are “luxury bones” that insurance doesn’t cover, and this is more or less true - even with dental insurance, you are still out of pocket significant amounts of money for even basic dental care. I haven’t been to a dentist since I was 11 years old for reasons related to this. I often consider the fact that I’m in a bit of a race against time with my own teeth - at some point they will go from “merely crooked” to “visibly rotting”, and very few people will hire a person with visibly rotten teeth for work. </p><p>Note for other people of limited income: Take the time to check and see if there’s a dental school in your town. The care dental school clinics give isn’t free, but it’s significantly cheaper and in my experience pretty good. One of my children has significant dental care needs, and he regularly goes to the dentist at a clinic of this sort - they treat him well and do good work. I can’t compare it to a “real dentist”, but it’s infinitely better than nothing.</p><p>I mentioned this before, but I can work on cars, and I’m able to do anything less complex than a full engine or transmission rebuild. This is an example of what I refer to with friends as “poor people skills”, or capabilities you develop beyond the norm because it’s necessary to survive.</p><p>The most fun poor person skill by far is buying things off of Craigslist. It’s by no means rocket science, but having little money means you end up buying all but the very cheapest of durable goods used, and repeated practice at this makes you skilled at finding deals other people might miss.</p><p>It’s been decades since I bought new furniture besides IKEA; most of that comes from Craigslist. Cars come from Craigslist - you can buy used cars at dealerships and it’s less risky, but comes with a 25-50% markup for the safety that a lot of people can’t afford. Durable cookware, like pots and pans? Craigslist, if you want anything kind of nice; the stuff you can afford at target starts flaking teflon into your eggs a week in.</p><p>Rich person tip: Unless you really, really need everything in your house to clearly be part of a unified set, you are a sucker if you buy furniture new; this is especially true for non-upholstered wooden furniture. Antique furniture is prettier, studier, has more street cred and can be had for a song compared to retail store prices; let other people pay those and look average while you put in a minimum effort, save money, and get cooler older furniture that makes you look like a person of taste rather than an every day jive-turkey retail sucker.</p><p>Poor people tip: Stop buying spatulas on Craigslist. Just work some more overtime. Yes, I know it’s a lot of overtime already but spatulas cost $5 new - a $2 spatula is not a deal and the savings don’t pay for even minimum-wage time spent driving to talk to a guy named “Pastor Dave” about used discount cookware in a Circle K parking lot.</p><p>That last tip to poor people seems like a joke, but at some point it’s something you have to look out for - you get so used to thinking of money as an extremely finite resource that any amount of absolute savings in purchase price looks necessary to you. But once you conquer that, it’s like a superpower; you can save hundreds or thousands of dollars furnishing a room; you can buy a box of books with the one book you want in it for less than the price of that individual book from a bookstore. </p><p>The only downside to your new found x-man discount used goods status is the possibility of getting stabbed; it’s a good idea to look at the approximate area of the guy selling you a hamster cage before you find yourself in the more murder-prone parts of town at night, conspicuously button-down and muggable hoping nobody notices you. Get that one little bit down, though, and it’s like the skies open up and the heavens beam savings down; all the discount archery sets and knock-off kitchen knives of the world are suddenly at your fingertips.</p><p>That’s it! We made it through. As I said before, none of this was meant to make you feel guilty and I hope and pray I managed not to sound like I was whining - I really want to emphasize that outside of everything I’ve talked about here, I’m absurdly wealthy in terms of the people who choose to spend their lives in my vicinity. I’m mostly a happy guy, and anymore one who can often pay his bills on time. I can really honestly confirm that money isn’t the operative thing that makes you happy; it really is  more about having good people around to talk to, take care of and to be taken care of by.</p><p>And if you do better than I do - say, if you are a person who completed college on time and went on to your deserved place in the upper-middle class -  I hereby command you not to feel bad about it. It’s OK to do well, and I have an idea of the kind of work you’ve put in to get to where you are; there’s a great chance you deserve to have the things you have. I hope this was instructive for you, and I wish you continued success.</p></div></div>]]></description>
