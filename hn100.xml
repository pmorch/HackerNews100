  <p>I have cited a few games as inspiration for Balatro in the past, but I wanted to talk about one in particular that hasn’t been mentioned much that arguably is the most important.</p><p>I think if I had some kind of Balatro vision board, solitaire (Klondike) would be right in the middle of it with a big red circle around it. You can probably see some of the similarities between my game and the classic solo card game. I wanted my game to have the same vibe.</p><p>If you’re somehow unfamiliar, solitaire is a group of card games characterized by solo play. Klondike is usually the variant that most people in the west associate with solitaire, but one could argue<em> </em>even Balatro is technically a solitaire game. Traditional solitaire games exist at the peak of game culture for me. These games are so ubiquitous and accepted by society that almost everyone has some memory of playing them. They have transcended gaming culture more than even the biggest IPs (like Tetris or Mario), and they occupy this very interesting <strong><em>wholesome</em></strong> niche. Solitaire is almost viewed as a positive pastime more than a game. That feeling interests me greatly as a game designer.</p><div><p>As Balatro 1.0 development drew nearer to a close in early 2024, I found myself picturing the type of person that might play my game and what a typical play session might look like for them. My fantasy was that I was playing this weird game many years later on a lazy Sunday afternoon; I play a couple of runs, enjoy my time for about an hour, then set it down and continue the rest of my day. I wanted it to feel evergreen, comforting, and enjoyable in a very low-stakes way. I think that’s one of the reasons why there isn’t a player character, health, or classic ‘enemies’ in the game as well. I wanted this game to be as low stakes as a crossword or a sudoku puzzle while still exercising the problem solving part of the brain.</p><p>Essentially I wanted to play Balatro like people play solitaire.</p></div><p>One of the main ways that the vibe of solitaire and my own game differ is in the meta-game Balatro has that solitaire does not. Things like achievements, stake levels, unlocks, and challenges certainly can be looked at as a way to artificially inflate playtime, but those things were added for 2 other reasons I was more concerned about:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>To force players to get out of their comfort zone and explore the design of the game in a way they might not if this were a fully unguided gaming experience. In solitaire this probably isn’t super useful because the game has far fewer moving parts, so the player can figure everything out by themselves, but I don’t think that’s the case with a game like Balatro. I feel like even I learned a lot from these guiding goals that I wasn’t anticipating many months after the game launched.</p></li><li><p>To give the players that already enjoy the game loop a sort of checklist to work through if they so choose. They can come up with a list of goals on their own (as I see many from the community have) but I do really appreciate when I play other games and they give me tasks to accomplish and shape my long-form play around while I enjoy the shorter play sessions individually.<br> </p></li></ol><div><p>It’s now been over a year since launch and I am still playing Balatro almost daily. I play a couple runs before I go to bed, and I feel like I just might have accomplished the task of recreating the feeling of playing solitaire for myself. Seeing the discourse around my game has me fairly convinced that this is decidedly not how the average player has been interacting with my game, but I’m still thrilled that people are having a great time with it and I’m even more happy that I feel like this game turned out how I wanted as a player myself.</p><p> This is why you might have seen me refer to this game as ‘jazz solitaire’ in the past. I wanted to bring the old feeling of solitaire into a game with modern design bells and whistles, creating something new and yet familiar. Only time will tell if I actually accomplished that.</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.quippd.com/writing/2025/02/26/mozillas-new-terms-of-use-are-out-of-step-with-firefoxs-direct-competition.html">https://www.quippd.com/writing/2025/02/26/mozillas-new-terms-of-use-are-out-of-step-with-firefoxs-direct-competition.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43194536">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/firefox-terms-of-use/">Mozilla introduced legal updates to users of Firefox</a>, and something feels off. I read, and re-read the new <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/">Terms of Use</a> and while much of it reads like standard boilerplate from any tech company, there’s a new section that is unexpected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The community <a href="https://mstdn.io/@jomo/114072136787385688">has</a> <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/114071999359445580">also</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1iyuvjf/introducing_a_terms_of_use_and_updated_privacy/meyb9e9/">zeroed</a> in on this phrase, with contributors <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/why-does-mozilla-now-require-a-nonexclusive-royalty-free-worldwide-license-when-entering-information-in-firefox/140700">asking directly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqpnRyfz_aY">what up with that?</a></p>

<p>While I’m not going to ponder about <em>why</em> Mozilla wants this royalty-free license to my intellectual property, I immediately wondered whether using Microsoft Word also needed this kind of license grant – since it is <em>processing my words</em>.</p>

<p>I was quickly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement">informed</a> by a chatroom interlocutor that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which seems excessive. However, this copy is part of a section called “Your Content” where Microsoft explicitly disclaims ownership of your content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of our Services allow you to create, store or share Your Content or receive material from others. <strong>We don’t claim ownership of Your Content.</strong> Your Content remains yours and you are responsible for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that gives you the ick, or you simply want to avoid the <a href="https://beebom.com/microsoft-free-ad-supported-office-quietly-launched/">ads coming to Office</a>, you may want to try <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> - which doesn’t seem to have a terms of service. Just local, open source software.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Microsoft specifically disclaims ownership of your content - something Mozilla does not do.</p>

<p>Is Mozilla an outlier here? Is this as weird as it seems? Mozilla has a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/compare/">browser comparison page</a>, so we can use those as a basis for comparison - let’s look at the data!</p>

<table>

They also retain the right to use “content you’ve shared publicly to promote” their service, such as reviews, and to develop new technologies and services. You also grant these rights to sublicensees. Unsurprisingly, Google grants itself very expansive access to your intellectual property.</td>

      <td>Partial</td>
      <td>Microsoft grants itself a “worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services” while explicitly disclaiming ownership of your content.</td>

      <td>❌</td>
      <td>No reference to user generated intellectual property. Apple says that they retain “personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected”.</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It would be remiss to not mention that these changes come at the heels of a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-leadership-growth-planning-updates/">leadership shakeup</a> at Mozilla, with the exit of its longtime <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/getting-there-mozilla-foundations-mitchell-baker-111479">lizard wrangler, Mitchell Baker</a> and a new focus on “<a href="https://www.quippd.com/writing/2024/10/13/protecting-your-privacy-while-eroding-your-democracy-PPAs-considered-harmful.html">privacy-respecting advertising</a>” and “trustworthy, open source AI”.</p>

<p>The initial version of this post concluded that other browser vendors don’t grant themselves the same rights to users’ intellectual property that Mozilla’s new Terms does. Upon further review and discussion, I realize that the exceptions that Google grants itself for usage of people’s content are large enough to drive a truck through - they are expansive. In particular, using people’s intellectual property to serve ads based on that content is exactly the kind of usage that people are creeped out by.</p>

<p>There is something different here, though. Although Google’s ToS is expansive, Mozilla’s is more expansive still. As Google notes, “some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.” Google grants itself the expansive rights only when users upload or share content to its online services. Mozilla goes beyond this by not limiting the scope of what is covered to what is uploaded to Mozilla services, but more expansively to all “information” input “through” Firefox - that is every website, including ones on your local area network!</p>

<p>Lastly, I think the non-existence of a copyright license grant in the other competing browsers presents a valuable counterexample to claims that users of software programs must explicitly grant copying rights to any software that interacts with user data. What is their exposure to liability?</p>

<p>Clearly, if a license grant isn’t present in the Terms, users aren’t automatically granting <em>expansive</em> rights like letting a print shop republish dozens of copies of their work for free after making a single printout. If such a grant was automatic, vendors wouldn’t need to write it into an agreement that must be clicked through. Vendors that <em>do</em> assert such rights in their Terms can expect them to be operative, as <a href="https://www.mcglinchey.com/insights/split-supreme-judicial-court-issues-important-update-to-clickwrap-arbitration-clause-jurisprudence/">“clickwrap” agreements have been held to be enforceable</a>.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>I received some valuable feedback to this post, so I have further thoughts. At the outset, I’ll note that I am not a lawyer.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-prudent-change---it-prevents-lawsuits">This is a prudent change - it prevents lawsuits</h3>

<p>I got feedback that while the new verbiage might not be quite <em>necessary</em>, it clarifies and prevents people and businesses from trying to sue Mozilla for using the software as designed. An example of this might be someone suing Mozilla for uploading a file that they dragged onto Firefox, transmitting the file to a third party website.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me why Mozilla needs a license grant to protect itself from this lawsuit - the software worked as designed, and Mozilla having a license to the data doesn’t indemnify it from transmitting the data to the wrong place - if anything, the indemnification clause does that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Mozilla and its affiliates harmless for any liability or claim from your use of Firefox, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lacking a transferable, sub-licensable agreement means that Mozilla can’t escape liability for sending the file to the “wrong” site by granting the “wrong” site the license to the information. The lawsuits that I have come up with in my thought exercises don’t seem coherent to me. It is hard for me to imagine a lawsuit that would be prevented by this phrase.</p>

<p>My interpretation could be totally wrong! If it is, Mozilla can help the community understand why this verbiage is necessary – and what risks forks and other vendors who do not have this language in their ToS harbor. If forks are exposing themselves to legal liability, Mozilla would be performing a community service to non-Mozilla Gecko developers by clarifying their understanding of why copyright law requires users to grant these intellectual property rights to developers.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-how-software-works-the-tos-just-reflects-it">This is how software works, the ToS just reflects it</h3>

<p>Another response I’ve gotten is that computers need to copy data and transform it in order to do valuable things with your data. Thus, Mozilla needs these rights in order to correctly describe how software is working in the background.</p>

<p>This feels ahistorical, like an inversion of how we have always thought about copyright.</p>

<p>Did writing a story in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite">MacWrite</a> give Claris rights to your story?</p>

<p>Remember that to display, edit, transform (underline, italicize, fonts) the documents you write in MacWrite <em>necessarily</em> requires copying your document data from disk to memory to cpu to memory to display – lots of copying. Did Claris need the rights to your copyright to allow you to edit your documents in its software?</p>

<p>I think that we know that it isn’t the case that Claris needed (or had) a legal right to your intellectual property in order to “use” your data in order to let you edit your story.</p>

<p>If that example feels esoteric - since we’re talking about copies, how about copy machines?</p>

<p>If I walk up to a copy machine manufactured by Konica Minolta and copy a proprietary document, am I instantaneously granting Konica Minolta a license to “use” the copy? We know that many industrial copiers have <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/digital-copier-data-security-guide-businesses">hard drives in them</a> - does that mean the next time the disk goes back to Konica Minolta for warranty service, they get to use the documents to train algorithms to more accurately copy those types of documents?</p>

<p>I don’t think that is the case – clearly this is a <em>new</em> right being assigned. We do not assume that mere usage of a copier grants the copier company the right to use your data outside of of what is required to make the copy. We don’t even need the company involved at all! Indeed, I would expect that a responsible company would either destroy hard drives with customer data on them, or to securely wipe them before reuse.</p>

<p>In a more modern software example, guidance on the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#CanIUseGPLToolsForNF">GPL specifically clarifies that using open source software to create non-free software</a> is allowed - there is no assumption that using open source software to produce documents similarly grants the rights holders of the software in use rights to your creative work. Artworks created in Inkscape aren’t free to be used by the developers of Inkskape. Clearly, users of open source software aren’t automatically granting developers rights to their work. Why is Firefox different?</p>

            <guid>43194024</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 13:06:40 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/4.0.0">https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/4.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43194024">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>fish’s core code has been ported from C++ to Rust (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9512" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9512/hovercard">#9512</a>). This means a large change in dependencies and how to build fish. However, there should be no direct impact on users. Packagers should see the <a href="#rust-packaging">For Distributors</a> section at the end.</p>
<h3>Notable backwards-incompatible changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of a larger binding rework, <code>bind</code> gained a new key notation.<br>
In most cases the old notation should keep working, but in rare cases you may have to change a <code>bind</code> invocation to use the new notation.<br>
See <a href="#changelog-new-bindings">below</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ctrl-c</code> now calls a new bind function called <code>clear-commandline</code>. The old behavior, which leaves a “^C” marker, is available as <code>cancel-commandline</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10935" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10935/hovercard">#10935</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>random</code> will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.<br>
The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,<br>
so we do not expect this to have a large impact (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9593" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9593/hovercard">#9593</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.<br>
For example, <code>set editor command emacs; $editor</code> is no longer allowed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10249" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10249/hovercard">#10249</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>functions --handlers</code> will now list handlers in a different order.<br>
Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.<br>
This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9944" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9944/hovercard">#9944</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>qmark-noglob</code> feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means <code>?</code> will no longer act as a single-character glob.<br>
You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding <code>no-qmark-noglob</code> to <code>fish_features</code> and restarting fish:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob
</code></pre></div>
<p>The flag will eventually be made read-only, making it impossible to turn off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool-retro-term and emacs’ ansi-term are affected, but most mainstream terminals are not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user <code>$PATH</code> environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the <code>/mnt/c/...</code> path is explicitly added to <code>$fish_user_paths</code> and not just automatically appended to <code>$PATH</code> by <code>wsl.exe</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10506/hovercard">#10506</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2), backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a <code>SIGHUP</code> + <code>SIGCONT</code> sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into <code>SIGTTOU</code> remain in a suspended state indefinitely (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263/hovercard">#5263</a>). The workaround is to explicitly <code>disown</code> processes you wish to outlive the shell session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notable improvements and fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>fish now requests XTerm’s <code>modifyOtherKeys</code> keyboard encoding and <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/" rel="nofollow">kitty keyboard protocol’s</a> progressive enhancements (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10359" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10359/hovercard">#10359</a>).<br>
Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers <code>ctrl</code>, <code>alt</code> and <code>shift</code>, and distinguishing (for example) <code>ctrl-i</code> from <code>tab</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>bind</code> now supports a human-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.<br>
This includes modifier names, and names for keys like <code>enter</code> and <code>backspace</code>.<br>
For example</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bind up 'do something'</code> binds the up-arrow key instead of a two-key sequence (“u” and then “p”)</li>
<li><code>bind ctrl-x,alt-c 'do something'</code> binds a sequence of two keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like <code>\e</code> or <code>\cX</code>) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain <code>,</code> or <code>-</code> will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.</p>
<p>Keyboard protocols can be turned off by disabling the “keyboard-protocols” feature flag:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set -Ua fish_features no-keyboard-protocols"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>set -Ua fish_features no-keyboard-protocols
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a temporary measure to work around buggy terminals (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11056" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/11056/hovercard">#11056</a>), which appear to be relatively rare.<br>
Use this if something like “=0” or “=5u” appears in your commandline mysteriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fish can now be built as a self-installing binary (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10367" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10367/hovercard">#10367</a>). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.<br>
To do this, run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository
# or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository
# or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  <code>~/.local/share/fish/install/</code>. A specific path can be used for the data files with <code>fish --install=PATH</code> To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.</p>
<p>This build system is experimental; the main build system, using <code>cmake</code>, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new function <code>fish_should_add_to_history</code> can be overridden to decide whether a command should be added to the history (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10302" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10302/hovercard">#10302</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bindings can now mix special input functions and shell commands, so <code>bind ctrl-g expand-abbr "commandline -i \n"</code> works as expected (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186/hovercard">#8186</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special input functions run from bindings via <code>commandline -f</code> are now applied immediately, instead of after the currently executing binding (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031/hovercard">#3031</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10126" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10126/hovercard">#10126</a>).<br>
For example, <code>commandline -i foo; commandline | grep foo</code> succeeds now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undo history is no longer truncated after every command, but kept for the lifetime of the shell process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ctrl-r</code> history search now uses glob syntax (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131/hovercard">#10131</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ctrl-r</code> history search now operates only on the line or command substitution at cursor, making it easier to combine commands from history (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9751" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9751/hovercard">#9751</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abbreviations can now be restricted to specific commands. For instance:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'
</code></pre></div>
<p>will expand “back” to <code>reset --hard HEAD^</code>, but only when the command is <code>git</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411/hovercard">#9411</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deprecations and removed features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>commandline --tokenize</code> (short option <code>-o</code>) has been deprecated in favor of <code>commandline --tokens-expanded</code> (short option <code>-x</code>) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/4.0.0/cmds/eval.md">eval</a> in completion scripts (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10212/hovercard">#10212</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two new feature flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>remove-percent-self</code> (see <code>status features</code>) disables PID expansion of <code>%self</code>, which has been supplanted by <code>$fish_pid</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10262" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10262/hovercard">#10262</a>).</li>
<li><code>test-require-arg</code> disables <code>test</code>’s one-argument mode. That means <code>test -n</code> without an additional argument will return false, <code>test -z</code> will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for <code>[</code>, test’s alternate name.<br>
This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.<br>
In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category “deprecated-test”. Running fish with <code>fish -d deprecated-test</code> will show warnings whenever a <code>test</code> invocation that would change is used. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10365" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10365/hovercard">#10365</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be enabled with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg
</code></pre></div>
<p>We intend to enable them by default in future, and after that eventually make them read-only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifying key names as terminfo names (using the <code>bind -k</code> syntax) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a terminal pastes text into fish using bracketed paste, fish used to switch to a special <code>paste</code> bind mode.<br>
This bind mode has been removed. The behavior on paste is no longer configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an interactive fish is stopped or terminated by a signal that cannot be caught (SIGSTOP or SIGKILL), it may leave the terminal in a state where keypresses with modifiers are sent as CSI u sequences, instead of traditional control characters or escape sequences that are recognized by Readline and compatible programs, such as bash and python.<br>
If this happens, you can use the <code>reset</code> command from <code>ncurses</code> to restore the terminal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fish_key_reader --verbose</code> no longer shows timing information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminal information is no longer read from hashed terminfo databases, or termcap databases (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10269" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10269/hovercard">#10269</a>). The vast majority of systems use a non-hashed terminfo database, which is still supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>source</code> returns an error if used without a filename or pipe/redirection (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10774" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10774/hovercard">#10774</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scripting improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>for</code> loops will no longer remember local variables from the previous iteration (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525/hovercard">#10525</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>history append</code> subcommand appends a command to the history, without executing it (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506/hovercard">#4506</a>).</li>
<li>A new redirection: <code>&lt;? /path/to/file</code> will try opening the file as input, and if it doesn’t succeed silently uses <code>/dev/null</code> instead.<br>
This can help with checks like <code>test -f /path/to/file; and string replace foo bar &lt; /path/to/file</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10387" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10387/hovercard">#10387</a>)</li>
<li>A new option <code>commandline --tokens-raw</code> prints a list of tokens without any unescaping (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10212/hovercard">#10212</a>).</li>
<li>A new option <code>commandline --showing-suggestion</code> tests whether an autosuggestion is currently displayed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10586" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10586/hovercard">#10586</a>).</li>
<li><code>functions</code> and <code>type</code> now show that a function was copied and its source, rather than solely <code>Defined interactively</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575/hovercard">#6575</a>).</li>
<li>Stack trace now shows line numbers for copied functions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575/hovercard">#6575</a>).</li>
<li><code>foo &amp; &amp;&amp; bar</code> is now a syntax error, like in other shells (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911/hovercard">#9911</a>).</li>
<li><code>if -e foo; end</code> now prints a more accurate error (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10000" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10000/hovercard">#10000</a>).</li>
<li><code>cd</code> into a directory that is not readable but accessible (permissions <code>--x</code>) is now possible (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432/hovercard">#10432</a>).</li>
<li>An integer overflow in <code>string repeat</code> leading to a near-infinite loop has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899/hovercard">#9899</a>).</li>
<li><code>string shorten</code> behaves better in the presence of non-printable characters, including fixing an integer overflow that shortened strings more than intended (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9854/hovercard">#9854</a>).</li>
<li><code>string pad</code> no longer allows non-printable characters as padding (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9854/hovercard">#9854</a>).</li>
<li><code>string repeat</code> now allows omission of <code>-n</code> when the first argument is an integer (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10282" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10282/hovercard">#10282</a>).</li>
<li><code>string match</code> and <code>replace</code> have a new <code>--max-matches</code> option to return as soon as the specified number of matches have been identified, which can improve performance in scripts (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10587" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10587/hovercard">#10587</a>).</li>
<li><code>functions --handlers-type caller-exit</code> once again lists functions defined as <code>function --on-job-exit caller</code>, rather than them being listed by <code>functions --handlers-type process-exit</code>.</li>
<li>A new <code>set --no-event</code> option sets or erases variables without triggering a variable event. This can be useful to change a variable in an event handler (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10480" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10480/hovercard">#10480</a>).</li>
<li>Commas in command substitution output are no longer used as separators in brace expansion, preventing a surprising expansion in some cases (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048/hovercard">#5048</a>).</li>
<li>Universal variables can now store strings containing invalid UTF-8 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313/hovercard">#10313</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>path basename -E</code> option that causes it to return the basename (“filename” with the directory prefix removed) with the final extension (if any) also removed. This is a shorter version of <code>path change-extension "" (path basename $foo)</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10521" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10521/hovercard">#10521</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>math --scale-mode</code> option to select <code>truncate</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>ceiling</code> as you wish; the default value is <code>truncate</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117/hovercard">#9117</a>).</li>
<li><code>random</code> is now less strict about its arguments, allowing a start larger or equal to the end. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879/hovercard">#10879</a>)</li>
<li><code>function --argument-names</code> now produces an error if a read-only variable name is used, rather than simply ignoring it (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10842" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10842/hovercard">#10842</a>).</li>
<li>Tilde expansion in braces (that is, <code>{~,}</code>) works correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10610" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10610/hovercard">#10610</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interactive improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autosuggestions were sometimes not shown after recalling a line from history, which has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287/hovercard">#10287</a>).</li>
<li>Up-arrow search matches -- which are highlighted in reverse colors -- are no longer syntax-highlighted, to fix bad contrast with the search match highlighting.</li>
<li>Command abbreviations (those with <code>--position command</code> or without a <code>--position</code>) now also expand after decorators like <code>command</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10396" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10396/hovercard">#10396</a>).</li>
<li>Abbreviations now expand after process separators like <code>;</code> and <code>|</code>. This fixes a regression in version 3.6 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730/hovercard">#9730</a>).</li>
<li>When exporting interactively defined functions (using <code>type</code>, <code>functions</code> or <code>funcsave</code>) the function body is now indented, to match the interactive command line editor (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8603" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/8603/hovercard">#8603</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-x</code> (<code>fish_clipboard_copy</code>) on multiline commands now includes indentation (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10437" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10437/hovercard">#10437</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-v</code> (<code>fish_clipboard_paste</code>) now strips ASCII control characters from the pasted text.<br>
This is consistent with normal keyboard input (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274/hovercard">#5274</a>).</li>
<li>When a command like <code>fg %2</code> fails to find the given job, it no longer behaves as if no job spec was given (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835/hovercard">#9835</a>).</li>
<li>Redirection in command position like <code>&gt;echo</code> is now highlighted as error (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877/hovercard">#8877</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_vi_cursor</code> now works properly inside the prompt created by builtin <code>read</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088/hovercard">#10088</a>).</li>
<li>fish no longer fails to open a FIFO if interrupted by a terminal resize signal (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250/hovercard">#10250</a>).</li>
<li><code>read --help</code> and friends no longer ignore redirections. This fixes a regression in version 3.1 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274/hovercard">#10274</a>).</li>
<li>Measuring a command with <code>time</code> now considers the time taken for command substitution (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100/hovercard">#9100</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_add_path</code> now automatically enables verbose mode when used interactively (in the command line), in an effort to be clearer about what it does (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10532" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10532/hovercard">#10532</a>).</li>
<li>fish no longer adopts TTY modes of failed commands (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10603" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10603/hovercard">#10603</a>).</li>
<li><code>complete -e cmd</code> now prevents autoloading completions for <code>cmd</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716/hovercard">#6716</a>).</li>
<li>fish’s default color scheme no longer uses the color “blue”, as it has bad contrast against the background in a few terminal’s default palettes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10758" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10758/hovercard">#10758</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786/hovercard">#10786</a>)<br>
The color scheme will not be upgraded for existing installs. If you want, you should select it again via <code>fish_config</code>.</li>
<li>Command lines which are larger than the terminal are now displayed correctly, instead of multiple blank lines being displayed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296/hovercard">#7296</a>).</li>
<li>Prompts that use external commands will no longer produce an infinite loop if the command crashes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796/hovercard">#9796</a>).</li>
<li>Undo (<code>ctrl-z</code>) restores the cursor position too (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10838" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10838/hovercard">#10838</a>).</li>
<li>The output of <code>jobs</code> shows “-” for jobs that have the same process group ID as the fish process, rather than “-2” (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10833" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10833/hovercard">#10833</a>).</li>
<li>Job expansion (<code>%1</code> syntax) works properly for jobs that are a mixture of external commands and functions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10832" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10832/hovercard">#10832</a>).</li>
<li>Command lines which have more lines than the terminal can be displayed and edited correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10827" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10827/hovercard">#10827</a>).</li>
<li>Functions that have been erased are no longer highlighted as valid commands (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10866" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10866/hovercard">#10866</a>).</li>
<li><code>not</code>, <code>time</code>, and variable assignments (that is <code>not time a=b env</code>) is correctly recognized as valid syntax (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10890" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10890/hovercard">#10890</a>).</li>
<li>The Web-based configuration removes old right-hand-side prompts again, fixing a regression in fish 3.4.0 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10675" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10675/hovercard">#10675</a>).</li>
<li>Further protection against programs which crash and leave the terminal in an inconsistent state (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834/hovercard">#10834</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11038" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11038/hovercard">#11038</a>).</li>
<li>A workaround for git being very slow on macOS has been applied, improving performance after a fresh boot (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10535" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10535/hovercard">#10535</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>New or improved bindings</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the cursor is on a command that resolves to an executable script, <code>alt-o</code> will now open that script in your editor (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10266" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10266/hovercard">#10266</a>).</li>
<li>During up-arrow history search, <code>shift-delete</code> will delete the current search item and move to the next older item. Previously this was only supported in the history pager.</li>
<li><code>shift-delete</code> will also remove the currently-displayed autosuggestion from history, and remove it as a suggestion.</li>
<li><code>ctrl-Z</code> (also known as <code>ctrl-shift-z</code>) is now bound to redo.</li>
<li>Some improvements to the <code>alt-e</code> binding which edits the command line in an external editor:
<ul>
<li>The editor’s cursor position is copied back to fish. This is currently supported for Vim and Kakoune.</li>
<li>Cursor position synchronization is only supported for a set of known editors, which are now also detected in aliases which use <code>complete --wraps</code>. For example, use <code>complete --wraps my-vim vim</code> to synchronize cursors when <code>EDITOR=my-vim</code>.</li>
<li>Multiline commands are indented before being sent to the editor, which matches how they are displayed in fish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>...-path-component</code> bindings, like <code>backward-kill-path-component</code>, now treat <code>#</code> as part of a path component (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271/hovercard">#10271</a>).</li>
<li>Bindings like <code>alt-l</code> that print output in between prompts now work correctly with multiline commandlines.</li>
<li><code>alt-d</code> on an empty command line lists the directory history again. This restores the behavior of version 2.1.</li>
<li><code>history-prefix-search-backward</code> and <code>-forward</code> now maintain the cursor position, instead of moving the cursor to the end of the command line (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430/hovercard">#10430</a>).</li>
<li>The following keys have refined behavior if the terminal supports <a href="#changelog-new-bindings">the new keyboard encodings</a>:
<ul>
<li><code>shift-enter</code> now inserts a newline instead of executing the command line.</li>
<li><code>ctrl-backspace</code> now deletes the last word instead of only one character (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741/hovercard">#10741</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-delete</code> deletes the next word (same as <code>alt-d</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New special input functions:
<ul>
<li><code>forward-char-passive</code> and <code>backward-char-passive</code> are like their non-passive variants but do not accept autosuggestions or move focus in the completion pager (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10398" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10398/hovercard">#10398</a>).</li>
<li><code>forward-token</code>, <code>backward-token</code>, <code>kill-token</code>, and <code>backward-kill-token</code> are similar to the <code>*-bigword</code> variants but for the whole argument token (which includes escaped spaces) (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014/hovercard">#2014</a>).</li>
<li><code>clear-commandline</code>, which merely clears the command line, as an alternative to <code>cancel-commandline</code> which prints <code>^C</code> and a new prompt (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10213" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10213/hovercard">#10213</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>accept-autosuggestion</code> special input function now returns false when there was nothing to accept (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10608" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10608/hovercard">#10608</a>).</li>
<li>Vi mode has seen some improvements but continues to suffer from the lack of people working on it.
<ul>
<li>New default cursor shapes for insert and replace mode.</li>
<li><code>ctrl-n</code> in insert mode accepts autosuggestions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10339" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10339/hovercard">#10339</a>).</li>
<li>Outside insert mode, the cursor will no longer be placed beyond the last character on the commandline.</li>
<li>When the cursor is at the end of the commandline, a single <code>l</code> will accept an autosuggestion (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286/hovercard">#10286</a>).</li>
<li>The cursor position after pasting (<code>p</code>) has been corrected.</li>
<li>Added an additional binding, <code>_</code>, for moving to the beginning of the line (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10720" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10720/hovercard">#10720</a>).</li>
<li>When the cursor is at the start of a line, escaping from insert mode no longer moves the cursor to the previous line.</li>
<li>Added bindings for clipboard interaction, like <code>",+,p</code> and <code>",+,y,y</code>.</li>
<li>Deleting in visual mode now moves the cursor back, matching vi (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394/hovercard">#10394</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>;</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>I</code>, and <code>gU</code> bindings work in visual mode (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10601" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10601/hovercard">#10601</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10648/hovercard">#10648</a>).</li>
<li>Support <code>%</code> motion (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10593" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10593/hovercard">#10593</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-k</code> to remove the contents of the line beyond the cursor in all modes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10648/hovercard">#10648</a>).</li>
<li>Support ab and ib vi text objects. New input functions are introduced <code>jump-{to,till}-matching-bracket</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842/hovercard">#1842</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>E</code> binding now correctly handles the last character of the word, by jumping to the next word (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9700" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9700/hovercard">#9700</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Completions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete <code>git add</code> for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707/hovercard">#3707</a>).</li>
<li>Option completion now uses fuzzy subsequence filtering, just like non-option completion (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830/hovercard">#830</a>).<br>
This means that <code>--fb</code> may be completed to <code>--foobar</code> if there is no better match.</li>
<li>Completions that insert an entire token now use quotes instead of backslashes to escape special characters (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433/hovercard">#5433</a>).</li>
<li>Normally, file name completions start after the last <code>:</code>  or <code>=</code> in a token.<br>
This helps commands like <code>rsync --files-from=</code>.<br>
This special meaning can now disabled by escaping these separators as <code>\:</code> and <code>\=</code>.<br>
This matches Bash’s behavior.<br>
Note that this escaping is usually not necessary since the completion engine already tries<br>
to guess whether the separator is actually part of a file name.</li>
<li>Various new completion scripts and numerous updates to existing ones.</li>
<li>Completions could hang if the <code>PAGER</code> environment variable was sent to certain editors on macOS, FreeBSD and some other platforms. This has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10820" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10820/hovercard">#10820</a>).</li>
<li>Generated completions are now stored in <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fish</code> or <code>~/.cache/fish</code> by default (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369/hovercard">#10369</a>)</li>
<li>A regression in fish 3.1, where completing a command line could change it completely, has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10904" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10904/hovercard">#10904</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improved terminal support</h4>
<ul>
<li>fish now marks the prompt and command-output regions (via OSC 133) to enable terminal shell integration (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10352" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10352/hovercard">#10352</a>).<br>
Shell integration shortcuts can scroll to the next/previous prompt or show the last command output in a pager.</li>
<li>fish now reports the working directory (via OSC 7) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9955/hovercard">#9955</a>).</li>
<li>fish now sets the terminal window title (via OSC 0) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10037" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10037/hovercard">#10037</a>).</li>
<li>Focus reporting in tmux is no longer disabled on the first prompt.</li>
<li>Focus reporting is now disabled during commands run inside key bindings (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942/hovercard">#6942</a>).</li>
<li>Cursor changes are applied to all terminals that support them, and the list of specifically-supported terminals has been removed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10693" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10693/hovercard">#10693</a>).</li>
<li>If it cannot find the terminfo entry given by <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/4.0.0/language.md#envvar-TERM"><code>TERM</code></a> environment variable, fish will now use an included <code>xterm-256color</code> definition to match the vast majority of current terminal emulators (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10905" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10905/hovercard">#10905</a>). If you need to have a specific terminfo profile for your terminal’s <code>TERM</code> variable, install it into the terminfo database.</li>
<li>Further improvements to the correct display of prompts which fill the width of the terminal (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164/hovercard">#8164</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> gained a <code>buildinfo</code> subcommand, to print information on how fish was built, to help with debugging (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10896" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10896/hovercard">#10896</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_indent</code> will now collapse multiple empty lines into one (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10325" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10325/hovercard">#10325</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_indent</code> now preserves the modification time of files if there were no changes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10624" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10624/hovercard">#10624</a>).</li>
<li>Performance in launching external processes has been improved for many cases (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10869" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10869/hovercard">#10869</a>).</li>
<li>Performance and interactivity under Windows Subsystem for Linux has been improved, with a workaround for Windows-specific locations being appended to <code>$PATH</code> by default (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10506/hovercard">#10506</a>).</li>
<li>On macOS, paths from <code>/etc/paths</code> and <code>/etc/manpaths</code> containing colons are handled correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684/hovercard">#10684</a>).</li>
<li>Additional filesystems such as AFS are properly detected as remote, which avoids certain hangs due to expensive filesystem locks (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10818" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10818/hovercard">#10818</a>).</li>
<li>A spurious error when launching multiple instances of fish for the first time has been removed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10813" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10813/hovercard">#10813</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>For distributors</h3>
<p>fish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).</p>
<p>CMake remains the recommended build system, because of cargo’s limited support for installing support files. Version 3.5 remains the minimum supported version. The Xcode generator for CMake is not supported any longer (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924/hovercard">#9924</a>). CMake builds default to optimized release builds (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10799" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10799/hovercard">#10799</a>).</p>
<p>fish no longer depends on the ncurses library, but still uses a terminfo database. When packaging fish, please add a dependency on the package containing your terminfo database instead of curses.</p>
<p>The <code>test</code> target was removed as it can no longer be defined in new CMake versions. Use <code>make fish_run_tests</code>. Any existing test target will not print output if it fails (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11116" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11116/hovercard">#11116</a>).</p>
<p>The Web-based configuration has been rewritten to use Alpine.js (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9554" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9554/hovercard">#9554</a>).</p>
<h3>Changes since fish 4.0b1</h3>
<p>A number of improvements were included in fish 4.0.0 following the beta release of 4.0b1. These include fixes for regressions, improvements to completions and documentation, and the removal of a small number of problematic changes.</p>
<p>The full list of fixed issues can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/43">GitHub milestone page for 4.0-final</a>.</p>

<p><em>This coverage is made possible through a partnership between </em><a href="https://grist.org/"><em>Grist</em></a>, <a href="https://www.bpr.org/"><em>BPR</em></a><em>, a public radio station serving western North Carolina, </em><a href="https://www.wbez.org/"><em>WBEZ</em></a><em>, a public radio station serving the Chicago metropolitan region, and </em><a href="https://www.interlochenpublicradio.org/"><em>Interlochen Public Radio</em></a><em> in Northern Michigan.</em></p>



<p>On a recent Friday afternoon, Marie Richards sat in her living room in northern Michigan. She was having a hard time talking about her job at the U.S. Forest Service in the past tense.</p>



<p>“I absolutely loved my job,” she said. “I didn’t want to go.”</p>



<p>Richards, a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, was a tribal relations specialist at the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/hmnf">Huron-Manistee National Forests</a>. In mid-February, she found out she was one of the some 3,400 workers who had been targeted for layoffs — an estimated 10 percent of the workforce — as part of the Trump administration’s move to cut costs and shrink the federal government.</p>



<p>Richards watched as some of her colleagues were laid off on February 14 — the <a href="https://planetdetroit.org/2025/02/federal-employees-fired-valentine-day-massacre/">so-called</a> Valentine’s Day massacre, when the Trump administration laid off thousands of probationary employees, generally hired within the past two years. She got a call from her supervisor that Saturday informing her that she had been let go, too. The letter she received cited performance issues, even though she, along with others in a similar position, had received a pay raise less than two months earlier.</p>



<p>“None of us deserved this,” Richards said. “We all work hard and we’re dedicated to taking care of the land.”</p>



<p>The U.S. Forest Service, which&nbsp;stewards 193 million acres of public lands from Alaska to Florida, was in trouble even before Trump took office. Chronically understaffed, the service was already under a <a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/the-forest-service-is-cutting-its-seasonal-workforce-and-public-lands-will-suffer/">Biden-era hiring freeze</a>, all the while on the front lines of fighting and recovering from back-to-back climate disasters across the country.</p>

<p>For now, workers with the Forest Service fear this isn’t just the end of the line for their dream careers, but also a turning point for public lands and what they mean in the United States.</p>



<p>“It’s catastrophic,” said Anders Reynolds with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that litigates environmental issues in the southeastern U.S. “We are losing an entire generation of talent and passion.”</p>



<p>The federal agency does more than ensure that Americans have a place to hunt, hike, fish, or paddle. In the South, forest workers played a key role in helping western North Carolina and other communities recover from impacts of Hurricane Helene. In the West, they’re taking on fire risk mitigation and fighting wildfires. They’re also involved in fisheries management in places like Alaska. Across the country, agency biologists and foresters are busy working to strengthen the over 150 national forests and 20 grasslands it monitors in the face of changing climate.</p>



<p>Increasingly, the service is getting spread thin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agency has experienced a steady decrease in staffing over the last decade and the workers that remain are often overworked and underpaid, according to Reynolds.</p>



<p>“That means you’re going to see those campgrounds close, the trails go unmaintained, roads closed, you’re going to feel the effects of wildfire and hurricane recovery work that’s just going to remain undone,” said Reynolds. “Communities are going to struggle.”</p>



<p>The Forest Service has reduced its capacity over many years, causing headaches for staff.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://nafsr.org/advocacy/2019/072619%20Workforce%20Capacity%20Study.pdf">report</a> from the National Association of Forest Service Retirees showed the agency losing a little over half of staff who supported specialty ecological restoration projects — meaning a whole range of jobs, from botanists to foresters to wildlife and fisheries biologists — between 1992 and 2018. As a result, understaffed Forest Service ranger districts, hemorrhaging staff positions, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-01-53R/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-01-53R.htm">have consolidated</a>.</p>



<p>Former employees report they saw serious financial and staffing shortages during their time. Bryan Box, a former timber sale administrator with the Forest Service who took some time out of the agency to care for his aging mother, said he found the working conditions unsuitable for a stable, normal life. Box worked for the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin, where he said he made so little he biked around on his off days rather than wasting money on gas. While he was working, multiple national forests around him consolidated, causing a downward spiral on organizational capacity.</p>

<p>“We decommissioned buildings, we decommissioned the infrastructure that we had back in the ‘80s and ‘90s when we had this huge staff,” Box said. “And that put us into a position where we couldn’t hire seasonal employees anymore because we didn’t have housing for them. In rural northern Wisconsin, you know, just there’s not any housing available really. I think at one point our firefighters were all living above a bar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other foresters he knew failed to make rent and were evicted or lived itinerantly, couch-surfing, for the love of the work they did. For Box, the financial realities became untenable. So, too, had the restrictions on his work, which grew as budgets failed to grow.</p>



<p>Box’s program was expensive to run and required travel, often to reduce fire fuels by harvesting timber after an emergency. The program he worked for, Box said, ended up needing to reduce costs by cutting travel funds and ending overtime, making it difficult for him to do his job well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of their work involves emergency response, not only fighting fires but also picking up the pieces after conflagrations and hurricanes leave potentially thousands of acres of dead timber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matthew Brossard works as the current business representative and organizer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, and was formerly the general vice president for the National Federation of Federal Employees’ Forest Service Council, which represents around 18,000 employees of the Forest Service, 6,000 of whom are probationary, meaning they have either recently been hired or moved to a new position within the agency. Typically, probation — a part of every federal hiring process — is one or two years. Probationary employees were primarily targeted in the layoffs, meaning a generation of hires is potentially interrupted.&nbsp;Brossard said even though the administration maintains they have not fired positions essential to public safety, there’s more to fighting fires than just the firefighters. Support and logistical personnel are essential. “Extra dispatchers, security to close off roads, food unit leaders, base camp managers, all these very important, 100 percent-needed positions. Those people are getting terminated right now,” Brossard said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another instance recounted by Brossard, someone on assignment to help with long-term hurricane recovery in Louisiana was fired while he was there. The employee lived in Oregon and reported having no financial support for his trip home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The loss of a seasonal workforce will also be felt, Brossard added. “Without that influx of seasonal workforce, it puts a huge amount of work onto the permanent staff if they’re still employed to do all the work,” he said, meaning not only trailwork and campground maintenance, but also research and other essential work. “So the work that in the summer that should have been done by 15 or 20 people are now going to be done by five or six.”</p>



<p>As workers continue to struggle with the fallout of their abrupt firings, their union is jumping in to protect them, Brossard said. The NFFE-FSC has joined in multiple lawsuits to challenge the firings, including one filed February 12, provided to Grist, that aims to put a stop to the firings and reverse the ones that have already happened, on grounds that the terminations are unlawful. A decision on the lawsuit is still to come, with more potential legal action following, Brossard said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re not reducing, you know,&nbsp;the stereotypical bureaucrats,” Brossard said. “You’re reducing the boots on the ground that are going out and doing work.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an emailed statement to Grist, a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the new agricultural secretary, Brooke Rollins, supported Trump’s directive to cut spending and inefficiencies while strengthening the department’s services. “As part of this effort, USDA has made the difficult decision to release about 2,000 probationary, non-firefighting employees from the Forest Service. To be clear, none of these individuals were operational firefighters.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement continued, “Released employees were probationary in status, many of whom were compensated by temporary IRA funding. It’s unfortunate that the Biden administration hired thousands of people with no plan in place to pay them long term. Secretary Rollins is committed to preserving essential safety positions and will ensure that critical services remain uninterrupted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in northern Michigan, Marie Richards, the former tribal relations specialist, crunched down the snowy driveway, pointing toward the Huron-Manistee National Forests where she worked. It spans nearly 1 million acres and covers land tribal nations ceded in two treaties, which the federal government has a responsibility to keep in trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richards said workers like her are also a vital part of pushing the federal government to meet its trust responsibility to tribal nations. She helped connect the region’s federally recognized tribes with officials and staff at the forest service, set up meetings, and ensured work was being carried out responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not just the damage to that trust relationship with the Forest Service,” said Richards, who left her job as a repatriation and historic preservation specialist for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians to work at the agency. “It’s across the board for so many things, and tribes trying to work through that freeze, and making people understand that this isn’t DEI — that this is governmental affairs.”</p>



<p>Richards doesn’t know what’s next; she wants to finish her dissertation (about the impact of the lumber industry on traditional cultural landscapes and Anishinaabe bands and communities) and continue her work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It still really hurts that this dream of mine is kind of shattered, and we’ll see, and find a new dream,” she said. “But ultimately, my career, my livelihood, is in tribal relations for our heritage and I will find a home somewhere.”</p>

    <h2>Interactive Demo</h2>
    <p>
      This is a demo of our simulated piano playing agent trained with reinforcement learning. It runs
      MuJoCo natively in your browser thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zalo/mujoco_wasm/">WebAssembly</a>.
      You can use your mouse to interact with it, for example by dragging down the piano keys to generate sound
      or pushing the hands to perturb them. The controls section in the top right corner can be used to
      change songs and the simulation section to pause or reset the agent. Make sure you click the
      demo at least once to enable sound.
    </p>
    
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Simulation</h3>
    <p>
      We build our simulated piano-playing environment using the open-source <a href="https://mujoco.org/">MuJoCo</a>
      physics engine.
      It consists in a full-size 88-key digital keyboard and two <a href="https://www.shadowrobot.com/">Shadow Dexterous
        Hands</a>,
      each with 24 degrees of freedom.
    </p>
    
    <img src="https://kzakka.com/robopianist/assets/environment.png" id="robopianist-env">
    
    <h3>Musical representation</h3>
    <p>
      We use the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a>) standard
      to represent
      a musical piece as a sequence of time-stamped messages corresponding to "note-on" or "note-off" events. A message
      carries
      additional pieces of information such as the pitch of a note and its velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We convert the MIDI file into a time-indexed note trajectory (also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_roll">piano roll</a>),
      where each note is represented as a one-hot vector of length 88 (the number of keys on a piano). This trajectory
      is used as the goal
      representation for our agent, informing it which keys to press at each time step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interactive plot below shows the song Twinkle Twinkle Little Star encoded as a piano roll. The x-axis
      represents
      time in seconds, and the y-axis represents musical pitch as a number between 1 and 88. You can hover over each
      note to
      see what additional information it carries.
    </p>
    
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer">synthesizer</a> can be used to convert MIDI files to raw
      audio:</p>
    <audio controls="" src="https://kzakka.com/robopianist/assets/twinkle_twinkle.wav"></audio>
    <h3>Musical evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      We use precision, recall and F1 scores to evaluate the proficiency of our agent. If at a given instance of time
      there are keys that should be "on"
      and keys that should be "off", precision measures how good the agent is at not hitting any of the keys that should
      be "off", while recall measures
      how good the agent is at hitting all the keys that should be "on". The F1 score combines the precision and recall
      into a single metric, and ranges
      from 0 (if either precision or recall is 0) to 1 (perfect precision and recall).
    </p>
    <h3>Piano fingering and dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Piano fingering refers to the assignment of fingers to notes in a piano piece (see figure below).
      Sheet music will typically provide sparse fingering labels for the tricky sections of a piece to
      help guide pianists, and pianists will often develop their own fingering preferences for a given
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      In RoboPianist, we found that the agent struggled to learn to play the piano with a sparse reward signal
      due to the exploration challenge associated with the high-dimensional action space. To overcome this issue,
      we added human priors in the form of the fingering labels to the reward function to guide its exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since fingering labels aren't available in MIDI files by default, we used annotations from the Piano Fingering
      Dataset (<a href="https://beam.kisarazu.ac.jp/~saito/research/PianoFingeringDataset/">PIG</a>) to create 150
      labeled MIDI files, which we call Repertoire-150 and release as part of our environment.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3>MDP Formulation</h3>
    <p>
      We model piano-playing as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by a tuple \( (\mathcal{S},
      \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{\rho}, \mathcal{p}, r, \gamma, H) \),
      where \( \mathcal{S} \) is the state space, \( \mathcal{A} \) is the action space, \( \mathcal{\rho}(\cdot) \) is
      the initial state distribution, \( \mathcal{p} (\cdot | s, a) \)
      governs the dynamics, \( r(s, a) \) is the reward function, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, and \( H \) is
      the horizon. The goal of the agent is to
      maximize its total expected discounted reward over the horizon \( \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{H} \gamma^t r(s_t,
      a_t) \right] \).
    </p>
    <p>
      At every time step, the agent receives proprioceptive (i.e, hand joint angles), exteroceptive (i.e., piano
      key states) and goal observations (i.e., piano roll) and outputs 22 target joint angles for each hand. These
      are fed to proportional-position actuators which convert them to torques at each joint. The agent then
      receives a weighted sum of reward terms, including a reward for hitting the correct keys, a reward for
      minimizing energy consumption, and a shaping reward for adhering to the fingering labels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our policy optimizer, we use a state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02034">DroQ</a>
      and train our agent for 5 million steps with a control frequency of 20 Hz.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- quantitative results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Quantitative Results</h2>
    <p>
      With careful system design, we improve our agent's performance significantly. Specifically,
      adding an energy cost to the reward formulation, providing a few seconds worth of future goals
      rather than just the current goal, and constraining the action space helped the agent learn
      faster and achieve a higher F1 score. The plot below shows the additive effect of each of
      these design choices on three different songs of increasing difficulty.
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://kzakka.com/robopianist/assets/design_considerations.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      When compared to a strong derivative-free model predictive control (MPC) baseline, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00541">Predictive Sampling</a>,
      our agent achieves a much higher F1 score, averaging 0.79 across Etude-12 versus 0.43 for Predictive Sampling.

  <section>
    <h2>Qualitative Results</h2>
    <p>
      Each video below is playing real-time and shows our agent playing every song in the Etude-12 subset.
      In each video frame, we display the fingering labels by coloring the keys according to the
      corresponding finger color. When a key is pressed, it is colored green.
    </p>
    <h3>Debug dataset</h3>
    <p>
      This dataset contains "entry-level" songs (e.g., scales) and is useful for sanity checking an agent's performance.
      Fingering labels in this dataset were manually annotated by the authors of this paper. It is not part of the
      Repertoire-150 dataset.

<p dir="auto">DualPipe is an innovative bidirectional pipeline parallelism algorithm introduced in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19437" rel="nofollow">DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report</a>. It achieves full overlap of forward and backward computation-communication phases, also reducing pipeline bubbles. For detailed information on computation-communication overlap, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/profile-data">profile data</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Example DualPipe scheduling for 8 PP ranks and 20 micro-batches in two directions.
The micro-batches in the reverse direction are symmetric to those in the forward direction, so
we omit their batch ID for illustration simplicity. Two cells enclosed by a shared black border
have mutually overlapped computation and communication</p>

					<p>The

						replaces the main logic board in a 17" or 20" iMac G4 and turns its built-in LCD
						into an HDMI monitor.
						It also uses the iMac's custom power supply and has a built-in audio amplifier
						to be able to drive the
						<a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Apple_Pro_Speakers">Apple Pro speakers</a>
						that were available for the iMac G4.
						Swapping the boards is easy and completely reversible.</p>

					<p>I ordered the DockLite G4 but it was going to take a few weeks to get.
						In the mean time, I needed to find a 17" iMac G4 in good condition but not fully
						working so that I wouldn't be sacrificing a working machine.
						I eventually found one on eBay and I paid nearly as much for shipping as the
						machine itself.
						The iMac uses a lot of thick steel inside the dome which makes it quite heavy.</p>
					<p><em>Pro tip: there are a bunch of 17" G4 iMacs on eBay that are listed as 15".
							I don't know if it's because eBay fills this in by default or if people are
							confused by the screen size since it measures about 15" horizontally but the 17"
							refers to its diagonal size.
							It's usually possible to tell which size it is by the photos since the 15" looks
							much more square, but if you can get the serial number on the bottom,
							<a href="https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/">looking it up</a>
							will confirm whether it's 15" or 17".</em></p>
					<p>Once the dead iMac arrived, a power-on test produced a happy chime but showed
						nothing on the screen.
						At this point I wasn't sure if the LCD was busted or if the problem was with the
						iMac's logic board, so I had to get a
						<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=mini-vga+to+vga">Mini VGA to VGA adapter</a>
						to test its video output.
						This also failed to show any video so I was pretty sure the logic board was
						faulty but I still had no idea whether the LCD worked.</p>
					<p>Eventually the DockLite arrived from Australia and after a few minutes of
						swapping things, I was able to confirm that the LCD worked fine and was
						displaying the Mac Mini's desktop over HDMI.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately after using the iMac for a little while, I noticed a few issues
						that soured my experience with the DockLite.</p>
					<h3 id="color-banding">Color Banding</h3>
					<p>I'm not sure whether the DockLite or the 20-year old LCD screen is to blame for
						this, but there is noticeable color banding on the screen, especially with macOS
						window shadows.</p>
					<figure><a href="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-1500x518.jpg"><img src="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-680x235.jpg" srcset="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-680x235.jpg 1x, https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-1360x470@2x.jpg 2x" width="680" height="235"></a>
						<figcaption>Color banding in window shadow</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>I wasn't able to test native Mac OS with the iMac's logic board so I can't be
						sure the problem isn't with the LCD, but I've seen this same problem with some
						other generic
						<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=lvds+to+hdmi">LVDS/eDP to HDMI</a>
						boards.</p>
					<h3 id="imac-screen-resolution">iMac Screen Resolution</h3>
					<p>My other issue with using the iMac G4 was that its 17" screen has a resolution
						of only 1440x900.
						This isn't terrible but having used 1.5x or 2x resolution screens on my
						<a href="https://jcs.org/openbsd-laptops">laptops</a>
						for many years, the small resolution was not ideal and modern macOS is
						definitely not tuned for 1x resolutions anymore.</p>
					<h3 id="exposed-ports">Exposed Ports</h3>
					<p>It's a very minor gripe, but I would have liked some sort of covers to fill in
						the space between the DockLite's new ports (or lack thereof) and the iMac's
						bottom case cutouts.
						No one's going to see them anyway but for the money, it would have been nice to
						have that included.</p>
					<figure><a href="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-1500x678.jpg"><img src="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-680x307.jpg" srcset="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-680x307.jpg 1x, https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-1360x614@2x.jpg 2x" width="680" height="307"></a>
						<figcaption>DockLite ports</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<h3 id="screen-blanking">Screen Blanking</h3>
					<p>However, my biggest issue with the DockLite is that it doesn't support turning
						off the display via HDMI (DPMS or CEC or whatever this is).
						When the Mac Mini tries to blank the screen after inactivity, the DockLite keeps
						the backlight on showing a black screen.
						Juicy Crumb warns about this in the documentation saying to tap the power button
						on the back of the iMac (which pushes the power button on the DockLite board)
						to turn off the screen since leaving it on all the time will damage it.
						This was going to get pretty annoying since I would like to leave the machine on
						all the time but I wouldn't be using it very often, so I would like the display
						to turn off and back on automatically when I need it.</p>
					<p>On the upside, the DockLite <em>does</em> support adjusting the LCD's backlight level
						via USB through a
						<a href="https://juicycrumb.com/juicy-link/">custom macOS application</a>
						rather than having to press the buttons on the back of the iMac.</p>
					<h2 id="upgrading-the-screen">Upgrading the Screen</h2>
					<p>With these faults in mind, I decided to ditch the DockLite and go with a custom
						screen upgrade.
						With a different LCD and appropriate driver board, I could get a higher
						resolution with better color and gain screen blanking.
						By eliminating the DockLite, I could then remove the iMac's internal power
						supply which otherwise takes up a large portion of the upper part of the dome.
						That would then free up enough room inside the iMac to store the Mac Mini
						without modifying it (as Sean had to in his YouTube video).</p>
					<p>Browsing eBay, I found the
						<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/295880001215">Sharp LQ170R1JX42</a>,
						a 4K 3840x2400 17" LCD originally used in the Dell XPS 17.
						This would provide a 2x resolution of 1920x1200 in the same outer footprint of
						the iMac's original LCD and fit behind the screen bezel.
						An appropriate
						<a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807092859241.html">eDP driver board</a>
						would connect the LCD to the Mac Mini over HDMI or USB-C.</p>

						<figcaption>LQ170R1JX42 with eDP driver</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Once I confirmed the new LCD and driver worked with the Mac Mini, I disassembled
						the iMac to swap its screen.
						The original LCD is quite heavy and is about 1/2" thick due to its CCFL
						backlight.
						The new LCD with its LED backlight is so light and thin, I didn't even bother
						making a frame to attach it to the bezel, I just secured it with tape and then
						mounted the controller to the back of it.</p>

					<h2 id="imac-neck">iMac Neck</h2>
					<p>Once the new LCD was working over USB-C, I ran into the problem of having to get
						the new cable run inside of the iMac's articulating neck.
						The cables connecting to the original LCD are run inside the neck assembly
						during manufacturing and then connectors are added afterward since they are too
						large to fit through the small openings at the top and bottom of the neck.
						Unfortunately this meant I had to cut these original cables to get them out, and
						it also made it difficult to run a USB-C cable through it.</p>
					<p>The smallest diameter of the neck hinge is about 9mm where it meets the dome,
						but most USB-C/Thunderbolt cables I tried had at least a width of about 12mm.
						Even after trimming off the rubber/silicone of some of them, they often had a
						PCB or other stuff inside that was wider than the connector.</p>
					<center>

							<figcaption>Smallest opening at the neck base</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</center>
					<p>The 9mm opening is on a flange that slides inside the base of the neck and is
						where the dome attaches to the neck with 5 screws.
						It tapers to a smaller opening at the top because there is usually a sleeve that
						goes around it to make rotating smoother, though it's not really needed in my
						experience.
						I figured I could make a new piece like it and make it not taper, allowing the
						inner wall to be thinner and its opening wider, ultimately allowing the USB-C
						cable to pass through it.</p>
					<p>I took some measurements and
						<a href="https://jcs.org/notes/2025/01/27/3lgqyqymzrk2x">modeled</a>
						the flange in Tinkercad, then did a bunch of 3D prints making tiny adjustments
						each time.
						I suppose I'm more of a "measure once, cut 14 times" person.</p>

					<p>Although it's not load bearing (it is sandwiched between the steel openings at
						the top of the dome and bottom of the neck assembly), I wanted the new flange to
						be made out of something stronger than my 3D printer could produce.
						Once my prototyping was done, I sent the design off to
						<a href="https://jlccnc.com/">JLCCNC</a>
						to get it machined out of 6061 aluminum.
						Their engineer said the thin wall of the vertical tube had to be thicker to get
						safely machined, so although the opening ended up not being as wide as I
						wanted, it still allowed a USB-C cable to pass through.</p>
					<p>It took a few weeks to machine since I was doing this during Chinese New Year.
						Although I didn't like the bead-blasted finish which immediately scuffed up, it
						fit perfectly and the dome could securely attach to the neck.</p>

					<p>Once the top was all put back together, I could now focus on mounting the Mac

					<p>I modeled a new circular piece to replace the Juicy Crumb DockLite board and

					<p>While every tech reviewer complained about the M4 Mac Mini's power button being
						moved to the bottom, it was actually beneficial to me when putting it inside the
						iMac.  Underneath the iMac is a removable panel that originally gave access to
						the upgradeable RAM and AirPort slots, but I no longer need it.</p>
					<p>By mounting the Mac Mini rotated a bit, the power button is now accessible from
						the bottom of the iMac and can be pressed just by tilting up the left side of
						the iMac a bit.
						Since I would only need to press this button on rare occasions, I figured this
						would be easier than having to disassemble the Mac Mini to solder an external
						power button to it.</p>

					<p>I didn't want to have to open the iMac to reach certain ports, so I bought some
						short extension cables for the IEC C7/C8 power port, ethernet, and one
						Thunderbolt port.
						For now they are just slightly hanging out the back but I'd like to 3D print
						some sort of bracket to hold them all in place just behind the port openings and
						fill in the voids.</p>

					<p>Aside from having to make the rear port bracket, I thought it also might be neat
						to make use of the flip-down optical drive door to put some USB ports behind it.</p>
					<p>The eDP LCD controller currently has an annoying "feature" where once the
						display goes to sleep, it shows a blue screen with "No Signal" shown for about
						10 seconds before completely shutting off.
						From what I've read, it's possible to disable this in the firmware but I'm
						still trying to figure out how to modify that.</p>

   <p>The <em>Washington Post</em>'s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, announced a sweeping new libertarian vision for the paper's opinion sections on Wednesday, just four months after his decision to kill a presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris triggered hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel.</p>   <p><em>Post</em> Opinions Editor David Shipley, whom Bezos recruited from Bloomberg Opinions in 2022, chose to resign rather than stay to oversee the paper's revamped sections.</p>   <p>"We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets," Bezos <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088" target="_blank"><u>wrote in a memo to staffers</u></a> announcing the changes. "We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others."</p>   
   <p>Newspaper op-ed sections have incorporated opposing views for years. The term "op-ed" is literally an abbreviation for pieces running "opposite the editorial pages" that often conflicted with a publisher's editorial line. But Bezos characterized that practice as outdated.</p>   <p>"There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views," Bezos said. "Today, the internet does that job."</p>   <h3>Shock inside the newsroom</h3>   <p>At an hour-long meeting with opinion writers, Shipley said he did not know what lay ahead, according to an attendee who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.</p>   <p>Shipley said he had wanted a "broader, pluralistic place," but that Bezos sought "a focused [opinion] report."</p>   <p>Bezos justified his decision in the memo to staffers. "I am of America and for America, and proud to be so," he wrote. "And a big part of America's success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else."</p>   <p>The decision sparked fresh shock and dismay at the paper. After senior news editors raised concerns at a meeting Wednesday, Executive Editor Matt Murray reassured them that Bezos had given no indication that he wanted to interfere with news coverage, according to two people with direct knowledge. A spokesperson for the <em>Post</em> confirmed his remarks.</p>

   <p>Later in the day, Murray sent a memo to the newsroom to underscore the point: "The independent and unbiased work of The Post's newsroom remains unchanged, and we will continue to pursue engaging impactful journalism without fear or favor." (Murray and Bezos did not reply to requests for comment.)</p>   <p><em>Post</em> Associate Editor David Maraniss, a legendary journalist whose association with the newspaper stretches back more than four decades, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidmaraniss.bsky.social/post/3lj3o3ozerc2d" target="_blank"><u>wrote on Bluesky</u></a> that he would never write for it again as long as Bezos owns it.</p>   
   <p>"One pernicious step after another, Bezos encroached on the <em>Post</em> editorial policy," Maraniss wrote. "Today he seized it fully. The old <em>Washington Post</em> is gone."</p>   <p>Former senior managing editor Cameron Barr, who had been editing projects for the paper, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cameron-barr-72093bb0_today-i-am-ending-my-professional-association-activity-7300598172819546112-TjW-?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAB91b0BakuuTKmXlgSzUTCFIqDVZDWUq6o" target="_blank">announced on LinkedIn that he was severing ties with the <em>Post</em></a>. He wrote that Bezos's changes amount to "an unacceptable erosion of its commitment to publishing a healthy diversity of opinion and argument."</p>   <p>One writer for the opinions section told NPR he was "heartsick," adding, "leadership matters."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>NPR spoke to six people with direct knowledge of events for this article. They were given the ability to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters at the paper.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Shipley did not respond to requests for comment. According to a person with direct knowledge, Shipley told Bezos that the new approach would violate the <em>Post</em>'s promise of holding power to account.</p>   <h3>Bezos new approach differs dramatically  from first Trump term</h3>   <p>Bezos stood by the newspaper's dogged reporting on the first Trump administration. In that period, the <em>Post </em>adopted the motto "Democracy Dies in Darkness." It won Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2022/05/09/pulitzer-prize-public-service/" target="_blank">Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol</a> and, earlier, of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/04/16/feature/washington-post-wins-pulitzer-prizes-for-roy-moore-investigation-russia-reporting/" target="_blank">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election.</p>   <p>His business interests, however, have billions of dollars in dealings with the federal government. And Trump's regulators have made clear they intend to take an active role. </p>   <p>Bezos' decision in October to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris" target="_blank">kill the Harris editorial</a> sparked a furor inside and outside the paper, leading editorial writers to resign and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5248299/cartoonist-quits-wapo-over-bezos-trump-cartoon-washingtonpost" target="_blank">more than 300,000</a> people to cancel their digital subscriptions in a matter of days. (The <em>Post </em>says it has been able to win some subscribers back and garner some new subscribers in the opening weeks of Trump's second term.)</p>   <div id="resg-s1-50914">

                David Shipley resigned as opinions editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> after owner Jeff Bezos declared he wanted the section to focus only on supporting "personal liberties and free markets." In this 2024 photo, Shipley and the newsroom celebrate winning three Pulitzer Prizes.

   <p>As a practical matter, Shipley argued to Bezos, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s highly pro-markets pages have had a similar policy for decades. As with the decision not to publish the endorsement of Harris, Shipley's arguments fell on deaf ears.</p>   
   <p>In his memo to staff, Bezos praised Shipley and wrote that he offered the editor the chance to lead the reformed sections. "I suggested to him if the answer wasn't 'hell yes,' then it had to be 'no,'" Bezos wrote.</p>   <p>The <em>Post</em> has aggressively covered the new administration. But Bezos appears to have embraced the president's return to power. Bezos personally paid $1 million toward Trump's inaugural fund. He and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez traveled to Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to socialize with the Trumps. And, along with other digital chieftains, Bezos sat behind the president as he was sworn in for a second term.</p>   <h3>Opinions editor repeatedly in tough spot</h3>   <p>Shipley's two-and-a-half years have brought acclaim for the section, with two Pulitzer Prizes and two Loeb Awards. But his standing was deeply undercut by Bezos's recent decisions, especially over the Harris endorsement.</p>   <p>When Shipley decided to withhold a cartoon from the Pulitzer-winning staffer Ann Telnaes about Bezos from publication, he told colleagues he believed he was making a decision on the merits, not pulling his punches. The cartoon depicted Bezos abasing himself along with other tech titans before Trump.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-103" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force," Shipley said in a statement shared at the time with NPR. "My decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column — this one a satire — for publication. The only bias was against repetition."</p>   <p>Shipley told colleagues privately that he understood, given the moment, it might be hard to credit his actual motivations.</p>   <p>The paper <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/26/nx-s1-5166062/washington-post-endorsement-controversy" target="_blank">has bled veteran talent</a> from both the opinion and news sides since the news broke about the killed editorial. <em>Post</em> journalists left for the <em>Atlantic</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, and CNN among other outlets.</p>   
   <p>But <em>Post </em>Publisher and Chief Executive Will Lewis celebrated the change in direction on Wednesday. Lewis previously served for six years in the same role at the <em>Journal</em>, which is owned by Trump ally and conservative media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He has advocated for a similar approach at the <em>Post</em>. </p>   <p>Bezos hired Lewis, in significant part, due to his belief the British journalist could build better bridges to Trump and to conservatives. As well as serving Murdoch as an executive for a decade, Lewis was previously editor of the conservative <em>Telegraph </em>in the U.K. and later served as a consultant for Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-104" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency, and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every Day," Lewis said in a note to staff. "This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fire Red Agent</h2><a id="user-content-fire-red-agent" aria-label="Permalink: Fire Red Agent" href="#fire-red-agent"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is my attempt at getting a large language model to play Pokémon FireRed autonomously. My bot has rudementery capabilities to play the game, explore, battle, and respond to game events.</p>
<p dir="auto">To me, this is the future of TV. While building the bot, I felt like I was producing television more than I was programming a computer. Ultimately, I ran into some technical hurdles around programmatic input control, which led me to pause development.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fire-red-agent/FIRE_RED_PROMO.mp4" rel="nofollow">Watch the demo video.</a>
<a href="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fire-red-agent/HD+project+walkthrough+(taylors+version).mp4" rel="nofollow">Watch the technical deep dive.</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Emulator Integration</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I used <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/" rel="nofollow">RetroArch</a> to run Pokémon FireRed. I struggled with sending inputs programmatically. RetroArch has a UDP-based input system (<a href="https://docs.libretro.com/library/remote_retropad/" rel="nofollow">RetroPad</a>), but I couldn't get it to work reliably.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, I resorted to using <a href="https://ss64.com/mac/osascript.html" rel="nofollow">OSA Script (AppleScript)</a> to send keyboard events to the emulator, which meant the game had to be in focus. This was a huge limitation because it took over my entire computer, making background work impossible.</p>
<ol start="2" dir="auto">
<li>Game Memory Management</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I stored game state in a database, treating it like a diary of the AI’s experiences. The system recorded actions the AI attempted, what worked, what didn’t, and adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto">There were four different types of memories, and the AI pulled the most recent 250 to maintain context. If an action failed—like trying to walk somewhere and hitting an obstacle—the AI would remember and avoid making the same mistake.</p>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Navigation &amp; Pathfinding</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The AI needed to figure out where to go in the game world. I extracted map data by reading game memory from RetroArch. I then used a pathfinding algorithm to determine the best route. The AI only considered valid movement options based on tiles and available paths. If stuck, it defaulted to trying adjacent moves (e.g., "walk south", "walk east", etc.).</p>
<ol start="4" dir="auto">
<li>Game Text Parsing</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To understand the game, the AI needed to read in-game text. Since I wasn’t using direct memory extraction for text (as advised by <a href="https://pret.github.io/" rel="nofollow">PRET</a>), I took screenshots at key points and processed them with OCR.</p>
<p dir="auto">This allowed the AI to understand NPC conversations, menu prompts, and other critical game events. This was super important, as it guided the LLM to know what to do next.</p>
<ol start="5" dir="auto">
<li>LLM Integration</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I used OpenAI’s GPT-4o to process all the gathered information and make decisions.System prompts guided the AI to avoid repeated actions (e.g., trying to pick Charmander before meeting Professor Oak multiple times). The model received structured data about current location, possible actions, game memories, and navigation options. I experimented with frequency and presence penalties to encourage varied behavior and prevent getting stuck in loops.</p>
<ol start="6" dir="auto">
<li>Battle Handling</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The battle handler was quite naive. All it was doing was pressing A. if the battle lasted longer than a minute, we began sending some random inputs to get out of the battle. This was an area I wanted to improve, but my priority was getting the AI to navigate the world first.</p>
<ol start="7" dir="auto">
<li>Interaction &amp; Conversation Handling</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">When talking to NPCs, the AI needed to determine if it should continue the conversation or move on. The conversation handler took screenshots, extracted text, and checked whether dialogue was still ongoing.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the AI detected text, it continued pressing A. If no new text appeared, it moved on to the next part of the script.</p>

<p dir="auto">The biggest hurdle was sending inputs to the emulator.</p>
<p dir="auto">RetroArch’s UDP input (RetroPad) didn’t work for me.</p>
<p dir="auto">Keyboard-based input (OSA Script) required focus, making automation impractical.</p>
<p dir="auto">Python-based solutions (like PiBoy) exist, but I prefer Ruby and struggled with existing Python tools freezing up.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project was both a nightmare and a ton of fun. As LLMs get better this is only going to get easier. I believe that Claude Plays Pokemon isn't doing any of the memory parsing I spent a ton of time, they are just streaming the memory directly to Claude 3.7 and it is figuring it out 🤯. If you find this work interesting, feel free to fork it, modify it, and build something even better!</p>

<p>Your camera has the ability to take three dimensional photos. Your screen has the ability to display three dimensional photos. You’ve probably never used either. This isn’t a hidden feature of some new phone hardware release, it’s a feature of your brain. All your brain needs to see in 3D is two pictures, and you can trick your brain into seeing 3D on a flat screen using just your eye muscles. I will teach you how. I’ll also tell you why you should.</p>



<h2>Binocular Vision, and Faking It</h2>



<p>Around a third of your brain is devoted to vision, and accordingly, it is amazing at it. From just the two small 2D images that are sent to your brain from the backs of your eyeballs, your brain reconstructs the entire 3D scene that you experience when you look around. Because your eyes are a few inches apart, they see two different views of the same scene, and those two views are all your brain needs. Distance causes objects to shift relative to each other when you see them from different angles. You can see this most clearly by moving your head from side to side and watching how things move. Your brain uses that discrepancy between the two views of your two eyes to reconstruct depth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because your brain has this power, all you need to do to see an image in 3D is to send different images to each eye. It doesn’t matter how you do it. Every 3D display technology works this way, the only difference between them is how they get each image to only one eye.</p>



<p>Red/Blue 3D glasses filter out images that have the same color as the plastic lens. Modern 3D movies use polarizing filters, but the principle is the same. Two images are projected using orthogonal polarizations of light, and are filtered out by lenses in the glasses with the opposite polarization. Holograms show different images at different angles, and your eyes are at different angles. VR goggles put separate images on the screens in front of each eye that correspond to the views of two eye-spaced cameras in the virtual world.</p>



<h2>Seeing Cross Views</h2>



<p>If you don’t have any fancy technology, that doesn’t matter. You have eyes, a camera, eye muscles, and a brain, and it turns out that’s all you need.</p>

<p>If you have two images that show the views from two different positions, all you have to do to see the objects in 3D is to have one eye look at one image, and the other eye look at the other, and your brain will do the rest. You can do this either by crossing your eyes a little bit, or diverging your eyes a little bit. Most people have only ever deliberately controlled their eye muscles to cross their eyes, so find that to be easier. Accordingly most stereograms are designed to look correct when you cross your eyes. To use the other method the images have to be swapped or the 3D effect will be inverted.</p>

<p>Doing it correctly feels like this: First the images split in two, and you’ll see flickering blurry copies of both images slightly offset from each other. Then as you cross your eyes more, eventually the two images in the middle will align. The center image will resolve into a clear 3D image, with two flickering copies of it next to them.</p>



<p>If you aren’t sure how to do this, there are two good ways. The easiest, if you are comfortable crossing your eyes, is just to cross your eyes slowly, so you can stop when the images align. If you aren’t comfortable crossing your eyes, then the best way is to focus on something in front of the picture, and hope that the images align on top of each other as a side effect. You can do this by holding your finger substantially in front of the image, and focusing solely on the finger with your eyes, while turning your mind’s attention to the image behind it while keeping your eyes still. This is hard to do right, so it might be easier to learn to cross your eyes first.</p>



<h2>Making Cross Views</h2>



<p>All you need is two pictures taken from two different positions shifted horizontally. The easiest way to do this is to take a picture, take a small step to the left or right, and take another picture. If the object is close, you only need to move the camera a few inches. If the object is far away you may need to take a full step to the side. How far you step will determine how strong the depth effect is, which is ultimately a matter of taste. A stronger depth effect makes the result more dramatic, but makes the image harder to resolve when you cross your eyes.</p>

<p>To turn the image into a cross view, you just need to put the images next to each other. Any way you do this is fine, even just looking at the two pictures next to each other in your camera roll. If the 3D effect looks backwards, just swap the images. There is free software that can do a better job by aligning the images automatically, adding borders, and allowing easy adjustments, <a href="https://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/">Stereo Photo Maker</a> for Windows or OSX, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kra2008.crosscam">Cross Cam</a> for Android.</p>



<h2>Why bother? Isn’t 3D just a gimmick?</h2>



<p>3D has mostly been a gimmick. 3D movies use the depth effect mainly to throw things at you and make you flinch, not to add to the art. But every sense we have should have art in it, and our depth perception has been shortchanged. Depth is such an immature medium that we haven’t gotten past the kind of whiz bang novelty of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Arriv%C3%A9e_d%27un_train_en_gare_de_La_Ciotat">The Arrival of the Train</a>. (Notable exceptions to this are Avatar and Half Life: Alyx, which are enormously enhanced by being in 3D.) It is a huge part of how we experience the world, we shouldn’t give up on it.</p>



<p>There are some things that just can’t look the same without depth. To photograph a forest, and convey anything like the experience of being there, you need the world to give you other visual cues to add depth to the image, like fog. The world usually doesn’t do this, and as a result nearly every photograph of a forest looks like a flat disorganized mess. Add depth, and suddenly all the complexity and beauty reappears. You can show people what a forest is for the first time.</p>

<p>To photograph a cave, and convey the layers and scale of the rock, you need clever lighting, and even then it usually fails. The geometry of a cave is too unusual for cues like lighting and shadow to work reliably. The rocks are all the same color. Add depth, and there is no more ambiguity. The shapes take shape.</p>

<p>Depth literally adds another dimension to the composition. You’re no longer just positioning objects to lead the eye around the page, but also to lead the eye through space. What compositions could we create with this? Architecture or stage plays probably have more to tell us about this than visual art does. But it’s mostly still brand new and wide open. Go explore!</p>

<h2>Parallel Views</h2>



<p>If you are able to diverge your eyes instead of crossing them, then arranging the images the opposite way can give you a more relaxing and more natural stereo effect. This corresponds to focusing past the image instead of in front of it. There is an upper limit to how far you can physically diverge your eyes, they can’t go past infinity, so parallel view images need to be smaller to take up less of your viewing area.</p>

Ordinarily, we might associate the sensation with passing strangers on the street, but recently I’ve been experiencing it most intensely when looking at old photographs. </span></p><p>Which brings me to the work of a little-known photographer, Frederick Monsen.</p><p>Monsen was born in Bergen, Norway, in 1865, but emigrated with his parents to Utah Territory when he was only three. He grew up in the West during the time for which it is most famous, when it was adventurous, wild, and still dangerous. As a teenager, Monsen became fascinated with the new art form of his day, photography, and was soon accompanying land surveys as an informal tagalong, helping shoot the landscape and its inhabitants. Soon it became a full time vocation and he joined expeditions heading to Alaska, Yukon, and Central America. But the area that became his speciality was the American Southwest; he was drawn back to its deserts, mesas, and canyons again and again over the course of his life.</p><p>Over the course of those decades, Monsen became deeply fascinated with the Native Americans of that region, eventually joining a group of other photographers (together known as the ‘Pasadena Eight’) in documenting their way of life before it was changed irrevocably. Fortunately, by the time Monsen began his ethnographic project, which spanned the years 1886-1911, Kodak had developed a handheld box camera as well as roll and cartridge film, making it easier than ever before to be spontaneous in shooting film. Hence, the Norwegian-American was able to capture his subjects in more natural, candid moments, contrasting the more typical stiff and staged shots that were common at the time.</p><p>Across Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico, Monsen documented the people and landscapes of the land he loved most. He captured his subjects, whether Navajo, Tigua, Apache, Hopi, Zuni, surveyors, prospectors, Mormons, missionaries, pioneers, or fortune seekers, with a degree of pathos that’s rare from that era of photography.</p><p>As you look through his images below, you may find yourself realising that all of those faces once belonged to people whose lives were as rich and varied as your own. It may occur to you that nothing besides remains of their stories, except perhaps these images and Monsen’s scrawled captions. Who were they? What were their hopes and dreams? Did they live full, happy lives? We can only guess.</p><h5><strong><span>(All photographs in this post are courtesy of </span><a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c869753j/entire_text/" rel="">Huntington

Link, who had spent most of the past half century playing gin rummy by the side of the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, in Los Angeles. For forty-two years, from the time he discovered the hotel, in 1950, until it closed, last December 30th, Irving’s days had been as well ordered and as predictable as the Sun King’s. At seven o’clock every morning, wearing one of the many perfectly fitted tropical-weight suits that have been a special affection of his since a memorable day in the nineteen-thirties, he would stroll over from his house, in the lower reaches of Beverly Hills; enter the hotel under the long, sloping green-and-white striped awning that extended all the way from the driveway, above Sunset Boulevard, to the main entrance; turn right in the lobby; and arrive at the Polo Lounge. Often he and the hostess, Bernice Philbin, would be the first two people there, and they would have a polite conversation before Irving took his place in his booth—the first half circle to your left as you came in—and ordered breakfast: scrambled eggs back in the days when people ate eggs, and, more recently, banana and granola with skim milk.</p><p>Occasionally, when the weather was particularly fine, he would take his breakfast outside, under the great Brazilian peppertree on the curving flagstone Polo Lounge patio. Then, at around nine, he would stroll back through the lobby and follow the curving, carpeted stairs down to the lower hallway, where he would stop to say good morning to all the people in the downstairs shops: to Tony, the barber, for instance, who would just be laying out his razors and scissors, and Amir, the haberdasher, who specialized in cashmere coats with chinchilla linings, and who would often be at work on a new suit for Irving. Then Irving would walk out through the glass door at the end of the hallway into the allée of jacarandas and bougainvilleas that led to the Beverly Hills Hotel pool. He would wave good morning to Sven Peterson and his pool crew, who would be scrutinizing visitors from the safety of a small, tollhouse-style booth, and walk down the concrete steps toward the pool itself. One of the pool boys would scamper ahead to “set up” a chaise for Irving—that is, drape a flamingo-colored towel over the chair’s buff-colored vinyl—on the south, or sunny, side of the pool while Irving went over to his cabana, on the opposite side, to change into his swimming trunks. Then he would sunbathe for a few hours on the chaise. At noon, Irving would retire again to his cabana and change for lunch, which he would occasionally eat under an umbrella-shaded table in the Patio Club, or sometimes at the Bistro Garden, on Canon Drive, a favorite spot of his. After lunch, Irving would return to the cabana, change again—usually into what is called “resort wear”—and set up a table just outside for the gin game. On any reasonably sunny day, the pool would by then be echoing with the names of well-known people being called to the phone, as well as with the names of unknown people being called to the phone by themselves in the forlorn hope that one day this would help them become well known, too.</p><p>From his vantage in front of his cabana, Irving could not only watch the parade go by but get the parade to sit down with him and play cards. Over the years, his gin game included Hollywood luminaries ranging from Tony Martin to such lesser figures as Ken Berg, the Koo-Koo-Roo King. Irving is an inordinately polite man, and words like “starlets,” “moguls,” and “kibitzers” never cross his lips; the world he saw was one in which, as he put it, “magnificent-looking young women, full of theatrical drive,” lay on chaises in order to impress many of the astute businessmen who had decided to “take a fling in the picture business.” All through the day, Irving’s own business—a hard-to-follow mixture of liquor distribution, real-estate deal making, and all-around middleman stuff—would be unhurriedly intertwined with all his other activities, like creepers rising on a trellis.</p><p>Irving would play cards until sunset. Most days, in fact, he and Sven closed the pool together. Then Irving would either walk back home to his wife and two children, or, after his wife died, in 1990, change yet again, and have dinner at the Bistro Garden.</p><p>Except for a brief period in the early sixties—when Irving, through no fault of his own, became trapped in the contest between Bobby Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa and was in effect banished for a while by Kennedy from the Polo Lounge—one day of Irving’s has been almost exactly like the next. By the end of 1992, he had spent approximately fifteen thousand days by the side of the pool. (Irving has never learned how to swim.) “I guess I’m a creature of habit,” he says.</p><p>In recent years, people would come by the pool and ask to meet Irving, just so they could say that they had at last met a man who had it all figured out. His circle of admirers, probably larger than that of any other man who has spent his days by the side of a pool, extended from the pool boys (“I’m in awe of him,” one of them said the week before Christmas, watching Irving sun himself on an icy Southern California morning. “He’s what—ninety?” Eighty-seven, actually. “And he’s sunproof. He’s cancer-proof. What does he do? How does he make his money? How does he do it?”) all the way to Richard Koshalek, the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, who has admired Irving from an aesthetic distance, as though he were a Diebenkorn seascape. “It’s one of the great performance pieces in Los Angeles history,” Koshalek says. “He exemplifies something important about L.A., which is that the fragmentation of the city, which everyone always decries, also means that there are these remarkable subcultures all around, where people with very specific, amazing plumage flourish.”</p><p>Last December 30th, however, the Sultan of Brunei, who has owned the Beverly Hills Hotel since 1988, decided to close it—for reasons that are either sensible and as plain as day, if you ask people who work for the Sultan now, or murky and irrational, if you ask people who were working for him up until December 30th. Officially, the hotel will be closed for renovations for two years—“twenty-four months” is the formula the Sultan’s people prefer—but there are people who think that it may be closed much longer, or even for good. Irving now has to figure out another way of spending his days: Louis XIV expelled from Versailles and shuffling back and forth among other guys’ châteaux.</p><p>“The Sultan is the only owner of the hotel in the past forty years who has not been a close personal friend of mine,” Irving said one morning in the last week of December, as he sat at breakfast in the now nearly empty Polo Lounge. “Manny Borenstein, Ben Silberstein, Marvin Davis—I played cards with them all. I wish the Sultan and I might have sat down together. My experience with potentates is larger than you might think. I once had a maharaja as a warm personal friend. Now, observing the Sultan’s policy, I’d say that he is a very astute businessman.” Irving toyed, a little sadly, with his banana and granola. “And in the long run what we all have to believe is that this sabbatical will prove to be an extremely astute move, and that we’ll all be grateful when we recommence in two years. If it is astute, however, I don’t yet grasp <em>how</em> it’s astute. I run the figures through my head very often, and the project doesn’t cost out in terms of what he paid, what he’ll have to invest, and how hard it will be to reassemble this—this magnificent cast of characters and memories and associations.” He stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the peppertree, dominating the abandoned Polo Lounge patio. Then he went on, “Of course, what we’re all learning—” By “we,” Irving meant the hotel regulars, who are now being dispossessed—a group for which he serves as a sort of unpaid, ex-officio chairman, and on all of whom he has bestowed royal titles: Sven Peterson the Pool Prince, Bernice Philbin the Queen of the Polo Lounge, Chris Dunn the Crown Prince of Parking. “What we’re all learning is something new. Which is that if you’re a sultan it really doesn’t matter how astute you are. If you’re a sultan, you get to do whatever you want to do. Astuteness is somehow not your problem in life.”</p><p>Irving is one part Meyer Wolfshiem, one part Colonel Stingo, and eight parts everything your grandfather in Fort Lauderdale would dream of being if only he could get loose from your grandmother. He is certainly the best-dressed eighty-seven-year-old in America. He is slim, has beautiful, almost silver-white hair, a dashing white mustache, which recalls those of the rakish leading men of the forties—Cesar Romero or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.—and a wardrobe that extends into new vistas of rococo elegance every time you see him. His appreciation of fine clothes is mostly untouched by narcissism. Spying an old friend just arrived at the hotel and wearing, let’s say, a white linen suit with a blue shirt and a flowered Liberty print tie—nothing much at all, really—Irving, dressed in a black cashmere Edwardian coat, chocolate kid gloves, and a camel’s-hair scarf, might pause before crossing the lobby and, after a warm handshake, say, “I didn’t want to come over too quickly. I was having too much pleasure in admiring that wonderful suit you’re wearing, and observing how perfectly you’ve accessorized it.”</p><p>On the Tuesday of that last week, I met Irving at the hotel (we had become friends several years before), got into his gold Lexus, and drove off with him to have lunch at the Bistro Garden. On the drive, which, in the best Beverly Hills tradition, took us eight blocks, Irving began to hum. “Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few,” he sang under his breath as we waited at a light and looked out across the depopulated streets. “I’m thinking of moving to the Beverly Hilton. Have you seen it? It’s the white building on Santa Monica Boulevard. Merv Griffin owns it, and it seems to be a promising place. I’d be grateful to have your view. What I’m thinking of right now is: have breakfast at the Century Plaza and then move to the Beverly Hilton for the gin game in the afternoon.” The thought of breaking up his day seemed to depress him a little, and he sank into silence, until he spotted a mild, ferrety man slowly walking up Canon Drive. “Now, there’s a very good friend of mine,” he said. “One of the most astute businessmen and lawyers in California.” He slowed the car and gave a honk on the horn. The man stopped and turned warily. He cautiously tried to make out who was inside the car, and then, spotting Irving at last, broke into a smile and gave a solid, official wave. Then he walked on. “That’s my good friend the legendary Sidney Korshak,” Irving explained. “He was Hoffa’s lawyer, and played a part in my dark years, which I’ll tell you about at some point.”</p><p>We walked together into the Bistro Garden. Irving said a warm hello to the owner and then to the tuxedoed maître d’, and took his usual table, on the edge of the garden. He ordered his lunch—baked whitefish—and began to talk about how he had come to spend so much of his life at the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>“My story begins on the Lower East Side of New York,” he said. “That’s where I was born, the ninth child of a rather important rabbi. I was the only one of the family who was born in New York—everyone else had begun life in Vienna. My father died when I was twenty, and the truth is that I never really felt I knew him well, though he was, I’m told, an exceptionally astute Talmudic scholar, and he did like to play cards.” Irving smiled. He was wearing a navy-blue pin-striped suit whose stripes were outlined in gold thread; a hand-painted silk tie decorated in a soft pattern derived from Monet’s water lilies; a shirt with fine red checks and a white collar, and with the points of the collar edged in the same red check; a cream cashmere vest; and a pocket square in the same hand-painted water-lily pattern as his tie. Small gold threads ran through the pocket square, and his cuffs were closed with two shields of silver, with his initials, “IVL,” set into them, and a small stone to punctuate each monogram.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In August, 1933, when he was twenty-seven, Irving married Nan Ofgang at his older sister’s house, in Brooklyn. “I had to borrow ten dollars to pay the rabbi,” he said. “We had nothing but guts and faith, and my wife had a job at the cosmetics department at the Thrifty Drug Company. I had heard from a friend, however, about a novelty company that had gone broke and abandoned a million units of a fortune-telling device in a warehouse in New York. This was called the Fortunscope. I borrowed money to lay claim to the inventory, and Nan and I decided to go on the road. There were a million Fortunscopes in that warehouse, and I was determined to sell them all. Now, the Fortunscope was a device in which you spun an arrow and found your fortune. All the fortunes were complimentary. I had a sample case, and would offer the Fortunscope to retailers. Once they placed an order, I would send it back to the New York warehouse, and Fortunscopes would be shipped to the retailer. It was a painstaking business: a gross to a department store, a dozen Fortunscopes to small five-and-dimes. I bought them for two cents and sold them for fifteen cents. In our first two years, we couldn’t afford sleeping cars, so we slept sitting up, in the day coach.</p><p>“Oh, those were wonderful days, though! We travelled from Philadelphia to Seattle, through the Middle West, Minnesota, and the various Dakotas. We were determined to visit every city with a population of more than twenty-five thousand. It was one day in some small city in one of the Carolinas—I can no longer remember which—that I was walking down a street and saw three magnificent Palm Beach suits in the window of a men’s store. One was cream, one was white, and one was navy. I went in and bought them all, eighteen dollars apiece. I’ve tried never to be badly dressed since.</p><p>“Our odyssey ended here, in California, where I took the stake we had made through the Fortunscope and went into the dress business. We liked California, but we both became homesick and decided to try moving back East. We actually found a house in Connecticut, and were ready to close on it. But then thoughts of California filled our heads. So we tossed a coin to see where we should go, and it turned up heads—California. We came back out in 1949 and bought a little house here in Beverly Hills for six thousand dollars. By then my beautiful daughter, Gale, was born. I have a son, Rand, as well, who’s a dean at Sonoma State University. I’ve always been an early riser, and so one morning—not wanting to wake my wife and children—I slipped out of the house and went looking for breakfast. The hotel was at the bottom of the street, on Sunset Boulevard, so I slipped into the Polo Lounge and ordered breakfast, and my life at the hotel began that day.”</p><p>The Beverly Hills Hotel that Irving walked into that morning was, though Irving did not know it then, in the midst of a transformation. The hotel had been built in 1912, at a time when Beverly Hills was still essentially rural; in fact, the hotel was the first large building that the city had seen. It was decorated in the heavy, leadfooted style then called Mission Revival. The halls were uncarpeted, the rooms had exposed beams, and the hotel’s various amenities had a severe, purposeful look: the swimming pool was a place where people went to go swimming, and the Polo Lounge, which had been christened by Will Rogers, looked more or less like the kind of rough-hewn place in which you might actually wish to lounge after playing polo.</p><p>By 1941, the hotel had been in and out of bankruptcy, and it was bought by a consortium of show-business people headed by the banker Hernando Courtright, who decided to have the place remodelled in the style today loosely referred to as Deco but actually called by experts Coffee Shop Moderne. Courtwright had a new wing built along Crescent Road, on the east side of the hotel, and the interior of the hotel was redesigned: its hard Spanish angles were rounded off, and it became a paradise of curving stairs, recessed lighting, and pink and green stucco. The Fountain Coffee Shop, with its famous black S-shaped counter, was installed downstairs. A thirty-foot-high sign—“The Beverly Hills” inscribed in low relief in a looping, almost feminine cursive hand—was visible from Sunset.</p><p>It was during this period that the Beverly Hills Hotel pool achieved its familiar form. The pool was set in a tropical garden. On the eastern and western edges were three rows of lounge chairs; each group of three chairs was punctuated by a small table topped with translucent glass, and a telephone rested upon each table. At the north end, a small white fountain played all day. To the south, behind a hedge of lime trees in white urns, lay the Patio Club: ten white metal tables under umbrellas, with a small bar in the back, and eight shaded booths set into one side wall. On the west side of the pool were the cabanas—little tents with striped awnings, like jousting tournament pavilions. Each had a chair, a chaise of its own, and a small door leading to a changing room just behind. (A second group of cabanas was mounted, more discreetly, above the chaises on that side, nestled into a little overhanging promontory, like a Tibetan monastery; these upper cabanas were, by legend, favored by Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe and other movie stars who were either too chubby to be looked at or too nude to be respectable.) The only sounds at the pool—aside from soft piped-in classical music and the sound of people being paged—were the metallic whirring and put-put of the blender at the bar, preparing frozen drinks (it was a tradition for the pool boys to make the rounds of the chaises every day at two-thirty with sherbet freezes in the heraldic house colors, pink and green), the breeze in the palms, and the constant murmur of boastful, wheedling, confident monologue.</p><p>It is sometimes said that the heyday of the pool dates from the heyday of the great studios, but in fact its heyday was just after theirs: its high period occurred in the mid-fifties—the era of Sam Spiegel (who stayed in the hotel for a long time) and Joseph Levine (who did, too) and Stanley Kramer and the other independent producers who began to assemble films from the ground up. It was the era of “international” casts, freelance directors, and creative financing. There was a new kind of negotiating to be done, which required a neutral place to negotiate, and the place that a lot of people chose was the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>“Now, how I got my cabana had a great deal to do with what happened at the hotel,” Irving was saying. He and I had returned from lunch and were sitting together by the side of the pool. There would be no gin game that day; the regulars had all gone off to other hotels. The weather had turned unseasonably chilly; at certain moments, you could actually see your breath. But a solitary man in brown trunks, whom Irving referred to as the Hamburger Hamlet King, was lying bare-chested on a chaise on the other side of the pool. (“If you get yourself focussed in the sun,” he had said when we walked in, “it’s actually quite warming.”) “Looking back, in later years, it’s quite remarkable that I got my cabana at all,” Irving went on. “What happened was that Hernando Courtwright, who was responsible for the renovation, sold the hotel in 1953 to a couple of gentlemen from Detroit—Manny Borenstein and Ben Silberstein. Silberstein was a lawyer; Borenstein was a very astute businessman.” Irving’s tone implied that Silberstein was not. “They began to make a great deal of money. But Silberstein wanted to keep the profits for himself, and Borenstein wanted to plow the money back into the hotel. They quarrelled endlessly, for years, but neither could budge the other. Now, each had forty-five per cent, and two or three other people had the rest. Silberstein’s sister, for instance, owned two per cent. That turned out to be important, as you’ll see. They agreed to sell—Borenstein to Silberstein. Silberstein got a good deal, and Borenstein, as part of the package, got a ten-year lease, for no money, on a suite and a cabana. But his cabana was next to Silberstein’s, and by that time there was so much bad blood between them that he didn’t want to be anywhere near Silberstein, so he gave the cabana to me. We were friends. I had begun the gin game several years before, and Manny enjoyed it.</p><p>“So, because of the ill feeling and misunderstanding between Borenstein and Silberstein, I had my cabana, when only two or three years later grown men would have killed for that cabana. There were thirteen cabanas, and in summer months they were almost impossible to get, even at a hundred dollars a day. A cabana meant power, it meant glamour, it meant that you had a place in the world. Everyone came to the hotel then. Every important personality in the picture business. I knew them all. Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Buddy Rogers, Don Ameche.” Irving is essentially a democrat; Buddy Rogers and Clark Gable exist for him on more or less the same plane. “Orson Welles, Marlene Dietrich. How well I remember that memorable day when Dietrich broke the dress code in the Polo Lounge! Women were not allowed to wear slacks. It was an absolute prohibition. Now, Dietrich entered the loggia room in slacks.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“They let her in. She was Marlene Dietrich, after all.”</p><p>The Hamburger Hamlet King jogged over—there were goose bumps all over his almost purple tanned skin—and he and Irving began to talk. Then the Hamburger Hamlet King returned to his chaise and peremptorily summoned the one remaining pool boy. “Can you believe that? Only one,” Irving said. “Now, in those days the people who worked here at the hotel had influence. They had power. To get a good chaise from Sven, a good table from Bernice—well, grown men would plead with me to put in a good word for them. Even the parking was competitive. Who parked your car. It was in the nature of the picture business, you see, to be like that. It is a nest of insecurities. Now, I have sat here”—he waved toward the cabanas behind us—“for forty-two years and watched the picture business, and the thing that I have learned about the picture business is this: Keep out of the picture business. They can strip you naked and leave nothing behind. I knew everyone who mattered in the picture business, and the ones who made real money were the ones who expanded beyond the picture business.</p><p>“The only time I ever really got involved in the picture business was when several gentlemen were making a picture with Hal Holbrook called ‘The Kidnapping of the President.’ They came to me to see if I could introduce them to anyone who could help with the financing. Well, at that point I wanted to do something surprising for my grandchildren, so I encouraged these gentlemen, and they offered me a bit part in the picture, as an Air Force general. When the picture came out, my grandchildren were delighted.</p><p>“Now, I was explaining how the hotel came to be sold to the Sultan, which has led us to all this. You see, the two daughters of Silberstein inherited the hotel, and one of them, Seema, at the time of Silberstein’s death was married to Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who was also very astute, decided to sell the hotel. The sisters didn’t get along—the Beverly Hills Hotel curse, you could call this. So he bought the two per cent the aunt still had—you recall the aunt I mentioned?—and got it for himself. The balance had tipped, and now he could sell the hotel. There were two real bids: one from the Sultan of Brunei and one from my good friend Marvin Davis, whom I once tried to help buy CBS. Marvin—do you know Marvin? Well, in addition to being a wonderfully astute businessman he’s—” Irving groped for a word. “He’s a wonderfully Falstaffian figure,” he said at last, delicately. “We had breakfast together once, and he asked me to teach him how to dress. I said, ‘Draw up a contract!’ But he never did. Anyway, Marvin Davis explained to me that both he and the Sultan of Brunei offered a hundred and thirty-five million, but that Muriel wanted to sell it to an American rather than to a foreigner. So Marvin bought the hotel. But it was only after he bought the hotel that they pursued the due diligence—checking the plumbing, the wiring, the corroding. He realized that it would take millions to fix it. ‘Irving,’ he told me, ‘I made a bad deal.’ Then he gets a call from the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan is still dying to buy the Beverly Hills Hotel. ‘Not for sale,’ Marvin says. He’s an astute Sultan, as sultans go, but no match for Marvin Davis. Marvin has nerves of steel. Of course, it’s much easier to have nerves of steel when you have money of gold. That’s a maxim of mine. So the Sultan ended up paying a lot more than a hundred and thirty-five million.</p><p>“It was too much to pay, of course—what the Sultan paid. People have a hard time understanding the hotel business. There’s an interesting sidelight to this story. Let’s go back to the late fifties, when Howard Hughes had three bungalows and twenty-one rooms permanently taken at the hotel, although he only visited for a few weeks each year. I used to observe Mr. Hughes going from one bungalow to another: one bungalow for Jean Peters, his wife; one for Hughes; and one for his mistress, who was rotated every month. Now, this is the interesting part. Ben Silberstein came to me upset, because he was going to have to throw Hughes out. Throw out Howard Hughes! I asked why. Because the rooms were not producing any income. No food, no services. Hughes thought that everybody must be holding him in awe because he had all those rooms, and in fact they were going to have to kick him out. So Hughes checked out, and went to Las Vegas. He was not terribly missed by any of us. My point is that the hotel business is not as simple as it looks. The Sultan owns the hotel, but he discovers that it needs work to bring it up to date. So he’ll spend millions. The problem is that if you close the hotel and spend the millions, by then all the regulars will have moved on—to the Hilton, the Peninsula, the Bel-Air. Did I mention to you that I was thinking of moving to the Hilton? I should go over and spend more time there before I decide. But I hate to leave the hotel.”</p><p>In its last weeks, there were only a dozen paying guests left in the Beverly Hills Hotel; Sven Peterson at one point was even seen waiting on tables at the Patio Club. The doors to the unoccupied rooms were often left open for hours by the maids, and, peering inside, you saw a kind of anthology of forlorn, forgotten de-luxe styles: rooms lined with mirrors and Buffet-like paintings; rooms with wall-to-wall shag carpeting; rooms with “Persian” rugs and small terraces; rooms that looked like sets for James Bond movies; rooms that looked like sets for Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies.</p><p>Over the past twelve months, the decision to close down the Beverly Hills Hotel and remodel it has been much argued over in Beverly Hills, but, Beverly Hills being Beverly Hills, the argument has taken a peculiarly Beverly Hills form, with much of the argument conducted in the weekly “giveaway” papers. The Beverly Hills community, which is heavily Jewish, has always mistrusted the Sultan, who is, of course, Muslim, and whose little, wealthy country has voted against Israel in the United Nations, and this larger mistrust took the local form of suspicion that he and his minions intended to destroy the hotel “landmarks”—the Polo Lounge and the pool, in particular. There were even dark rumors—not entirely implausible, given the shaky state of small Islamic principalities—that the Sultan wanted the hotel remodelled in order to have it ready to use as a palace in exile.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Most hotel people, however, think that the Sultan is doing what the Sultan has to do. “The whole thing began to come apart very quickly,” a hotel-business insider explained. “Until the mid-eighties, there was a ninety-per-cent occupancy rate, and the hotel wasn’t even allowed to be booked by tourist agencies. But then the occupancy rate declined suddenly and precipitously. What was happening was that the clientele was dying off, and it wasn’t being replaced by younger Hollywood people. The occupancy rate dropped into the mid-sixties. And the competitive situation became intolerable: the Beverly Wilshire was upgraded, and then the Beverly Hilton. The Beverly Hills, by comparison, still had—well, it still had window units instead of central air-conditioning.” (When you talk to Los Angeles hotel people, this issue comes up again and again: “window unit” is always pronounced a little sotto voce, in a tone that might be reserved in other hotel circles for the term “chamber pot.”)</p><p>Officially, the renovation of the hotel will include the construction of an underground parking lot and a reduction in the number of rooms. Each suite will have a “luxury” bathroom, with a double marble sink and a television. A fax machine will be installed in every suite. “People—show-business people—used to want a hotel that created an illusion of <em>leisure</em>,” one hotel man told me. “Welcoming your guest out onto the patio of your room for breakfast in your terry robe—that kind of thing. The Beverly Wilshire, though, pioneered an illusion of power, which is what wealthy people, and particularly people in show business, want now. You’re in your suite, faxing stuff, when people come in. The hotel has to respond to that change.”</p><p>Although in the last few years the hotel made a halfhearted effort to promote itself as a kind of dowager empress—with stories planted in the press about the history of the place, the enduring charm of Bernice, the unchanged décor of the Polo Lounge—that kind of nostalgic, ironic appeal seemed not to be very alluring to the powerful movie-and-television industry people the hotel was losing to the competition down the street. What veterans of the leisure industry call the South Beach Phenomenon, after the Miami Beach strip—a phenomenon in which what had been innocently luxurious to one generation then became slightly passé to an in-between generation, only to suddenly become fashionable once again, to a still younger crowd—never took hold in Beverly Hills. Richard Koshalek feels that this lack of historical affection is a typically Los Angeles phenomenon. “You know, we based the entire color scheme of L.A. MOCA on the colors of the Polo Lounge—that green and pink coloring,” he says. “It seemed to Isozaki, the architect, that they represented a kind of mystical, heraldic, symbolic coloring of Los Angeles. But it’s very hard to get people in L.A. to care about their own disappearing monuments. The hot-dog stand, the Brown Derby—the things that have seemed to outsiders to define authentic L.A. culture—leave most moneyed people here very uneasy.”</p><p>Koshalek’s principle seems to be borne out by the evolution of the hotel’s clientele in its declining years. Movie people, the theory runs, tend to value extreme clarity in their lines of power and obligation. (One non-movie person who has regular dealings with movie people says that whenever a certain agent has even the smallest favor done for him, he immediately sends lavish and expensive gifts not only to the one doing the favor but to all of that person’s secretaries and assistants, whom in many cases he may never have met.) Hollywood is essentially a feudal society, and in a feudal society what matters most is that the feudal powers never put themselves in even a mildly ambiguous situation—that they never run the risk of looking ridiculous. Hollywood people, this argument goes on, like to build their own, indubitably serious establishments as soon as they can—I. M. Pei’s C.A.A. building is an example of this compulsion—instead of taking over old ones. Irony—even the kind of simple, nostalgic irony that involves appreciating the dated, period look of a slightly passé swimming pool—is a disruptive, cosmopolitan virtue, favored in cultures, like New York’s, in which the primary social skill is not obtaining a fixed place within a hierarchy but being able to enter as many circles as you possibly can.</p><p>Throughout the eighties, a number of “European” hotels were opened in Los Angeles, with an eye to a New York crowd that was supposedly put off by the presumed tackiness of the Hollywood hotels, but those new, elegant hotels tended to be frequented by show-business types, while the Beverly Hills Hotel was the one that became a favorite haunt of New Yorkers. In recent years, the clientele of the hotel had become particularly heavy with professional ironists—New York art-world people. On one morning about two years ago, in fact, the only people at the pool (except, of course, for Irving) were a good chunk of the staff of the Museum of Modern Art’s Department of Painting &amp; Sculpture. William Rubin, the director emeritus, was down in the shallow end; his wife, Phyllis Hattis, was dangling her legs in the shallow end; Lynn Zelevansky, the senior curator, was sunning in a chaise (Kirk Varnedoe, the department’s current director, had left the hotel only a couple of days before). Lounging in chairs at poolside were the art dealer Larry Gagosian and the photographer Sheila Metzner. You can’t make a living on a crowd like that. Irving’s own notes on the hotel, from a set of recollections he has prepared about his life, record this change simply and plaintively: “Polo Lounge. Power breakfasts and lunches. Lines at night extended deep into lobby. Not anymore.”</p><p>“I’ve heard very <em>encouraging</em> things about the breakfast at the Century Plaza,” Irving said. We were having coffee in the Polo Lounge one afternoon. He was dressed in a cherry-red turtleneck, high-waisted black slacks, and a black leather bomber jacket. “The Century Plaza is very near where I live. What I ought to do is go there for breakfast one morning soon and try it out. I hate to jump off the deep end without a parachute. But that would mean giving up breakfast here, and I don’t have many left. The days dwindle down, dwindle down to a precious few. Everyone else is moving. The Bel-Air, the Peninsula, the Wilshire, the Hollywood Hilton. But I’m not ready to leave yet.” Irving was in what was for him a lugubrious mood. The day before,another of the pool regulars—Mark Goodson, the game-show producer—had died. (The obituary in the L.A. <em>Times</em>, seeking to explain how Goodson had come by his forty-million-dollar fortune, pointed out that he had “created a plethora of now-familiar television concepts—such as having contestants compete against one another; using the ‘bell and buzzer’ to signal which contestant answered a question first.”) “I never liked Goodson,” Irving said. “He was the only man I knew who could strut sitting down.” But then he added, “Still, I hate to see the regulars dying off. He was only seventy-seven. Pretty soon, who will be left who really <em>knows</em> the pool—who can bridge the gap between the pool’s closing and its reopening? There’s not going to be any continuity at the pool.”</p><p>I had been trying for a long time to get Irving to explain to me exactly how his business worked. “I live on finder’s fees,” he said now. “I’m a middleman—a matchmaker. What I do is to bring people together, and take two per cent. For instance, that gentleman who’s staying in the hotel right now, the Hamburger Hamlet King? Well, I knew that an old friend who had created the entire Hamburger Hamlet concept was ready to sell, and from my network of friends I also knew who might be interested in going into the restaurant business on that scale. It isn’t simply pool people, but the pool people help. I’m a middleman, a matchmaker, an observer. I observe who’s ready to sell and who’s eager to buy.”</p><p>We had made a date for Irving to take me to see a couple of “landmark suites”—the Boesky Suite, where Ivan Boesky had lived, and Suite 100, which was legendary as the place where Ben Silberstein had conducted what Irving refers to as his “extracurricular activities.” But as we were settling the bill Irving said suddenly, “I suppose I ought to tell you that tragic story I started to tell you about, since it’s about my business. Well, it all had to do with the Teamsters. In the early sixties, I was making good money in real estate, and everything couldn’t have been clearer. Then my daughter had the bad luck to make an unhappy marriage to the son of a man who ran the Teamsters’ pension fund. I took out a loan from him to invest in some real estate. It was all completely aboveboard and legal. But then Bobby Kennedy came to believe that he could put pressure on me to turn against my son-in-law and testify to terrible things. So one morning”—Irving was becoming uncharacteristically agitated—“one morning Kennedy came into the Polo Lounge, right here where we’re sitting, during <em>breakfast</em> and shook his finger at me and said, ‘Link, you do as I tell you, or you’ll be in trouble.’ He didn’t even call me <em>Mr.</em> Link—just pointed at me with that finger, and called me Link. So I held that finger, and I said, ‘Mr. Kennedy, I don’t do what <em>anyone</em> tells me.’ He was right, I was in big trouble. Bobby put the I.R.S. on me, and they ended up disallowing two hundred and forty-two thousand dollars in deductions. There was nothing illegal. Things like my son’s bar mitzvah, here in the hotel. They wanted me to testify, you see, and I had to protect my son-in-law. I had never met Hoffa. I was <em>supposed</em> to meet him, once. My son-in-law’s father wanted me to come to Washington and meet Hoffa. So I took a plane out to Washington. But I was troubled by an inner-ear problem in those days, and I got terribly, terribly sick on the plane. I damaged my clothes—a wonderful suit, in linen. When I arrived, he said, ‘I don’t want Hoffa to see you looking like that.’ So I never met him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“But my business was ruined. The papers picked it up, and, since I wouldn’t testify against my son-in-law, they made it sound as if I belonged to the Mafia. It stopped me dead. People believe what they read. I went from the top to the bottom. But I was never depressed. I’d done nothing wrong. The measure of a man, I think, is how he can accept adversity with dignity. I decided to hold my head high. I still came to the hotel every day. But I often ate at the counter, and I curtailed my gin playing.” By “the counter,” Irving meant the Fountain Coffee Shop, downstairs. “I was eventually reduced to taking a job. My brother-in-law was a liquor distributor, and I joined his business.</p><p>“I was called in front of the grand jury four times. I took the Fifth. I went to visit my son-in-law’s father in jail one Sunday and told him I wouldn’t testify against him. He said to me, ‘You dumb son of a bitch, what more can they do to me?’ Here are the two cheering things that came out of this tragic episode, however. First, the enduring love of my children. Second, the friendship of Charles Z. Smith, one of the prosecuting attorneys. He knew that I was simply protecting my son-in-law. Mr. Smith and I became fast friends after the trial, and he is one of the most charming and delightful gentlemen I’ve ever met. We correspond, and call each other for Christmas. His son and I have actually breakfasted right here in the booth, where Bobby Kennedy pointed his finger at me. Bobby, I believe, always wanted his own way, whether he was right or wrong. You know, he caused me so much strife, but I believe he was sincere. I was watching him in early 1968, and I said to my daughter, ‘You know, I may vote for him.’ She just looked at me.”</p><p>Irving and I left the Polo Lounge, crossed the lobby, and went to look at the Boesky Suite and Suite 100—which turned out to be just hotel suites, from which the aura of power and sensuality had long since fled. We walked back toward the empty lobby, and bumped into Kerman Beriker, the hotel manager, who had just left a farewell party given by the Sultan for the hotel’s employees. “It’s a sad day, but it’s not final,” Beriker said. “Everything will be the same, Mr. Link, I promise you. New rooms, but the Polo Lounge will be the same, the swimming pool will be the same. It’s just—we need a face-lift.” He dropped his voice. “We still have <em>window units</em> in the rooms,” he said, and held his hands out, palms upward, in dismay.</p><p>A steady, melancholy procession of employees poured out of the Crystal Room, where the party had been held. First, a phalanx of Mexican and South American bellhops and maids, each clutching a pink plastic bag with the logo of the hotel imprinted on it. “There’s a present from the Sultan in each bag,” Mr. Beriker explained. Then, after a suitable interval, the royalty of the hotel came out, all in mufti: Sven, Bernice, Chris, Robert the concierge, clutching pink plastic bags that held parting gifts from the Sultan. They gathered around Irving and talked in low voices. (Severance pay had been arranged for most of the senior staff, but no one had been promised a job when the hotel reopened.) Irving looked around the lobby. “Well,” he said, “I have an invitation to a gin game at the Peninsula. But I think— No, I’m just going home.”</p><p>On my last afternoon in the hotel, I went down to have a sandwich at the Fountain. A young black woman, with elegant, aristocratic features, wearing a T-shirt that featured the cast of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons—Sylvester, Tweetie, Bugs, Porky, Yosemite Sam—was having lunch there, too. She was engaged in a conversation with the waitress behind the counter, who looked like a waitress supplied by Central Casting thirty years ago. The young woman gave the waitress a box. The waitress opened it, and exclaimed with delight when she saw that it was full of little sweet-potato pies.</p><p>“Those are <em>good</em> pies,” the young woman said. “I knew you’d like them.” Then she ordered a sandwich. “Jonny,” she said to the waitress, “can I have some ketchup and Tabasco when you come this way? And some chips?”</p><p>“Karen, I’ll have to <em>send</em> for chips,” the waitress said. “I don’t want to give you these I have here.”</p><p>The young woman turned to me. “This is the only decent food in this place,” she said. “Last year, when I was working on my book about my grandfather, I lived over in the Crescent Wing and tried the room service. But it was awful. I’ve been coming here since I was a little girl. My grandfather designed this hotel. His name was Paul Revere Williams, and he did all the Hernando Courtright-period remodelling, back in the forties. The Polo Lounge, the pool, the lobby, this place—all the color schemes and the staircases and the signage. They’re all his. Even the big sign out on Sunset. That’s his, too.”</p><p>The waitress brought over the Tabasco sauce and the potato chips. “This has been a <em>horrendous</em> year for me,” the young woman went on, after introducing herself as Karen Hudson. “All my grandfather’s papers were burned in the riot. This black S. &amp; L. where I work, and that he helped found—it burned right to the ground. So <em>that</em> set me back. But, fortunately, I’ve got lots of other things in the house—his house, where I live, which he designed for my grandmother. It looks like this place, a lot. The curves, the recessed lighting, the inside-outside theme, the color scheme—that was the whole Paul Williams look. He’s just being rediscovered. My book—I’m doing it for Rizzoli—will be the first book about him. It’s funny how people are only just beginning to hear of him. He invented all this—took every straight angle he found in the hotel and turned it round, made it graceful and elegant. But when I called the L.A. <em>Times</em> to get an extra copy of his obituary, they couldn’t find it. They said to me, very querulously, ‘How do you know he <em>had</em> an obituary?’ I said, ‘I know he had two. Because we had them in the family scrapbook.’ He was the first black member of A.I.A. and their first black fellow, too. He was building houses here in Beverly Hills at a time when black people couldn’t even live there. It’s not true that he couldn’t stay here himself—my grandfather would probably have been welcome. He came to the hotel a lot for balls and functions, and so on. But he never wanted to put himself in a position where he could be humiliated. One day when they were creating the pool out there—one of the engineers told me this—my grandfather came out to talk to his crew, and he wouldn’t sit down. They thought, My God, the boss doesn’t want to come and speak to us. It wasn’t that. He would just never put himself in a position where he could possibly be humiliated. That’s why, though he designed hundreds of homes here in Beverly Hills, he would never live in one. Instead, he built his home in a black neighborhood, and always lived deep in the mid-city, in a black community.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Nobody knows exactly why he got the job. He practiced from 1915 to 1973, in just about every style known to man. He built hundreds of houses around here—he had a completely adaptable, eclectic style. They’re all known, of course, by the pedigree of stars who’ve lived in them. One of my favorite houses that he built is owned by a terrific couple who bought it from Raquel Welch. They’ve got a room with a brass plate on the door: ‘Raquel Welch Memorabilia Room.’ He really designed two masterpieces, though—this place and the house I live in. I’ll take you there, if you like. I’ve tried to keep it unchanged.”</p><p>In Los Angeles, I had got used to jumping into other people’s cars and taking long drives to places I had never seen, so we went upstairs to the lobby, Karen got her car from Chris, and we set off. Along the way, she took me on a compressed tour of her grandfather’s work. He seemed to have designed every second house in Beverly Hills, in a bewildering range of styles: little absurd imitations of the White House; small, graceful bungalows done in a modified Frank Lloyd Wright manner; mini-Monticelli.</p><p>Then we drove south, through miles and miles of low, featureless buildings, and pulled up in a beautiful, palm-lined block that seemed to have been inserted, in one piece, from another, posher neighborhood. I asked Karen what part of Los Angeles we were in.</p><p>“Well, I <em>think</em> this is called Wilshire,” she said. “Until there’s a police disturbance, and then it becomes South Central again.” She led the way to a small, nondescript façade on one corner of the block, and opened the door.</p><p>A small vestibule dominated by a staircase with a curved ironwork railing—rather like the staircase that leads from the ground floor to the pool corridor in the hotel—lay just inside. The railing was wrought in the image of three stags, chasing each other upstairs. On the far side of the staircase lay the living room, with a hearth of agate-colored stone. The right wall was entirely of floor-to-ceiling glass and looked out on a curving, gently terraced, kidney-shaped patio—a doll’s-house version of the Polo Lounge patio, almost down to the last flagstone. The entire interior was orchestrated around a series of graceful S-curves—the curved living room echoing the curve of a green lacquered baby-grand piano, which, in turn, stood in front of a swelling built-in breakfront that filled an entire wall. The colors of the room were all subtly nuanced shades of emerald and moss—a quieter, domestic version of the Beverly Hills Hotel green.</p><p>“Let me show you the Ben Mayer,” Karen said, and opened the breakfront. Inside its doors was a five-foot-long painted mural signed “Ben Mayer” and dated 1951. It showed, in a spirited, cartoonlike style—half Stuart Davis and half Ben Shahn—the story of the architect Paul Williams’ life. A handsome black man in a perfect pin-striped suit, his wife, and their two little girls, in crinolines, filled the foreground. Behind the family was a montage, painted in uneven, shifting perspective, of Paul Williams’ most famous buildings: a Saks Fifth Avenue branch on a boardwalk, a pair of New Orleans-style houses. To the upper right was the sign of the Beverly Hills Hotel, and below were scenes from the hotel itself—the lounge, the awning, the pool. “That was his handwriting,” Karen said, pointing to the cursive writing on the sign, faithfully reproduced in the painting. “He just used it for the hotel.”</p><p>There was a single incongruous note in the mural. Above the beautiful family, a woman was depicted in black underwear, sitting, one leg drawn up, on the edge of a bed. “Ben Mayer put that in for my grandfather,” Karen explained. “He said he put it in because he and my grandfather agreed that prostitutes were the only people they had known who never discriminated against <em>anyone</em>.</p><p>“Before the hotel, my father’s biggest commission was the Al Jolson shrine. It’s this big memorial out at Hillside Cemetery. It’s funny, isn’t it? He made his early reputation commemorating a blackface entertainer.”</p><p>The living room was sunken, and the light came in from small windows facing a garden. I noticed that they were heavily barred. Karen caught me eying them.</p><p>“That’s new,” she said, a little grimly. “We’ve had so many break-ins here. Just this spring, they broke in and stole <em>everything</em>—all my files, all my computers, and, what was worse, the computer disks. They steal them for the programs. That meant that I lost just about the entire manuscript for my book, and I had to start all over again. Oh, it’s been a horrendous year. The fire broke my heart. The S. &amp; L. where I worked was the oldest black-owned-and-operated S. &amp; L. in the city. My other grandfather, my paternal grandfather, opened it in 1947, and brought Paul Williams on at the beginning. In the Watts riot, back in ’65, everybody knew that it was a black institution, so it was left untouched. But not this time. It burned right to the ground that first night, with all the papers in it. I’ve just had to write a new statement for our calendar.” She handed me the calendar. It read, in part, “Broadway Federal emerged from the ashes rededicated to the principles upon which it was founded. Fiercely committed to the belief in South Central and its viability for business, while understanding the importance of home ownership . . . Strengthened by your trust and support, we found many bright lights amidst the rubble.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Karen showed me around the upstairs rooms, which were simpler in décor—a big Frank Lloyd Wright desk, a handsome faceted-glass chandelier—but had the same signature lulling rhythm of curves and recesses. “He lived here in such happiness with my grandmother,” Karen said. “He was entirely filled with her. At work, he was a martinet, but around here all you ever heard him say was ‘Yes, dear.’ It moves me, because he usually worked in whatever style his clients wanted. But this style was obviously his real style—it was the style he loved. It’s so funny—his most public building is done in this style, and his most private building is, too.”</p><p>I’d promised to say goodbye to Irving, and I was already late, so Karen drove me back to the hotel. As we turned the corner onto Wilshire Boulevard, I noticed, for the first time, that everything on the Boulevard looked odd. Not just empty—everything always looks empty in Los Angeles—but unnaturally dark, as though the gas stations and shopping centers had been crudely overprinted in woodcut.</p><p>“It’s all still burned,” Karen said softly. “Nothing restored yet. That burned, and that burned, and that burned.” She pointed at the gas stations and supermarkets and little shopping centers; they were, I realized, all charred at their edges. “Can you imagine?” she said, shaking her head. “But the house is still safe, thank God.”</p><p>“And where will <em>you</em> go?” Irving asked me. He was lying on his chaise, all alone by the side of the pool. By now, the weather had passed from unseasonably chilly to just plain cold; I was in a wool suit. Irving seemed impervious to it all; he was stripped to the waist and was peering at the thin, distant, hazy sun with deep satisfaction, as though we were in Hawaii in August.</p><p>When I returned to the hotel, I had asked Irving if he knew that the pool and the Polo Lounge had been designed by a black architect named Paul Williams. “I didn’t,” he said, and he looked shocked. But then he said, “If I looked surprised, it’s because I didn’t know that he had designed all <em>this</em>. You see, I knew the name, because he was the architect of the first house I lived in in Beverly Hills—the one I was living in when I walked over here that morning. I never met the gentleman, but now I realize that my entire adult life has been spent within his precincts.” Irving looked suitably impressed.</p><p>“And where will <em>you</em> go?” he asked again. I realized that he was asking what hotel I would stay in when I came back to Los Angeles, and that, for him, it was an important question. I didn’t know what to say. I vaguely remembered hearing from a friend that there was a nice hotel on a beach in Santa Monica, so I mentioned it.</p><p>“Really!” Irving said, with polite surprise. He considered for a few moments. “Well, why not?” he said, at last. “One of my maxims is ‘Try everything.’ ”</p><p>On the patio, two producers were having what one of them had loudly billed as “the last Beverly Hills Hotel lunch.” Their voices barked out across the empty pool.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘good family’?” one of them was saying. “What does that mean? What. Come on, what? They don’t take drugs, they give money to the poor—what?”</p><p>“I grant you that the expression is clichéd,” the other began.</p><p>I lost track of the conversation. Irving had walked over to the hedge of lime trees, and now he deliberately plucked a lime from a tree, walked back, and handed it to me. “Here,” he said. “Keep this.”</p><p>I put the lime in the pocket of my suit, and brought it back to New York with me. I still have it.</p><p>I spoke to Irving just the other week. “The Hilton turned out to be a pretty crummy place,” he said. “So I’ve moved my entire life over to the Peninsula. Now something quite remarkable has happened there, which seems agreeably unexpected.” He paused. “The entire royal family of Brunei has moved in here, including the Sultan’s brother! I helped them get rooms—there are forty of them already, and eighty more are coming next month—and we’ve become very good friends. They’re delightful, magnificent people. They’ve reassured me immensely about the future of the hotel, even though I’ve never met the Sultan himself. In fact, I’m coming to think that this time away from the pool may even be very invigorating and character-building. When we return to the pool, we may even appreciate it all the more, for having been kept away so long.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>
