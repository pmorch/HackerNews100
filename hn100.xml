We were getting tired of filling out endless security questionnaires, the kind of stuff that can easily live in a proper trust center.</p><p>It's one thing to say, <em>"We use MFA, we encrypt stuff, we care about your data,"</em> but it hits different when a third party auditor confirms we're actually doing it by the book.</p><p>And since our team is still fairly small, we figured it was the right time to get our practices locked in early.</p><p>If you're wondering how SOC 2 works or planning to get certified yourself, this post aims to shed some light.</p><h2>What is SOC 2?</h2><p>SOC 2 is a security and compliance framework created by the AICPA. It defines how companies should handle customer data using five criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</p><p>There are other frameworks, such as ISO 27001, and in the long run, it pays out to get that one too, depending on what your customer base is, but starting with SOC 2 is never a bad idea. It's widely recognized by US companies, less complex than ISO 27001, and builds a solid security foundation to build upon.</p><p>There are two flavors of SOC 2:</p><ul><li> <strong>SOC 2 Type I</strong> checks that your systems and policies exist at a point in time. Basically, whether you have the right setup.</li><li> <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong> looks at whether those policies work over time. Think of it as, "cool, but do you really follow through?"</li></ul><p>We've completed <strong>SOC 2 Type I</strong> (üéâ) and we're already working on Type II.</p><h2>The Journey</h2><figure><p><img src="https://excalidraw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lp-cms/media/SOC2%20journey%20timeline%20(1).png" alt="Excalidraw+ SOC 2 journey" width="1968" height="455"></p></figure><p>Before you start the certification audit itself, you need to make sure you're in compliance to begin with. If you're young and brave, you can read up on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/2017-trust-services-criteria-with-revised-points-of-focus-2022">criteria requirements</a> directly from AICPA without using any third-party services to help get going, but such a document doesn't hold your hand or tell you what you need to do. We do not recommend it. </p><p>Instead, we looked for services that can get you set up and going easily (well, easier). They help you centralize compliance docs, security workflows, audits, risk monitoring, and all the other things you definitely don't want to be keeping up to date with instead of shipping your product. We narrowed the list down to Drata and Vanta, and in the end, went with Vanta as most of the services and providers we use already had an integration there.</p><p>Once you plug all your services in (for us, this meant Vercel, GCP, DigitalOcean, GitHub, among others), Vanta runs a check to see what needs fixing. </p><p>Anything without an existing integration, you need to track manually. Sometimes you need to supply evidence in the form of screenshots, so keep your "receipts" at hand! You can do this in Google Drive or elsewhere, but we built this stuff into our internal admin dashboard. It takes a little bit of work upfront, but it pays off long-term and keeps everything nice and organized.</p><p>Vanta also helps you introduce secure workstation policies, such as requiring disk encryption, screen locks, and the use of password managers across your entire team. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff, but useful and necessary, and trying to roll that out on our own would have been a nightmare.</p><p>The upside for us was that we got a bird‚Äôs eye view of our team: who has access to what, whether MFA was enabled, and so on.</p><p>Doing all that was a bit overwhelming at first, but once we got the hang of it, it was surprisingly manageable.</p><p>The toughest (or let's say, the most annoying) part by far was the policies. You need a ton of them: "Code of Conduct," "Human Resource Security Policy," "Access Control Policy," "Operational Security Policy," and more. Vanta provided some boilerplate templates to get us started, but we still had to tailor them for our company, especially since we're remote-first. Finding the balance between keeping our startup vibes and introducing more rigid and structured processes was key.</p><p>Actually implementing those policies was easier for us, as we had already been doing most of these things without them being written down, but there were still some processes that needed updating or technical changes that needed implementing. This can be time-consuming, especially when you're also actively developing a product concurrently. The key is to carve out some dedicated time for this, taking on tasks one by one, and aim for a gradual roll-out.</p><p>Even though paperwork isn't exactly our favorite thing, some of it actually made a lot of sense. It forced us to properly write down how we handle incidents like outages and similar, instead of it existing in bits and pieces or locked in the minds of specific team members. And for our customers, it offers a peek into how we operate behind the scenes.</p><p>Since we're a remote team, we implemented a zero-trust production access model with strict role-based controls. Production access is limited to essential personnel (currently the technical co-founders) and operates through our automated deployment pipeline for all routine operations. This approach minimizes the attack surface while ensuring our support team can handle customer requests through our purpose-built internal admin dashboard, which provides controlled access to necessary functions without direct production exposure.</p><p>It also helps us automate SOC 2 tasks like tracking and managing resource access, conducting regular access reviews, and keeping a paper trail for compliance reasons highlighted above. And yes, we log who touches what.</p><p>Of course, no compliance journey would be complete without a few moments that feel like they come straight from a company training video. Well, watching those was quite literally part of it (No, Sheila, passwords go into the password manager, not on your monitor's sticky note), but we now also run regular staff training sessions. Our new member onboarding calls have also become more structured.</p><h2>Technical Work</h2><figure><p><img src="https://excalidraw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lp-cms/media/soc2-tech-arch-overview%20(1).png" alt="SOC 2 Technical architecture overview" width="1417" height="1376"></p></figure><p>We went a bit crazy here. We started by splitting our monolith into more services and kept adding new apps into our codebase as we grew. To manage it all, we chose <a target="_blank" href="https://nx.dev/">Nx‚Å†</a> as our build/monorepo framework. Migrating to Nx helps us standardize how our dev team runs development, builds, shipping, and tests within our GitHub CI/CD pipeline. Nx gives us custom executors that we use to handle environment variables, accommodate differences between frameworks like classic SPA and Next.js, and others. The speedup due to caching was a nice bonus (you can do this locally, or in the cloud for added benefits).</p><p>For managing environment keys, we picked <a target="_blank" href="https://infisical.com/">Infisical‚Å†</a>, which is end-to-end encrypted, self-deployable, and basically ticks all our boxes. This setup lets developers access only development keys and nothing more, same for CI. No more committing environment variables into the codebase or injecting them manually into CI. Try it once, and you'll never want to go back. The secrets management tool also lets us run everything in CI smoothly, such as testing for missing or leaking environment keys. One of the tougher challenges was making CI work smoothly alongside the VPN and firewalls we have in place.</p><p>And our custom firewall and VPN setup finally pushed us to upgrade to GitHub Enterprise to get dedicated IPs for our runners.</p><p>We also set up monitoring for our services and made a public <a target="_blank" href="https://status.excalidraw.com/status">status page‚Å†</a>. For logging, we use <a target="_blank" href="https://vector.dev/">Vector‚Å†</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://axiom.co/">Axiom‚Å†</a>.</p><p>As we wrapped things up, we needed to verify that everything was as secure as we planned. So, we conducted penetration testing across the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw+</a> platform. It found some minor issues, like exposed headers, which we fixed right away. Running penetration tests at least once a year to make sure everything is squared up is a must.</p><h2>Vendors &amp; Risk Management</h2><p>Turns out, your vendors need to have their act together, too. Every service that touches customer data needs to be evaluated and documented.</p><p>The good news? Most of the big players we rely on (Vercel, Google Cloud, GitHub) already have their SOC 2 reports ready to go. </p><p>We use a combination of Vanta (which handles most of the common vendors) and our internal admin dashboard for the ones Vanta doesn't cover, because managing this in spreadsheets gets old fast. For each vendor, we document what data they access, their certifications, key risks, and how we mitigate them.</p><p>Pro tip: Start this early. Some vendors take weeks to respond, and you might need time to find alternatives.</p><h2>Going One Step Further</h2><p>We don't care for tracking our customers, but we do need to know the essentials. How many users do we have, what features are actually used, things like that.</p><p>For Excalidraw, we use a self-hosted version of <a target="_blank" href="https://umami.is/">Umami‚Å†</a>. For public-facing stuff like our open-source editor and landing pages, we use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>‚Å†.</p><p>Both do the job without invading your privacy. So if you're wondering why you don't see a cookie banner (<a target="_blank" href="https://umami.is/docs/faq">Umami‚Å† FAQ</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simpleanalytics.com/blog/analytics-without-a-cookie-banner">Simple Analytics‚Å†</a> ) on our site, that's why.</p><h2>The Audit</h2><p>When it comes to the audit itself, you can either pick from the auditors your provider (e.g., Vanta) works with or find your own. We chose <a target="_blank" href="https://insightassurance.com/">Insight Assurance</a>‚Å†. What we learned, though, is that we should have contacted them way earlier in the process, as they could have helped us with some of the policies and risk definitions we were overthinking, which would have saved us a lot of time. But hey, lesson learned.</p><p>As for the good ending, we passed SOC 2 Type 1. While Type 2 is next on the list and it's what everyone should aim for, Type 1 is a good stepping stone along the way, as it already demonstrates to your customers you're serious and that you're not running your business from the back of a tool shed.</p><p>If you want to go through the paperwork with a good wine in the evening, you can find it all in our trust center, below.</p><h2>Security page &amp; trust center</h2><ul><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://trust.excalidraw.com/">Trust Center</a>‚Å†</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance‚Å†</a></li></ul><h2>What's Next</h2><figure><p><img src="https://excalidraw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lp-cms/media/SOC2-blog-roadmap.png" alt="soc2 certification roadmap" width="3860" height="1667"></p></figure><ul><li> SOC 2 Type 2</li><li> GDPR (unless the EU repeals it first)</li><li> ISO 27001 (if enough customers ask)</li></ul></div></section></div>]]></description>

  </div><div><p>The Trump administration has proposed to eliminate the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) by October 2026, citing fiscal responsibility and redundancy with existing regulatory agencies. This proposal, embedded in the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, has sparked bipartisan opposition in Congress and concern among industry groups.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Background on the CSB</strong></h3><p>Established in 1990 and operational since 1998, the CSB is an independent federal agency tasked with investigating industrial chemical accidents. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the agency's board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It conducts root cause analyses of chemical incidents at fixed industrial facilities and issues safety recommendations to prevent future occurrences.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the CSB lacks regulatory authority, its findings have influenced policies at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) . The CSB investigative staff includes chemical and mechanical engineers, industrial safety experts, and other specialists with experience in the private and public sectors. Many investigators have years of chemical industry experience.</p><p>The CSB currently operates with just three Senate-confirmed members, down from its full complement of five, yet continues to issue major safety reports ‚Äî including its latest on three catastrophic events at a Honeywell facility in Louisiana. In the CSB‚ÄôS 25-year history, the agency has deployed to over 170 chemical incidents and issued more than 1000 recommendations that have led to numerous safety improvements across a wide variety of industries.</p><p>After a CSB team reaches a chemical incident site, investigators begin their work by conducting detailed interviews of witnesses such as plant employees, managers, and neighbors. Chemical samples and equipment obtained from accident sites are sent to independent laboratories for testing. Company safety records, inventories, and operating procedures are examined as investigators seek an understanding of the circumstances of the accident.</p><p>Under its public safety mission, the CSB conducts root cause investigations of chemical accidents at fixed industrial facilities. Root causes are usually deficiencies in safety management systems, but can be any factor that would have prevented the accident if that factor had not occurred. Other accident causes often involve equipment failures, human errors, unforeseen chemical reactions or other hazards. The agency does not issue fines or citations, congress designed the CSB to be non-regulatory and independent of other agencies so that its investigations enhance public safety, the safety of workers and inform industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Both accident investigations and hazard investigations lead to new safety recommendations, which are the Board's principal tool for achieving positive change. Recommendations are issued to government agencies, companies, trade associations, labor unions, and other groups. Implementation of each safety recommendation is tracked and monitored by CSB staff. When recommended actions have been completed satisfactorily, the recommendation may be closed by a Board vote.</p><p>While some recommendations may be adopted immediately, others require extensive effort and advocacy to achieve implementation. Board members and staff work to promote safety actions based on CSB recommendations. In many cases, the lessons from CSB investigations are applicable to many organizations beyond the company investigated. Many CSB recommendations have been implemented in industry, leading to safer plants, workers, and communities.</p><h3><strong>Key Areas of Focus:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Chemical Incident Investigations</strong>: Determining root causes of industrial explosions, toxic releases, and chemical spills.</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety Recommendations</strong>&nbsp;&amp; Policy Development: Providing non-regulatory safety guidance for industry and government.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Analytics and Digital Modeling</strong>: Using AI and predictive analytics to assess industrial risk factors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Outreach and Reporting</strong>: Publishing incident reports, video animations, and safety recommendations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cybersecurity and IT Modernization</strong>: Protecting CSB‚Äôs investigative data, reports, and forensic analysis tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Industrial Hazard Prevention</strong>: Identifying systemic safety issues in chemical plants, refineries, and storage facilities.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Details of the Proposed Closure</strong></h3><p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) stated that closing the CSB aligns with efforts to move the nation towards fiscal responsibility and redefine the federal government's role. The budget documents specify that funding for the CSB should be "permanently canceled not later than September 30, 2026."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the CSB's own budget request for fiscal year 2026 was set at zero dollars, with language suggesting that its functions duplicate those of the EPA and OSHA. However, former OSHA official Jordan Barab described this as "highly unusual," implying that the request may have been imposed by the White House rather than originating from CSB leadership.&nbsp;</p><h3>
<strong>Why it Matters for the Planet:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Shutting down the CSB would weaken federal oversight of chemical safety at a time when industrial accidents pose escalating environmental and public health risks.</p><ul>
<li>CSB investigations not only prevent repeat disasters but also provide vital insights into pollution, workplace safety, and hazardous material management.</li>
<li>Its absence could slow or halt environmental justice progress, particularly in frontline communities located near industrial zones.</li>
<li>Impede collaboration of enhancing vital safety recommendations to close the current gaps between federal and state regulations and local ordinance.</li>
<li>Support chemical industry need to protect workers, public and the environment from harm.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Mistake to Shut Down the CSB</strong></h3><ul><li>
<strong>&nbsp;It Fills a Unique Safety Role</strong>: The CSB investigates industrial chemical accidents‚Äînot to assign blame, but to figure out why they happened and how to prevent them. No other federal agency does this kind of root cause analysis focused purely on safety improvement. OSHA and the EPA enforce rules, but they don‚Äôt specialize in deep, systems-based investigations like the CSB does.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>It Has a Strong Track Record</strong>: Despite its small size and limited budget, the CSB has produced high-impact reports that have led to real-world safety improvements‚Äîsuch as changes to refinery operations, better emergency response protocols, and industry-wide alerts on chemical handling. Its investigations have prevented repeat disasters.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>Communities and Workers Depend on It</strong>: Many of the facilities CSB investigates are located near low-income or marginalized communities. These people bear the brunt of chemical disasters‚Äîexplosions, toxic leaks, fires. The CSB gives voice to those most at risk and pushes for safer industry practices that protect lives.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>It‚Äôs Cost-Effective</strong>: The CSB operates with a modest annual budget‚Äîabout $13 million, which is microscopic compared to the cost of even a single industrial explosion. Its work reduces risk and saves far more in avoided injuries, environmental damage, and litigation than it costs to run.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>Eliminating It Increases Risk</strong>: Without the CSB, there would be fewer independent, transparent investigations into chemical accidents. The lessons learned from past disasters would take longer to surface‚Äîor never surface at all. That means higher risk for chemical workers, emergency responders, and nearby neighborhoods.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>It Has Bipartisan and Industry Support</strong>: Lawmakers from both parties have defended the CSB, and even chemical industry leaders have acknowledged its value. That kind of consensus is rare‚Äîand telling. Killing the CSB would go against expert opinion, common sense, and the public interest.</li></ul><h3><strong>Reactions and Implications</strong></h3><p>The proposal has drawn criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum. Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) warned that eliminating the CSB could lead to more chemical disasters affecting communities near industrial facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Industry groups have also expressed concern. The American Chemistry Council stated that while the proposal is part of the budget process, they value the CSB's work and wish to see it continue. Similarly, the Chlorine Institute emphasized the CSB's vital role in chemical safety and advocated for its full funding or a comparable alternative.&nbsp;</p><p>The CSB's recent investigations underscore its importance. For instance, it released a final report on three serious incidents involving toxic hydrogen fluoride at a Honeywell facility in Geismar, Louisiana, highlighting systemic safety failures.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3><p>While the proposal to eliminate the CSB is part of the administration's budget plan, it requires congressional approval. Given the bipartisan support for the agency, the proposal is expected to face significant resistance in Congress. The CSB‚Äôs defunding proposal enters a contested legislative process, with early signals of pushback from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers:</p><ul>
<li>Industry groups, such as the American Chemistry Council and Chlorine Institute, have expressed support for the CSB‚Äôs continued operation</li>
<li>Advocacy for stronger chemical safety regulations is expected to intensify in Congress, especially following recent deadly incidents like the hydrogen fluoride leak at a Honeywell plant in Louisiana</li>
<li>The final decision will hinge on Congressional negotiations over the 2026 federal budget</li>
</ul><p>As of now, the CSB continues its operations, with leadership emphasizing the agency's critical role in ensuring chemical safety and protecting communities, workers, and the environment.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ol>

        OpenAI will fight order to keep all ChatGPT logs after users fail to sway court.

    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>After a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">court ordered OpenAI to "indefinitely" retain all ChatGPT logs</a>, including deleted chats, of millions of users, two panicked users tried and failed to intervene. The order sought to preserve potential evidence in a copyright infringement lawsuit raised by news organizations.</p>
<p>In May, Judge Ona Wang, who drafted the order, rejected the first user's <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Motion-to-Intervene-5-19-25.pdf">request</a> on behalf of his company simply because the company should have hired a lawyer to draft the filing. But more recently, Wang <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Order-6-20-25.pdf">rejected</a> a second claim from another ChatGPT user, and that order went into greater detail, revealing how the judge is considering opposition to the order ahead of oral arguments this week, which were urgently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-says-court-forcing-it-to-save-all-chatgpt-logs-is-a-privacy-nightmare/">requested by OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Motion-to-Intervene-6-6-25.pdf">request</a> to intervene came from a ChatGPT user named Aidan Hunt, who said that he uses ChatGPT "from time to time," occasionally sending OpenAI "highly sensitive personal and commercial information in the course of using the service."</p>
<p>In his filing, Hunt alleged that Wang's preservation order created a "nationwide mass surveillance program" affecting and potentially harming "all ChatGPT users," who received no warning that their deleted and anonymous chats were suddenly being retained. He warned that the order limiting retention to just ChatGPT outputs carried the same risks as including user inputs, since outputs "inherently reveal, and often explicitly restate, the input questions or topics input."</p>
<p>Hunt claimed that he only learned that ChatGPT was retaining this information‚Äîdespite policies specifying they would not‚Äîby stumbling upon the news in an online forum. Feeling that his Fourth Amendment and due process rights were being infringed, Hunt sought to influence the court's decision and proposed a motion to vacate the order that said Wang's "order effectively requires Defendants to implement a mass surveillance program affecting all ChatGPT users."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Hunt's fears are not unfounded, Corynne McSherry, legal director for the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Ars.</p>
<p>"The discovery order poses genuine risks to user privacy in itself and as a precedent for the many other lawsuits around the country," McSherry said. "And it is emblematic of a broader problem: AI chatbots are opening another vector for corporate surveillance, especially if users don't have meaningful control over what happens to their chat histories and records."</p>
<p>According to Hunt, Wang failed to "consider exempting 'Anonymous Chats,' which are reasonably expected to contain the most sensitive and potentially damaging information of users, from retention and disclosure in this case," claiming that it "constitutes an overly broad and unreasonable action."</p>
<p>He urged the judge to revise the order to include this exemption, as well as exemptions for any chats "discussing medical, financial, legal, and personal topics that contain deeply private information of users and bear no relevance whatsoever" to the plaintiff news organizations' claimed interests.</p>
<p>For Hunt and many other users blindsided by the order, the stakes appear high. He suggested that Wang should have allowed him to intervene "because this case involves important, novel constitutional questions about the privacy rights incident to artificial intelligence usage‚Äîa rapidly developing area of law‚Äîand the ability of a magistrate to institute a nationwide mass surveillance program by means of a discovery order in a civil case."</p>
<p>But Wang <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Order-6-20-25.pdf">disagreed</a> with Hunt that she exceeded her authority in enforcing the order, emphasizing in a footnote that her order cannot be construed as enabling mass surveillance.</p>
<p>"Proposed Intervenor does not explain how a court‚Äôs document retention order that directs the preservation, segregation, and retention of certain privately held data by a private company for the limited purposes of litigation is, or could be, a 'nationwide mass surveillance program,'" Wang wrote. "It is not. The judiciary is not a law enforcement agency."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>However, McSherry warned that "it's only a matter of time before law enforcement and private litigants start going to OpenAI to try to get chat histories/records about users for all sorts of purposes, just as they do already for search histories, social media posts, etc." Wang's order could become a gateway to that future, she said.</p>
<p>Wang rejected Hunt's motion primarily because "whether the temporary preservation of certain chat output log data that was routinely being deleted by OpenAI throughout the course of this litigation may infringe on purported constitutional and contractual privacy rights of individual consumers that use ChatGPT" was deemed a "collateral issue" that does not directly pertain to the central question of copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Finding that Hunt's intervention would not contribute "in any way" to "the development of the underlying factual issues in this case," Wang ruled that Hunt ultimately had no right to intervene.</p>
<p>"None of Proposed Intervenor‚Äôs purported 'novel' questions are at issue in this copyright infringement action," Wang wrote. "Even if the Court were to entertain such questions, they would only work to unduly delay the resolution of the legal questions actually at issue."</p>
<h2>User questions how hard OpenAI will fight</h2>
<p>OpenAI will have a chance to defend panicked users on June 26, when Wang hears oral arguments over the ChatGPT maker's concerns about the preservation order.</p>
<p>In his filing, Hunt explained that among his worst fears is that the order will not be blocked and that chat data will be disclosed to news plaintiffs who may be motivated to publicly disseminate the deleted chats.</p>
<p>That could happen if news organizations find evidence of deleted chats they say are likely to contain user attempts to generate full news articles. Ars could not immediately reach a spokesperson for the lead plaintiff in the copyright lawsuit, The New York Times, for comment on this alleged privacy risk for ChatGPT users.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Wang suggested that there is no risk at this time since no chat data has yet been disclosed to the news organizations. That could mean that ChatGPT users may have better luck intervening after chat data is shared, should OpenAI's fight to block the order this week fail. But that's likely no comfort to users like Hunt, who worry that OpenAI merely retaining the data‚Äîeven if it's never shared with news organizations‚Äîcould cause severe and irreparable harms.</p>
<p>Some users appear to be questioning how hard OpenAI will fight. In particular, Hunt is worried that OpenAI may not prioritize defending users' privacy if other concerns‚Äîlike "financial costs of the case, desire for a quick resolution, and avoiding reputational damage"‚Äîare deemed more important, his filing said.</p>
<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment. The company previously provided a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/"> breakdown of affected users</a> and vowed to fight the order.</p>
<p>For now, ChatGPT users must wait to see the fate of their most sensitive chat logs. Intervening ChatGPT users had tried to argue that, at minimum, OpenAI should have been required to directly notify users that their deleted and anonymous chats were being retained. Hunt suggested that it would have stopped him from inputting sensitive data sooner. McSherry told Ars that more transparency will be needed as courts continue tangling with cases impacting chatbot users.</p>
<p>"All AI chat apps should be taking steps not only to ensure that users can delete their records and be sure they are actually erased but also to ensure that users get timely notice of demands for their information," McSherry said. "If they aren't already doing so, they should also commit to regular transparency reporting about demands for user data."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="main__body"><div><p>In 1977, NASA launched the Voyager probes to study the Solar System's edge, and the interstellar medium between the stars. One by one, they both hit the "wall of fire" at the boundaries of our home system, measuring temperatures of 30,000-50,000 kelvin (54,000-90,000 degrees Fahrenheit) on their passage through it.</p><p><span id="piano-gate"><p>There are a few ways you could define the edge of the Solar System ‚Äì for instance, where the planets end, or at the Oort cloud, the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence where objects may still <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/#:~:text=The%20Oort%20Cloud%20is%20the,t%20extend%20quite%20as%20far." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return closer</a> to the Sun. One way is to define it as the edge of the Sun's magnetic field, where it pushes up against the interstellar medium, known as the heliopause.</p><p>"The Sun sends out a constant flow of charged particles called the solar wind, which ultimately travels past all the planets to some three times the distance to Pluto before being impeded by the interstellar medium," <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/heliosphere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA explains</a>. "This forms a giant bubble around the Sun and its planets, known as the heliosphere."</p><p>It is beyond that where the heliopause lies.</p><p id="isPasted">"The boundary between solar wind and interstellar wind is the heliopause, where the pressure of the two winds are in balance.

Prior to the Voyager spacecraft crossing the heliopause, scientists didn't really know where the boundary would be, but the fact that the probes hit it at different distances helped support a few predictions about it.</p><p>"Scientists expected that the edge of the heliosphere, called the heliopause, can move as the Sun's activity changes, sort of like a lung expanding and contracting with breath," a <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/voyager-2-illuminates-boundary-of-interstellar-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA statement</a> explains. "This was consistent with the fact that the two probes encountered the heliopause at different distances from the Sun."</p><p>While not a hard edge, or a "wall" as it has sometimes been called, here both spacecraft measured temperatures of 30,000-50,000 kelvin (54,000-90,000 degrees Fahrenheit), which is why it is sometimes also referred to as a "<a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-some-people-call-the-solar-systems-edge-the-wall-of-fire-72918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall of fire</a>". &nbsp;The craft survived the wall as, though the particles they measured were extremely energetic, the chances of collision in this particle-sparse region of space are so low that not enough heat could be transferred to the duo.&nbsp;</p><p id="isPasted">The <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/voyager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voyager</a> spacecraft continue to send us data from beyond this "wall", the only two probes that have crossed it so far, nearly 50 years after they were launched. Together they have found several surprises on our first glimpse outside the Solar System.</p><p>"An observation by Voyager 2's magnetic field instrument confirms a surprising result from Voyager 1: The magnetic field in the region just beyond the heliopause is parallel to the magnetic field inside the heliosphere," NASA explained, shortly after one such surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>"With Voyager 1, scientists had only one sample of these magnetic fields and couldn't say for sure whether the apparent alignment was characteristic of the entire exterior region or just a coincidence. Voyager 2's magnetometer observations confirm the Voyager 1 finding and indicate that the two fields align."</p></span></p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  
  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>this is a whole blog post because it is "outside the overton window"; it usually takes at least a video before people even understand the thing i am trying to describe. so, here's the video:</p>

<p>the steps here that tend to surprise people are 
, 
, and 
. when i say "surprise" i don't just mean that people are surprised that i've set this up, but they are surprised this is possible at all.</p>
<p>here's what happens in that video:</p>
<ol>
<li>
 I start with Windows Terminal open on my laptop.</li>
<li>
 I hit <code>ctrl-shift-5</code>, which opens a new terminal tab which <code>ssh</code>'s to my home desktop and immediately launches tmux.</li>
<li>
 tmux launches my default shell, <code>zsh</code>. zsh shows a prompt, while loading the full config asynchronously</li>
<li>
 i use <code>zoxide</code> to fuzzy find a recent directory</li>
<li>
 i start typing a ripgrep command. zsh autofills the command since i've typed it before and i accept it with <code>ctrl-f</code>.</li>
<li>
 i hit <code>ctrl-k f</code>, which tells tmux to search all output in the scrollback for filenames. the filenames are highlighted in blue.</li>
<li>
 i hold <code>n</code> to navigate through the files. there are a lot of them, so it takes me a bit to find the one i'm looking for.</li>
<li>
 i press <code>o</code> to open the selected file in my default application (<code>nvim</code>). tmux launches it in a new pane. note that this is still running <em>on the remote server</em>; it is opening a remote file in a remote tmux pane. i do not need to have this codebase cloned locally on my laptop.</li>
<li>
 i try to navigate to several references using rust-analyzer, which fails because RA doesn't understand the macros in this file. at 
 i finally find one which works and navigate to it.</li>
<li>
 i hit <code>ctrl-k h</code>, which tells tmux to switch focus back to the left pane.</li>
<li>
 i hit <code>n</code> again. the pane is still in "copy-mode", so all the files from before are still the focus of the search. they are highlighted again and tmux selects the next file in search order.</li>
<li>
 i hit <code>o</code>, which opens a different file than before, but in the <em>same</em> instance of <code>nvim</code>.</li>
<li>
 i hit <code> b</code>, which shows my open file buffers. in particular, this shows that the earlier file is still open. i switch back and forth between the two files a couple times before ending the stream.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="but-why"><a href="#but-why" aria-label="Anchor link for: but-why">but why??</a></h2>
<p>i got annoyed at VSCode a while back for being laggy, especially when the vim plugin was running, and at having lots of keybind conflicts between the editor, vim plugin, terminal, and window management. i tried zed but at the time it was quite immature (and still had the problem of lots of keybind conflicts).</p>
<p>i switched to using nvim in the terminal, but quickly got annoyed at how much time i spent copy-pasting filenames into the editor; in particular i would often copy-paste files with columns from ripgrep, get a syntax error, and then have to edit them before actually opening the file. this was quite annoying. what i wanted was an equivalent of ctrl-click in vscode, where i could take an arbitrary file path and have it open as smoothly as i could navigate to it. so, i started using tmux and built it myself.</p>
<p>people sometimes ask me why i use tmux. this is why! this is the whole reason! (well, this and session persistence.) terminals are stupidly powerful and most of them expose almost none of it to you as the user. i like tmux, despite its age, bugs, and antiquated syntax, because it's very extensible in this way.</p>

<p>i will not go through the whole regex, but uh. there you go. i spent more time on this than i probably should have.</p>

<p>this part is not so bad. tmux again.</p>
<pre data-lang="tmux"><code data-lang="tmux"><span><span><span>#</span> `cd` is important in case this is a relative path. `echo | bash` is to perform tilde expansion.

</span><span>  if -F <span><span>"</span>#{alternate_on}<span>"</span></span> { <span>send-keys</span> -X cancel }
</span></code></pre>
<p>i also have a version that always opens an editor in the current pane, instead of launching in the default application. for example i use <a href="https://fx.wtf/"><code>fx</code></a> by default to view json files, but <code>nvim</code> to edit them.</p>
<pre data-lang="tmux"><code data-lang="tmux"><span><span><span>#</span> save the buffer, then open an editor in the current pane
</span></span><span><span>bind-key</span> -T <span>copy-mode</span>-vi O <span>send-keys</span> -X copy-pipe-and-cancel \

<p>here is the trick. i have created <a href="https://github.com/jyn514/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/hx-hax">a shell script</a> (actually a perl script) that is the default application for all text files.</p>
<div><p>setting up that many file associations by hand is a pain. i will write a separate blog post about the scripts that install my dotfiles onto a system. i don't use Nix partly because all my friends who use Nix have <em>even weirder</em> bugs than they already had, and partly because i don't like the philosophy of not being able to install things at runtime. i want to install things at runtime and <em>track</em> that i did so. that's a separate post too.</p></div>
<p>the relevant part is this:</p>
<pre data-lang="perl"><code data-lang="perl"><span><span><span><span>#</span> don't use `` so that args can have embedded pipes
</span></span></span><span><span>my</span> <span><span>@</span>split</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span><span>'</span>tmux<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span><span>'</span>split-window<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span><span>'</span>-h<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span><span>'</span>-P<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span><span>'</span>-F<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span><span>'</span>"#{pane_id}"<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span>$</span>editor</span><span>,</span> <span><span>@</span>args</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span><span>open</span></span><span>(</span><span>my</span> <span><span>$</span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span><span><span>'</span>-|<span>'</span></span></span><span>,</span> <span><span>@</span>split</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>die</span> <span><span><span>"</span>can't open pipeline: </span><span><span><span>$</span>!</span></span><span><span>"</span></span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>this bounces <em>back</em> to tmux. in particular, this is being very dumb and assuming that tmux is running on the machine where the file is, which happens to be the case here. this is not too bad to ensure - i just use a separate terminal <em>emulator</em> tab for each instance of tmux i care about; for example i will often have open one Windows Terminal tab for WSL on my local laptop, one for my desktop, and one for a remote work machine via a VPN.</p>
<div><p>there's actually even more going on here‚Äîfor example i am translating the <code>file:line:column</code> syntax to something vim understands, and overriding <code>xdg-open</code> so that it doesn't error out on the <code>:line</code>‚Äîbut for the most part it's straightforward and not that interesting.</p></div>
<h3 id="open-a-file-in-a-running-instance-of-nvim"><a href="#open-a-file-in-a-running-instance-of-nvim" aria-label="Anchor link for: open-a-file-in-a-running-instance-of-nvim">open a file in a running instance of nvim</a></h3>
<p>this is a perl script that scripts tmux to send keys to a running instance of nvim (actually the same perl script as before, so that both of these can be bound to the same keybind regardless of whether nvim is already open or not):</p>
<pre data-lang="perl"><code data-lang="perl"><span><span>my</span> <span><span>$</span>current_window</span><span>=</span> <span><span>trim</span></span> <span><span><span>`</span>tmux display-message -p "#{window_id}"<span>`</span></span></span><span>;</span>

<h2 id="consequences-of-this-setup"><a href="#consequences-of-this-setup" aria-label="Anchor link for: consequences-of-this-setup">consequences of this setup</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>i don't need a fancy terminal locally; something with nice fonts is enough. all the fancy things are done through tmux, which is good because it means they work on Windows too without needing to install a separate terminal.</li>
<li>the editor thing works even if the editor doesn't support remote scripting. nvim <em>does</em> support RPC, but this setup also worked back when i used <code>helix</code> and <code>kakoune</code>.</li>
<li>i <em>could</em> have written this such that the fancy terminal emulator scripts were in my editor, not in tmux (e.g. <code>:terminal</code> in nvim). but again this locks me into the editor; and the built-in terminals in editors are usually not very good.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ok-but-do-you-really-want-to-use-tmux"><a href="#ok-but-do-you-really-want-to-use-tmux" aria-label="Anchor link for: ok-but-do-you-really-want-to-use-tmux">ok, but do you really want to use tmux</a></h2>
<p>well. well. now that you mention it. the last thing keeping me on tmux was session persistence and <a href="https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/389">Ansuz has just released a standalone tool that does persistence and nothing else</a>. so. i plan to switch to <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a> in the near future, which lets me keep all these scripts and does not require shoving a whole second terminal emulator inside my terminal emulator, which hopefully will reduce the number of weird mysterious bugs i encounter on a regular basis.</p>
<p>the reason i picked kitty over <a href="https://wezterm.org/">wezterm</a> is that ssh integration works by integrating with the shell, not by launching a server process, so it doesn't need to be installed on the remote. this mattered less for tmux because tmux is everywhere, but hardly anywhere has wezterm installed by default.</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it"><a href="#was-it-worth-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: was-it-worth-it">... was it worth it?</a></h2>
<p>honestly, yeah. i spend quite a lot less time fighting my editor these days.</p>
<ul>
<li>it's <em>much</em> easier to debug when something goes wrong (vscode's debugging tools are mostly for plugin extension authors and running them is non-trivial). with vim plugins i can just add <code>print</code> statements to the lua source and see what's happening.</li>
<li>all my keybinds make sense to me!</li>
<li>my editor is less laggy.</li>
<li>my terminal is much easier to script through tmux than through writing a VSCode plugin, which usually involves setting up a whole typescript toolchain and context-switching into a new project</li>
</ul>
<p>that said, i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone else. all my scripts are fragile and will probably break if you look at them wrong, which is not ideal if you haven't written them yourself and don't know where to start debugging them.</p>
<h2 id="ok-but-this-looks-nice-i-want-this"><a href="#ok-but-this-looks-nice-i-want-this" aria-label="Anchor link for: ok-but-this-looks-nice-i-want-this">ok but this looks nice i want this</a></h2>
<p>if you do want something similar without writing your own tools, i can recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> + <a href="https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/">zoxide</a> + <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>. that gets you steps 4, 5, and kinda sorta-ish 6.</li>
<li>"builtin functionality in your editor" - fuzzy find, full text search, tabs and windows, and "open recent file" are all commonly supported.</li>
<li><a href="https://git.causal.agency/src/tree/bin/qf.c">qf</a>, which gets you the "select files in terminal output" part of 6, kinda. you have to remember to pipe your output to it though, so it doesn't work after the fact and it doesn't work if your tool is interactive. note that it hard-codes a vi-like CLI (<code>vi +line file.ext</code>), so you may need to fork it or still add a script that takes the place of $EDITOR. see <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/10/how-to-compile-a-c-program/">julia evans' most recent post</a> for more info.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kilobyte/e">e</a>, which gets you the "translate <code>file:line</code> into something your editor recognizes" part of 8, kinda. i had never heard of this tool until i wrote my own with literally the exactly the same name that did literally exactly the same thing, forgot to put it in PATH, and got a suggestion from <code>command-not-found</code> asking if i wanted to install it, lol.</li>
<li><code>vim --remote filename</code> or <code>code filename</code> or <code>emacsclient filename</code>, all of which get you 12, kinda. the problem with this is that they don't all support <code>file:line</code>, and it means you have to modify this whenever you switch editors. admittedly most people don't switch editors that often, lol.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learned"><a href="#what-have-we-learned" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-have-we-learned">what have we learned?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>terminals are a lot more powerful than people think! by using terminals that let you script them, you can do quite a lot of things.</li>
<li>you can kinda sorta replicate most of these features without scripting your terminal, as long as you don't mind tying yourself to an editor.</li>
<li>doing this requires quite a lot of work, because no one who builds these tools thought of these features ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>hopefully this was interesting! i am always curious what tools people use and how - feel free to <a href="https://jyn.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e5c5251597e544750105a5b48">email me</a> about your own setup :)</p>

    <p>I recently changed jobs and found myself in a position where I would need to do a lot of work on remote machines. Since I am Emacs user, the most common way to do this is using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/">TRAMP (Transparent Remote access, Multiple Protcol)</a>. TRAMP is an Emacs package that let‚Äôs you treat a remote host like a local system, similar to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">VSCode Remote Development Extension</a>. I had used TRAMP before and it tended to be slow. Since I would be using it all day now I figured I should take some time to make it faster.</p>
<h2 id="tramp-is-great">

<p>TRAMP really is an amazing piece of technology. It supports a huge number of protocols and it lets you pretend that you are working on a local system. You can copy files around, run programs, run shells, and for the most part everything just works.</p>
<p>But TRAMP unfortunately has a propensity for being slow. Sometimes this is not TRAMPs fault and comes from how it is used. In my testing, each call through TRAMP takes about 50-100ms. Compare that to a normal external process call in Emacs which would take around 1 ms. Workflows that work fine on a local machine become unbearable when working remotely. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that TRAMP has to be slow. If you run <code>emacs -Q</code> and use TRAMP you will normally find it quite snappy.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">
    <a href="#getting-started">

</h2>
<p>First, let‚Äôs set up some of the basic settings. These settings below will prevent TRAMP from creating a bunch of extra files and use scp directly when moving files.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span><span><span>(</span><span>setq</span> <span>remote-file-name-inhibit-locks</span> <span>t</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>tramp-use-scp-direct-remote-copying</span> <span>t</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>remote-file-name-inhibit-auto-save-visited</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In order to open a file on a remote host, TRAMP needs to copy the file contents to your local machine. Most TRAMP methods have two ways to copy files; inline or out-of-band. Out-of-band will use external methods like <code>rsync</code> or <code>scp</code>, while inline will send compressed base64 encoded text over the SSH session and then decode it on the other side. This works best for small files where the overhead of creating a new connection is not worth it. This is by default set to 10KB. However, I found in my testing that the best value was much bigger than that.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/tramp/inline_vs_OOB.png">
</figure>

<p>You can see in the graph above that inline is faster all the way up until about 2MB. After that point inline continues to grow linearly (the x-axis is logarithmic) while the out-of-band copying is sub-linear. Generally the slower the connection, the bigger the gap between inline and out-of-band. In the graph above it is 250ms, but on some slower connections I have observed that gap to be closer to 750ms. Interestingly, the cutoff always seems to be around 2MB, at least on my machines.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span><span><span>(</span><span>setq</span> <span>tramp-copy-size-limit</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>1024</span><span>)</span> <span>;; 1MB</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>tramp-verbose</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I also found that using <code>rsync</code> as your method makes updating an existing file (i.e. making a small change to a file and saving it) about 3-4 times faster than using <code>scp</code>.  I don‚Äôt use <code>rsync</code> though because it breaks remote shells.</p>
<h2 id="use-direct-async">

      Use Direct Async
    </a>
</h2>
<p>When creating a new process in Emacs, you have two options: synchronous or asynchronous. Async processes have historically been really slow over TRAMP, because it has to create a new connection for every async process. However recent version of TRAMP have added a feature called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/TRAMP/#Improving-performance-of-asynchronous-remote-processes-1">direct async process</a> that makes this significantly faster. This feature alone will take many packages (like magit or git-gutter) from completely unusable to bearable over TRAMP. Here is how you configure it with TRAMP <code>2.7</code>.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have to add that extra setting to get magit to work. See <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/5220">this issue</a> for more details. You can double check that this mode is working by calling <code>M-: (tramp-direct-async-process-p)</code> on a remote file. make sure to change <code>"server"</code> to the name of your remote.</p>

</h2>
<p>Newer versions of TRAMP will use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/TRAMP/#Using-ssh-connection-sharing-1">SSH connection sharing</a> for much faster connections. These don‚Äôt require you to reenter your password each time you connect. The <code>compile</code> command disables this feature, so we want to turn it back on.</p>

</h2>
<p>What can we do to make working over TRAMP faster? If you are like me and already have an existing config, it is more than likely that some packages you are using are not going to play nicely over TRAMP due to the extra overhead. There will be certain operations like changing modes, moving the cursor, or saving a buffer that has inexplicable delays.</p>
<p>When you encounter this, you should use the built-in profiler. use <code>M-x profiler-start</code> before  behavior that is slow and then <code>M-x profiler-stop</code> and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> afterwards. This will give you a hierarchical list of where Emacs was spending its time. If this is an issue related to TRAMP you should see <code>tramp-wait-for-output</code> be a significant portion of the total time. But it is not always clear what is actually causing TRAMP to be called. In this case, you can use <code>debug-on-entry</code>  on <code>tramp-send-command</code> to get a backtrace when something calls TRAMP. This will let you see the exact commands that are calling out to TRAMP and causing the slow down. In my case, I found a couple of the features of doom modeline were causing a lot of delays.</p>

      Magit
    </a>
</h2>
<p>magit is one of Emacs super powers, consistently rated as one of the best packages. I use it for practically everything related to git. Unfortunately, it is quite slow over TRAMP. On my remote repo‚Äôs it can take 10-20 seconds just to run <code>magit-status</code>. And every time you run a command it needs to refresh the whole status buffer, leading to more delays. Magit is designed to run on a local machine where shell commands are cheap. A simple magit command might run 30 individual shell commands. This can be a big overhead over TRAMP.</p>
<p>So here is my advice for working with magit over TRAMP.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>magit-dispatch</code> and <code>magit-file-dispatch</code> instead of doing everything from the status buffer. This will let you quickly execute commands without waiting for the status buffer to load and refresh each time. Only use the status buffer when you need to get a high-level view of your repo or need to operate on large numbers of files.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt be afraid to just run a shell command. Running <code>M-S-! git branch foo</code> or <code>M-S-! git commit -m "Update foo"</code> will often be faster than waiting 8 seconds for magit to populate all branch targets over ssh, or load the git commit interface. Some things like cherry-picking or rebasing are still much easier in magit, despite the overhead.</li>
<li>Try and remove anything extra that magit might try and do. Here are some settings I am using.</li>
</ol>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A lot of this slowness could be alleviated with some better caching. When I first started testing this I found <code>forge-dispatch</code> to be extremely slow. Some profiling showed that <a href="https://github.com/magit/forge/discussions/712">magit was making 176 calls over TRAMP</a>, even though it only needed 6 of them. This has since been fixed, but there is more performance to be gained. I tried to <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/pull/5228">implement a magit caching mechanism</a> and it was a huge boost for performance (though it is still very rough). I stopped working on it because the magit maintainer <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/pull/5228#issuecomment-2379743798">said that he is hoping 2025 will be the year</a> to add caching to the whole magit workflow!

<p>Even with all the settings above, opening the status buffer and staging a few files is still quite slow. So I created a simple mode that just opens a status buffer and lets me easily stage some files. It doesn‚Äôt have any of the fancy features or folding headers of the magit status buffer, but it is nearly instantaneous. When I want to quickly stage or unstage some files, this is what I reach for. I am not interested in trying to maintain this as a proper package, but <a href="https://github.com/CeleritasCelery/emacs.d/blob/master/speed-git.el">here</a> is the source if you are interested.</p>
<h2 id="lsp">
    <a href="#lsp">
      LSP

</h2>
<p>LSP mode works over TRAMP, but unfortunately not with the direct async process feature. There is a <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/4573">workaround</a> you can use though. Another alternative is <a href="https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge">lsp-bridge</a>, but I was not able to test it because it requires the remote python to be built with FFI support, which my server does not have. Even though it is supported, LSP over TRAMP can be kind of slow, so I tend not to use it. Rather than adding <code>lsp</code> to the major mode hook, I added this function that will not enable LSP by default on remote hosts. It also removes other functionality that can tend to cause a slowdown.</p>

<p>If sending calls over TRAMP is so expensive, the best thing we can do is not run them. TRAMP already has some built-in caching for things like remote files, but it only keeps them for a short while. Anything that doesn‚Äôt go through TRAMP will be a win. I created this function for just that purpose:</p>

<p>All this work has made TRAMP quite usable for me. There are still things that are slow, but almost nothing that just doesn‚Äôt work. For most of the work I do I hardly notice that I am working over a remote protocol. However, in writing all this, I kept thinking to myself ‚ÄúThere has to be a better way to do this‚Äù. I have started to think of ways to fundamentally improve the performance of TRAMP that would involve changes to the package itself. I plan to write more on that soon, so stay tuned!</p>

It doesn‚Äôt trigger any negative feelings. It somehow feels atmospheric, like a living time capsule.</p><p>The music, of course, helped.</p><p>I know those are modern, probably LED lightbulbs, but their color, almost like some old flickering film come to life, really does things for a plain space.</p><p>It‚Äôs such a curious, almost uncanny, feeling to enter one of these places. The inside feels much bigger and grander than the outside. It almost feels like entering a portal to another world or another time. Now that I think about it, there was nothing in this shop that would tell you it isn‚Äôt still, say, 1960.</p><p>The closest thing I can think of is entering one of those grand old urban churches, where the door creaks closed behind you and the interior blocks out the city noise, and it‚Äôs just you and the silence, and maybe God is in the silence.</p><p><span>I suppose, religion aside, that that feeling is </span><em>wonder</em><span>. That is not a feeling I often feel running errands and going out in America. But it‚Äôs a feeling that the Japanese business landscape and built environment is able to spark frequently.</span></p><p><span>Maybe it‚Äôs that on vacation your work/routine brain is off, and you‚Äôre more receptive to the curiosity and delight out there. Maybe that delight is everywhere. I try to think so, and I‚Äôve written pieces making just that argument. But I think there‚Äôs really something substantively different about commerce at this tiny, almost intimate scale. It blurs the line between business/customer and host/guest: in a way you really are a guest in this man‚Äôs space. There‚Äôs a social element that is lost when it all gets too big. And when it‚Äôs oriented around cars, too. There‚Äôs a seamlessness, a </span><em>frictionlessness</em><span>, to visiting tiny shops in walkable cities.</span></p><p><span>It‚Äôs subtle, but it isn‚Äôt metaphysical or magical. It‚Äôs about giving people permission to pursue a passion or hobby at a slightly commercialized scale, rather than forcing them to either keep it to themselves or take the big, risky, expensive jump of </span><em>going into business</em><span>. This is genuine free enterprise: barriers so low that almost anyone can try something out without running into the brick wall of regulatory obstruction. This is how freedom can grow the small, the local, the beautiful.</span></p><p>And the coffee was pretty good, too.</p><p><strong>Related Reading:</strong></p><p><a href="https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/i-am-here-as-you-are-here" rel="">I Am Here As You Are Here</a></p><p><a href="https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/home-business" rel="">A Peek at What‚Äôs Possible</a></p><p><a href="https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/three-cheers-for-the-blue-and-white" rel="">Three Cheers For The Blue &amp; White</a></p><p><a href="https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/the-wolverine-claws" rel="">The Wolverine Claws</a></p><p>Thank you for reading!

<p>The embassy also said that it wants people to set their social media profiles to public, <a href="http://www.thejournal.ie/j1-visiting-us-6737092-Jun2025/">reiterating a move announced last week by the US State Department</a>.</p>
<p>Reacting to the announcement, Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin said the measures are ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt approve of them, and I don‚Äôt agree with them,‚Äù he told reporters in Dublin this afternoon.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is an issue around freedom of speech, but it‚Äôs more the atmosphere that‚Äôs created by these measures, the fear and the anxiety that young people will now experience travelling.‚Äù</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheJournalVideo">The Journal</a> / YouTube</span></p>
<p>National students body Aontas na Mac L√©inn in √âirinn (AML√â), formerly known as the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), expressed concern about the heightened student visa vetting procedures, saying that the ‚Äúinvasive scrutiny‚Äù would create a ‚Äúclimate of fear‚Äù among students.
</p>
<h3><strong>Who is affected?</strong></h3>
<p>This will apply to all applicants for F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas.</p>
<p>The J nonimmigrant visa is the best known of these. It covers work in the US for a limited period, while its J1 iteration allows students and college graduates to enter the US during the summer for work and travel in the US.</p>
<p>An F nonimmigrant visa allows foreign nationals to enter the US temporarily to pursue academic studies at certain institutions. The M nonimmigrant visa is similar, covering education in non-academic, or vocational, fields such as technical or culinary pursuits.</p>
<p>The new measures do not affect Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) visas.</p>
<p>The new requirements are more far-ranging than previously, with the crackdown on social media accounts over the past five years likely to heighten concern among Irish political parties and activist groups.</p>
<p>Social media handles or usernames are not necessarily the person‚Äôs real name, and may instead be used as an alias for their online profile.</p>
<h3><strong>US Embassy‚Äôs new guidance</strong></h3>
<p>In the statement, the US Embassy said that a visa ‚Äúis a privilege, not a right‚Äù for travellers and that every visa decision was a ‚Äúnational security decision‚Äù.</p>
<p>The embassy said it will resume scheduling F, M, and J nonimmigrant visa applications soon.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission,‚Äù the embassy said in its statement today.</p>
<p>Omitting social media information could lead to ‚Äúvisa denial and ineligibility‚Äù for future visas, the embassy added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe US Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,‚Äù the embassy said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe use all available information in our visa screening and vetting to identify visa applicants who are inadmissible to the United States, including those who pose a threat to US national security.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnder new guidance, we will conduct a comprehensive and thorough vetting, including online presence, of all student and exchange visitor applicants in the F, M, and J nonimmigrant classifications.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo facilitate this vetting, all applicants for F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas will be instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to ‚Äòpublic‚Äô.</p>
<h3><strong>Students told to ‚Äòproceed with caution‚Äô</strong></h3>
<p>The J1 visa has long been popular with students, with <a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/basics/facts-and-figures/top-sending-countries-2019/">3,392 students entering the US via the programme pre-pandemic in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Reacting to the US embassy statement, students‚Äô union body AML√â said that students should ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù when visa appointments resume soon.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStudents applying for a J1 visa or any US student visa this summer are advised to remain informed, stay safe, and carefully review what they are sharing publicly online,‚Äù a spokesperson for AML√â said.</p>
<p>The union‚Äôs statement added that it believes the new measures represent a ‚Äúdisproportionate intrusion‚Äù into students‚Äô personal lives and raises serious concerns about freedom of expression and online surveillance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStudents should not be subjected to invasive scrutiny simply for seeking educational and cultural opportunities abroad,‚Äù said Bryan O‚ÄôMahony, deputy president of AML√â.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These changes create a climate of fear and self-censorship, and risk unfairly penalising students from marginalised or politically active communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/basics/facts-and-figures/top-sending-countries-2019/">There had been confusion over the status of J1 applications as Donald Trump‚Äôs administration carried out its new agenda.</a></p>
<p>Ireland‚Äôs Department of Foreign Affairs said last month that while it was aware of reports that the US has instructed its diplomatic missions to pause appointments for interviews in certain visa categories, including J1 student visas, it understood that existing appointments in Ireland hadn‚Äôt been cancelled.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/j1-visas-ireland-6717405-May2025/">Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin criticised the moves</a> by the US and said there should not be ‚Äúany overzealous examinations of people‚Äôs records‚Äù by officials.</p>
<p>In an executive order on his first day as president, Donald Trump called for increased vetting of persons entering the United States to ensure they ‚Äúdo not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles‚Äù.</p>
