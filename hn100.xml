<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <div><p>TOKYO, Japan, June 17, 2025 – Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd., a research and development subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., today conducted a launch and landing test of an experimental reusable rocket<sup>*1</sup> (6.3 m in length, 85 cm in diameter, 900 kg dry weight/1,312 kg wet weight) developed independently by Honda. The test was completed successfully, the first time Honda landed a rocket after reaching an altitude of 300 meters.</p>
<p>This test marked the first launch and landing test conducted by Honda with an aim to demonstrate key technologies essential for rocket reusability, such as flight stability during ascent and descent, as well as landing capability. Through this successful test, Honda achieved its intended rocket behaviors for the launch and landing (reaching an altitude of 271.4 m, and landing at 37cm of the target touchdown point, flight duration 56.6 sec), while obtaining data during the ascent and descent.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
    <h3><b>＜Overview of launch and landing test of a Honda reusable rocket＞</b>
</h3>
</p>


    
</div>
<div>
<p>・Purpose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishment of key technologies necessary for a reusable rocket<br>
・Location:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honda facility in Taiki Town<sup>*2</sup>, Hiroo District, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan<br>
・Date/Time:&nbsp; June 17, 2025. Launch time: 16:15</p>
</div>

<div><p>*1 A reusable rocket, also known as a reusable launch vehicle (RLV), is a type of rocket that, unlike a conventional expendable launch vehicle (ELV), can be used repeatedly in a short period of time. A reusable rocket is launched in a vertical position, reaches an altitude of around 100 kilometers, and then lands back on earth while maintaining a vertical position.</p>
<p>*2 Taiki Town, located in southeastern Hokkaido, Japan, has been developing itself as a “space town” through the joint efforts of public and private sectors, and various aviation/space related tests are being conducted by a wide range of organizations including JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), businesses and universities.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
    <h3><b>＜Safety measures for Honda rocket testing＞</b>
</h3>
</p>


    
</div>
<div>
<p>Since 2024, Honda has been safely conducting engine combustion tests and hovering tests for its reusable rockets in Taiki Town in Hiroo District, Hokkaido, Japan. As with all previous tests, Honda conducted this launch and landing test while placing the highest priority on safety and with the understanding and cooperation of local authorities and residents.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
    <h4><b>Specific safety measures taken for this test</b>
</h4>
</p>


    
</div>
<div><ul>
<li>A restricted area with a 1-kilometer radius was established. During the test, access to the area was restricted through the installation of signs and gates, as well as the deployment of security personnel.<b></b></li>
<li>The restricted area was defined by calculating the potential area where the rocket could fall to earth in the event of a thrust cut-off and by adding a sufficient buffer zone (safe distance calculated based on the guidelines set forth by the Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan) that would cover the potential area where a blast wave, debris dispersion, or fireballs could impact in the event of an explosion within the potential fall area.<b></b></li>
<li>The experimental rocket was equipped with a safety system to prevent deviation from a pre-defined flight corridor, speed and attitude conditions, ensuring no impact beyond the restricted area.<b></b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<p>
    <h3><b>＜Honda initiatives in the areas of rocket research＞</b>
</h3>
</p>


    
</div>
<div><p>As announced in 2021, Honda has been pursuing research and development in the field of space technologies while viewing it as a place to take on challenges to realize the “dreams” and “potential” of people worldwide while leveraging its core technologies. Honda has the aim to enable people to transcend the constraints of time, place or ability and make people’s daily lives more enjoyable. Examples of Honda initiatives toward creating new value in the ultimate environment of outer space include research into a circulative renewable energy system, key robotic technologies for use in outer space and reusable rockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by the dream of young Honda engineers who wanted to build rockets by utilizing core technologies amassed by Honda through the development of various products, such as combustion and control technologies, Honda started rocket research based on the belief that it has the potential to contribute more to people’s daily lives by launching satellites with its own rockets, that could lead to various services<sup>*3</sup> that are also compatible with other Honda business.</p>
<p>In today’s world, vast amounts of data are consumed, with the growing expectation for greater utilization of a data system in outer space through expanded use of satellites. In light of this trend, the need for satellite launch rockets is also expected to increase in the coming years.</p>
<p>In this market environment, Honda has chosen to take on the technological challenge of developing reusable rockets by utilizing Honda technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems, based on a belief that reusable rockets will contribute to achieving sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>Although Honda rocket research is still in the fundamental research phase, and no decisions have been made regarding commercialization of these rocket technologies, Honda will continue making progress in the fundamental research with a technology development goal of realizing technological capability to enable a suborbital launch by 2029.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
    <h4><b>Comments by Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda</b>
</h4>
</p>


    
</div>
<div>
<p>“We are pleased that Honda has made another step forward in our research on reusable rockets with this successful completion of a launch and landing test. We believe that rocket research is a meaningful endeavor that leverages Honda’s technological strengths. Honda will continue to take on new challenges—not only to offer our customers various services and value through our products, while addressing environmental and safety issues, but also to continue creating new value which will make people’s time and place more enjoyable.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>*3 Examples include remote sensing to monitor Earth conditions such as global warming and extreme weather, as well as satellite constellations that enable wide-area communication, which is an essential component for connected features of mobility products.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, June 16, 2025</em></p><p>I keep hearing claims like this:</p><ul><li>Not everyone in the US has access to stable, reliable internet, even in 2025.</li><li>Web developers should stop assuming people have fast internet connections and slim their payloads accordingly.</li></ul><p>This seems intuitively true to me—programmers are gonna have better connectivity because that takes money, and programmers are well-paid. But what's the actual scope of the problem?</p><p>I dug around, and here's some data. My goal here is not to beat anyone over the head with "THOU SHALT NOT ASSUME GOOD INTERNET" but to give an idea about the scope of broadband rollout in the US in a way that can help inform choices we make when designing software.</p><p><strong>If you don't feel like reading this whole thing, here's the bottom line up front:</strong> you can probably assume internet access in somewhere around 97% of US households, but you should not assume that it's better than around 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up, and latency may be significantly worse than you previously assumed. This is likely worse for B2C software than B2B.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>I'm going to pull from two US government agencies here: the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a>and the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/">National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)</a> (part of the Department of Education.) All the data I'm referencing was published well before the current administration started gutting the bureaucracy, so I think it's fairly reliable.</p><h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2><p>Before we begin, there are a bunch of ways to define "stable" or "reliable" internet connections. For the purposes of this post, I'm defining that as a <strong>terrestrial link with at least 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up.</strong></p><ul><li>Terrestrial because—well, have you ever tried to use a satellite connection for anything real? Latency is awful, and the systems tend to go down in bad weather. They also have had fairly low data caps historically so you had to use your connection judiciously, although this may be changing.<sup><a href="#satellite">1</a></sup><sup><a href="#my-history">2</a></sup></li><li>25/3Mpbs because that's a fairly common cable package speed, and also around the minimum I’ve been able to use modern SaaS apps on without it getting ridiculously frustrating. <a href="https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&amp;sysparm_article=KB0060748#h_d278c327-e03d-4896-b19a-96a8f3c0c69c">Zoom says</a> you need 1–4 Mbps in both directions to do a video call.</li></ul><p>The FCC's broadband map lets you set both these criteria. Let's have a look at it.</p><h2 id="the-fcc-broadband-map">The FCC Broadband Map</h2><p>The FCC tracks access to broadband internet in the US. As a result, they publish a map that's more accurate than the maps you see from ISPs. This isn't <em>completely</em> error-free, but individuals and companies can both submit data on coverage at a street address level and challenge inaccuracies in the existing data. For our purposes, I think it's good enough!</p><p>I'm going to grab some screenshots of the map to fix it at the current data for discussion. That way we can get an idea about regional coverage.</p><p>Strangely, they don't let you zoom out enough to grab a screenshot of the whole country so I'm going to look at the west. That'll get both urban and rural coverage, as well as several famously internet-y locations (San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle.)</p><p>If you want to follow along or compare how the data has changed since this post was published, you can get the map yourself at <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/">broadbandmap.fcc.gov</a>.</p><p>First, here's a hex map of coverage using the criteria we set above. The darker each hex is, the higher the percent coverage within it. Dark blue is 100%, white is 0%, grays or faded blues are in between.</p><p><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/us-national-broadband-map-terrestrial-25-3-2025-06-10.png" alt="A map of the western US with a color scale overlaid showing access to broadband. Higher-population areas are shown to have better access, generally, with the exception of the Dakotas which have excellent access throughout the states."></p><p>This shows pretty much what I'd expect: coverage is fine in and around cities and less great in rural areas.<sup><a href="#mobile">3</a></sup> (The Dakotas are an interesting exception; <a href="https://www.bek.coop/">there's a co-op up there</a> that connected a ton of folks with gigabit fiber. Pretty cool!)</p><p>Although, remember that these are <em>minimum</em> criteria. When I'm building software, I'm mostly doing it on my home internet. A test just now says I get 367/71Mpbs. What does the country look like if I were to expect all my users to have similar connections? The map lets us filter for 250/25; let's look:</p><p><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/us-national-broadband-map-terrestrial-250-25-2025-06-10.png" alt="A map of the western US with a color scale overlaid showing access to broadband at a higher level. Rural areas show much less availability than in the previous map, although access in the Dakotas is still excellent."></p><p>Cities are pretty much unchanged, but rural coverage gets much worse. (Except again for North Dakota, the reigning champion of rural fiber.)</p><p>So what does this tell us about how we should design software? One big takeaway: if you design for the <em>availability</em> of fast internet connections, you'll exclude many people in rural areas.</p><p>This may or may not be OK for your market—"good internet" tends to be in population centers, and population centers tend to contain more businesses and consumers. You have to make that call!</p><p>However, it's also worth keeping in mind that this is a map of commercial availability, not market penetration. Hypothetically, you could get the average speed of a US residential internet connection, but the FCC doesn't make such a statistic available.<sup><a href="#speed-stat-third-party">4</a></sup></p><p>However, we have another source of data!</p><h2 id="student-internet-access">Student Internet Access</h2><p>The US Department of Education occasionally tracks student internet access. Since classwork and homework have moved more online (especially during the early days of COVID) it's useful data for policy-making. The <a href="https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Relationship+Between+Internet+Access+and+Literacy+Among+OECD...-a0795707532">most recent data I could find is from 2021</a> but it gives us both a baseline for internet availability and some demographic data. Unfortunately, they don't track bandwidth, just raw availability. Still useful, though.</p><p>Here are the top-line statistics for all students in the US across several versions of the report:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>% Available 2019</th><th>% Available 2021</th><th>Difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any internet access</td><td>94.6%</td><td>97.1%</td><td>+2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Smartphone-only</td><td>6.5%</td><td>4.5%</td><td>-2.0</td></tr><tr><td>No internet Access</td><td>5.4%</td><td>2.9%</td><td>-2.5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2021, they say that these statistics cover 66,108,000 students, which means 2.97 million students only had mobile access as of 2021.</p><p>Access gets worse, of course, with lower household income. Here's how those stats look for the lowest quartile:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>% Available 2019</th><th>% Available 2021</th><th>Difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any internet access</td><td>88.6%</td><td>94.4%</td><td>+5.8</td></tr><tr><td>Smartphone-only</td><td>14.1%</td><td>9.8%</td><td>-4.3</td></tr><tr><td>No internet access</td><td>11.4%</td><td>5.6%</td><td>-5.8</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite the fact that these numbers are going down, that's still a huge number of people in absolute terms (1.87 million students in this category with only mobile access.)</p><h2 id="what-do-we-do-with-this-information">What Do We Do With This Information?</h2><p>So that's a lot of words to say this: despite gains in the last couple of years, it's still not safe to assume that every user of your software either has access to stable internet, or is willing and able to pay to get high speeds.</p><p>That said, I'm deliberately not making any moral judgments here. If you think you're in a situation where you can ignore this data, I'm not going to come after you. But if you dismiss it out of hand, you're likely going to be putting your users (and business) in a tough spot.</p><p>I think it's worth considering a couple of scenarios in the parts of your software that someone interacts with regularly:</p><ol><li>What if that person is on a slow link? If you've never had bad internet access, maybe think of this as plane wifi. Rural satellite connections behave very similarly: high latency, speed and (sometimes) low data caps.</li><li>What if that person is on a mobile/metered/capped network? Remember that 4G is like 5/1Mbps, and 3G is even worse. Big downloads are probably not a great idea.</li></ol><p>This is also a very US-centric view, plus it doesn't consider latency from distance between your data center and your user's device. Still, though, I think this shows that this problem is real and we should take it into account when designing software.</p><div id="my-history"><p><sup>2</sup></p><p>I grew up in a semi-rural area (mountains) and this was the only real option. As a kid, I really hated it! The latency was too bad to play games with my friends online, and I also regularly hit our household's download cap and got us all throttled to basically-dialup for the rest of the month.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

          <p>If you feel it's a bit brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question, <strong>you can still preface your message with as many pleasantries as you see fit.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"hey man, what's up? also, any idea when that thing's due?"</li>
<li>"Hi there! Hope you're well. I'm after the latest deck, when you get a sec :)"</li>
<li>"hey, if you're not busy, could you update those NFRs?"</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply also allows for <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.</p>
<p>When done right - everyone's happy! 🎉</p>

When these railway networks entered cities, however, they faced a crucial problem: they had to stop. Rather than carrying on through the city, it was common for them to terminate on its edge.</p><p><span>In part, this was due to the high cost of acquiring land in urban areas. It was also a technological problem: the </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/" rel="">tunneling technologies</a><span> that would enable railways to run into the centre underground without destroying everything in their path had not yet been invented. Finally, the problem was sometimes regulatory as well: in cities such as London railways </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_Metropolitan_Railway_Termini" rel="">were prohibited</a><span> from penetrating too deep into the urban area.</span></p><p><span>The result was that nineteenth century railways often terminated roughly wherever the city limits were when they were built. Some Victorian urban networks, like those of London and Paris, thus resemble a vast hubless wheel whose spokes do not quite join one another in the middle. In other cases, the lines circled round the city and then all entered it at the same point, terminating together in one huge station. This model was common in Germany, so that stations of this sort are still sometimes known by the German name </span><em>Hauptbahnhof</em><span> (literally: main station).</span></p><p>At the end of the nineteenth century, electrification and improvements in tunneling technology led to the emergence of a new kind of railway: the modern metro. Metros were a huge advance in three ways. First, they could go anywhere in the city. Second, metro lines could easily interconnect with one other, meaning that passengers could use the network to travel swiftly from any part of the city to any other part of the city, rather than merely going from a suburb to the edge of the center. Third, the lines were not bottlenecked by the capacity of a central terminus.</p><p>Inner-city termini like London Waterloo and the Gare du Nord in Paris have always handled a complex range of intercity and suburban trains, so delays on any one service can easily propagate over to others. To stop every small delay from generating a huge chain of further delays, tracks and platforms have to be used far below their theoretical maximum capacity: the system can only operate smoothly by preserving a great deal of redundancy. Trains therefore wait around at the terminus for longer than strictly necessary, to recover from delays.</p><p>This, in turn, means that termini have to be massive, and in the age of steam, this was compounded by needing to have room to turn around and store steam locomotives and carriages. Today, the Gare du Nord has 28 tracks above ground, and Waterloo has 24.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png" width="593" height="445.56456043956047" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1094,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:593,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The giant Gare du Nord (right) and the Gare de l’Est in Paris.

But expanding central termini is rarely straightforward: they are typically surrounded by expensive land containing dense urban fabric which would have to be demolished. Furthermore, they are often located on viaducts or in a trench, which makes their expansion technically difficult. Over time, terminus capacity thus generally became the binding constraint on the number of trains that could be run in and out of the urban core, limiting the frequency of both the suburban trains and intercity services.</p><p>Metros, by contrast, could get away with much smaller termini. A typical metro runs a very simple service pattern: every train stops at every station, with few branch lines, and shares no track with any other services, so delays are much less likely. A metro train can easily turn around in well under five minutes, so its terminus only requires two or three platforms.</p><p>In the first decades of the twentieth century, metro lines were built in cities across Europe and North America like Paris, Tokyo, London, Barcelona, and New York. In all of these cities, however, metro lines were built to supplement the Victorian legacy networks, rather than to replace them. As a result, the legacy networks are still there today.</p><p><span>Since building tunneled metro lines is so expensive, these legacy networks are often more extensive than modern metros. The map on the above is London’s metro network (and even this, as we will see, incorporates some bits of legacy lines). The map below shows London’s whole</span><em> </em><span>railway network. Nearly all of the additional lines are Victorian: the pre-metro legacy system is actually far greater than the modern metro.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png" width="619" height="961.845220030349" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:659,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:619,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>London is not an anomaly. In Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago, the suburban railway network is much bigger than the metro, and the same is true in Paris, Tokyo and Berlin. A small number of expensive modern metro lines operate alongside vast Victorian networks, a legacy from the golden age of railways. In Britain, nearly all cities have a Victorian legacy network, but only three – London, Glasgow and Newcastle – have something that is unambiguously a metro.</p><p>One of the Holy Grails of transport policy has thus been a way to turn these legacy lines into something like a modern metro system. The solution developed by many transit authorities is known as through running. This means taking suburban lines on opposite sides of the city, and joining them up by running trains through the city center, usually in a tunnel. This tunnel does not necessarily have to be very long: in some cities, only a handful of kilometers is needed, because the rest of the infrastructure (the legacy lines that are joined together by the tunnel) is already there. For the price of a comparatively small section of tunnel, a large number of suburbs can get metro-like service directly into the city center.</p><p>Through running has convergently evolved in many places. This article looks at two of them, Munich and London. Munich is distinctive in having used through running to create what is probably the best transit network on earth, relative to the size of the city. London is distinctive in the sheer size of its legacy network, due to its enormous size in the nineteenth century. This means that through running has offered it opportunities of unique scale and complexity.</p><p>For countries with extensive Victorian legacy networks, through running is one of the most important themes in modern transport policy. Across the world, many cities puzzle over how they can pay for the vast costs of developing an all-new metro system. But if they can get through running right they don’t necessarily have to. Often 90 percent of their modern rail network is already there and has been for 150 years. The stories of Munich and London show how they might fill in the remaining ten percent to create world-leading transit systems at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>A terminological note. In the language of railway engineers, the Victorian legacy networks we are discussing are generally called ‘suburban railways’. This is confusing, because metros are also railways and also run in suburbs, and also because the Victorian systems in question are often the suburban sections of intercity lines. But we bow to convention, and in what follows the surface-level Victorian terminating lines are called ‘suburban railways’ and the underground networks are called ‘metros’.</p><p><span>Munich has a good claim to the best rapid-transit system of any medium-sized city in the world. Within ten kilometers of the center of Munich, </span><a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/" rel="">there are 1.6 million people</a><span>, who are served by 284 stations and 194 tram stops, all of which receive a fast, frequent service.</span></p><p>Munich has two different railway systems. The U-Bahn (short for ‘underground railway’ in German) is a conventional metro system, which serves only the urban area. But there is also the S-Bahn, which is a network of through-running trains that connect the city to outlying towns up to 40 kilometers away as the crow flies.</p><p>Before its metro system was built in the 1960s, Munich had two networks of commuter trains. One network radiated out of the Hauptbahnhof, the city’s main station, which is on the western edge of the city center. Another radiated out of Ostbahnhof, the eastern station, which is much further away from the center. For the reasons described above, neither reached the heart of the city. There was (and still is) an above-ground connection between the two stations, but it is quite a detour, with trains taking about ten minutes to travel 3.5 kilometers as the crow flies. It loops round the city center to the south, and much of its capacity is taken up by long-distance trains traveling to south-eastern Bavaria and Austria.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png" width="662" height="451.4876373626374" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:993,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:662,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>According to this 1893 map, the connection between Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof was not used by suburban trains at all.

In France, Britain, and the United States, the railways were initially built by competing companies that saw each other as rivals, and had little interest in sharing stations. New York City ended up with Pennsylvania Station, operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Grand Central Terminal, operated by the New York Central Railroad. Paris had eight termini at its peak. London has had as many as fifteen, depending on how they are counted.</p><p><span>Even where railways were more centrally planned (including Munich), linking separate networks together was challenging. In Germany, Britain, America, and France, the period of explosive growth of railways mainly took place in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. In this period, tunneling technologies were still in their infancy. The only way railways could run tracks underground was by digging an enormous trench, laying the tracks in it, and then covering it over, a method called </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/" rel="">‘cut and cover’</a><span>. In urban areas, this was expensive and inconvenient: unless the line could be dug underneath a wide street, all the buildings above the future underground line had to be demolished to clear the way for the trench. The other option, which was equally disruptive and expensive, was to build large viaducts through the city center. Berlin did this in 1882 because it was essential for military maneuvers between the eastern and western parts of Germany, but Berlin was the exception rather than the rule.</span></p><p>By the 1920s, the shortcomings of the system were becoming increasingly obvious. The population of Munich increased sevenfold between 1850 and 1930, with most of the growth in newly built suburbs. But the capacity of the suburban network could not be easily increased to meet rising demand. For the reasons explained above, the two central termini were the key constraints on capacity. There was also continued discontent at the fact that suburban services did not reach the city center, a fact that had been made more obvious by the development of trams that could do so.</p><p>On the other hand, there were fewer capacity constraints in the termini at the suburban end, because they usually only handled one type of service (i.e. just a single suburban service, not multiple suburban and intercity ones). This meant they could handle more trains per hour without major risk of generating chains of delays. If they did face capacity constraints, it was normally easier to solve them through expanding termini, since suburban termini are surrounded by less development, and land is cheaper.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png" width="651" height="420.7355769230769" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:651,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption> Geltendorf station, the terminus of Munich S-Bahn route S4.

It is a single network: the S-Bahn tunnel intersects with each U-Bahn line, and the interchanges were designed coherently: with the exception of Hauptbahnhof, none of the interchange stations has more than </span><a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2018/01/16/transit-and-scale-variance-part-2-soviet-triangles/" rel="">two lines intersecting</a><span>, which prevents any station from being overloaded. The fares are also </span><a href="https://springbett.substack.com/p/how-to-simplify-rail-fares" rel="">integrated</a><span> between the two systems, so that passengers are not penalised for changing trains. The S-Bahn tunnel would have been useful in itself, but its integration with the U-Bahn has a ‘multiplier’ effect: with one change of train to the U-Bahn, an S-Bahn passenger can get nearly anywhere in the city.</span></p><p><span>This principle of ‘one network, two systems’ enables Munich to manage the trade-off between station spacing and speed, so that both the dense urban core and the suburbs can be served by rapid transit. Other cities try to achieve the same result by running both express trains, and trains that stop at every station, on the same lines, but this is </span><a href="https://springbett.substack.com/p/how-to-improve-the-elizabeth-line" rel="">difficult to do effectively</a><span>, for the obvious reason that the fast trains tend to get bottlenecked behind the stopping ones.</span></p><p><span>The S-Bahn has also relieved the main station. Today, Munich Hauptbahnhof has 32 terminal tracks above ground which handle about 30 departures per hour in the evening peak, because nearly all of the suburban trains run into the S-Bahn tunnel. One train per track per hour is very low utilization, which means there is plenty of room to make sure delays do not cascade across the network, expand the service in future, or possibly to rationalize the station by selling off part of the track space for development.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-2-166071620" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>But beyond the better connections and the relief provided to the main station, the most important benefit of the Munich S-Bahn has been its frequency. The trunk is able to handle 32 trains per hour in each direction because the branches start in one outlying suburban town, go through the trunk, and then terminate in another suburban town. (Munich has, since December 2024, started temporarily running one branch into Hauptbahnhof due to reliability issues in the trunk.)

Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Vienna, and Zurich all have networks very similar to the Munich S-Bahn, using tunnels to link up lines on opposite sides of the city. Not all S-Bahns require an expensive tunnel: some cities like Cologne, Nuremberg, and Hanover do not have a terminus, so they can simply run their trains through the main station. The S-Bahn model has also been influential on cities in neighbouring countries, such as Copenhagen, Stockholm, Prague, Brussels, and Milan.</p><p>Karlsruhe, a small city in the south-west of Germany near the French border, developed an interesting variation on through running in the 1990s: the tram-train S-Bahn. A ‘train’ from the big town of Pforzheim starts off running on ordinary rails, then through runs on the city streets of Karlsruhe as a tram, before becoming a train again on the other side of the city. Although the tram portion is slow, the city is small enough that this does not have a large effect on journey times. The ‘Karlsruhe model’ has been emulated around the world, including in Sheffield in the United Kingdom.</p><p>In all of these cities, the principle is the same: to enable all of the suburban railway lines to through run onto a trunk that goes through the city center, whether that trunk be a tunnel, platforms at the main station, or occasionally a tram network.</p><p>Through running has convergently evolved in several different places. One of these was Germany. Another was London.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, London was the world’s largest city, and it had an enormous network of suburban railways. These were originally built by competing, private companies, which were set up in the mid-nineteenth century to connect the capital with other major cities like Birmingham, Bristol, and Brighton. Each company built its own London terminus almost always on the edge of the urban area. The theoretical opportunity for through running in London was thus gigantic, uniting the enormous and disorganized system of suburban railways.</p><p>The problem with London’s suburban railway system has been obvious from a start. As soon as underground railways became possible, companies began designing networks to connect the various termini together, beginning with what later became the Metropolitan and District lines of the London Underground. Their aim was to allow commuters to move between the various disconnected ‘spokes’ of the suburban ‘wheel’. This was not, however, through running: passengers would need to change trains at a terminus like King’s Cross to get to the early Underground lines. The suburban lines were not directly linked together.</p><p><span>The Victorians managed only one true example of through running, the Snow Hill Tunnel. This went south from Farringdon to a station called Ludgate Hill, which enabled the lines north and south of the Thames to be connected. London’s first crossrail can thus be dated to 1 August 1866, when the first trains used this new connection to run from Herne Hill, in the south of London, to Barnet, in the north of London.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-5-166071620" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Although the service was initially fairly successful, the slow, infrequent, steam-operated suburban service was outcompeted by electric trams after the Kingsway tunnel allowed them to cross the river, and closed to passengers in 1916.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-6-166071620" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png" width="610" height="337.25961538461536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:805,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:610,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The Snow Hill tunnel briefly enabled an early form of the through running in London.

One problem was that through running would have involved railway companies letting one another’s trains run on their tracks, which they were often unwilling to do. Another was that through running would require more </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/" rel="">cut-and-cover</a><span> tunnels to be built, which meant digging a huge trench, laying the track in it, and covering it over. Cut and cover requires the total destruction of everything in the way of the trench, which makes it phenomenally expensive, unless it follows the line of a wide street. Some cities, like New York and Paris, had lots of wide streets for this purpose, but central London has only one, Euston Road, which already had the Metropolitan Line running underneath it.</span></p><p><span>At the end of the nineteenth century, advances in tunneling technology meant a new generation of underground lines could be built. These ‘deep level’ lines, powered by electricity, ran far beneath the surface of the earth and were bored rather than excavated, so they no longer required destructive trenches to be cut through the urban fabric. This did not, however, solve London’s through-running problem. The suburban lines remained operated by steam, so none was suitable for through running without expensive investment in electrification.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-7-166071620" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p>Through running began to get underway again in the 1930s, after London’s railway services were nationalized and schemes began to be developed to coordinate them more effectively. As part of its New Works Program, the London Passenger Transport Board joined a short Edwardian underground line with two suburban railway lines on either side, resulting in what we now know as the Central Line. The suburban lines were electrified so that their trains could run through the underground line, and then out into the suburban line at the other end. A total of 14 kilometers of tunnel were built to join the lines together.</p><p>By the 1940s, there was high enthusiasm for further through-running schemes. In 1943, planners prepared the County of London Plan for rebuilding London after the Second World War, which included grand designs to through run nearly all of London’s suburban railways with a series of tunnels. The Plan’s rail proposals were mainly downstream of its plans for improving the South Bank of the River Thames, an area criss-crossed by three huge railway viaducts which, the planners judged, impeded rational planning of the area. The Plan therefore suggested removing the stations and their attached viaducts, and building a series of tunnels which would enable through running of nearly all traffic.</p><p><span>However, these schemes came to nothing. The British state was virtually bankrupted by the Second World War, with </span><a href="https://obr.uk/box/post-world-war-ii-debt-reduction/" rel="">government debt rising to 270 percent of GDP</a><span>, and struggled to initiate major infrastructure projects in its aftermath. Resources were channeled into finishing the pre-war extensions, with the Central Line Extension being finally completed in 1948.</span></p><p><span>In any event, new through-running schemes seemed less attractive. London’s population began to decline: from 8.6 million people in 1939, to 8 million in 1961, to 6.8 million in 1981. Cars drew passengers away from railways. Furthermore, the Green Belt in particular, and more generally </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/" rel="">the introduction of Britain’s planning system</a><span>, made it impossible to build new housing around commuter railways, reducing the value of more frequent services to these stations.</span></p><p><span>Even today, the outer reaches of the Central Line extensions go to places like Grange Hill and Theydon Bois, which are </span><a href="https://www.createstreets.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BRM_CreateStreets_New-Towns-Report_111224.pdf" rel="">‘mirror towns’</a><span>: on one side of the tracks there is suburban development, on the other there are just fields. It was assumed in the 1930s that suburbia would rapidly spring up on the fields next to the stations, but in many cases there are streets that, quite literally, end when their builders were conscripted or redirected into war industries in 1939, and were never finished due to the Green Belt.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png" width="1456" height="690" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:690,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption> Trentwood Side in Enfield, North London.

London’s population began to recover from its 1981 nadir, and the economic boom of the 1980s brought more traffic to the railways, many of them commuters into London.</p><p>In 1988, London implemented a through running project called Thameslink. This involved reopening the disused Snow Hill Tunnel, thereby restoring London’s first through-running service. Thameslink was an unusual project: although the passenger service had closed in 1916, the tunnel had been in use for freight until 1971, which meant it was easy to resurrect the service 15 years later. Although this brought immediate benefits, it was done cheaply, and 30 years later London had to spend six billion pounds on untangling track layouts, rebuilding stations and resignaling the route to get the most out of the Snow Hill Tunnel.</p><p><span>Unlike the original Thameslink, other through running projects would require much more substantial investment. But in the boom years of the late 1980s, it looked as though this would come. In 1989, the </span><a href="https://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=1294" rel="">Central London Rail Study</a><span>, commissioned jointly by the national government, British Railways and London Transport, proposed what eventually became the Elizabeth Line, a huge through-running scheme joining a suburban line running east from Liverpool Street into Essex with one running west from Paddington into Berkshire. It also proposed two other through-running schemes, which it expected to have lower benefits relative to their costs.</span></p><p>These proposed schemes were intended to kill two birds with one stone. As London grew, both the central trunks of the Tube and the suburban branches grew busier. The route that eventually became the Elizabeth Line would relieve the Central Line by providing a new parallel east-west route, as well as enabling through running of some of the suburban branches.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png" width="1183" height="838" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:838,&quot;width&quot;:1183,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The early plan for what is now the Elizabeth line.

In 1991, a bill to build the line was put before Parliament. In 1994, however, it was rejected, partly because an economic downturn had led to fewer commuters in London, but also perhaps because decision makers did not understand the benefits of through running: one cabinet minister was quoted as saying, ‘It went from nowhere to nowhere. No sane person has ever wanted to go to Shenfield’, one of the suburban termini of the line. But the idea did not go away.

But in total, the Elizabeth Line trains travel 117 kilometers because of the two existing suburban lines it cannibalized.</p><p><span>The Elizabeth Line has been a huge success: within a year of opening, quarterly fare revenue </span><a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-quarterly-performance-report-q2-2023-24-acc.pdf" rel="">exceeded predictions</a><span> by £22 million. Nearly every station on the Line has surpassed its pre-COVID passenger numbers, even though in 2024 the average London station not on the Elizabeth Line had 10 percent fewer people than before COVID.</span></p><p>The Elizabeth Line has been transformative for places like Romford, a suburb of eastern London. Romford used to get direct trains to only Liverpool Street: it now has them to most of central London, Heathrow Airport, and the western suburbs. The trains also run twice as frequently as they used to. The rest of the city center (plus most of its suburbs) can be reached with one change of train. Because the trains to Romford no longer run into the terminus part of Liverpool Street, other services using the station have become more reliable as well.</p><p><span>Most importantly, this has been done cost-effectively. Although the Elizabeth Line tunnel was </span><a href="https://transitcosts.com/london-crossrail/" rel="">expensive</a><span>, for the price of 21 kilometers of tunnel, London got a 117 kilometer-long railway network. In short, Romford has got most of the benefits of a connection to the London Underground, without needing to build an underground line all the way to the suburb.</span></p><p>The Elizabeth Line was a success, but a costly one. It became viable only when London was booming and its railway lines were crying out for more capacity. If all through running schemes were like the Elizabeth Line, we might conclude it was an expensive luxury, useful only in the wealthiest and most transport-constrained cities.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not the case. For one thing, through running does not need to be as costly as the Elizabeth Line. As the table below shows, cities differ greatly in the costs at which they build through-running projects. These costs are usually correlated with the costs for railway projects in that country generally, suggesting their variation is mainly the result of regulatory and procurement systems rather than the particular physical features of the individual lines.</p><p><span>But as important as the cost per kilometer of track is the amount of track that needs to be made. Some cities, like Cologne, do not need to tunnel to allow trains to run through: they only need works to expand the city’s main station, or alter its layout. Where tunneling is necessary, it does not necessarily need to be on the scale of the Elizabeth Line. London is a megacity, but owing to its smaller size, a tunnel to connect Manchester’s suburban railway lines together would only be a couple of kilometers long, roughly a tenth of the length of the Elizabeth Line’s tunnel and more similar to the scale of the trunk tunnel of the Munich S-Bahn. Indeed, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070911034934/http://www.metromapsoftheworld.com/PipeDreams/PiccVic/" rel="">such a scheme was approved and was almost built in the early 1970s</a><span>. It never went ahead due to pressures on the public finances, but similar projects were built in Liverpool, which used 1.5 kilometers of tunnel, and Newcastle, which used 5 kilometers.</span></p><p>Through running has potential in any city with a network of legacy suburban lines. In general, this is likely to be the case in countries that industrialized in the nineteenth century, when railways had been invented but metros had not.</p><p>Britain is a particularly striking example of this. British cities outside of London are notorious for their lack of metro and tram systems, but many of them actually have enormous suburban railway networks. The problem with these systems is not that they have poor coverage, but they have low frequency and poor interconnectivity. These are problems that can be solved by through running, turning them into something similar to modern metro systems, at a small fraction of the cost of developing such a metro from scratch.</p><p>Not all countries are so fortunate. China, for instance, developed large cities in the twentieth century with neither suburban railways nor modern metros. Today, the Chinese authorities want to improve their urban rail systems. But in the absence of suburban railways that can through run, that means developing vast underground metro systems from scratch at enormous expense.</p><p>Through running is a cost-effective way of upgrading pre-existing railway lines. This is beneficial for passengers who get a better quality of service, and in itself justifies through running. But through-run lines also are able to catalyze urban growth, by making better-connected areas desirable locations for development.</p><p><span>The Elizabeth Line has enabled development around stations like Woolwich, West Drayton and Southall, while new commuter towns have been </span><a href="https://www.createstreets.com/projects/creating-new-towns-fast-and-well/" rel="">proposed at Taplow and Iver</a><span>. Meanwhile in Munich a brand-new urban quarter called Freiham is being built around a brand new S-Bahn station.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png" width="649" height="365.0625" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:649,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcc48702-9cc4-4e9d-9553-d3029338971b_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span> Dense residential development around the new Freiham S-Bahn station.

In the 1930s, Copenhagen developed a high-capacity through-running system called the S-tog, which works much like the Munich S-Bahn. In the 1940s, Copenhagen developed its celebrated ‘finger plan’ for further development, with the city extending outward in urban ‘fingers’ along the lines of the S-tog, leaving open countryside in the areas between. Dozens of neighbourhoods are now clustered around S-tog stations, enjoying its fast, frequent, and highly interconnected service across Copenhagen and its environs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png" width="469" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:469,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The famous 'finger plan', with the five fingers corresponding to S-tog routes. Source: Dansk Byplanlaboratorium.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Crucially, the success or failure of through-running schemes does not depend on building new housing around the lines, because through-run lines are so much cheaper that they can often be justified purely on the basis of benefits of existing passengers. The reverse is usually true with metro schemes: due to their higher costs, they can only be financially viable if they are surrounded by high-density development. If that development does not materialize, either because of an economic downturn or because land-use regulations make it prohibitively expensive to build, the metro line will be an economic failure.</p><p>It is tempting to think that the most important ways to improve transport involve new technology: self-driving cars, flying taxis, or even e-scooters. But often, the best investments involve getting the most out of existing technology, through smaller investments that have a strong multiplier effect. Through running involves using a fairly old technology, deep bore tunneling, to improve an even older technology, commuter railways. 90 percent of London’s S-Bahn network is already built, and with Manchester this is closer to 95 percent. The opportunity is great in North America: Boston only needs a mile of tunnel, and Toronto and New York City already have the infrastructure for through running, but choose not to use it. By weaving together Victorian lines, these cities can get the best railway networks in the world. It’s not a free lunch, but most of it has already been paid for.</p><p><em><span>Benedict Springbett is a </span><a href="http://springbett.substack.com/" rel="">writer</a><span> and Bar student.</span></em></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><!----><!----><main>  <img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/brainonllm.png" alt="Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task"> <div><p>as seen on:</p> <p><img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/media/NewYorkTimes.svg" alt="The New York Times"> <img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/media/salon-logo.svg" alt="Salon"></p></div> <p>With today's wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses
		engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages
		and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the
		educational context of writing an essay.</p> <p>We assigned participants to three groups: LLM group, Search Engine group, Brain-only group,
		where each participant used a designated tool (or no tool in the latter) to write an essay. We
		conducted 3 sessions with the same group assignment for each participant. In the 4th session we
		asked LLM group participants to use no tools (we refer to them as LLM-to-Brain), and the
		Brain-only group participants were asked to use LLM (Brain-to-LLM). We recruited a total of 54
		participants for Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 18 participants among them completed session 4.</p> <p>We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record participants' brain activity in order to assess
		their cognitive engagement and cognitive load, and to gain a deeper understanding of neural
		activations during the essay writing task. We performed NLP analysis, and we interviewed each
		participant after each session. We performed scoring with the help from the human teachers and
		an AI judge (a specially built AI agent).</p> <p>We discovered a consistent homogeneity across the Named Entities Recognition (NERs), n-grams,
		ontology of topics within each group. EEG analysis presented robust evidence that LLM, Search
		Engine and Brain-only groups had significantly different neural connectivity patterns,
		reflecting divergent cognitive strategies. Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with
		the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging
		networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the
		weakest overall coupling. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed weaker neural
		connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks; and the Brain-to-LLM participants
		demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‑engagement of widespread occipito-parietal and
		prefrontal nodes, likely supporting the visual processing, similar to the one frequently
		perceived in the Search Engine group. The reported ownership of LLM group's essays in the
		interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only
		group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just
		minutes prior.</p> <p>As the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this
		study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the
		results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the
		benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM
		group's participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all
		levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.</p> <p>We hope this study serves as a preliminary guide to understanding the cognitive and practical
		impacts of AI on learning environments.</p> <p>Distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></p> <p>© Copyright 2025: <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/nkosmyna/overview/" target="_blank">Nataliya Kosmyna</a>, Eugene Hauptmann</p></main><!----><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->

						<p><b>The Humble Programmer</b><br>
							by<br>
							Edsger W. Dijkstra</p>
						<p>As a result of a long sequence of coincidences I entered the programming profession officially on the first spring morning of 1952 and as far as I have been able to trace, I was the first Dutchman to do so in my country. In retrospect the most amazing thing was the slowness with which, at least in my part of the world, the programming profession emerged, a slowness which is now hard to believe. But I am grateful for two vivid recollections from that period that establish that slowness beyond any doubt.</p>
						<p>After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with A.&nbsp;van Wijngaarden, who was then my boss at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam, a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable theoretical physicist, or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A programmer? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was programming? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on van Wijngaarden’s office door, asking him whether I could “speak to him for a moment”; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come? This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could. One moral of the above story is, of course, that we must be very careful when we give advice to younger people; sometimes they follow it!</p>
						<p>Another two years later, in 1957, I married and Dutch marriage rites require you to state your profession and I stated that I was a programmer. But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession. And, believe it or not, but under the heading “profession” my marriage act shows the ridiculous entry “theoretical physicist”!</p>
						<p>So much for the slowness with which I saw the programming profession emerge in my own country. Since then I have seen more of the world, and it is my general impression that in other countries, apart from a possible shift of dates, the growth pattern has been very much the same.</p>
						<p>Let me try to capture the situation in those old days in a little bit more detail, in the hope of getting a better understanding of the situation today. While we pursue our analysis, we shall see how many common misunderstandings about the true nature of the programming task can be traced back to that now distant past.</p>
						<p>The first automatic electronic computers were all unique, single-copy machines and they were all to be found in an environment with the exciting flavour of an experimental laboratory. Once the vision of the automatic computer was there, its realisation was a tremendous challenge to the electronic technology then available, and one thing is certain: we cannot deny the courage of the groups that decided to try and build such a fantastic piece of equipment. For fantastic pieces of equipment they were: in retrospect one can only wonder that those first machines worked at all, at least sometimes. The overwhelming problem was to get and keep the machine in working order. The preoccupation with the physical aspects of automatic computing is still reflected in the names of the older scientific societies in the field, such as the Association for Computing Machinery or the British Computer Society, names in which explicit reference is made to the physical equipment.</p>
						<p>What about the poor programmer? Well, to tell the honest truth: he was hardly noticed. For one thing, the first machines were so bulky that you could hardly move them and besides that, they required such extensive maintenance that it was quite natural that the place where people tried to use the machine was the same laboratory where the machine had been developed. Secondly, his somewhat invisible work was without any glamour: you could show the machine to visitors and that was several orders of magnitude more spectacular than some sheets of coding. But most important of all, the programmer himself had a very modest view of his own work: his work derived all its significance from the existence of that wonderful machine. Because that was a unique machine, he knew only too well that his programs had only local significance and also, because it was patently obvious that this machine would have a limited lifetime, he knew that very little of his work would have a lasting value. Finally, there is yet another circumstance that had a profound influence on the programmer’s attitude to his work: on the one hand, besides being unreliable, his machine was usually too slow and its memory was usually too small, i.e. he was faced with a pinching shoe, while on the other hand its usually somewhat queer order code would cater for the most unexpected constructions. And in those days many a clever programmer derived an immense intellectual satisfaction from the cunning tricks by means of which he contrived to squeeze the impossible into the constraints of his equipment.</p>
						<p>Two opinions about programming date from those days. I mention them now, I shall return to them later. The one opinion was that a really competent programmer should be puzzle-minded and very fond of clever tricks; the other opinion was that programming was nothing more than optimizing the efficiency of the computational process, in one direction or the other.</p>
						<p>The latter opinion was the result of the frequent circumstance that, indeed, the available equipment was a painfully pinching shoe, and in those days one often encountered the naive expectation that, once more powerful machines were available, programming would no longer be a problem, for then the struggle to push the machine to its limits would no longer be necessary and that was all what programming was about, wasn’t it? But in the next decades something completely different happened: more powerful machines became available, not just an order of magnitude more powerful, even several orders of magnitude more powerful. But instead of finding ourselves in the state of eternal bliss of all programming problems solved, we found ourselves up to our necks in the software crisis! How come?</p>
						<p>There is a minor cause: in one or two respects modern machinery is basically more difficult to handle than the old machinery. Firstly, we have got the I/O interrupts, occurring at unpredictable and irreproducible moments; compared with the old sequential machine that pretended to be a fully deterministic automaton, this has been a dramatic change and many a systems programmer’s grey hair bears witness to the fact that we should not talk lightly about the logical problems created by that feature. Secondly, we have got machines equipped with multi-level stores, presenting us problems of management strategy that, in spite of the extensive literature on the subject, still remain rather elusive. So much for the added complication due to structural changes of the actual machines.</p>
						<p>But I called this a minor cause; the major cause is... that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming had become an equally gigantic problem. In this sense the electronic industry has not solved a single problem, it has only created them, it has created the problem of using its products. To put it in another way: as the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a thousand, society’s ambition to apply these machines grew in proportion, and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of tension between ends and means. The increased power of the hardware, together with the perhaps even more dramatic increase in its reliability, made solutions feasible that the programmer had not dared to dream about a few years before. And now, a few years later, he <em>had</em> to dream about them and, even worse, he had to transform such dreams into reality! Is it a wonder that we found ourselves in a software crisis? No, certainly not, and as you may guess, it was even predicted well in advance; but the trouble with minor prophets, of course, is that it is only five years later that you really know that they had been right.</p>
						<p>Then, in the mid-sixties, something terrible happened: the computers of the so-called third generation made their appearance. The official literature tells us that their price/performance ratio has been one of the major design objectives. But if you take as “performance” the duty cycle of the machine’s various components, little will prevent you from ending up with a design in which the major part of your performance goal is reached by internal housekeeping activities of doubtful necessity. And if your definition of price is the price to be paid for the hardware, little will prevent you from ending up with a design that is terribly hard to program for: for instance the order code might be such as to enforce, either upon the programmer or upon the system, early binding decisions presenting conflicts that really cannot be resolved. And to a large extent these unpleasant possibilities seem to have become reality.</p>
						<p>When these machines were announced and their functional specifications became known, quite a few among us must have become quite miserable; at least I was. It was only reasonable to expect that such machines would flood the computing community, and it was therefore all the more important that their design should be as sound as possible. But the design embodied such serious flaws that I felt that with a single stroke the progress of computing science had been retarded by at least ten years: it was then that I had the blackest week in the whole of my professional life. Perhaps the most saddening thing now is that, even after all those years of frustrating experience, still so many people honestly believe that some law of nature tells us that machines have to be that way. They silence their doubts by observing how many of these machines have been sold, and derive from that observation the false sense of security that, after all, the design cannot have been that bad. But upon closer inspection, that line of defense has the same convincing strength as the argument that cigarette smoking must be healthy because so many people do it.</p>
						<p>It is in this connection that I regret that it is not customary for scientific journals in the computing area to publish reviews of newly announced computers in much the same way as we review scientific publications: to review machines would be at least as important. And here I have a confession to make: in the early sixties I wrote such a review with the intention of submitting it to the CACM, but in spite of the fact that the few colleagues to whom the text was sent for their advice, urged me all to do so, I did not dare to do it, fearing that the difficulties either for myself or for the editorial board would prove to be too great. This suppression was an act of cowardice on my side for which I blame myself more and more. The difficulties I foresaw were a consequence of the absence of generally accepted criteria, and although I was convinced of the validity of the criteria I had chosen to apply, I feared that my review would be refused or discarded as “a matter of personal taste”. I still think that such reviews would be extremely useful and I am longing to see them appear, for their accepted appearance would be a sure sign of maturity of the computing community.</p>
						<p>The reason that I have paid the above attention to the hardware scene is because I have the feeling that one of the most important aspects of any computing tool is its influence on the thinking habits of those that try to use it, and because I have reasons to believe that that influence is many times stronger than is commonly assumed. Let us now switch our attention to the software scene.</p>
						<p>Here the diversity has been so large that I must confine myself to a few stepping stones. I am painfully aware of the arbitrariness of my choice and I beg you not to draw any conclusions with regard to my appreciation of the many efforts that will remain unmentioned.</p>
						<p>In the beginning there was the EDSAC in Cambridge, England, and I think it quite impressive that right from the start the notion of a subroutine library played a central role in the design of that machine and of the way in which it should be used. It is now nearly 25 years later and the computing scene has changed dramatically, but the notion of basic software is still with us, and the notion of the closed subroutine is still one of the key concepts in programming. We should recognise the closed subroutines as one of the greatest software inventions; it has survived three generations of computers and it will survive a few more, because it caters for the implementation of one of our basic patterns of abstraction. Regrettably enough, its importance has been underestimated in the design of the third generation computers, in which the great number of explicitly named registers of the arithmetic unit implies a large overhead on the subroutine mechanism. But even that did not kill the concept of the subroutine, and we can only pray that the mutation won’t prove to be hereditary.</p>
						<p>The second major development on the software scene that I would like to mention is the birth of FORTRAN. At that time this was a project of great temerity and the people responsible for it deserve our great admiration. It would be absolutely unfair to blame them for shortcomings that only became apparent after a decade or so of extensive usage: groups with a successful look-ahead of ten years are quite rare! In retrospect we must rate FORTRAN as a successful coding technique, but with very few effective aids to conception, aids which are now so urgently needed that time has come to consider it out of date. The sooner we can forget that FORTRAN has ever existed, the better, for as a vehicle of thought it is no longer adequate: it wastes our brainpower, is too risky and therefore too expensive to use. FORTRAN’s tragic fate has been its wide acceptance, mentally chaining thousands and thousands of programmers to our past mistakes. I pray daily that more of my fellow-programmers may find the means of freeing themselves from the curse of compatibility.</p>
						<p>The third project I would not like to leave unmentioned is LISP, a fascinating enterprise of a completely different nature. With a few very basic principles at its foundation, it has shown a remarkable stability. Besides that, LISP has been the carrier for a considerable number of in a sense our most sophisticated computer applications. LISP has jokingly been described as “the most intelligent way to misuse a computer”. I think that description a great compliment because it transmits the full flavour of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.</p>
						<p>The fourth project to be mentioned is ALGOL&nbsp;60. While up to the present day FORTRAN programmers still tend to understand their programming language in terms of the specific implementation they are working with —hence the prevalence of octal and hexadecimal dumps—, while the definition of LISP is still a curious mixture of what the language means and how the mechanism works, the famous Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL&nbsp;60 is the fruit of a genuine effort to carry abstraction a vital step further and to define a programming language in an implementation-independent way. One could argue that in this respect its authors have been so successful that they have created serious doubts as to whether it could be implemented at all! The report gloriously demonstrated the power of the formal method BNF, now fairly known as Backus-Naur-Form, and the power of carefully phrased English, at least when used by someone as brilliant as Peter Naur. I think that it is fair to say that only very few documents as short as this have had an equally profound influence on the computing community. The ease with which in later years the names ALGOL and ALGOL-like have been used, as an unprotected trade mark, to lend some of its glory to a number of sometimes hardly related younger projects, is a somewhat shocking compliment to its standing. The strength of BNF as a defining device is responsible for what I regard as one of the weaknesses of the language: an over-elaborate and not too systematic syntax could now be crammed into the confines of very few pages. With a device as powerful as BNF, the Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL&nbsp;60 should have been much shorter. Besides that I am getting very doubtful about ALGOL&nbsp;60’s parameter mechanism: it allows the programmer so much combinatorial freedom, that its confident use requires a strong discipline from the programmer. Besides expensive to implement it seems dangerous to use.</p>
						<p>Finally, although the subject is not a pleasant one, I must mention PL/1, a programming language for which the defining documentation is of a frightening size and complexity. Using PL/1 must be like flying a plane with 7000 buttons, switches and handles to manipulate in the cockpit. I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language —our basic tool, mind you!— already escapes our intellectual control. And if I have to describe the influence PL/1 can have on its users, the closest metaphor that comes to my mind is that of a drug. I remember from a symposium on higher level programming language a lecture given in defense of PL/1 by a man who described himself as one of its devoted users. But within a one-hour lecture in praise of PL/1. he managed to ask for the addition of about fifty new “features”, little supposing that the main source of his problems could very well be that it contained already far too many “features”. The speaker displayed all the depressing symptoms of addiction, reduced as he was to the state of mental stagnation in which he could only ask for more, more, more... When FORTRAN has been called an infantile disorder, full PL/1, with its growth characteristics of a dangerous tumor, could turn out to be a fatal disease.</p>
						<p>So much for the past. But there is no point in making mistakes unless thereafter we are able to learn from them. As a matter of fact, I think that we have learned so much, that within a few years programming can be an activity vastly different from what it has been up till now, so different that we had better prepare ourselves for the shock. Let me sketch for you one of the possible futures. At first sight, this vision of programming in perhaps already the near future may strike you as utterly fantastic. Let me therefore also add the considerations that might lead one to the conclusion that this vision could be a very real possibility.</p>
						<p>The vision is that, well before the seventies have run to completion, we shall be able to design and implement the kind of systems that are now straining our programming ability, at the expense of only a few percent in man-years of what they cost us now, and that besides that, these systems will be virtually free of bugs. These two improvements go hand in hand. In the latter respect software seems to be different from many other products, where as a rule a higher quality implies a higher price. Those who want really reliable software will discover that they must find means of avoiding the majority of bugs to start with, and as a result the programming process will become cheaper. If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with. In other words: both goals point to the same change.</p>
						<p>Such a drastic change in such a short period of time would be a revolution, and to all persons that base their expectations for the future on smooth extrapolation of the recent past —appealing to some unwritten laws of social and cultural inertia— the chance that this drastic change will take place must seem negligible. But we all know that sometimes revolutions do take place! And what are the chances for this one?</p>
						<p>There seem to be three major conditions that must be fulfilled. The world at large must recognize the need for the change; secondly the economic need for it must be sufficiently strong; and, thirdly, the change must be technically feasible. Let me discuss these three conditions in the above order.</p>
						<p>With respect to the recognition of the need for greater reliability of software, I expect no disagreement anymore. Only a few years ago this was different: to talk about a software crisis was blasphemy. The turning point was the Conference on Software Engineering in Garmisch, October 1968, a conference that created a sensation as there occurred the first open admission of the software crisis. And by now it is generally recognized that the design of any large sophisticated system is going to be a very difficult job, and whenever one meets people responsible for such undertakings, one finds them very much concerned about the reliability issue, and rightly so. In short, our first condition seems to be satisfied.</p>
						<p>Now for the economic need. Nowadays one often encounters the opinion that in the sixties programming has been an overpaid profession, and that in the coming years programmer salaries may be expected to go down. Usually this opinion is expressed in connection with the recession, but it could be a symptom of something different and quite healthy, viz. that perhaps the programmers of the past decade have not done so good a job as they should have done. Society is getting dissatisfied with the performance of programmers and of their products. But there is another factor of much greater weight. In the present situation it is quite usual that for a specific system, the price to be paid for the development of the software is of the same order of magnitude as the price of the hardware needed, and society more or less accepts that. But hardware manufacturers tell us that in the next decade hardware prices can be expected to drop with a factor of ten. If software development were to continue to be the same clumsy and expensive process as it is now, things would get completely out of balance. You cannot expect society to accept this, and therefore we <em>must</em> learn to program an order of magnitude more effectively. To put it in another way: as long as machines were the largest item on the budget, the programming profession could get away with its clumsy techniques, but that umbrella will fold rapidly. In short, also our second condition seems to be satisfied.</p>
						<p>And now the third condition: is it technically feasible? I think it might and I shall give you six arguments in support of that opinion.</p>
						<p>A study of program structure had revealed that programs —even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content— can differ tremendously in their intellectual manageability. A number of rules have been discovered, violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the intellectual manageability of the program. These rules are of two kinds. Those of the first kind are easily imposed mechanically, viz. by a suitably chosen programming language. Examples are the exclusion of goto-statements and of procedures with more than one output parameter. For those of the second kind I at least —but that may be due to lack of competence on my side— see no way of imposing them mechanically, as it seems to need some sort of automatic theorem prover for which I have no existence proof. Therefore, for the time being and perhaps forever, the rules of the second kind present themselves as elements of discipline required from the programmer. Some of the rules I have in mind are so clear that they can be taught and that there never needs to be an argument as to whether a given program violates them or not. Examples are the requirements that no loop should be written down without providing a proof for termination nor without stating the relation whose invariance will not be destroyed by the execution of the repeatable statement.</p>
						<p>I now suggest that we confine ourselves to the design and implementation of intellectually manageable programs. If someone fears that this restriction is so severe that we cannot live with it, I can reassure him: the class of intellectually manageable programs is still sufficiently rich to contain many very realistic programs for any problem capable of algorithmic solution. We must not forget that it is <em>not</em> our business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour. The suggestion of confining ourselves to intellectually manageable programs is the basis for the first two of my announced six arguments.</p>
						<p>Argument one is that, as the programmer only needs to consider intellectually manageable programs, the alternatives he is choosing between are much, much easier to cope with.</p>
						<p>Argument two is that, as soon as we have decided to restrict ourselves to the subset of the intellectually manageable programs, we have achieved, once and for all, a drastic reduction of the solution space to be considered. And this argument is distinct from argument one.</p>
						<p>Argument three is based on the constructive approach to the problem of program correctness. Today a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer’s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in hand. Argument three is essentially based on the following observation. If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance. By definition this approach is only applicable when we restrict ourselves to intellectually manageable programs, but it provides us with effective means for finding a satisfactory one among these.</p>
						<p>Argument four has to do with the way in which the amount of intellectual effort needed to design a program depends on the program length. It has been suggested that there is some kind of law of nature telling us that the amount of intellectual effort needed grows with the square of program length. But, thank goodness, no one has been able to prove this law. And this is because it need not be true. We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “abstraction”; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is <em>not</em> to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. Of course I have tried to find a fundamental cause that would prevent our abstraction mechanisms from being sufficiently effective. But no matter how hard I tried, I did not find such a cause. As a result I tend to the assumption —up till now not disproved by experience— that by suitable application of our powers of abstraction, the intellectual effort needed to conceive or to understand a program need not grow more than proportional to program length. But a by-product of these investigations may be of much greater practical significance, and is, in fact, the basis of my fourth argument. The by-product was the identification of a number of patterns of abstraction that play a vital role in the whole process of composing programs. Enough is now known about these patterns of abstraction that you could devote a lecture to about each of them. What the familiarity and conscious knowledge of these patterns of abstraction imply dawned upon me when I realized that, had they been common knowledge fifteen years ago, the step from BNF to syntax-directed compilers, for instance, could have taken a few minutes instead of a few years. Therefore I present our recent knowledge of vital abstraction patterns as the fourth argument.</p>
						<p>Now for the fifth argument. It has to do with the influence of the tool we are trying to use upon our own thinking habits. I observe a cultural tradition, which in all probability has its roots in the Renaissance, to ignore this influence, to regard the human mind as the supreme and autonomous master of its artefacts. But if I start to analyse the thinking habits of myself and of my fellow human beings, I come, whether I like it or not, to a completely different conclusion, viz. that the tools we are trying to use and the language or notation we are using to express or record our thoughts, are the major factors determining what we can think or express at all! The analysis of the influence that programming languages have on the thinking habits of its users, and the recognition that, by now, brainpower is by far our scarcest resource, they together give us a new collection of yardsticks for comparing the relative merits of various programming languages. The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. In the case of a well-known conversational programming language I have been told from various sides that as soon as a programming community is equipped with a terminal for it, a specific phenomenon occurs that even has a well-established name: it is called “the one-liners”. It takes one of two different forms: one programmer places a one-line program on the desk of another and either he proudly tells what it does and adds the question “Can you code this in less symbols?” —as if this were of any conceptual relevance!— or he just asks “Guess what it does!”. From this observation we must conclude that this language as a tool is an open invitation for clever tricks; and while exactly this may be the explanation for some of its appeal, viz. to those who like to show how clever they are, I am sorry, but I must regard this as one of the most damning things that can be said about a programming language. Another lesson we should have learned from the recent past is that the development of “richer” or “more powerful” programming languages was a mistake in the sense that these baroque monstrosities, these conglomerations of idiosyncrasies, are really unmanageable, both mechanically and mentally. I see a great future for very systematic and very modest programming languages. When I say “modest”, I mean that, for instance, not only ALGOL&nbsp;60’s “for clause”, but even FORTRAN’s “DO loop” may find themselves thrown out as being too baroque. I have run a little programming experiment with really experienced volunteers, but something quite unintended and quite unexpected turned up. None of my volunteers found the obvious and most elegant solution. Upon closer analysis this turned out to have a common source: their notion of repetition was so tightly connected to the idea of an associated controlled variable to be stepped up, that they were mentally blocked from seeing the obvious. Their solutions were less efficient, needlessly hard to understand, and it took them a very long time to find them. It was a revealing, but also shocking experience for me. Finally, in one respect one hopes that tomorrow’s programming languages will differ greatly from what we are used to now: to a much greater extent than hitherto they should invite us to reflect in the structure of what we write down all abstractions needed to cope conceptually with the complexity of what we are designing. So much for the greater adequacy of our future tools, which was the basis of the fifth argument.</p>
						<p>As an aside I would like to insert a warning to those who identify the difficulty of the programming task with the struggle against the inadequacies of our current tools, because they might conclude that, once our tools will be much more adequate, programming will no longer be a problem. Programming will remain very difficult, because once we have freed ourselves from the circumstantial cumbersomeness, we will find ourselves free to tackle the problems that are now well beyond our programming capacity.</p>
						<p>You can quarrel with my sixth argument, for it is not so easy to collect experimental evidence for its support, a fact that will not prevent me from believing in its validity. Up till now I have not mentioned the word “hierarchy”, but I think that it is fair to say that this is a key concept for all systems embodying a nicely factored solution. I could even go one step further and make an article of faith out of it, viz. that the only problems we can really solve in a satisfactory manner are those that finally admit a nicely factored solution. At first sight this view of human limitations may strike you as a rather depressing view of our predicament, but I don’t feel it that way, on the contrary! The best way to learn to live with our limitations is to know them. By the time that we are sufficiently modest to try factored solutions only, because the other efforts escape our intellectual grip, we shall do our utmost best to avoid all those interfaces impairing our ability to factor the system in a helpful way. And I cannot but expect that this will repeatedly lead to the discovery that an initially untractable problem can be factored after all. Anyone who has seen how the majority of the troubles of the compiling phase called “code generation” can be tracked down to funny properties of the order code, will know a simple example of the kind of things I have in mind. The wider applicability of nicely factored solutions is my sixth and last argument for the technical feasibility of the revolution that might take place in the current decade.</p>
						<p>In principle I leave it to you to decide for yourself how much weight you are going to give to my considerations, knowing only too well that I can force no one else to share my beliefs. As each serious revolution, it will provoke violent opposition and one can ask oneself where to expect the conservative forces trying to counteract such a development. I don’t expect them primarily in big business, not even in the computer business; I expect them rather in the educational institutions that provide today’s training and in those conservative groups of computer users that think their old programs so important that they don’t think it worth-while to rewrite and improve them. In this connection it is sad to observe that on many a university campus the choice of the central computing facility has too often been determined by the demands of a few established but expensive applications with a disregard of the question how many thousands of “small users” that are willing to write their own programs were going to suffer from this choice. Too often, for instance, high-energy physics seems to have blackmailed the scientific community with the price of its remaining experimental equipment. The easiest answer, of course, is a flat denial of the technical feasibility, but I am afraid that you need pretty strong arguments for that. No reassurance, alas, can be obtained from the remark that the intellectual ceiling of today’s average programmer will prevent the revolution from taking place: with others programming so much more effectively, he is liable to be edged out of the picture anyway.</p>
						<p>There may also be political impediments. Even if we know how to educate tomorrow’s professional programmer, it is not certain that the society we are living in will allow us to do so. The first effect of teaching a methodology —rather than disseminating knowledge— is that of enhancing the capacities of the already capable, thus magnifying the difference in intelligence. In a society in which the educational system is used as an instrument for the establishment of a homogenized culture, in which the cream is prevented from rising to the top, the education of competent programmers could be politically impalatable.</p>
						<p>Let me conclude. Automatic computers have now been with us for a quarter of a century. They have had a great impact on our society in their capacity of tools, but in that capacity their influence will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture, compared with the much more profound influence they will have in their capacity of intellectual challenge without precedent in the cultural history of mankind. Hierarchical systems seem to have the property that something considered as an undivided entity on one level, is considered as a composite object on the next lower level of greater detail; as a result the natural grain of space or time that is applicable at each level decreases by an order of magnitude when we shift our attention from one level to the next lower one. We understand walls in terms of bricks, bricks in terms of crystals, crystals in terms of molecules etc. As a result the number of levels that can be distinguished meaningfully in a hierarchical system is kind of proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between the largest and the smallest grain, and therefore, unless this ratio is very large, we cannot expect many levels. In computer programming our basic building block has an associated time grain of less than a microsecond, but our program may take hours of computation time. I do not know of any other technology covering a ratio of 10<sup>10</sup> or more: the computer, by virtue of its fantastic speed, seems to be the first to provide us with an environment where highly hierarchical artefacts are both possible and necessary. This challenge, viz. the confrontation with the programming task, is so unique that this novel experience can teach us a lot about ourselves. It should deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation, it should give us better control over the task of organizing our thoughts. If it did not do so, to my taste we should not deserve the computer at all!</p>
						<p>It has already taught us a few lessons, and the one I have chosen to stress in this talk is the following. We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>All web developers know, at some level, that accessibility is important. But when push comes to shove, it can be hard to prioritize it above a bazillion other concerns when you’re trying to center a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and you’re on a tight deadline.</p>
<p>A lot of accessibility advocates lead with the moral argument: for example, that disabled people should have just as much access to the internet as any other person, and that it’s a blight on our whole industry that we continually fail to make it happen.</p>
<p>I personally find these arguments persuasive. But experience has also taught me that “eat your vegetables” is one of the least effective arguments in the world. Scolding people might get them to agree with you in public, or even in principle, but it’s unlikely to change their behavior once no one’s watching.</p>
<p>So in this post, I would like to list some of my personal, completely selfish reasons for building accessible UIs. No finger-wagging here: just good old hardheaded self-interest!</p>

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Style&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;358kB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Build&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Vite&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<p>Ah, that’s much better! Now I can easily zero in on a table cell, or a column header, because they’re all <em>named</em>. I’m not wading through a sea of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s anymore.</p>
<p>Even just adding ARIA <code>role</code>s to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s would be an improvement here:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="css-1x2y3z4" role="table"&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-a5b6c7d" role="rowgroup"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-e8f9g0h" role="columnheader"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Library&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Version&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Size&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f" role="rowgroup"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;UI&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;React&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;167kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;Style&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;358kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;Build&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;Vite&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Especially if you’re using a CSS-in-JS framework (which I’ve simulated with <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/08/css-modules-in-css-modules/#:~:text=Can%20CSS%20Modules%20be%20more%20like%20CSS%20Modules%3F">robo-classes</a> above), the HTML can get quite messy. Building accessibly makes it a lot easier to understand at a distance what each element is supposed to do.</p>
<h2>Naming things</h2>
<p>As all programmers know, naming things is hard. UIs are no exception: is this an “autocomplete”? Or a “dropdown”? Or a “picker”?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="14944" data-permalink="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20/" data-orig-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png" data-orig-size="273,315" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot from 2025-06-15 11-10-20" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png?w=260" data-large-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png?w=273" src="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png" alt="Screenshot of a combobox with &quot;Ne&quot; typed into it and states below in a list like Nebraska, Nevada, and New Hampshire." width="273" height="315"></p>
<p>If you read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-autocomplete-both/">WAI ARIA guidelines</a>, though, then it’s clear what it is: a “combobox”!</p>
<p>No need to grope for the right name: if you add the proper <code>role</code>s, then everything is already named for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>combobox</code></li>
<li><code>listbox</code></li>
<li><code>option</code>s</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, you can use <code>aria-*</code> attributes or <code>role</code>s as a CSS selector. I often see awkward code like this:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div
  className={isActive ? 'active' : ''}
  aria-selected={isActive}
  role='option'
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>active</code> class is clearly redundant here. If you want to style based on the <code>.active</code> selector, you could just as easily style with <code>[aria-selected="true"]</code> instead.</p>
<p>Also, why call it <code>isActive</code> when the ARIA attribute is <code>aria-selected</code>? Just call it “selected” everywhere:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div
  aria-selected={isSelected}
  role='option'
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Much cleaner!</p>
<p>I also find that thinking in terms of roles and ARIA attributes sharpens my thinking, and gives structure to the interface I’m trying to create. Suddenly, I have a <em>language</em> for what I’m building, which can lead to more “obvious” variable names, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area">grid area names</a>, etc.</p>
<h2>Testability</h2>
<p><a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2019/11/05/what-ive-learned-about-accessibility-in-spas/#:~:text=Easier%20integration%20testing">I’ve written about this before</a>, but building accessibly also helps with writing tests. Rather than trying to select an element based on arbitrary classes or attributes, you can write more elegant code like this (e.g. with Playwright):</p>
<pre title="">await page.getByLabel('Name').fill('Nolan')

await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'OK' }).click()
</pre>
<p>Imagine, though, if your entire UI is full of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and robo-classes. How would you find the right inputs and buttons? You could select based on the robo-classes, or by searching for text inside or nearby the elements, but this makes your tests brittle.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/making-your-ui-tests-resilient-to-change">Kent C. Dodds has argued</a>, writing UI tests based on <em>semantics</em> makes your tests more resilient to change. That’s because a UI’s semantic structure (i.e. the accessibility tree) tends to change less frequently than its classes, attributes, or even the composition of its HTML elements. (How many times have you added a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> only to break your UI tests?)</p>
<h2>Power users</h2>
<p>When I’m on a desktop, I tend to be a keyboard power user. I like pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close dialogs, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit a form, or even <kbd>/</kbd> in Firefox to quickly jump to links on the page. I do use a mouse, but I just prefer the keyboard since it’s faster.</p>
<p>So I find it jarring when a website breaks keyboard accessibility – <kbd>Esc</kbd> doesn’t dismiss a dialog, <kbd>Enter</kbd> doesn’t submit a form, <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> don’t change radio buttons. It disrupts my flow when I unexpectedly have to reach for my mouse. (Plus it’s a <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">Van Halen brown M&amp;M</a> that signals to me that the website probably messed something else up, too!)</p>
<p>If you’re building a productivity tool with its own set of keyboard shortcuts (think Slack or GMail), then it’s even more important to get this right. You can’t add a lot of sophisticated keyboard controls if the basic <kbd>Tab</kbd> and focus logic doesn’t work correctly.</p>
<p>A lot of programmers are themselves power users, so I find this argument pretty persuasive. Build a UI that you yourself would like to use!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The reason that I, personally, care about accessibility is probably different from most people’s. I have a family member who is blind, and I’ve known many blind or low-vision people in my career. I’ve heard firsthand how frustrating it can be to use interfaces that aren’t built accessibly.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were disabled, I would probably think to myself, “computer programmers must not care about me.” And judging from the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">miserable WebAIM results</a>, I’d clearly be right:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Across the one million home pages, 50,960,288 distinct accessibility errors were detected—an average of 51 errors per page.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As a web developer who has dabbled in accessibility, though, I find this situation tragic. It’s not <em>really</em> that hard to build accessible interfaces. And I’m not talking about “ideal” or “optimized” – the bar is pretty low, so I’m just talking about something that <em>works at all</em> for people with a disability.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future, accessible interfaces won’t require so much manual intervention from developers. Maybe AI tooling (on either the production or consumption side) will make UIs that are usable out-of-the-box for people with disabilities. I’m actually sympathetic to the Jakob Nielsen argument that <a href="https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/accessibility-generative-ui">“accessibility has failed”</a> – it’s hard to look at the WebAIM results and come to any other conclusion. Maybe the “eat your vegetables” era of accessibility has failed, and it’s time to try new tactics.</p>
<p>That’s why I wrote this post, though. You can build accessibly without having a bleeding heart. And for the time being, unless generative AI swoops in like a <em>deus ex machina</em> to save us, it’s our responsibility as interface designers to do so.</p>
<p>At the same time we’re helping others, though, we can also help ourselves. Like a good hot sauce on your Brussels sprouts, eating your vegetables doesn’t always have to be a chore.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me">https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44294633">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People keep asking me If I use Generative AI tools for coding and what I think of them, so this is my effort to put my thoughts in writing, so that I can send people here instead of having to repeat myself every time I get the question.</p>
<p>From the title you already know that this isn't a pro-AI blog post. But it isn't an anti-AI post either, at least I don't think it is. There are already plenty of articles by AI promoters and AI critics, so I don't feel there is a need for me to write one more of those. While I'm definitely not neutral on the subject, in this article I'm just going to share my personal experience with these tools, from a strictly technical point of view.</p>
<h2>AI is not faster</h2>
<p>Really the main and most important reason why GenAI tools do not work for me is that <strong>they do not make me any faster</strong>. It's really that simple.</p>
<p>It would be easy to use GenAI coding tools to have code written for me. A coding agent would be the most convenient, as it would edit my files while I do something else. This all sounds great, in principle.</p>
<p>The problem is that I'm going to be responsible for that code, so I cannot blindly add it to my project and hope for the best. I could only incorporate AI generated code into a project of mine after I thoroughly review it and make sure I understand it well. I have to feel confident that I can modify or extend this piece of code in the future, or else I cannot use it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately reviewing code is actually harder than most people think. It takes me at least the same amount of time to review code not written by me than it would take me to write the code myself, if not more. There is actually a well known saying in our industry that goes something like "it’s harder to read code than to write it." I believe it was Joel Spolsky (creator of Stack Overflow and Trello) who formalized it first in his <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Things You Should Never Do, Part I</a> article.</p>
<p>You could argue that code that was written by AI can be considered a black box. I guess you can convince yourself that as long as the code works as intended it is safe to use without the need to review it, which would translate into some productivity increase. I think this is highly irresponsible, because the AI is not going to assume any liability if this code ever malfunctions. I'm always the responsible party for the code I produce, with or without AI. Taking on such a large risk is nuts, in my opinion.</p>
<p>This is even more important for some of the work that I do where there are contracts signed, with associated legal obligations and money payments. If I'm hired as a professional, I really have no other choice than to be one. AI tools cannot help me make more money or do my work in less time. The only way I could achieve those things is by degrading the quality of the work and introducing risk, and I'm not willing to do that.</p>
<h2>AI is not a multiplier</h2>
<p>I've heard people say that GenAI coding tools are a multiplier or enabler for them. Basically those who make this claim say that they are able to work faster and tackle more difficult problems when using GenAI. Unfortunately these claims are just based on the perception of the subjects themselves, so there is no hard data to back them up. I guess it is possible that some people can be more efficient reviewing code than I am, but I honestly doubt it. What I think happens is that these people save time because they only spot review the AI generated code, or skip the review phase altogether, which as I said above would be a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>Another common argument I've heard is that Generative AI is helpful when you need to write code in a language or technology you are not familiar with. To me this also makes little sense. The part that I enjoy the most about working as a software engineer is learning new things, so not knowing something has never been a barrier for me. The more you practice learning the easier and faster it gets! In recent times I had to learn Rust, Go, TypeScript, WASM, Java and C# for various projects, and I wouldn't delegate this learning effort to an AI, even if it saved me time. Which it wouldn't, because of all the reasons above about being responsible for the code that I produce. Sorry if I'm a bit repetitive on this.</p>
<h2>AI code is different than human code</h2>
<p>I made all these points to a friend the other day and he asked me why then I gladly accept open source contributions to my projects when they are made by people. Aren't those also code that is not written by myself? Why are those okay but AI generated code is not?</p>
<p>The truth that may be shocking to some is that open source contributions submitted by users do not really save me time either, because I also feel I have to do a rigorous review of them. But I enjoy working with users who have an interest in my projects and take time to report bugs, request new features or submit code changes. These interactions are a source of new ideas more than anything, so they directly help me do better work. This is what I love the most of working in open source!</p>
<p>My friend, who is still unconvinced, suggests I could launch a bunch of AI agents in parallel to create PRs for all my open bugs. It's a game changer, he says. Unfortunately that would cost me money and likely make me slower, for the reasons explained above. Even if we assume that AI coding tools are sophisticated enough (they are not) to fix issues in my projects with little or no supervision, I'm still the bottleneck because all that code has to be reviewed before it can be merged.</p>
<p>The unfortunate side of AI coding tools being widely available is that some users now also generate low effort pull requests with them. I have received some of these, and it's interesting that there is a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> effect that triggers in me when I start reading AI generated code that hasn't been edited and refined by a real person. When I come across pull requests of this type I start asking questions to the submitters about the weird parts of their submissions, because I consider them responsible for the code they want me to merge. They rarely respond.</p>
<h2>AI is not the same as an intern</h2>
<p>Many AI advocates say that you should treat your AI coding tool as an intern that is eager to please. I think the people who say this never worked with interns!</p>
<p>In the beginning, delegating work to an intern causes a productivity decrease for you, for the same reasons I enumerated above. Interns need a lot of hand-holding, and all the code they produce needs to be carefully reviewed before it is accepted.</p>
<p>But interns <em>learn</em> and get better over time. The time that you spend reviewing code or providing feedback to an intern is not wasted, it is an investment in the future. The intern absorbs the knowledge you share and uses it for new tasks you assign to them later on. The need for close supervision goes down throughout the duration of the internship. In the end, interns are often hired by their companies as full time employees because they become successful independent contributors.</p>
<p>An AI tool can only resemble an intern with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a>, which would be a bad kind of intern to have. For every new task this "AI intern" resets back to square one without having learned a thing!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope with this article I've made the technical issues I have with applying GenAI coding tools to my work clear.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as a free lunch with AI coding. I believe people who claim that it makes them faster or more productive are making a conscious decision to relax their quality standards to achieve those gains. Either that or they just say this because they personally benefit from selling AI to you.</p></div><p>Thank you for visiting my blog!

            <p><span>A</span>lmost a decade ago, a Baptist Biblical scholar, a Catholic priest, several rabbis, an Islamic leader, a Zen Buddhist roshi, and more than a dozen other religious leaders walked into a lab—and took high doses of magic mushrooms.</p>
      
    <p>All of them said it was their first time taking the drug. The <a href="https://nautil.us/what-hallucinogens-will-make-you-see-308247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind-altering details</a> of these guided trips were recorded at the time and over the following 16 months, but it wasn’t until recently that the results of the controversial experiment came to light.</p><p>One might wonder how a single psilocybin trip could compare to the catalog of rich transcendent experiences that might accumulate over a lifetime of religious devotion. But according to the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/psymed.2023.0044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">findings</a>, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Psychedelic Medicine</em>, the vast majority of the 33 clergy who participated in the study—more than 90 percent—said taking psilocybin was one of the most spiritually meaningful and deeply sacred experiences of their lives. Almost half said it was the most profound thing they had ever experienced, period. Many of them also said it made them better religious leaders.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Now, years later, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/26/this-is-your-priest-on-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some of these clergy</a> have become evangelists for psychedelics, incorporating them into their own religious teachings. For some of them, the experience led to a release from attachment to dogmas and greater openness to other forms of religious experience. For at least one participant, it was a dark, empty, terrifying trip. Still, none of them ruled out using psilocybin again in the future.</p><p>Publication of the study took so long in part due to charges of ethical lapses, including potential conflicts of interest related to funding sources, as well as the direct involvement of a funder in the research itself. But these conflicts were eventually resolved through disclosure, which the authors say they always intended. Questions also swirled around certain flaws in the study’s execution, which even the authors, scientists at Johns Hopkins University and New York University, admit. </p><p>One issue was bias: Participants may have been primed to see their experiences as sacred by language used in recruitment ads and by the expectations of those running the experiment. (Many of those who chose to participate were also considering leaving the profession at the outset and so could have been seeking a way to reconnect with the divine.) The sample was also small, heavily white, male, and Christian; and representation of a number of major world religions, including Indigenous religious traditions, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism, was absent.</p></div>

          </div><p>Still the results raise questions about the relationship between hallucinogens and religious experience. Most of the major world religions today (Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam) do not advocate the use of mind-altering substances. But psychedelic plants and mushrooms have been employed in sacred ceremonies by <a href="https://nautil.us/the-long-history-of-psychedelic-theft-430330/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indigenous cultures</a> in the Americas for millennia, and many psychedelic researchers suspect they drove pagan mystical experiences in ancient Greece that may have served as the foundations for some religions, including <a href="https://nautil.us/is-christianity-based-on-psychedelic-trips-623594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christianity</a>.</p><p>William James, considered the father of American psychology and author of <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>, is said to have to come to many of his own <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352452917301445#:~:text=For%20James%2C%20the%20use%20of,%2C%20constant%2C%20eternal)%2C%20driven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most central ideas</a> at least in part through hallucinatory experiences with nitrous oxide: the value of religion, the importance of mystical experience, the universe as pluralistic.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
Version 0.2.0 of the Chawan TUI browser has been released.
</p><p>
A tarball of the source tree is available
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-src.tar.xz">here</a>.  Please refer to the README
file for compilation instructions.
</p><p>
A static binary distribution for
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-linux-amd64.tar.xz">amd64 Linux</a> also exists.
To install it, extract the archive somewhere and run <code>make install</code>
as root.  (To uninstall, run <code>make uninstall</code>.)
</p><p>
The same distribution is also available as a <a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-amd64.deb">.deb
package</a>.
</p><h2 id="information-for-package-maintainers"><a href="#information-for-package-maintainers">##</a> Information for package maintainers</h2>
<p>
The current list of mandatory runtime dependencies is:
</p><ul>
<li>libssh2.
</li><li>libbrotli (more precisely, libbrotlicommon and libbrotlidec).
</li><li>OpenSSL or LibreSSL.  For OpenSSL, you will want 3.0 or later.
For LibreSSL, the version in OpenBSD 7.7 has been tested.
</li></ul>
<p>
Previous development versions had other dependencies which no
longer apply, and can be dropped.  In particular, zlib, libseccomp,
termcap/ncurses and libcurl are no longer used.
</p><p>
If you run into an issue while packaging Chawan, please contact me
before trying to patch over it.  Chances are we can solve it upstream.
</p><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next">##</a> What's next</h2>
<p>
It took a bit longer than expected, but I finally feel OK putting a
version on this.  It has all features I wanted from an MVP, and no known
fatal bugs.
</p><p>
The v0.2 branch in git will only receive bugfixes.  Further work on new
features will continue on the master branch.
</p><p>
For the next release, I hope to improve upon the layout module's
performance &amp; correctness, and to make the UI somewhat more user
friendly.  Stay tuned :)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elsewhere I've been asked about the task of replaying the bootstrap process for rust. I figured it would be fairly straightforward, if slow. But as we got into it, there were <em>just</em> enough tricky / non-obvious bits in the process that it's worth making some notes here for posterity.</p><p>UPDATE: someone has <a href="https://github.com/LegionMammal978/rust-from-ocaml">also scripted many of the subsequent snapshot builds</a> covering many years of rust's post-bootstrap development. Consider the rest of this post just a verbose primer for interpreting their work.</p><h3>context</h3><p>Rust started its life as a compiler written in ocaml, called <b>rustboot</b>. This compiler did <em>not</em> use LLVM, it just emitted 32-bit i386 machine code in 3 object file formats (Linux PE, macOS Mach-O, and Windows PE).</p><p>We then wrote a <em>second</em> compiler <em>in Rust</em> called <b>rustc</b> that <em>did</em> use LLVM as its backend (and which, yes, is the genesis of today's rustc) and ran rustboot on rustc to produce a so-called "stage0 rustc". Then stage0 rustc was fed the sources of rustc again, producing a stage1 rustc. Successfully executing this stage0 -&gt; stage1 step (rather than just crashing mid-compilation) is what we're going to call "bootstrapping". There's also a third step: running stage1 rustc on rustc's sources again to get a stage2 rustc and checking that it is bit-identical to the stage1 rustc. Successfully doing <em>that</em> we're going to call "fixpoint".</p><p>Shortly after we reached the fixpoint we <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/6997adf76342b7a6fe03c4bc370ce5fc5082a869">discarded rustboot</a>. We stored stage1 rustc binaries as snapshots on a shared download server and all subsequent rust builds were based on downloading and running that. Any time there was an incompatible language change made, we'd add support and re-snapshot the resulting stage1, gradually growing a long list of snapshots marking the progress of rust over time.</p><h3>time travel and bit rot</h3><p>Each snapshot can typically only compile rust code in the rust repository written between its birth and the next snapshot. This makes replaying the entire history awkward (<a href="https://github.com/LegionMammal978/rust-from-ocaml">see above</a>). We're not going to do that here. This post is just about replaying the initial bootstrap and fixpoint, which happened back in April 2011, 14 years ago.</p><p>Unfortunately all the tools involved -- from the host OS and system libraries involved to compilers and compiler-components -- were and are moving targets. Everything bitrots. Some examples discovered along the way:</p><ul><br><li>Modern clang and gcc won't compile the LLVM used back then (C++ has changed too much -- and I tried several CXXFLAGS=-std=c++NN variants!)<br></li><li>Modern gcc won't even compile the gcc used back then (apparently C as well!)<br></li><li>Modern ocaml won't compile rustboot (ditto)<br></li><li>14-year-old git won't even connect to modern github (ssh and ssl have changed too much)<br></li></ul><h3>debian</h3><p>We're in a certain amount of luck though:</p><ul><br><li>Debian has maintained both EOL'ed docker images and still-functioning fetchable package archives at the same URLs as 14 years ago. So we can time-travel using that. A VM image would also do, and if you have old install media you could presumably build one up again if you are patient.<br></li><li>It is easier to use i386 since that's all rustboot emitted. There's some indication in the Makefile of support for multilib-based builds from x86-64 (I honestly don't remember if my desktop was 64 bit at the time) but 32bit is much more straightforward.<br></li><li>So: <tt>docker pull --platform linux/386 debian/eol:squeeze</tt> gets you an environment that works.<br></li><li>You'll need to install rust's prerequisites also: g++, make, ocaml, ocaml-native-compilers, python.<br></li></ul><h3>rust</h3><p>The next problem is figuring out the code to build. Not totally trivial but not <em>too</em> hard. The best resource for tracking this period of time in rust's history is actually the rust-dev mailing list archive. There's <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/info.html">a copy online at mail-archive.com</a> (and Brian keeps <a href="https://github.com/brson/rust-dev-archives">a public backup of the mbox file</a> in case that goes away). Here's <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/msg00329.html">the announcement that we hit a fixpoint</a> in April 2011. You kinda have to just know that's what to look for. So that's the rust commit to use: 6daf440037cb10baab332fde2b471712a3a42c76. This commit still exists in the rust-lang/rust repo, no problem getting it (besides having to copy it into the container since the container can't contact github, haha).</p><h3>LLVM</h3><p>Unfortunately we only started pinning LLVM to specific versions, using submodules, <em>after</em> bootstrap, closer to the initial "0.1 release". So we have to guess at the LLVM version to use. To add some difficulty: LLVM at the time was developed on subversion, and we were developing rust against <a href="https://github.com/brson/llvm">a fork of a git mirror of their SVN</a>. Fishing around in that repo at least finds a version that builds -- <a href="https://github.com/brson/llvm/commit/45e1a53efd40a594fa8bb59aee75bb0984770d29">45e1a53efd40a594fa8bb59aee75bb0984770d29</a>, which is "the commit that exposed </p><tt>LLVMAddEarlyCSEPass</tt><p>", a symbol used in the rustc LLVM interface. I bootstrapped with that (brson/llvm) commit but subversion also numbers all commits, and they were preserved in the conversion to the modern LLVM repo, so you can see the same svn id 129087 as <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/e4e4e3758097d7967fa6edf4ff878ba430f84f6e">e4e4e3758097d7967fa6edf4ff878ba430f84f6e</a> over in the official LLVM git repo, in case brson/llvm goes away in the future.</p><p>Configuring LLVM for this build is also a little bit subtle. The best bet is to actually read the rust 0.1 configure script -- when it was managing the LLVM build itself -- and work out what it would have done. But I have done that and can now save you the effort: </p><tt>./configure --enable-targets=x86 --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --host=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --disable-docs --disable-jit --enable-bindings=none --disable-threads --disable-pthreads --enable-optimized</tt><p>So: configure and build that, stick the resulting bin dir in your path, and configure and make rust, and you're good to go!</p><pre>root@65b73ba6edcc:/src/rust# sha1sum stage*/rustc
639f3ab8351d839ede644b090dae90ec2245dfff  stage0/rustc
81e8f14fcf155e1946f4b7bf88cefc20dba32bb9  stage1/rustc
81e8f14fcf155e1946f4b7bf88cefc20dba32bb9  stage2/rustc
</pre><h3>Observations</h3><p>On my machine I get: 1m50s to build stage0, 3m40s to build stage1, 2m2s to build stage2. Also stage0/rustc is a 4.4mb binary whereas stage1/rustc and stage2/rustc are (identical) 13mb binaries.</p><p>While this is somewhat congruent with my recollections -- rustboot produced code faster, but its code ran slower -- the effect size is actually much less than I remember. I'd convinced myself retroactively that rustboot was produced <em>abysmally</em> worse code than rustc-with-LLVM. But out-of-the-gate LLVM only boosted performance by 2x (and cost of 3x the code size)! Of course I also have a faster machine now. At the time bootstrap cycles took about a half hour each (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/msg00331.html">according to this: 15 minutes for the 2nd stage</a>).</p><p>Of course you can still see this as a condemnation of the entire "super slow dynamic polymorphism" model of rust-at-the-time, either way. It may seem funny that this version of rustc bootstraps faster than today's rustc, but this "can barely bootstrap" version was a mere 25kloc. Today's rustc is 600kloc. It's really comparing apples to oranges.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The identity of the reviewers will remain anonymous, unless they choose otherwise — as happens now. But the exchanges between the referees and the authors will be accessible to all. Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‘black box’ of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made. This serves to increase transparency and (we hope) to build trust in the scientific process.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00056-z" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01880-9/d41586-025-01880-9_20176346.jpg"><p>Research evaluation needs to change with the times</p></a></article><p>As <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00493-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00493-w" data-track-category="body text link">we have written previously</a>, a published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors. These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study’s clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. For early-career researchers, there is great value in seeing inside a process that is key to their career development. Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it’s a chance to add to the ‘story’ of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported, even if it includes only the perspectives of authors and reviewers. The full story of a paper is, of course, more complex, involving many other contributors.</p><p>Many people think of science as something fixed and unchanging. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. Scientists constantly discuss their results, yet these debates are not contained in research papers and often remain unreported in wider science-communication efforts.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01162-1" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01880-9/d41586-025-01880-9_17620936.jpg"><p>Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers</p></a></article><p>The COVID-19 pandemic provided a brief interlude during which much of the world got to see how research works, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track-category="body text link">almost in real time</a>. It’s easy to forget that, right from the start, we were continuously learning something new about the nature and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On television screens, in newspapers and on social media worldwide, scientists were discussing among themselves and with public audiences the nature of the virus, how it infects people and how it spreads. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone’s knowledge <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track-category="body text link">as fresh evidence came to light</a>. And then, it went mostly back to business as usual.</p><p>We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted <i>Nature</i> papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn’t need to remain the case. <i>Nature</i> started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track-category="body text link">M. Baldwin <i>Notes Rec.</i> <b>69</b>, 337–352; 2015</a>). But the convention in most fields is still to keep the content of these peer-review exchanges confidential. That has meant that the wider research community, and the world, has had few opportunities to learn what is discussed.</p><p>Peer review improves papers. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.</p>

It’s a sentiment eagerly embraced by The Dull Men’s Club. Several million members in a number of connected Facebook groups strive to cause dullness in others on a daily basis. In this club, they wear their dullness with pride. The duller the better. This is where the nerds of the world unite.</p><p>“Posts that contain bitmoji-avatar-things are far too exciting, and will probably get deleted,” warn the rules of the Dull Men’s Club (Australian branch).</p><p>Maintaining standards of dullness is paramount. Alan Goodwin in the UK recently worried that seeing a lesser spotted woodpecker in his garden might be “a bit too exciting” for the group.

It’s sort of competitive dullness.” Dull people trying to out-dull each other.</p><figure id="24c6f5bf-c6f8-4735-b5fa-bb661518d899" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Andrew McKean in a chair in his room" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88635aeb47b38888d370c395767bd95cad548bb1/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.9891304347826" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>In his writing, McKean has elevated the dull institutional days into something poetic and poignant.</span> Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Are there people who are just too exciting for the club? “There isn’t actually a mandatory level of dullness,” he admits, although some of the members he has met “would bore the ears off you”.</p><p>It all started in New York in the early 1980s.

There is an annual calendar featuring people with peculiar hobbies, a book – Dull Men of Great Britain – merchandise and not one but two awards: Anorak of the Year in the UK and DMC Person of the Year for the rest of the world. There are also numerous copycat Dull Men’s Clubs, including one that has 1.7 million members. Click is “very surprised” that so many people identify as dull. The Australian club has 8,000 members.

Then there was the dismantling of electronic appliances. Or photographing post boxes, the ranking of every animated movie from one to 100 – 100 being “dull and pointless”. Members judge the speed of other people’s windscreen wipers against their own, or in the case of Australia’s Simon Molina, stuff as many used toilet rolls as possible inside another. “It’s extremely dull.” There was the late John Richards who founded the Apostrophe Protection Society and 94-year-old Lee Maxwell who has fully restored 1,400 antique washing machines – that no one will ever use.</p><p>Australian member Andrew McKean, 85, had dullness thrust upon him. He is, dare I say it, an interesting anomaly in the Dull Men’s Club, a shift in tone. Three years ago, he had a heart attack. He recovered but the hospital’s social workers deemed him unable to care for his wife, Patricia, and they moved to a nursing home in New South Wales. There is nothing droll or amusing about being stuck in a nursing home. But he has elevated the dull institutional days into something poetic and poignant by writing about them and posting “to you strangers” in The Dull Men’s Club.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-18" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="ac863569-1879-412c-926f-995ba36d5758" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Andrew sitting on a bench outside." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31ddfa406aef44cc73f5839a7d55be7391a7fe2/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.9891304347826" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew writes about his life in a care facility and the kangaroos that live on the property’s lawn.</span> Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>His life before moving into a home had been anything but dull.

  <div><p>Picture this, you’re a teenager in the middle of the ocean on a cruise ship. All is good, except you’re lacking your lifeblood: internet. You could pay $170 for seven days of throttled internet on a <em>single</em> device, and perhaps split it via a travel router or hotspot, but that still seems less than ideal.</p>
<p>I’ve been travelling Europe with family and am currently on REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises’ REDACTEDCRUISELINE cruise ship. For the past two days, the ship has mostly been in port, so I was able to use a cellular connection. This quickly became not feasible as we got further from land, where there was no coverage. At around the same time, I wanted to download the REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises app on my phone, and realized that it would give me a <em>one-time 15-minute</em> internet connection. I activated it, and quickly realized that it didn’t limit you to just the Play Store or App Store: all websites could be accessed. I soon realized that this “one-time” download was MAC-address dependent and thus, could be bypassed by switching MAC addresses. However, doing so logs you out of the REDACTEDSERVICE portal, which is required to get the 15-minutes of free internet.</p>
<p>This means that in order to get just 15 minutes of internet, the following is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change MAC address</li>
<li>Login to REDACTEDSERVICE with date-of-birth and room number, binding the MAC address to your identity</li>
<li>Send a request with your booking ID activating 15 minutes of free internet, intended to be used for downloading the REDACTEDCRUISELINE app
<ul>
<li>Not completely sure, but it did initially seem that to activate unrestricted access to the internet, you would need to send a simple HTTP to play.google.com, although I don’t think this is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process, on the surface, seems extremely arduous. But if this could be automated, it would suddenly become a much more viable proposition. After looking at the fetch requests the REDACTEDSERVICE portal was sending to log in and activate the free sessions, I realized that it shouldn’t be <em>too</em> hard to automate.</p>
<p>Conveniently, my family also brought a travel router running OpenWRT as we were planning on purchasing the throttled single-device plan (which is ~$170 for the entire cruise) and using the router as a hotspot so we could connect multiple devices to the internet. This router (a GL.iNet) allows you to change the MAC address via the admin portal, needing only a single POST request. This meant that if I could string together the API requests to change the MAC address (after getting a token from the router login endpoint), login to REDACTEDSERVICE, and request the free internet session, I would have free internet.</p>
<p>I first tried copying the requests as cURL commands via DevTools into Notepad and using a local LLM to vibe-code a simple bash file. Realizing this wasn’t going to work, I began work on a Python script instead. I converted the cURL commands to <code>requests</code> via Copilot (yes, I used LLMs to an extent when building this) and started chaining together the requests.</p>
<p>The only issues I faced that took some time to overcome were figuring out how to repeat the requests when needed and being resistant to unexpected HTTP errors. For the former, I initially tried repeating it on an interval (first through a <code>while True</code> loop and later via shell scripting in the container) but later realized it was much easier by checking if internet access expired by sending a request to example.com and checking if it fails. For the latter, I used <code>while True</code> loops to allow the requests to be retried and executed <code>break</code> when the requests succeeded. The only other issue, that still exists, is that occasionally, the connection will drop out while the session is refreshed, although this seems to happen less than every 15 minutes and only lasts for a minute or two.</p>
<p>After comparing speeds with another guy I met on the cruise (who also happens to be a high-school programmer), who had the highest-level REDACTEDSERVICE plan, there seems to be no additional throttling (7+ Mbps). Even better, after connecting my power bank’s integrated USB-C cable to the router, I’m able to move around the ship for hours. So far, I’ve been using the router for nearly ~7 hours and my 10,000 mAh power bank is still at 42% battery. In fact, I’m writing this very post while connected to the router.</p>
