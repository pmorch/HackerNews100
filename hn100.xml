        <article>
          <div>
              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>“Howdy Joseph,” the July email I got from Zdravko Krivokapić, who was the Prime Minister of Montenegro until last year, read.</p><p>Obviously, this wasn’t actually Krivokapić emailing me. Instead, it was a hacker who had gained access to what seemed to be Krivokapić’s personal Gmail account. The hackers proceeded to send me a mass of alleged documents from the government of Montenegro, including some related to the country’s Ministry of Finance. Alongside those, the hacker also sent photos of cash, flashy watches, and weapons, which appear to be from the hacker’s own collection and not the former Prime Minister’s.</p><p>Beyond wanting to flex their access to Krivokapić’s account, the hacker said they might use the compromised email to then target other services, using the former Prime Minster’s identity as a cover. It’s unclear how successful that attempt may have been, but the brazenness of emailing a journalist from an official’s email account did highlight something gaining popularity in the digital underground. Hackers are compromising the email accounts of government and law enforcement officials, selling them on the open market, and in some cases using that access to trick social media giants and other legitimate companies to hand over their customers' data. Desired targets include TikTok, Discord, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. The groups where these email accounts are often advertised include criminals who use personal information to target people for harassment, extortion, or physical violence.</p><p>The hacker’s initial email to me ended with “LOL.”</p><div><p>💡</p><p><strong>Do you know anything else about fraudulent use of EDRs? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></p></div><p>Cybercriminals sell access to these compromised government accounts across a variety of forums and groups chats, especially on the messaging app Telegram. One person who is a reputable seller of personal information on Telegram also claims to be selling such email accounts. One screenshot they shared on Telegram shows an inbox allegedly belonging to a Brazilian municipality; the seller said they are offering accounts for $400 each. In another post and accompanying screenshot, they claimed to have access to an FBI email account.</p><p>A second apparent seller wrote in one popular Telegram group they are “SELLING INDIAN GOV MAILS, $100 A PIECE, CAN ACCESS FB LAW PANEL/EDR IG/FB ACCS.” The post adds they are selling “other third world gov mails” for $50 each.</p><p>Other messages viewed by 404 Media advertise emails belonging to the governments of Thailand, the UK, Germany, Bangladesh, and Nepal.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Many of the adverts explicitly say that buyers can use these email accounts to then make Emergency Data Requests, or EDRs. EDRs are a common mechanism across social media or tech companies designed to provide user data to law enforcement in high stakes situations. This, for example, might include a child kidnapping, where authorities may need data quickly in an attempt to apprehend a suspect or locate a victim.</p><p>One Telegram group where government emails are being explicitly advertised as a way to gain access to sensitive user data <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-secret-weapon-hackers-can-use-to-dox-nearly-anyone-in-america-for-15-tlo-usinfosearch-transunion/">is focused on physical violence against targets</a>. Here, members can hire one another to perform shootings, stabbings, robberies, and more. </p><p>Companies each have their own way for handling EDRs, be that a locked-off web portal or a dedicated department to contact. But they typically require anyone requesting data to contact the company from an official government or law enforcement agency email address.</p><p>That’s why these compromised accounts are so valuable to criminals. They allow hackers to tap into a stream of data that is usually off limits, simply by pretending to be a law enforcement officer. In March last year <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/?ref=404media.co">cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs reported</a> on the rise of fraudulent EDR requests among cybercriminals and pointed to a specific case involving Discord. A day later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/apple-meta-gave-user-data-to-hackers-who-forged-legal-requests?ref=404media.co#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg reported</a> that Apple and Meta had given up user data in response to such demands.</p><p>In more recent Telegram messages, 404 Media has seen criminals specifically discuss the ability to make fraudulent EDRs with TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and GoDaddy. Others have shown interest in targeting Discord and Snapchat.</p><p>Meta told 404 Media it blocks known compromised accounts from making requests to its dedicated Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT).</p><p>TikTok confirmed to 404 Media it more commonly sees fraudulent requests from people impersonating law enforcement agencies in foreign countries. TikTok said it has successfully blocked some fraudulent requests, but declined to say whether any have managed to get through. TikTok added it has additional safeguards in place to vet EDRs and tools to protect those requests.</p><p>A Discord spokesperson told 404 Media in a statement that “Like any company, we are obligated to comply with law enforcement requests. To ensure the legitimacy of requests from law enforcement, we follow thorough guidelines to carefully evaluate them and ensure they come from a genuine source and that they are not overly broad or vague.”</p><p>Snapchat and GoDaddy did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Krivokapić, the former Prime Minister of Montenegro who a hacker appeared to have targeted, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>Update: this piece has been updated with a statement from Discord.</em></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Wat2Wasm Directly ( Recommended )</h2>
<p dir="auto">For syntax highlighting and up-to-date builds, you can <strong>optionally</strong> use the official <strong><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">WebAssembly Binary Toolkit</a></strong> which will provide you with a <code>wat2wasm</code> CLI tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">If it is found on your path as <code>wat2wasm</code>, it will be used instead of <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wabt" rel="nofollow">NPM WABT</a></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>While it is strictly optional, it can help with debugging.</em></p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recommended Editor</h2>
<p dir="auto">We recommend using <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VSCode</a></strong> with the <strong><a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/wati">WATI</a></strong> extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">This should provide syntax highlighting, intellisense, and other helpful features as you work through the exercises.</p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivations</h2>
<p dir="auto">I've found just diving in to be the best way to build experience with programming.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href="https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings">Ziglings</a></strong> have both had tremendous returns to my journeys with both languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">WebAssembly (and by extension WAT) has a more sparse educational landscape than most and I was hoping to fill some of the gaps by building a project with the same sort of structure.</p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pedagogical Philosophy</h2>
<p dir="auto">Outlined here are some thoughts on what makes a good teaching experience.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Typing Over Reading</h3>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to learn by doing. Comments on each file outline a task and some background. However, a lot about a language can be gleaned by its syntax alone. We should be adding <strong>as little</strong> explanation as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Occasional gaps in knowledge can be filled by consistent exposure to the syntax within different contexts. Certain things can therefore be learned without any mention.</p>
<p dir="auto">Introduction text is superfluous. Words add visual noise, so we should be careful with our count. Coding itself should supplement ambiguities in the text.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you find a text confusing or too verbose, <strong>please create a discussion post</strong>!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Create Struggle</h3>
<p dir="auto">Studies have shown that one cannot learn effectively without effort. This applies to practically every domain of knowledge. These projects should be educational, not easy.</p>
<p dir="auto">This does not mean we should make the education itself elusive. We should not make learning more difficult, but instead more intentional.</p>
<p dir="auto">When introducing a lot of new syntax, keep the problem scope small, but force the user to read a bit. If the syntax is not new, increase the problem scope. Maybe many variations of the same task.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>30. 08. 2023</p><p><strong>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.uochb.cz/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IOCB of the CAS</a>, the <a href="https://www.fzu.cz/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Physics of the CAS</a> and <a href="https://www.upol.cz/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palacký University Olomouc</a> have made a groundbreaking discovery – using an advanced method of scanning electron microscopy, they’ve managed to image not only the inside of a molecule, but also the structure of the electron shell of the atom. Their experiment was the first in the world to confirm the non-uniform distribution of electron density in aromatic molecules and the existence of the so-called π-hole. </strong><strong>The significance of the results of this research at the submolecular level is comparable to that of the discovery of cosmic black holes. </strong><strong>The study was published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40593-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications</a></em>.</strong></p><div>
			<p>The scientists focused their experiments on aromatic hydrocarbons. Anthracene, benzene, naphthalene, and other aromatic molecules have so-called pi electrons located above and below the carbon skeleton. “However, if we replace the peripheral hydrogens with more electronegative atoms or groups of atoms that pull electrons away, the originally negatively charged clouds turn into positively charged electron holes – π-holes [pi-holes],” explains Pavel Hobza from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS (IOCB Prague), who contributed significantly to the research in question.</p>
<p>The researcher likens the aromatic molecule to a volcano. When the volcano erupts, a huge crater appears underneath, and we can imagine this as the π-hole. Pavel Hobza explains more in the following video (English subtitles available):</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="/system/modules/cz.osw.opencms.types/elements/cookies/content_is_blocked.html" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Tgiob7vePk?si=F9Od0r45OJS6myIN" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The significance of the results of this research at the submolecular level is comparable to that of the discovery of cosmic black holes. In fact, black holes were theorized for decades as well before experiments proved and confirmed their existence. The same research team involved in the discovery of the π-hole had already achieved great success with their previous study, which was published in <em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk1479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science</a></em> in 2021, in which they proved the existence of so-called sigma-holes (σ-holes).</p>
<p>“The confirmation of the existence of the π-hole, as well as the σ-hole before it, fully demonstrates the quality of the theoretical predictions of quantum chemistry, which have accounted for both phenomena for decades. It shows that they can be relied upon even in the absence of available experiments,” Hobza explains.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Unique microscopes<br></strong>The above-mentioned discoveries have been made thanks to the unique scanning electron microscopy available at the Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute (CATRIN). “Thanks to our previous experience with the Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) technique, we have been able to refine our measurements and acquire very complete data sets that have helped us to deepen our understanding not only of how the charge is distributed in the molecules but also of what observables are obtained with the technique,” says Bruno de la Torre, head of the research group at CATRIN.</p>
<p>A better knowledge of the distribution of the electron charge will help scientists understand a number of chemical and biological processes. In practice, this will translate into the ability to build new supramolecules and subsequently develop advanced nanomaterials with improved properties.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone, I’m FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington, and I’m here to discuss security updates for IoT devices and how you can make a difference by filing comments with the FCC.</p><p>As you know, serious vulnerabilities are common in IoT, and it often takes too long for these to be patched on end-user devices—if the manufacturer even bothers to release an update, and if the device was even designed to receive them. Companies may cease supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.</p><p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.</p><p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].</p><p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.</p><p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.</p><p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them.</p><p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   
I’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well. Thank you!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/simington-calls-mandatory-security-updates" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/simington-calls-mandatory-secur...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices/simington-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a></p><p>[4] If your comments are purely in response to arguments made in other comments, you have an extra 15 days, until October 10, 2023.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p dir="auto">OpenTF is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. OpenTF can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key features of OpenTF are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Execution Plans</strong>: OpenTF has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTF will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTF manipulates infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Resource Graph</strong>: OpenTF builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, OpenTF builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Change Automation</strong>: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTF will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recipes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Puck is a React component that can be easily integrated into your existing application. We also provide helpful recipes for common use cases:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/recipes/next"><strong>next</strong></a>: Next.js app example</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">Puck can be configured to work with plugins. Plugins can extend the functionality to support novel functionality.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Official plugins</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-heading-analyzer"><code>heading-analyzer</code></a>: Analyze the heading outline of your page and be warned when you're not respecting WCAG 2 accessiblity standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing a plugin</h3>
<p dir="auto">The plugin API follows a React paradigm. Each plugin passed to the Puck editor can provide three functions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>renderRoot</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the root node of the preview content</li>
<li><code>renderRootFields</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the root fields</li>
<li><code>renderFields</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the fields for the currently selected component</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each render function receives the <code>children</code> prop, which you must render, and the <code>data</code> prop, which can be used to read the data model.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h4>
<p dir="auto">Here's a basic plugin that renders a "My plugin" heading in the root field area:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const myPlugin = {
  renderRootFields: (props) => (
    <div>
      {props.children}

      <h2>My plugin</h2>
    </div>
  ),
};"><pre><span>const</span> <span>myPlugin</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Android was <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html">initially announced</a> in 2007 by the Open Handset Alliance (headed by Google) their flagship project was billed as an "open platform", "providing developers a new level of openness", and giving them "complete access to handset capabilities and tools".</p>
<p>We've come a long way since then, steadily retreating from openness &amp; user control of devices, and shifting towards a far more locked-down vendor-controlled world.</p>
<p>The next step of Android's evolution is Android 14 (API v34, codename Upside-Down Cake) and it takes more steps down that path. In this new release, the restrictions around certificate authority (CA) certificates become significantly tighter, and appear to make it impossible to modify the set of trusted certificates at all, even on fully rooted devices.</p>
<p>If you're an Android developer, tester, reverse engineer, or anybody else interested in directly controlling who your device trusts, this is going to create some new challenges.</p>
<p>Before we get into the finer details, first I want to talk a little about the context around Android CA management and how we got here, but if you want to jump to the latest details you can go straight to the <a href="#enter-android-14">Enter Android 14</a> section below.</p>
<h2 id="open-software-open-device-open-ecosystem"><a href="#open-software-open-device-open-ecosystem" aria-label="open software open device open ecosystem permalink"></a>"Open Software, Open Device, Open Ecosystem"</h2>
<p>While the initial principles of Android were very much focused on open software, controllable by users and developers, over more recent years Android has increasingly limited the control of users, developers &amp; researchers over their own devices.</p>
<p>The key turning point in this process was Android 7 (Nougat, released in 2016) in which the certificate authorities (CAs) on the device that were previously fully modifiable by the owner of the phone were <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html">split in two</a>: one fixed list of CAs provided by the OS vendor and used by default by every app on your phone, and another set of user-modifiable CAs that users could control, but which was used only for apps that specifically opted in (i.e. almost none).</p>
<p>The set of CAs on a device is a small configuration setting with big consequences, as your device's trusted CAs are the organizations guaranteeing the security of your encrypted network traffic. A CA can issue TLS certificates (as used in HTTPS to secure all communication on the web) for any domain name they like, and anybody who trusts that CA will trust those certificates as evidence of a secure &amp; legitimate connection to that domain.</p>
<p>That also means though that if you create your own CA and trust it then you can intercept your own HTTPS or other TLS traffic, to see exactly what your phone is sending &amp; receiving, and potentially modify or block it. Being able to configure your device's CAs is key to this.</p>
<p>That is a lot of power. Making this difficult to modify accidentally for non-technical users and impossible to modify without user knowledge is certainly reasonable. At the same time however, being able to control this is critical for privacy &amp; security research, reverse engineering, app debugging &amp; testing, for assorted enterprise internal network configurations, for anybody who doesn't trust one of the standard CAs provided by their vendor, and many other cases.</p>
<p>With that one change in Android Nougat in 2016, each of those use cases became significantly more challenging. It became impossible for users on normal devices to control who was trusted to secure the communication of apps on their own devices, and a substantial hurdle was created that directly transferred power from users to vendors &amp; third-party app developers.</p>
<h2 id="rooting-around-the-nougat-problem"><a href="#rooting-around-the-nougat-problem" aria-label="rooting around the nougat problem permalink"></a>Rooting around the Nougat problem</h2>
<p>Although this is very inconvenient, fortunately it's long been possible to root Android devices, allowing full administrative access over the device, and making it possible to work around these kinds of restrictions. This isn't officially encouraged by Google, but it's been sufficient as a workaround to allow researchers, developers &amp; reverse engineers to take control of their own devices for these advanced use cases.</p>
<p>By doing so, it was possible to deal with Android Nougat's restrictions on rooted devices, manually adding the trusted certificate to the system store via the filesystem, injecting them into the <code>/system/etc/security/cacerts/</code> directory.</p>
<p>This is a bit harder than it sounds, because <code>/system</code> is generally read-only, even on rooted devices. There are two main ways to solve that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make <code>/system</code> directory writable (requires a little reconfiguration &amp; a device reboot) and then manually modify the real system certificates directory.</li>
<li>Mount a temporary read-write filesystem over the top of the read-only directory, copy the existing CA certs into there, and then add your own additions on top too.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case there are a few other steps required to ensure that the certificates have the appropriate naming, permissions, and SELinux labels to be accepted by the system (for more low-level details and discussion see <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/intercepting-android-https/">this post</a>), but it's relatively simple and HTTP Toolkit has long automated the temporary mount-based process (see <a href="https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server/blob/aa453e9df98491c549aa4b97b90618f1cf808e17/src/interceptors/android/adb-commands.ts#L256-L308">the certificate injection script here</a>). In practice, this means it's possible to provide one-click automated interception setup for any rooted Android device or emulator.</p>
<p>These approaches have been effective not only on custom rooted devices and specialized Android distributions, but even in most of Google's own official emulator images (everything except the full 'Google Play' edition images, which are locked down to match a normal OEM device) not to mention other emulators from Genymotion to Bluestacks.</p>
<p>Easy &amp; effective CA setup has powered myriad tools that let you see what apps on your phone are sending &amp; receiving: helping developers to debug their networking issues, keeping app developers honest about the data they share, and shining a light on security vulnerabilities in both apps &amp; their APIs.</p>
<p>These techniques are used by HTTP Toolkit's automatic setup, but also referenced in the setup guides for similar tools like <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/#3-insert-certificate-into-system-certificate-store">mitmproxy</a>, in <a href="https://awakened1712.github.io/hacking/hacking-install-ca-android/">endless</a> <a href="https://binary-manu.github.io/binary-is-better/android/add-certificates-to-android-ca-store">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.ropnop.com/configuring-burp-suite-with-android-nougat#install-burp-ca-as-a-system-level-trusted-ca">posts</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46569793/68051">StackOverflow answers</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tutorial-how-to-install-custom-ssl-certificates-root-etc-on-bluestacks-4-5.4513773/">forum threads</a>, widely used in tools including <a href="https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts">popular Magisk packages</a> and by organizations like the <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/ImportRootCert#CAcert_system_trusted_certificates_.28without_lockscreen.29">community-run CA cacert.org</a>.</p>
<p>These are widespread techniques that have worked for many years. Although the required root access has become more a little challenging more recently (due to first SafetyNet and later 'Play Integrity' using attestation to allow apps to block users who use rooted devices) this solution has generally been quite manageable, and a just-about-acceptable balance between "inconvenient enough to disuade users unaware of the implications" and "accessible to power users who know what they're doing".</p>
<h2 id="enter-android-14"><a href="#enter-android-14" aria-label="enter android 14 permalink"></a>Enter Android 14</h2>
<p>Right now, Android 14 is currently in its final stages of beta testing, slated for imminent release within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>One of its headline new security features is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-root-certificates-updatable/">remotely updatable CA certificates</a>, which extracts management of CA certificates from the core OS image entirely, and moves it into a separately updateable component, delivered &amp; updated via Google Play. This allows for faster CA updates for Google, allowing them to revoke trust of problematic or failing CAs on all Android 14+ devices with just a Google Play System Update, without waiting for each phone vendor to release an OTA update for the whole operating system.</p>
<p>Although I'm sure you can see what's coming, let me caveat first: at a very high level, the goal here is a Good Thing.</p>
<p>CAs trusted by default like this are in a powerful position, and there needs to be serious oversight &amp; consequences to ensure they stick to their responsibilities and continue to justify that trust. When they fail to do so, it's important that this power is taken away quickly, before it can be abused.</p>
<p>In the most notable recent case, in January 2023 TrustCor was untrusted as a CA by effectively everybody (<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/sustaining-digital-certificate-security_13.html">including Google</a>), after close ties to a malware-distributing organization and associated US defence/intelligence contractor were <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/02/mozilla_microsoft_trustcor/">discovered</a>.</p>
<p>In the other direction, the inability to widely distribute &amp; trust new CA certificates has caused issues for new CAs on the block such as Let's Encrypt, who have had to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html">repeatedly delay the rollout</a> of improvements to their signing chain, because old Android devices missing recent CA root certificates would not have trusted them, and would thereby have been locked out of significant parts of the web.</p>
<p>Mechanisms to improve the responsiveness of this system are valuable. In addition to just speeding up removals &amp; additions, this should also widen access to those updates, since even devices for which vendors no longer offer official OS updates can continue to receive system component updates like this via Google Play for significantly longer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, despite those sensible goals, the reality of the implementation has serious consequences: system CA certificates are no longer loaded from <code>/system</code>, and when using root access to either directly modify or mount over the new location on disk, all changes are ignored by all apps on the device. Uh oh.</p>
<h2 id="the-mechanics"><a href="#the-mechanics" aria-label="the mechanics permalink"></a>The mechanics</h2>
<p>The key change to enable this is <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/8b192b19f264a8829eac2cfaf0b73f6fc188d933">here</a>. Instead of reading from the venerable <code>/system/etc/security/cacerts</code> directory, this new approach reads certificates from <code>/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts</code>, when it exists.</p>
<p>That root <code>/apex</code> path is where Android Pony EXpress (APEX) containers are mounted. These APEX modules are independently updatable system components, delivered as signed &amp; immutable containers. In this case, the certificates form part of Android's <code>com.android.conscrypt</code> module - its core TLS/SSL library delivered as an independently updatable system module.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms behind APEX are challenging to fully understand, as many low-level details seem undocumented, and <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/apex/+/master/docs/howto.md">what documentation there is</a> includes links to key details only available within Google's internal sites. Tessting the resulting behaviour though, it seems that this is using some kinds of containerization primitives to expose the mounted content directly to individual processes, resulting in surprising behaviour when trying to modify these files elsewhere. As a result, delivering content through an APEX module makes it much harder (seemingly impossible) to manually modify, even with full administrative control.</p>
<p>It's easy to test this for yourself, using the latest Android 14 beta official emulators. Both the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and 'Play Services' images have always allowed root access (unlike the 'Google Play' images) and by creating an emulator using those you can easily open a root shell.</p>
<p>Follow either of the two existing techniques though, and the expected updates do nothing. Let's walk through a demo.</p>
<p>First, set up your device. You'll need the Android SDK installed, and you probably want <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>, since it makes this much easier, although you can use the CLI directly if you like.</p>
<p>First, create an emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the Android Studio UI, select any device model, and the API 34 'Google APIs' image for your architecture.</li>
<li>Or, using the Android SDK tools on the CLI, run <code>avdmanager create avd -n TestAVD -k 'system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64'</code> (your architecture may vary)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's try messing with temporary mounts and see what we can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your emulator, via the UI or <code>emulator -avd TestAVD</code></li>
<li>Open a root shell via <code>adb shell</code>, then <code>su</code></li>
<li>
<p>Try mounting an empty temporary filesystem over the various <code>cacerts</code> directories now present:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts_google
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /apex/com.android.conscrypt@340818022/cacerts
<span># N.b. that last @id may vary in future updates</span></code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the emulator, open Settings -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy -&gt; More -&gt; Encryption -&gt; Trusted Credentials</p>
<p>Under the 'System' tab, all the certificates you've just hidden from view on disk are there!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, where's this coming from?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can try searching the entire filesystem to find the source of this data. For example, the top certificate shown is from 'ACCV'. You can also find that in Android's sources <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/ca-certificates/+/refs/heads/main/files/3c9a4d3b.0">here</a>, and it's present both there and in unmodified Android CA cert folders as <code>3c9a4d3b.0</code>. We can search for this with:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>find</span> <span>.</span> -name 3c9a4d3b.0 <span>2</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span>/dev/null</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>It doesn't exist!</li>
</ul>
<p>But in fact, it does: remove your 4 mounts again (<code>umount &lt;path&gt;</code>), retry that <code>find</code> command, and you'll see that this is indeed present in the original <code>cacerts</code> directories.</p>
<p>Try the exact same steps with an Android 13 image, and you'll find that this modifies the certs just fine, and the Settings certificates list appears entirely empty, as expected:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/54003/android-empty-system-certs.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Let's try another route and see if we can rewrite the system image filesystem directly to modify this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stop your emulator, and restart it from the CLI with a writable system partition:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code>emulator -avd TestAVD -writable-system</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make everything writable:</p>
<div data-language="text">
      <pre><code>adb root
adb remount
adb shell avbctl disable-verification
adb reboot
adb root
adb remount</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can delete all the normal certificates now (fair warning: this may create problems when using this emulator in future!) with:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>rm</span> -rf /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
<span>rm</span> -rf /system/etc/security/cacerts_google/*</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>You'll find that you can't delete the certs from <code>/apex</code> though! Despite the remount, it's read-only, and <code>mount -o remount,rw ...</code> commands to do so manually will all fail.</li>
<li>The closest you can do, so far as I can tell, is to unmount the certificates entirely with <code>umount &lt;path&gt;</code> so that they don't appear in the output of <code>mount</code> at all.</li>
<li>Doesn't matter though: no matter how aggressive you get, seemingly no matter how much of the emulator's relevant internals you delete, AFAICT there's nothing you can do to stop these certs all happily loading up in the 'Trusted' list in the Settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>As in with the other method, those same steps will work just fine on every other version of Android, up until now.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't just a detail about the Settings app, where these are cached or stored elsewhere. The certificates as shown here are reloaded each time, and they're representative of every app's view of the certificate store.</p>
<p>No matter what you modify on the filesystem, every app will continue to see Google's list of CA certificates regardless. I've been playing with this for a while, and as far as I can tell there's no working method to modify the certs anybody sees.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-on-here"><a href="#what-is-going-on-here" aria-label="what is going on here permalink"></a>What is going on here?</h2>
<p>It's hard to tell precisely, so I'm guessing &amp; inferring here (but if anybody does have more information, I'd love to hear it! Get in touch <a href="https://toot.cafe/@pimterry">on Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pimterry">on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/contact/">directly</a>).</p>
<p>I think the most likely case is that as part of the wider modularization of Android, these system files and components are now exposed to apps through an entirely different mechanism. It looks clear from the Android internals that they're still being <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/8b192b19f264a8829eac2cfaf0b73f6fc188d933/core/java/android/security/net/config/DirectoryCertificateSource.java#64">read from disk</a> and the code to do so hasn't changed in many years, so this implies not everybody is seeing the same filesystem. This is similar to how Docker and friends use chroot, overlay filesystems and mounts to run containers with an isolated view of system files and other devices.</p>
<p>Clearly, this has some serious consequences.</p>
<p>As touched on above: if you're configuring your own system CA certificates on Android right now for debugging, reverse engineering, testing or research, that option is going away in Android 14, and presumably all future versions too.</p>
<p>For now anybody interested in these use cases will just have to avoid updating, or use custom OS releases that don't use the APEX module to manage their CA certs. As time goes by though, this will likely become increasingly impractical, since it means either diverging strongly from Android mainline on a key internal component or running outdated software indefinitely.</p>
<p>Concerningly though, this also implies that APEX system modules are going to be a wider problem. If, as it appears, content within APEX modules is unmodifiable to users even with root access to the device, then every future system component that's moved into the remit of APEX is another part of Android that becomes completely removed from user control.</p>
<p>More investigation is required and it's hard to know the full implications of that now, but for the many forks of Android like GrapheneOS &amp; LineageOS, and for advanced device configuration tools like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk#readme">Magisk</a> and its many modules, it probably spells trouble.</p>
<p>Personally, for now I'm investigating some other promising alternative solutions to allow interception of your own network traffic on Android, and I'll share details here as soon as I have something working, so watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to debug your own HTTPS traffic, you'll need to stick to Android 13.</p>
<p><strong>Want to inspect, debug &amp; mock Android traffic on your Android 13 device anyway? <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/android/">Try out HTTP Toolkit</a> - hands-free HTTP(S) interception for mobile, web browsers, backend services, Docker, and more.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

So the message [of the Australian delegation] is going to be: this is very dangerous for journalists around the world and a race to the bottom that’s going on.”</p><p>China’s foreign ministry spokesperson has discussed the issue at the daily press conference in Beijing at least five times since early last year, including to say Assange should not “stand trial for telling people the truth”.</p><p>China has also argued the extradition bid “is a mirror” that “reflects the hypocrisy of the US and the UK on ‘press freedom’”.</p><ul>

            <pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:04:51 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs">https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37390184">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">This is a currently maintained fork of SSHFS</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS (original repo: <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs">https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs</a>) has been declared to be unmaintained and it breaks our heart. So me and some friends have decided to fork it and give it some love.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's a rust fork in progress by Greg Shuflin (<a href="https://github.com/neunenak/sshfs/tree/rust">https://github.com/neunenak/sshfs/tree/rust</a>). Rust is a modern and memory safe programming language, and in the long term, it's not a bad decision to port it to rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are some downsides to Rust, such as it being still a young language, unstable API changes, it not having a standard specification yet, and long and compute-intensive compilation process etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">So from a maintenance perspective, we are just here to fix issues, merge PRs, and give this project some love until the rust fork is ready (maybe even backport changes/features from there for a period of time).</p>
<p dir="auto">Everyone is welcome to create issues or PRs, please do contribute!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SSHFS</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH
servers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is
very simple to use - there's nothing to do on the server-side.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in
production use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,
at present SSHFS does not have any active, regular contributors, and
there are a number of known issues (see the <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/issues">bugtracker</a>).  The current
maintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular
releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development
beyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please
understand that unless you are including a pull request or are
reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once sshfs is installed (see next section) running it is very simple:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint"><pre><code>sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is recommended to run SSHFS as regular user (not as root).  For
this to work the mountpoint must be owned by the user.  If username is
omitted SSHFS will use the local username. If the directory is
omitted, SSHFS will mount the (remote) home directory.  If you need to
enter a password sshfs will ask for it (actually it just runs ssh
which asks for the password if needed).</p>
<p dir="auto">Also many ssh options can be specified (see the manual pages for
<em>sftp(1)</em> and <em>ssh_config(5)</em>), including the remote port number
(<code>-oport=PORT</code>)</p>
<p dir="auto">To unmount the filesystem:</p>

<p dir="auto">On BSD and macOS, to unmount the filesystem:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, download the latest SSHFS release from
<a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases">https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases</a>. You also need <a href="http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">libfuse</a> 3.1.0 or newer (or a
similar library that provides a libfuse3 compatible interface for your operating
system). Finally, you need the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/" rel="nofollow">Glib</a> library with development headers (which should be
available from your operating system's package manager).</p>
<p dir="auto">To build and install, we recommend to use <a href="http://mesonbuild.com/" rel="nofollow">Meson</a> (version 0.38 or
newer) and <a href="https://ninja-build.org/" rel="nofollow">Ninja</a>.  After extracting the sshfs tarball, create a
(temporary) build directory and run Meson:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mkdir build; cd build
$ meson .."><pre><code>$ mkdir build; cd build
$ meson ..
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Normally, the default build options will work fine. If you
nevertheless want to adjust them, you can do so with the <em>mesonconf</em>
command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mesonconf                  # list options
$ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option"><pre><code>$ mesonconf                  # list options
$ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To build, test and install SSHFS, you then use Ninja (running the
tests requires the <a href="http://www.pytest.org/" rel="nofollow">py.test</a> Python module):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ninja
$ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended
$ sudo ninja install"><pre><code>$ ninja
$ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended
$ sudo ninja install
</code></pre></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>F</span></span>ather’s Day is dangerous for Robert Nurden. Childless not through choice but, as he puts it, “complacency, bad luck, bad judgment”, he tries to stay indoors and ignore the family celebrations outside.</p><p>But one year, he went for a walk. “I met family after family. There were children everywhere,” he remembered. “It was terrible. Just so painful. So many ambushes and triggers for my anguish.”</p><p>There is very little research into men who have not had children, although that is beginning to change. Research by <a href="https://www.robinhadley.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Dr Robin Hadley</a> has found that 25% of men over 42 do not have children – 5% more than women of the same age group.</p><p>Half of the men who are not fathers but wanted to be describe a huge grief and isolation from society. Almost 40% have experienced depression and a quarter feel a deep anger.</p><p>Now 72, Nurden had a sheltered upbringing. Reaching adulthood, there was a lot he wanted to experience. “Having children was a very low priority. I was complacent: I just assumed it would happen,” he said.</p><p>It was not until he was in his early 40s that Nurden started to get broody. But by that point, he discovered, women of a similar age had already had children, if they were able or wanted to.</p><p>“I went into this 15-year period of not going into relationships or ending relationships quickly because I knew that person wasn’t going to want or be able to have a child with me – or that the relationship wasn’t going to be strong enough to last if we did have a child,” said Nurden.</p><p>He said high-profile older fathers breed complacency in ordinary men. “If I’m honest, even when I was in my 50s I believed that it might happen for me. But in real life, the Mick Jagger and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/18/jon-snow-channel-4-late-fatherhood" data-link-name="in body link">Jon Snow-age fathers</a> are actually very rare – and in any case, it’s medically not wise, as regards sperm quality.”</p><p>What compounded Nurden’s pain was that there was no public or private discussion about how men feel when circumstance leaves them unable to become fathers.</p><p>“There’s lots of publicity, quite rightly, about women and childlessness but men are very mute about this. Married men don’t want to hear it either: I’ve had men with children react with anger, as though they feel threatened, when I’ve tried to talk about my pain,” he said.</p><p>“I was mute too until recently, because as I aged, I found the regret grew into a great pain,” he added. “Unlike many other forms of grief, this compounds itself as it gets older: I wasn’t a father but now I’m not a grandfather. When I’m even older, I might find myself entirely alone.”</p><p>Nurden has published a book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195698230-i-always-wanted-to-be-a-dad" data-link-name="in body link">I Always Wanted to be a Dad: Men Without Children</a>, about his story and that of some other men. “It turns out that there is a lot of pain, regret and sadness out there,” he said.</p><p>Hadley, the researcher, is childless because although his wife had wanted children, by the time she and Hadley met, her age meant the risk of having one was too great. “I chose love but that doesn’t make the pain of not having children any less,” he said. “When a close colleague had his first child, I was so jealous that I couldn’t be in the same room as him.”</p><p>Being a father is a marker of status in many countries, said Hadley, but not in the west. “While there has recently been a lot more public discussion about how to be a good father, we still don’t have any narrative or celebration about how important it is for men to become a father in the first place,” he said.</p><p>Paul Goulden, the chair of <a href="https://www.awwoc.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Ageing Without Children,</a> said that, along with the lack of public dialogue about becoming a father, he was “not convinced that there’s this Game of Thrones genetic push felt by men to have children”.</p><p>Instead, he said: “There’s this mistaken belief that men are fertile across their lifespan, so there’s no imperative to get on with it.”</p><p>That complacency persists because men without children historically have not spoken about their grief. But, Goulden said: “I hope Robert’s book will trigger a change in public dialogue around this issue. I think there’s an overwhelming sense of loneliness and fear out there about who is going to be there for these men, when they’re old and all alone.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>If you ever get a chance to look through the classic Amiga OS source-code still floating around some murky corners of the internet, it is a thing of beauty and astonishing capabilities. It’s an inspirational piece of computing history with unmatched capabilities for the time. Remember, this was all originally on a computer released in the 1980s with 512Kb memory, a 7Mhz 68000 16-bit CPU, and a single floppy drive with 880Kb storage. On these limited specs, AmigaOS provided a pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system, a full set of GUI primatives and built-in “Workbench” interface, expansion card auto-configuration and a fully-featured filesystem with some unique and powerful capabilities. Although to be fair, the AmigaDOS parts do literally come from a different time (and possibly planet) - but more on that later.</p>

<p>Oh and of course, there was that amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set">chipset</a> that meant even that humble base can do things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wpXOsEm7M0" target="_blank">this</a> - while PCs of the time were basically  office boxes that occasionally bleeped and home computers still loaded games from cassette tape. There’s understandably a lot of on-line interest in those parts of the Amiga as they’re the most impressive in an obvious “wow!” way. But while that was what drew me to the Amiga when I was a kid (and the demo/cracking/bbs scene heavily influenced me) I’ve always been more of a systems geek at heart.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved building tools and platforms, and have long been fascinated with the world of operating systems. Apart from reading through the source code (where that’s legally available, of course…) I think there’s no better way to explore and understand a system - and the mindset that produced it - than to develop for it.</p>

<p>What follows is a brain-dump of what I’ve learned about developing for the AmigaOS, both on classic 68k-powered hardware to modern PowerPC systems like the <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2018/10/10/new-amiga-x5000/">X5000</a>. I’ll cover development environments, modern workflows like CI builds on containerised infrastructure, distribution of packages and even a look back in time before <code>C</code> existed, thanks to AmigaDOS’s odd heritage.</p>

There’s plenty of guides and videos on setting up an old-school game or demo-coding environment, but all of what follows is in the context of developing a systems tool in <code>C</code> as that’s the language of AmigaOS. I started a real-life <a href="https://www.markround.com/projects/#setcmd">project</a> partly to solve a small problem I had (switching between different versions of commands/tools at the Amiga CLI) but mainly to explore and dig deeper into the OS that influenced me so much as a teenager. <code>SetCmd</code> was the result, and is a very simple AmigaOS 4 PowerPC <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/setcmd">package</a>. I’m working (very slowly) on porting it to run on classic AmigaOS and variants but it has to be said this is my first time writing C in any meaningful capacity beyond wrestling with pointers at University. The source code is on <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd">GitHub</a> if you want to take a look but bear in mind despite having owned Amigas since they were released, I’m a total newbie at most of this! I wrote it to have fun, explore the AmigaOS, set up build environments and figure out how to package it up for re-distribution. I have <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/categories/#amiga">written</a> a bit about my development setup in the past, but things have changed a fair bit since then - so without further ado, here’s my development environment and thoughts in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="sdk-updates">SDK Updates</h2>
<p>Whilst things do move at a glacial pace in the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS_4">AmigaOS 4/PPC</a>, there have been a few big updates. A-EON’s <a href="http://wiki.amiga.org/index.php?title=Enhancer_Software" target="_blank">Enhancer Software</a> has had several releases, each adding new applications and developer APIs. As well as shipping their own versions of key Amiga OS applications and utilities, they also now are installing several core AmigaDOS command replacements. I tend to skip the installation of these as I’ve encountered a few edge cases where they don’t <em>quite</em> behave like the original OS 4 commands, but from recent discussions online it appears as if they are preparing for their own “clean-room” re-implementation and modernisation of Amiga OS 4. Presumably in order to free themselves from the eternal legal shenanigans with Hyperion et al. I’m not going to get into that raging dumpster fire here, but it’ll be interesting to see what comes of this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/sdk-03.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-200-579a9e856.webp 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-300.0-579a9e856.webp 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-400-579a9e856.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-200-a5839a0e7.png 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-300.0-a5839a0e7.png 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-400-a5839a0e7.png 2.0x" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/sdk-03-250-a5839a0e7.png"></picture></a> 
On the Hyperion side, they released a big <a href="https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/component/content/article/300-new-amigaos-41-sdk-5334-available-now" target="_blank">SDK Update</a> for OS 4 including updated GCC toolchains, cross-compilers, profilers and loads of updated SDKs. Bearing in mind the ancient GCC 4.x toolchain that had been in place for years it was great to have a more modern environment. On the classic Amiga front, Hyperion have also been pushing ahead with their updated AmigaOS 3.x OS for 68k-powered Amigas. Now on version 3.2.2.1 (I’ve got my boxed set of CD and <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2019/12/30/back-to-the-floppy/">floppy disks</a>) there have also been several NDK (“Native Developer Kit”) <a href="https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/component/content/article/297-native-developer-kit-for-amigaos-32-ndk-32-release-3-available-for-immediate-download" target="_blank">Updates</a> providing updated APIs and tools. AmiKit also released a great “all-in-one” environment called <a href="https://www.amikit.amiga.sk/devpack">DevPack</a> which includes a huge range of languages (C, Assembly, Amos, Lua, Basic…) and NDKs all configured and ready to go. As a quick and easy way of setting up a development environment on classic Amigas, it’s hard to beat and saves a lot of manual downloading, configuring and glue-ing everything together.</p>

<h2 id="editors">Editors</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2019/08/06/my-os4-development-environment/">last update</a> 3 years ago, I’d more or-less settled on using a GUI VIM derivative. While I’m still a die-hard VIM user at $DAYJOB, I really appreciate the modern comforts of e.g. VSCode. Thanks to the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/walkero-gr/">George Sokianos</a>, there is now a OS 4 <a href="http://os4depot.net/?function=showfile&amp;file=utility/text/edit/litexl.lha">package</a> of the awesome <a href="https://lite-xl.com/en/">Lite-XL</a> editor along with a comprehensive set of plugins. Here’s what a hacking session on my X5000 looks like:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/setcmd.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-200-5dadd9ab5.webp 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-400-5dadd9ab5.webp 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-800-5dadd9ab5.webp 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-1600-5dadd9ab5.webp 1600w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-200-9cc0c6e47.png 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-400-9cc0c6e47.png 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-800-9cc0c6e47.png 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-1600-9cc0c6e47.png 1600w" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/setcmd-800-9cc0c6e47.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>In that session you can see alongside LiteXL two terminal windows: I’m compiling <em>and</em> running the PowerPC and classic 68k versions of <code>setcmd</code> thanks to the cross-compilers and native “Petunia” JIT 68k emulation built into OS 4. More on that later, but while we’re talking about classic Amigas…</p>

<h2 id="native-hardware">Native hardware</h2>
<p>Emulation is fine, but nothing beats running on the actual hardware! In the <a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/amigaland.jpg">lead image</a> to this article you can see my treasured <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2019/03/18/two-worlds-meet/">Amiga 1200</a> (with older 8-bit friend in the background running my <a href="https://tnfs.markround.com/">TNFS site</a>) expanded with an <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2020/07/21/apollo-vampire-amiga-1200-review/">Apollo Vampire</a> accelerator. An Ethernet or Wifi adapter is more or less essential though when it comes to transferring data around and fortunately the Vampire card is capable of network connectivity, high-resolution display and other niceities but can easily be switched back to a more “stock” environment. I do still occasionally use my licensed copy of <a href="https://www.softwareandcircuits.com/division/amiga/products/cubic/screenshots.html">CubicIDE</a> but due to the age of this architecture, I tend to keep my tools light and have settled on the simple <a href="http://aminet.net/package/text/edit/JanoEditor">Jano</a> editor or sometimes <a href="http://www.cygnused.de/index-en.php">CygnusEd</a> for old time’s sake.</p>

<p>My build toolchain is provided by Devpack and it’s included <a href="http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc/">VBCC</a> compiler. I use the <code>vbcc_target_m68k-amigaos</code> target with this <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/src.68k/makefile">makefile</a> to build:</p>

<h2 id="modern-development">Modern development</h2>
<p>I’m (sadly) not always in front of my Amigas, but these days a modern laptop and cloud-native tools offer a lot of flexibility particularly with the advanced state of emulation. I use VSCode as my editor, and a containerised cross-compiler toolchain built by - again! - George Sokianos to target both 68k and PPC platforms. I can build my project on any system capable of running OCI containers, e.g.</p>

<div><pre><code>docker run <span>\</span>
  <span>--user</span> <span>$UID</span>:<span>$GID</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>-v</span> ./:/opt/code <span>\</span>
  walkero/docker4amigavbcc:latest-m68k-amd64 <span>\</span>
  make <span>-f</span> makefile.docker
</code></pre></div>

<p>Testing and running the code is made easy by the very advanced state of emulators. On Windows, <a href="https://www.winuae.net/">WinUAE</a> is the gold standard and can emulate everything from an original 1985-vintage A1000 up to modern systems with PowerPC accelerators, graphics cards and other devices. I have it multi-booting into clean Hyperion and Commodore/classic OS environments, with my source code directory shared as a virtual hard-drive:</p>

<p>I can compile in seconds with Docker, and then straight away test the resulting binary in my emulated Amiga. Source-code is kept up to date between systems using Git; on the Amiga X5000 I use the port of SimpleGit, which is now bundled with the latest Hyperion SDK under <code>SDK:c/sgit</code>. I haven’t yet found a suitable Git solution for the classic Amigas, so on those I use a makeshift AmigaDOS shell script that uses <a href="http://www.onyxsoft.se/backup.html">Backup</a> to copy files over to a network mount in an <code>rsync</code> -like fashion.</p>

<p>I also keep meaning to test running AmigaOS 4.1 under <a href="https://www.amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2023-03-00113-EN.html">QEMU</a> as support for this has greatly improved and looks a lot simpler than the currently convoluted process of getting “classic OS 4” running on an emulated 68k Amiga with PPC accelerator configured. But for now, the WinUAE approach is working pretty well.</p>

<p>Another advantage of having a containerised build-chain is that combined with Git and <a href="https://drone.io/">Drone</a> running on my personal Kubernetes clusters, I can build and package my code with a simple <code>git push</code> wherever I am:</p>

<h2 id="amigados-is-weird">AmigaDOS is weird</h2>
<p>Although AmigaOS is frequently lauded for it’s sophistication and elegance, there is a notable “oddness” about the AmigaDOS components which handle storage I/O, devices and filesystems. The original developers of the Amiga had an ambitious DOS system planned, but in the end Commodore had to purchase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPOS">Tripos</a> operating system and port parts of it to the Amiga due to deadline challenges. This mismatch is all the more pronounced as Tripos was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL">BCPL</a> - which in turn, influenced the <code>B</code> programming language which begat the <code>C</code> we all know and… well, tolerate, in my case. So it really is looking back into computing history and remnants of this still remain even in the “modern” AmigaOS 4.x and other derivatives.</p>

<p>Once you start diving into AmigaDOS code, you end up face-to-face with this legacy and need to convert back and forth with BCPL and C data-types. For example, BCPL strings are not <code>NULL</code>-terminated, instead they have a length in the first byte and then the characters follow. And pointers are similarly alien. This is why my code has stuff like this littered through it:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>// Convert the new node to a BPTR</span>
    <span>new_node_bptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>MKBADDR</span><span>(</span><span>new_node</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Set the new path</span>
    <span>cli</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cli_CommandDir</span> <span>=</span> <span>new_node_bptr</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As the NDK include file <code>dos.h</code> explains: “All BCPL data must be long word aligned.  BCPL pointers are the long word address (i.e byte address divided by 4 (»2))”. It also includes helper functions like <code>MKBADDR</code> to help with the conversion as most DOS system calls use BCPL pointers in arguments:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>/* Convert BPTR to typical C pointer */</span>
<span>#define BADDR(x)	((APTR)((ULONG)(x) &lt;&lt; 2))
</span><span>/* Convert address into a BPTR */</span>
<span>#define MKBADDR(x)	(((LONG)(x)) &gt;&gt; 2)
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>All in all, a fascinating look back into an obscure branch of computing history, but it hasn’t furthered my appreciation of pointers any!</p>

<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/dist.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-200-87c52ef2f.webp 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-400-87c52ef2f.webp 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-800-87c52ef2f.webp 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-1308-87c52ef2f.webp 1308w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-200-b29548dae.png 200w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-400-b29548dae.png 400w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-800-b29548dae.png 800w, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-1308-b29548dae.png 1308w" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/dist-800-b29548dae.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>If you want to distribute your project to a wider audience, there’s a few Amiga-specific things you can do that makes life much easier for people running AmigaOS. These all make use of some pretty cool bits of Amiga technology and have been widely adopted by native software since their introduction in the early 1990s.</p>

<h3 id="archive">Archive</h3>
<p>Just use LHA format archives. It’s the standard compression tool on Amigas and even though there are modern (and technically better) alternatives, <code>.lha</code> files are as ubiquitous as e.g. <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> packages on other systems and can also be handled by low-spec machines. There are ports of CLI tools and GUIs available on all platforms to handle these archives and while the syntax can be a little different, it’s quite easy to use. See my <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/packaging/make_lha">AmigaDOS script</a> that builds the SetCmd release artifact for a practical example.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Along with a basic README.txt, it’s a great practice to distribute more detailed documentation in <a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/AmigaGuide_101">AmigaGuide</a> format. Another area the Amiga was way ahead of it’s time - AmigaGuide is a hyper-text format commonly used for application manuals although people have even used it to publish <a href="http://www.whatiff.info/">disk magazines</a>! Introduced in 1992, the bundled tools on any AmigaOS (or clone/derivative) can read and use AmigaGuide as standard so you can include formatting, links and other content in your documentation. You can see the AmigaGuide docs I include with SetCmd in the screenshot above, or view the <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/SetCmd.guide">source</a> to see what the syntax looks like.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to write and is much like any other markdown or formatting code. You can set basic parameters:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>@Width 72
@wordwrap
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Documents have “Nodes” which can be linked to, e.g.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>@Node About "About SetCMD" 
@{"About" Link About}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>And formatting is much like HTML with opening and closing tags:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">@{b}@{u} Bold and Underlined! @{uu}@{ub}</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="installer">Installer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-200-7c58ead12.webp 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-300.0-7c58ead12.webp 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-400-7c58ead12.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-200-ca320d46f.png 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-300.0-ca320d46f.png 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-400-ca320d46f.png 2.0x" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/setcmd/setcmd-install-dev02-250-ca320d46f.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>A fantastic addition to AmigaOS, the system installer utility reads a developer-provided script which handles copying files, comparing versions, modifying system scripts and so on, in a standardized fashion. You can pass useful information and configuration which controls the Installer tool through standard Amiga tooltypes, and it uses a sort of LISP-ey syntax which again runs on all Amigas and derivatives. The syntax does some getting used to, but the best source of documentation is the AmigaGuide documentation found in the <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/misc/Installer-43_3">Installer dev package</a>. As an example, here’s an excerpt of the block of code which copies the <code>setcmd</code> program file over to a previously created directory:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>copyfiles</span>
  <span>(</span><span>source</span> <span>"setcmd"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>dest</span> <span>#</span><span>dname</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>prompt</span> <span>(</span><span>"Copy SetCmd program file?"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>confirm</span> <span>"expert"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>all</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>help</span> <span>@copyfiles-help</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>And for running commands, you can use the <code>run</code> command, along with <code>cat</code> (short for “concatenate”) to build up the command string :</p>

<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>run</span> <span>(</span><span>cat</span> <span>"C:MakeLink FROM "</span> <span>#</span><span>dname</span> <span>"/cmds/setcmd/release TO SETCMD:setcmd SOFT"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I found the best approach was to examine other Installer scripts to get a feel for common practices and idioms. Here’s my simplistic <a href="https://github.com/markround/setcmd/blob/68k/Install_SetCmd">Install_SetCmd</a> script, and if you want to see something more complex, there’s always the AmigaOS installation scripts, or the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtamigaosnative/files/release/">Qt installer</a> for OS 4 which taught me a lot.</p>

<h3 id="file-sites">File Sites</h3>
<p>The Amiga doesn’t have a universal package manager, so files are usually downloaded manually and installed from the <code>.lha</code> archives. The go-to place for Amiga software for all systems is <a href="https://aminet.net/">AmiNet</a>. It’s the biggest repository of Amiga packages on the internet (and, at one point in the mid-90s was actually the largest software repository of any platform) and now also supports hosting packages for Amiga OS 4, MorphOS and AROS alongside classic 68k fare. There are also smaller, platform-focused sites for each platform e.g. <a href="http://os4depot.net/">os4depot.net</a> for OS 4, <a href="https://www.morphos-storage.net/">morphos-storage.net</a> for MorphOS and so on.</p>

<p>Getting your package uploaded and accepted into the repository is broadly the same for all these: You FTP your package up according to the naming standards, and supply a <code>Readme</code> file which provides the <a href="http://wiki.aminet.net/index.php/The_Readme_file">required metadata</a> like this excerpt in AmiNet format:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>There are some Amiga-native GUI tools that assist with creating these files, but the specs e.g. for <a href="http://os4depot.net/?function=ftpinfo">os4depot.net</a> are pretty straight forward. And here’s the end result - My package available on <a href="http://os4depot.net/?function=showfile&amp;file=utility/shell/setcmd.lha">os4depot.net</a> and <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/setcmd">aminet</a>.</p>

When trying to learn or re-learn everything from C to AmigaDOS scripting, I found a few great resources. However, as with most things in Amiga-land, there’s an extraordinarily high “bus factor” for many websites and my biggest recommendation is to use native tools or save local copies of anything you find! With that said, here’s my essential Amiga bookmarks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Autodocs references. There’s lots of websites where you can browse the auto-generated docs from the SDK header files, like <a href="http://amigadev.elowar.com/">this</a> with clickable links to jump between things. If I’m actually at an Amiga though, there are some useful native tools I prefer that can index and search through the local headers. The screenshot above shows the standard “AutoDoc Reader” freeware tool viewing the equivalent of a <code>man</code> page for the AmigaDOS library, alongside the AmigaGuide Installer language reference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.pjhutchison.org/tutorial/amiga_c.html">http://www.pjhutchison.org/tutorial/amiga_c.html</a> - amazing site. This is what inspired me to pick up a compiler again and get to work. There’s a great refresher on the C language itself, and then it dives into Amiga-specific coding with everything from low-level library access, sound and GUI programming and more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/DeveloperDoc:Main">Amiga OS Dev wiki</a> is a goldmine, although it can take a little searching to find what you’re after. It’s mostly OS 4-focused but because all Amiga systems share a common ancestor it’s usually pretty applicable to all platforms. Specific articles that I found useful include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Migration_Guide">OS 4 Migration Guide</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Programming_in_the_Amiga_Environment">Programming in the Amiga Environment</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Fundamental_Types">Fundamental Types</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And lastly, there are great threads I constantly found on <a href="https://www.amigans.net/">amigans.net</a> which is where a lot of OS 4/”Next Gen” technical discussion happens. For classic systems, I found the Coders discussions on the <a href="https://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=116">English Amiga Board</a> an invaluable resource.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-way-forward-is-back-">The way forward is back ?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.markround.com/assets/images/amiga/dev/morphos.png"><picture><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-200-e475fa26b.webp 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-300.0-e475fa26b.webp 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-400-e475fa26b.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-200-794486915.png 1.0x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-300.0-794486915.png 1.5x, https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-400-794486915.png 2.0x" type="image/png"><img src="https://www.markround.com/assets/generated/amiga/dev/morphos-250-794486915.png"></picture></a></p>

<p>When I started this project, it was really a way to get acquainted with my new X5000. Since then, I’ve decided to port my codebase back to the classic Amiga, as well as explore porting over to other Amiga-like systems such as <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AROS_Research_Operating_System">AROS</a>. This leads to some choices: From a packaging and distribution point of view, a 68k binary is pretty much the universal standard in Amiga land. It can run natively on classic Amigas, and modern systems like AmigaOS 4.x and MorphOS can run 68k binaries through translation. In a method similar to how Apple has handled the transition between processors in the Mac, it’s a pretty seamless experience and I run a lot of classic 68k software on my X5000. As long as you aren’t “banging on the metal” it works really well and <a href="https://www.markround.com/blog/2018/10/30/classic-amiga-emulation-on-the-x5000/#classic-68k-binaries">integrates smoothly</a> with the rest of the system.</p>

<p>The original 68k AmigaOS from Commodore is also pretty much the standard for source-code compatibility; code targetting this release can be built on most of the derivatives and later systems with very little (if any) modification. On AmigaOS 4 for example, you can simply add <code>-D__USE_INLINE__</code> to your makefiles and in theory build from a common codebase. If you start the other way as I did and write initially targetting AmigaOS 4, it’s harder to port to other systems.</p>

<p>For example, I originally followed the AmigaOS 4 programming style which favours prefixing library calls with interface names. This isn’t compatible with any other system, so the easiest way to port this to more Amiga-like platforms is to refactor this code back to the classic style of calling system functions. I do plan on building platform-specific binaries using <code>#defines</code> so I can for example use functions like <code>dos.library/AddCmdPathNode</code> on OS 4 that I otherwise have to manually implement, and while a lot of higher-level layers (like e.g. MUI for building graphical applications) are shared across platforms this is probably the best bet for adding specific features from one platform that aren’t available on others.</p>

<p>Honestly though, at this point if you want to just get started I’d have to suggest you target classic AmigaOS compatibility and build a 68k binary. I’d personally target AmigaOS 3.x or 2.1 if you want to support a wider range of truly vintage systems; 1.x is facinating from a retro-geek perspective but lacks a lot of the nice features that came with later systems. Everything else like the installer, archive format, documentation format and so on is cross-platform anyway and supported from OS 2.1 and up.</p>

<p>MorphOS, AROS and OS 4 are really fun systems to explore, and I highly recommend checking them out if this article has whetted your appetite (and you can find a system to run them on!) but classic is the easiest way to get your code out to the wider world and ironically provides a better code-base for future porting than my “working backwards” approach.</p>

So that’s about the sum total of what I’ve picked up over the last few years, anyway! I still enjoy working on my Amigas when I get some “hacking on code in the evening” time, and in particular I find AmigaOS 4 on my X5000 a refreshing blend of retro appeal and just about enough modern convenience to use it for development tasks, or even for writing this article itself. My A1200 continues to impress me with how much utility there is in such a small box and is a wonderful distraction from the modern era of bloated systems and applications. It is perhaps an evolutionary dead-end, but it’s still a lot of fun and is one of the rare occasions these days where I feel actually in control of <em>my</em> computer. Working backwards in time from OS 4.1 to my classic Amigas has also really given me a greater insight and appreciation for what the Amiga engineers managed to pull off back then. If you’re in any way interested in computer history - or simply want to give something truly different a try - you should definitely check out AmigaOS. I hope this quick <code>type BRAIN: &gt; WEB:</code> dump provides you with some good starting points, and maybe gets you coding too!</p>

        <p>In the six months that have passed after the last USB-C article has been released, I have thought up a bunch of ways that these articles could have been improved. It’s, of course, normal to have such a feeling — expected, even. I now believe that there’s a few gaps that I could bridge. For instance, I have not provided enough example circuits, and sometimes one schematic can convey things better than a thousand words.</p>
<p>Let’s fix that! I’ll give you schematics for the kinds of USB-C devices you’re actually likely to want to build. I’ll also share a bunch of IC part numbers in this article, but I don’t have an exhaustive collection, of course – if you find more cool ICs that work for USB-C purposes and aren’t mentioned here, please do let us all know in the comments!</p>

<p>We’ve seen the first example circuit <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/12/06/usb-c-introduction-for-hackers/">in the first article</a> – a device-side (“upstream-facing”) USB-C port that supports USB 2.0 and 5 V of power. You must have the 5.1 K resistors, one resistor per pin, and remember to join both of the data pins — use vias if necessary. If you want to determine the amount of current available to you, you can also connect ADCs or comparators to both of the CC pins together, though most often, your device is low-power enough that there’s no reason to bother.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to make a device with a USB-C plug, the wiring is the same. The only difference is that you only need to populate one of the CC pull-downs, and wire up one pair of D+/D- pins instead of both pairs. Nothing bad is likely to happen in practice if you wire up the second pair of USB 2.0 pins, it’s just uncouth by the standard; it used to conflict with a certain kind of ports and cables (the VirtualLink ones) that are no longer being sold.</p>
<p>However, if you wire up 5.1 K pull-downs to both CC pins, you’ll accidentally make a hacker accessory: a debug mode adapter, something that will help you get extra signals out of some USB-C ports. For instance, on the Framework laptop, a USB-C-plug-equipped board with both pull-downs will switch a USB-C port into a debug mode, and expose the EC UART connection on the SBU pins. Unless you are making such a debug accessory, you should only populate one of the pull-downs, and wire up the USB 2.0 data pins accordingly.</p>
<h2>The Flipside Just As Easy</h2>
<p>What if you wanted to make a host port? From one side, it’s easier, because you don’t necessarily have to do any ADC measurements. Instead, you add pull-ups, different value for different amounts of available current. Not all devices check the pull-up presence, but phones do, so if you’re making a makeshift USB-C charger, a phone or a laptop might not recognize it as a valid way to charge if you don’t have the pull-ups. It doesn’t cost much to add them, either!</p>

<p>More importantly, you might want to control VBUS, only switching it on after you’ll have detected a pull-down on one of the CC pins. You won’t necessarily have a problem if you don’t, but it does cover some important edge cases, like someone plugging a USB-A to USB-C cable into your port!</p>
<p>I’ve never done this circuit, but the way I see it, it should be enough to use two FETs, one per CC pin, both put in parallel. This circuit might have edge cases — improvements welcome! On the other side, I’ve used pull-down-equipped USB-C port breakouts as host ports a few times, so it’s definitely not a hard requirement, and you don’t always need to break out your FET collection.</p>
<p>In total, there’s two things that you want to do if you’re building a host port, and neither of the two are quite required. Also, if you’d like to get more complex on the circuitry, or perhaps even do a dual-role port, there are ICs that help you with this part of USB-C!</p>
<p>For instance, take<a href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/span-style-background-color-ff0-USB-span-ICs_WILLSEMI-Will-Semicon-WUSB3801Q-12-TR_C2931342.html" target="_blank"> the WUSB3801</a>. It takes care of both source and sink detection, has all the needed pulld-owns and pull-ups inside, and can even do dual-role ports, which lets you build any kind of 5 V power port. It can output the port status with a few GPIOs, or you can connect it to your microcontroller over I2C, and it even has an ID pin so that you can use it to fully replace a MicroUSB port with a USB-C one! The WUSB3801 is small enough, solderable enough, and versatile enough too. For instance, <a href="http://hackaday.com/discord">over on the Hackaday Discord server</a>, someone has built a WUSB3801 circuit which limits a Li-ion charger’s current based on whether the USB-C port connected can provide 3 amps or not.</p>
<p>Whether you want to build a source port, a sink port, or even a port that can do both, the WUSB301 (or any of the many similar ICs like TUSB320), will be your solution of the day. One complaint I have towards the WUSB3801, is that it doesn’t provide a GPIO for determining the currently-plugged-in port polarity — you have to use the I2C interface for that. Now, why would you need to know the port polarity? High-speed interfaces are the reason, and the USB 3.0 interface is definitely a USB-C mainstay, if only because of how easy it is to implement.</p>
<h2>High-Speed, Low-Price</h2>
<p>Building a USB 3.0 device with a USB-C plug is as easy as building a USB 2.0 device with a USB-C plug. USB 3.0 has two high-speed diffpairs added to it, and a USB-C connector has spots for four diffpairs. With the plug, you wire up your USB 3.0 SSRX to USB-C RX1, USB 3.0 SSTX to USB-C TX1, pop a pull-down on the CC1, and you’re done. There are no extra components apart from any series capacitors that your USB 3.0 link might need, and these won’t be different from a regular implementation.</p>
<p>Now, this is why you will see a lot of USB flashdrives adopt a USB-C plug — it’s this easy to add one, you don’t need to figure out the CC pins, add any extra components or alike. You <em>do</em> need to add extra components if you aim to add a USB-C socket with USB 3.0 support, however. Imagine plugging your USB 3.0 USB-C flashdrive into a USB-C socket, depending on which way you rotate it, the pins are going to end up in one of the two positions. You don’t want to join TX/RX pins of the socket together, that would be a major signal integrity problem, so if you’re adding a USB-C socket with USB 3.0 support, you need a mux to handle high-speed signal rotation.</p>

<p>These are, by now, a tried and true kind of USB-C chip – you will find these from at least a dozen different manufacturers; if you find a few ICs that have the same pinout, it’ll be hard for you to get chip shortage’d. Some muxes will have a POL input, for manually switching your USB 3.0 signal into two possible positions — these are meant to be used together with your own PD controller, which is to say, a chip that handles CC pins. Many muxes, you will find, also contain CC logic, and will basically give you a complete solution for 5 V and USB 3.0 capable USB-C. If you’re building a host, you might only need to add VBUS handling, and if you’re building a device with a USB-C socket, you don’t need anything else!</p>
<p>Such a mux is how a lot of cheap USB-C ports on laptops work – they only provide USB 2.0, nothing else, and given how easy it is to implement, it makes sense that a lot of cheap laptop manufacturers have stuck to this. What’s more, you could even omit the mux if you wanted if you have a USB 3.0 port to spare. We’ve seen this done on desktop motherboards, and funnily enough, this is <a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/pocket-reform/-/tree/main/pocket-reform-motherboard" target="_blank">how both of the USB-C ports are wired on the MNT Pocket Reform,</a> too! It makes sense, the onboard USB 3.0 hub of the Pocket Reform board has four free ports, but there’s only two USB-C ports you can expose USB 3.0 on. It works well enough, and if someone wants to get at these two extra USB 3.0 ports, you only need to design a passive adapter!</p>
<p>One of these two USB-C ports on the Pocket Reform is special,it doesn’t just wire up the 5 V rail to VBUS like the first port does. Instead, it has a power switch IC wired up to VBUS, and a FUSB302B wired up to the CC pins. That’s the charger port of the Pocket Reform, and indeed, this is one of the ways you can get power delivery running.</p>

Higher voltages are supported too, of course. You just need to speak PD, or perhaps, let a friendly chip speak for you.</p>
<p>These friendly chips, as you might guess, are PD trigger ICs. You wire them up to the CC pins, and they negotiate a power profile on your behalf. They have a few inputs that let you set the desired voltage, and optionally a FET driver output to disconnect VBUS if the PSU can’t provide the voltage you need, making sure that you don’t get the default 5 V on a power rail where you require 20 V.</p>
<p>We could talk a lot about the trigger chips, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/07/02/dual-power-supply-in-a-pinch/">many other people do</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/01/09/all-about-usb-c-power-delivery/">and I sure have too</a>. In fact, it’s the option that people overwhelmingly pick when they need a high voltage out of a USB-C port. They are perfect for the majority of use cases, and chances are, you want to reach for one. However, mind you, their behavior is inflexible: they won’t let you make a dual-role port, and they won’t let you distinguish between a 30 W USB-C PSU and a 100 W one, which helps when you’re driving a resistive load. You also can’t combine them with USB 3.0 or DisplayPort either as they don’t have a polarity output, and they don’t let you send custom messages.</p>

Whether you use an external PD controller like the FUSB302B or maybe a PD controller built into your MCU, it will let you make your own PD communication decisions. It’s got all the resistors you might want, and you’re likely to find example code for whatever task you need to accomplish. We’ve gone through custom PD message building already, both for power and DisplayPort sink operation. At some point we’ll even build our own USB-C PSU with a FUSB302B, so stay tuned! When it comes to MCUs, there are some well-known STM32 and Cypress microcontrollers with PD peripherals, and recently, <a href="https://github.com/openwch/ch32x035" target="_blank">the CH32X035</a> has entered the scene.</p>
<p>Your own PD controller will also let you send out DisplayPort messages — extracting a DisplayPort output from any compatible ports, or perhaps offering DisplayPort on your own. Use a USB-C plug and you will not need a mux, or use a socket and add a DisplayPort-compatible mux – it will let you extract two-lane DisplayPort and USB 3.0 simultaneously, or four-lane DisplayPort, whichever you might want. Or, you can use a DisplayPort socket, omit the mux, and only have your port work in one orientation – this <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/hdmi-controller-board-for-display-panel/17513/88?u=arya" target="_blank">Chinese eDP breakout seller</a> can confirm!</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll go through the inner workings of a USB-C PSU, then convert a 20 V PSU into a USB-C source with 20 V support; we will only need the FUSB302, a few FETs, and a spare 5 V regulator. It won’t require much of us, you’ll be able to convert your old power supplies to USB-C laptop power duty, and you’ll get some insights into how a USB-C PSU operates, too!</p>

<p>As mentioned on previous posts, I have spent the past few weeks dealing with a ZFS crash on my FreeNAS install. Because of that, not only was I forced to learn how to troubleshoot ZFS, but I also had to learn how to setup new volumes and come up with new backup strategies (between a few other things).</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about ZFS (because I new ‘nada’ to start with). And I’m happy to share some of the knowledge that I gathered with you on this post.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that I don’t consider myself an expert on ZFS (not even close), but I will try to make things simple and easy to understand for someone, who like me, is just getting started with ZFS.</p>
<h2 id="about-zfs">About ZFS<a href="#about-zfs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="what-is-zfs-and-its-history">What is ZFS and It’s History<a href="#what-is-zfs-and-its-history" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>ZFS is a local filesystem (i.e.: ext4, NTFS, exfat) and logical volume manager (i.e.: LVM on Linux) created by Sun Microsystems. ZFS was published under an open source license until Oracle bought Sun Microsystems and closed source the license. Because the source code was already in the open and ported to different OSs, eventually a project called ‘OpenZFS’ was created, and that is the core code that is used on most Unix like systems today (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.).</p>

<h4 id="vdev">vdev<a href="#vdev" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A vdev is composed of one or more physical drives (can also be of things other than hard drive, like files). They can be combined together in mirrors or RAIDZs.</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/vdev.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/vdev.png"></a></p>
<p>💡 <em><strong>TIP:</strong> There are 7 different types of vdevs, and some of them (like host spare, L2ARC and ZIL) are very important.</em></p>
<h4 id="pool">Pool<a href="#pool" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>A pool is composed of one or more vdevs and they usually contain a volume or a dataset (which you create after creating the pool). You create/define your vdevs when you create a pool (with the <code>zpool</code> command which we’ll see later). This allows you to mix vdev types together to achieve other RAIDZ levels (see example below):</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/raid10.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/raid10.png"></a></p>
<h4 id="datasets">Datasets<a href="#datasets" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Dataset is the filesystem part of ZFS (so far we’ve seen the LVM components). Here you can define user access, quotas, compression, snapshots, etc…</p>
<h4 id="volume">Volume<a href="#volume" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Volume is the brother of datasets but in a block device representation. It provides some of the features that datasets have, but not all. Volumes can be useful to run other filesystems on top of ZFS, or to export iSCSI extents.</p>
<h3 id="raidz-types">RAIDZ Types<a href="#raidz-types" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic/Simple Stripe (RAID0) - Distributes data without parity. Loosing a device means loosing all data</li>
<li>MIRROR (RAID1) - Mirrored drives. Used with 2 to 4 disks (or more)</li>
<li>RAIDZ-1 (RAID5) - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose one physical drive before a raid failure. RAIDZ requires at least 3 disks</li>
<li>RAIDZ-2 (RAID6) - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose up to 2 physical drives. RAIDZ-2 requires at least 4 disks</li>
<li>RAIDZ-3 - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose up to 3 physical drives. RAIDZ-3 requires at least 4, but should be used with no less than 5 disks</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="commands">Commands<a href="#commands" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the most common commands for handling ZFS pools and filesystem. We’ll use <code>/dev/sdx</code> to refer to device names, but keep in mind that using the device UUID is preferred in order to avoid boot issues due to device name changes.</p>
<h3 id="1zfs-pool-commands">1.ZFS Pool Commands<a href="#1zfs-pool-commands" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>These are the commands related to creating vdevs and pools. We will be looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zpool create</code> - Create a pool (and vdevs)</li>
<li><code>zpool status</code> - Displays pool status</li>
<li><code>zpool list</code> - List pool and it’s details</li>
<li><code>zpool history</code> - Shows history of commands for zpool</li>
<li><code>zpool import</code>- Imports and mounts pool</li>
<li><code>zpool export</code> - Exports and unmounts pool</li>
<li><code>zpool destroy</code> - Destroy pool and all filesystems</li>
<li><code>zpool scrub</code> - Starts scrub of pool</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11creating-a-pool-and-vdevs">1.1.Creating a Pool (and vdevs)<a href="#11creating-a-pool-and-vdevs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>To create a new pool we use the <code>zpool create</code> command. We specify the pool name and the device we want to use.</p>
<p>It’s basic usage is:</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span># zpool create [pool] [devices]
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s look at different examples for this command.</p>
<h5 id="create-a-pool-on-a-single-disk"><strong>Create a pool on a single disk</strong><a href="#create-a-pool-on-a-single-disk" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>The command below creates a pool on a single disk.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-1-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span># zpool create tank /dev/sdb  
</span></code></pre></div>
<h5 id="create-a-dynamic-stripe-pool-on-3-disks"><strong>Create a dynamic stripe pool on 3 disks</strong><a href="#create-a-dynamic-stripe-pool-on-3-disks" title="Permanent link">#</a></h5>
<p>Remember that dynamic stripe is the same as RAID0 and that it has no parity.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-2-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span># zpool create tank /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can view the new pool with <code>zpool status</code></p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-3-1"><span data-linenos=" 1 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool status

<h4 id="25-creating-snapshots">2.5. Creating Snapshots<a href="#25-creating-snapshots" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Snapshots allow you to save the state of a filesystem to a current point in time, without duplicating storage (files are not copied). It flags existing data as «read-only» while allowing new data to be added to the filesystem without affecting the existing data blocks that are protected by the snapshot (the whole process is a bit more complicated than this).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the image below as an example. You have a filesystem with existing data (Data A) and you take a snapshot (snapshot 1). Then you make some changes, add new files (Data B) and take another snapshot (snapthot 2). After that you make even more changes (Data C).</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.1.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.1.png"></a></p>
<p>Snapshot 1 protects the original data (Data A), while snapshot 2 protects Data Changes (B) as well as the original data (Data A). So you can delete snapshot 1 and data (A) will still be protected.</p>
<p><a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.2.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="" src="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/_assets/homelab/zfs-for-dummies/snapshot.2.png"></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The amount of data used for the snapshots is very small because we are not copying the files, but instead the filesystem top-level metadata block indicating the they belong to a snapshot.</em></p>
<p>And here are a few scenarios of what happens when you delete files and snapshots:</p>

<p>One of the best features of ZFS is ‘ZFS send’. It allows you send snapshots as a stream of data. This is a great way replicate a snapshot and it’s dataset to a file, another pool or even to another system via SSH. Amazing no!</p>
<p>Let’s look at the example below. We have 2 pools in our system named ‘tank’ and ‘backup’.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-48-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool list
</span><span id="__span-48-2"><span data-linenos="2 "></span>NAME     SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  CKPOINT  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP    HEALTH  ALTROOT
</span><span id="__span-48-3"><span data-linenos="3 "></span>tank       9G  1.50G  7.50G        -         -     0%    16%  1.00x    ONLINE  -
</span><span id="__span-48-4"><span data-linenos="4 "></span>backup  4.50G   104K  4.50G        -         -     0%     0%  1.00x    ONLINE  -
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our tank pool we have a dataset for our Movies.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-49-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:/tank/Movies# zfs list -r tank
</span><span id="__span-49-2"><span data-linenos="2 "></span>NAME          USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
</span><span id="__span-49-3"><span data-linenos="3 "></span>tank         1.50G  7.22G       24K  /tank
</span><span id="__span-49-4"><span data-linenos="4 "></span>tank/Movies  1.50G  7.22G     1.50G  /tank/Movies
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Before we can send this data we need create a snapshot:</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-50-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs snapshot tank/Movies@$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M')
</span><span id="__span-50-2"><span data-linenos="2 "></span>
</span><span id="__span-50-3"><span data-linenos="3 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot
</span><span id="__span-50-4"><span data-linenos="4 "></span>NAME                           USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
</span><span id="__span-50-5"><span data-linenos="5 "></span>tank/Movies@2020-11-03_15-29     0B      -     1.50G  -
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now we can send our snapshot to our backup pool with <code>zfs send/recv</code>.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-51-1"><span data-linenos="1 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs send tank/Movies@2020-11-03_15-29 | zfs recv backup/Movies
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And let’s confirm that it worked.</p>
<div><p><span>Text Only</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-52-1"><span data-linenos=" 1 "></span>root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p> In the past 20 years, economists have estimated empirical exercises that rely in part on a published work that reports the population of every country in the world starting in the year 1 <span>ce</span> or even earlier. The existence of such data surprises those familiar with research on population history; we have only a rough idea of the population of most parts of the globe before 1500. For many countries, the statistical lacuna extends closer to the present. Until the advent of modern censuses, which in most countries started during the nineteenth century, reckonings of the total population for even the best-studied cases remain subject to considerable error.</p>
<p> These exercises typically rely on McEvedy and Jones’s <em>Atlas of World Population History</em> (hereafter MJ). Published in 1978, this work reports a population total for the countries of the world at intervals of a century or half-century. MJ did not disguise the rough nature of their data, as the epigraph notes, and we should distinguish what they report from the way others used their work. Several economists point to a U.S. Census Bureau summary that appears to endorse MJ’s estimates. The Bureau simply notes that MJ’s estimates for <em>world</em> population are not too different from the other, earlier results.<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a> As MJ state (pp. 353–4), however, that agreement is largely by construction.</p>
<p> The drawbacks of using such data are numerous. MJ’s estimates, as they suggested themselves at the time of writing, lacked, in many cases, any firm foundation. Often, the estimates appear to reflect a judgment about the nature of the economy in question, rendering their use as economic proxies partially tautological. The MJ estimates are out-of-date for some countries; researchers have provided better figures in the past 40 years. Economists tend to dismiss measurement error issues by appealing to the implications of “classical” measurement error. MJ’s clearly stated rounding rules mean the measurement error is not classical. Non-classical measurement error create several opportunities for bias in regression models. Economists have compounded these weaknesses with unwise disaggregation practices.</p>
<p> Many economics articles, including several highly cited contributions in the leading journals, rely on MJ for econometric exercises. This research has appeared in the leading general-interest economics journals, in development and growth-oriented journals, and in the main field journals for economic history. Several of these papers have been cited many times.<a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span><sup>2</sup></a> The present paper raises serious questions about the results of any econometric exercise that relies on MJ.</p>
<p> If the correct population data were available, we could re-estimate specific models that appear in published papers and assess the consequences of the measurement-error problems discussed here. This is obviously not possible because we lack the correct data. What I do instead is study the way MJ assemble and round their estimates. This permits us to draw on econometric literature to understand the difference between a model estimated using MJ and a model estimated using corrected population data. I then discuss more specifically the way some economists have used this population data. A brief replication exercise using Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>) shows that some published results are not robust to careful consideration of the problems in the MJ data.</p>

<p> One would think from reading the economics literature that MJ report precise numbers based on their analysis of earlier works. Graphs such as Figure&nbsp;<a href="#f1">1</a>, along with MJ’s descriptions, suggest a different picture. “There are almost no data on which to base a population estimate for Germany until we reach the late Middle Ages” (McEvedy and Jones <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference McEvedy and Jones</span>1978</a>, p. 70). “Estimates of Poland’s population before the 14<sup>th</sup> century are based on nothing more than general ideas about likely [population – T.G.] densities” (p. 76). For the Maghreb, “There is really nothing on which to base any calculations before the 19<sup>th</sup> century” (p. 220). These comments are admirably frank, but MJ do, in fact, report population totals for Germany, Poland, and the Maghreb, and economists have used those observations to test hypotheses we view as important. MJ include a bibliography for each group of population estimates, but they typically do not explain how they used the references they list. For Burma, they note that the quantitative record consists of a single publication based on a count of houses in 1783 as well as colonial censuses that began in 1871. Yet MJ report population sizes for that country as far back as 400 <span>bce</span> (pp. 190–92). This is not an isolated example. In discussing the western hemisphere, they refer to debates current at the time they wrote, but those debates suggested large ranges of estimates and pertain to the decades just prior to European contact. Yet MJ provide estimates for countries in this region going back many centuries. Most African entries have the same flavor; the only evidence MJ cites refers to the seventeenth century at the earliest, yet they report estimates for two full millennia.</p>
<p> Caldwell and Schindlmayr (<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Caldwell and Schindlmayr</span>2002</a>, p. 200) emphasize the difficulty of useful population estimates for most of the world, and even for Europe before 1800. Population figures for the large areas of the globe that once fell under European colonial domination may be the hardest part of the problem. The essays on the Americas collected in Denevan (1992) document debates that continue. Carlos, Feir, and Redish (<a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Carlos, Feir and Redish</span>2022</a>, p. 522), for example, note that in the early twentieth century, estimates of the pre-contact population of North America north of Mexico City ranged from 1.2 to 18 million people. Later efforts narrowed that range to 1.2 to 6.1 million people. The demographic consequence of colonial contact is one measure of imperialism’s impact on indigenous peoples, so these population measures carry considerable interpretative weight. Continuing differences of opinion do not reflect a lack of research.<a href="#fn5"><span>Footnote </span><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p> Systematic discussion of MJ has been limited, but specialists tend not to be impressed. As Austin (<a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Austin</span>2008</a>, p. 1102) puts it, “If you look up McEvedy and Jones expecting a treatise, detailing the original evidence and the reasoning behind the judgements by which it was converted into useable data, you will be disappointed.” In discussing one particular study that relies heavily on MJ, Austin (<a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Austin</span>2008</a>, p. 1002) says that “there is simply no epistemological basis for Nunn’s use of the word ‘data’ – literally, ‘things that are given’ or granted – to refer to the guesses that have been made about the population of future African countries in 1400.”<a href="#fn6"><span>Footnote </span><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p> MJ’s effort reflects a long interest in the world’s population from distant times. MJ draw on these earlier efforts, which include Clark (<a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Clark</span>1968</a>) and Durand (<a href="#ref19"><span>Reference Durand</span>1974</a>). (Online Appendix Table A.1 summarizes the leading examples.) Caldwell and Schindlmayr (<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Caldwell and Schindlmayr</span>2002</a>) discuss the intellectual history of these research projects, stressing their skepticism about the apparent consensus in the figures. MJ’s effort differs from their predecessors in one important respect: the earlier estimates pertain to large regions or continents. MJ usually report populations for the areas that correspond to modern nation-states.</p>
<p> How did MJ derive population estimates from before, as they say, there was anything on which to base such estimates? Reading their descriptions and examining the figures suggests four overlapping approaches. In some cases, they state explicitly their reliance on one of these approaches, but more often, their method only reveals itself in the estimates. First, they start with the earliest official census and work backward. What Clark (<a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Clark</span>1968</a>, p. 61) calls “jobbing back” can yield good population estimates given the right raw materials and technique. The population of a country in 1500 equals its 1600 population minus deaths and net emigrants, plus births in the period 1500–1600. Wrigley and Schofield (<a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Wrigley and Schofield</span>1981</a>, chapter 7) offer an example of this approach. They start with the reliable census of England and Wales for 1841 and work back in time using estimates of births and deaths, along with more speculative estimates of net migration, to produce annual populations back to 1541. The challenge for earlier periods is that we rarely have anything like good counts of births and deaths, much less migrants, and the effort demands attention to complex sources. Creating the vital events series was the heart of Wrigley and Schofield’s project.<a href="#fn7"><span>Footnote </span><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p> Austin (<a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Austin</span>2008</a>, p. 1002) stresses that momentous historical events such as the rise of the Atlantic slave trade greatly complicate such efforts. Few areas of the globe have been entirely spared these destabilizing episodes. Sometimes we even lack the equivalent of a reliable end-period enumeration, such as the 1841 census for England and Wales. Recent efforts to improve historical African population counts provide better-reasoned figures than MJ’s for that continent, but run into a source problem. The twentieth-century colonial censuses that form their end-period figure are themselves not terribly reliable. In addition, for Africa, we lack the sources that would allow us to estimate the earlier population increases needed for useful “jobbing back.”<a href="#fn8"><span>Footnote </span><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p> A hint comes from the suspiciously round progression of population figures for single countries.<a href="#fn9"><span>Footnote </span><sup>9</sup></a> Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl1">1</a> shows the overall patterns; in many cases, MJ apparently devised a population estimate after deciding on a round figure for percentage growth. The many commonalities across countries are implausible. Individual country histories drive home the problem. In MJ’s reckoning, England’s population grew by 750,000 between 1600 and 1650, and by another 750,000 in the next half-century (McEvedy and Jones <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference McEvedy and Jones</span>1978</a>, p. 43). Austria added 250,000 people every 50 years between 1650 and 1800 (pp. 88–92). Thailand added 250,000 people in both the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (p. 193). Burma’s population growth during the same period was 500,000 per century.</p>

</span></p>
</div>
<p> Second, MJ apparently wanted their estimates to reflect their view that until the late medieval period, population grew at a constant rate. In disagreeing with an earlier author on the right total world population for the year 1000, MJ note that “our figure for AD 1, being 100m below the agreed figure for AD 1000, fits better on the sort of exponentially rising curve that everyone agrees best describes mankind’s population growth” (p. 354). As the quotation implies, MJ also worried about consistency between theirs and earlier estimates. Caldwell and Schindlmayr (<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Caldwell and Schindlmayr</span>2002</a>, p. 199) call this “an example of a dangerous circularity,” while Biraben dismisses the MJ data after noting this fact.<a href="#fn10"><span>Footnote </span><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p> Third, in the face of ignorance, MJ felt comfortable assigning identical growth rates to places they thought were similar. This practice doubtless underlies much of what we see in Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl1">1</a>. For 35 percent of countries, MJ assign the same figure to population growth between the years 1 and 1000.</p>
<p> Finally, especially before 1500, MJ tended to reason from the nature of an economy and the population they thought it could support. They are rarely explicit about this tactic, but it shows through remarks such as “likely population densities” in the passage about Poland quoted earlier. To the extent that they estimate population in this way, MJ’s figures reflect not the population of a particular country at a point in time, but their views about the population density consistent with the kind of economy MJ thought the country had. Since they do not claim any serious knowledge of the economy or of the number of people it can support, the basis for this reasoning is unclear.<a href="#fn11"><span>Footnote </span><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<div data-magellan-destination="s1-1" id="s1-1">
<h3> Maddison</h3>
<p> Several of the articles discussed later rely in part on estimates reported by the late Angus Maddison. Maddison famously constructed, updated, and used a database that offered estimates of population and GDP/capita for most of the world’s countries, again, in some versions, going as far back as the year 1 <span>ce</span>.<a href="#fn12"><span>Footnote </span><sup>12</sup></a> For the last major revision of his estimates, Maddison says of his population data: “The following detailed estimates for 1500 onwards rely heavily on monographic country studies for the major countries. To fill holes in my dataset I draw on McEvedy and Jones (<a href="#ref32"><span>Reference McEvedy and Jones</span>1978</a>). For the preceding millennium and a half, I use their work extensively” (Maddison <a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Maddison</span>2001</a>, p. 230). Maddison adds that he relies on MJ rather than earlier accounts because MJ are “the most detailed and best documented” (p. 230).</p>
<p> Thus, for many places before 1500, Maddison’s database just reproduces MJ’s figures. This is not always the case, however; Maddison was able to incorporate the fruits of research published between 1978 and his own publication. This led to some substantive revisions, but those revisions reflect the research literature’s emphasis. He updated 23 percent of MJ’s observations for the year 1000, for example, and 40 percent of the observations for 1500. The majority of Maddison’s changes for the year 1000 were in non-European countries (eight of nine countries that changed were outside Europe). For 1500, this pattern changes; 10 of 16 changes are for European countries, and in 1700, 8 of 12 are for Europe. These changes reflect contributions from the research literature.</p>
<p> Some individual changes are much larger, however. Maddison added 50 percent to Mexico’s population for the year 1000, and he doubled Peru’s population in that same year (Maddison <a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Maddison</span>2001</a>, table B-5, p. 235). He increased the population of the territory that would become the United States by 125 percent for the year 1500. For later periods, especially in the twentieth century, Maddison revises the MJ estimates more comprehensively. In 1850, 84 percent of Maddison’s 51 observations have values different from MJ’s, although the average absolute difference (3 percent) is smaller than for earlier years.<a href="#fn13"><span>Footnote </span><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<h2> MEASUREMENT ERROR AND ROUNDING</h2>
<p> Relative to “perfect” data for every country in the world, how far wrong will MJ take us? It is worth reviewing some general consequences of measurement error for the kinds of linear models that most researchers use.<a href="#fn14"><span>Footnote </span><sup>14</sup></a> Denote the true population of country <em>i</em> in year <em>t</em> as Ṗ<sub><em>it</em></sub>. The MJ estimate is P<sub><em>it</em></sub>. The difference between MJ’s estimate and the true population is the measurement error <em>ε</em> <sub><em>it</em></sub>, such that P<sub><em>it</em></sub> = Ṗ<sub><em>it</em></sub> + <em>ε</em> <sub><em>it</em></sub>. Classical measurement error is the special cases where <em>ε</em> <sub><em>it</em></sub> is additive and uncorrelated with Ṗ<sub><em>it</em></sub>. We have two general implications. First, classical measurement error in the dependent variable alone does not bias estimates. The <em>ε</em> <sub>it</sub> are swept into the regression error term, and the only consequence is some efficiency loss. Second, measurement error in <em>any</em> regressor implies bias in <em>all</em> of the estimates.</p>

<p> where P<sub><em>it</em></sub> is the mis-measured variable. While I write Equation (<a href="#disp1">1</a>) for a panel framework, that is not necessary for what follows. Classical measurement error in P<sub><em>it</em></sub> implies that the estimate for γ will be smaller in absolute value than it would be if we could use Ṗ<sub><em>it</em></sub> instead. The estimate is attenuated. The estimate for β will also be biased in ways we cannot ordinarily sign. The problem arises from the correlation between the measurement error <em>ε</em> <sub><em>it</em></sub> and the regression error term μ<sub>it</sub>, which is why some researchers employ instrumental-variable techniques in using the MJ data as a regressor. The fixed-effects estimator does not necessarily yield unbiased estimates in the presence of even classical measurement error. Fixed effects only “deals with” measurement error if the errors in P<sub>it</sub> are, for each country <em>i</em>, the same for all years. In that case, the measurement error becomes part of the estimated country fixed effects (Deaton <a href="#ref16"><span>Reference Deaton</span>1997</a>, pp. 108–110).<a href="#fn15"><span>Footnote </span><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p> Classical measurement error in the dependent variable ordinarily does not bias regression estimates because the measurement error is added to the regression disturbance term. This result requires that the measurement error be additive: P<sub><em>it</em></sub> = Ṗ<sub><em>it</em></sub> + <em>ε</em> <sub><em>it</em></sub>. One common case of non-additive measurement error appears when the dependent variable is the ratio of two variables and the denominator is measured with error. Consider a common example: an urbanization figure is formed as the number of people living in cities divided by MJ’s population estimate. Rewriting Equation (<a href="#disp1">1</a>),

</p>
<p> The ratio in the original dependent variable makes the measurement error multiplicative and causes bias in estimates of β. More generally, if measurement error is not classical, then we need to model the error. Hyslop and Imbens (<a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Hyslop and Imbens</span>2001</a>) discuss several cases, including one where measurement error in a regressor leads to overestimates of that coefficient instead of the attenuation we expect with classical measurement error.</p>
<p> What does this mean for econometric studies that used mis-measured population estimates? If we maintain the assumption that the measurement error is classical, we can say two things. When population is the dependent variable, the estimates may be less efficient, but there should be no bias due to measurement error alone. If population is a regressor, on the other hand, then the estimate for population will be attenuated. Additionally, the other estimates in this case will be biased and inconsistent. Thus, using population as a “control” can lead to bias even for variables not thought to suffer from measurement error. If the error is not classical, on the other hand, then we cannot say much without modeling the measurement error.</p>
<p> While economists tend to assume that measurement error is always classical, in this case, we know that this is not the case. MJ state that they have rounded their estimates in ways that make the measurement error depend on the true value. This rounding applies to every country and every period, but the rounding rule depends on the population size. This means the measurement error depends on population size:</p><p> All figures are rounded on the following system: below one million to the nearest .1 million, between one and 10 millions to the nearest .25 million, between 10 and 20 million to the nearest .5 million and between 20 and 100 millions to the nearest million. Above 100 million the rounding is to the nearest 5 million, above a billion… to the nearest 25 million. (McEvedy and Jones <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference McEvedy and Jones</span>1978</a>, p. 9)</p>
<p> Thus, MJ tell us that they create measurement error that is larger for larger populations. We cannot know precisely the implications of MJ’s rounding rules. We can, however, simulate the “true” populations to get a feel for how much trouble the rounding can cause. I use a Monte Carlo exercise to simulate the rounded-off portion of each population estimate. Adding that rounded portion to MJ’s reported numbers yields a simulated “true” population. We can then ask whether that simulated “true” population is correlated with the error caused by rounding. This exercise can only address the measurement error caused by rounding; the other flaws remain. Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl2">2</a> shows the result: the rounding induces a high degree of correlation between the measurement error and the population. This result holds for four different assumed functional forms for the rounding error, including two that are asymmetric in different ways. The correlation stems from MJ’s different rules for different size categories.</p>

<p> Online Appendix Section 2 reports details of this simulation along with two additional assessments of the importance of this rounding. The first uses the populations of the 50 United States for the period 1900–1970. The second uses the populations of countries around the world for the period 1960–2020. In both cases, I apply MJ’s rounding rules and examine the correlation between the true values and the errors created by rounding. Rounding for the U.S. states does not consistently imply correlation, while for the countries of the world, the correlation between the true value and the measurement error is considerable. The countries dataset is the closer analogy to MJ because the countries span the entire range of their rounding rules.</p>
<p> MJ’s rounding procedure creates a distinct problem when a country’s population crosses one of the thresholds implied by their rounding rule. Portugal, they report, had a population of 900,000 in 1400 and 1.25 million in 1500 (p. 103). These figures imply that Portugal’s population increased by 350,000 people, or 39 percent, in those 100 years. Taking the rounding into account, however, implies upper and lower bounds for the population estimate in both 1400 and 1500. The true increase could be as small as 19 percent or as great as 58 percent.</p>
<p> The non-classical nature of the measurement error in MJ poses a serious problem for any estimates that rely on it. We can evaluate earlier, published work under the assumption of classical measurement error, and that is not a bad place to start. But MJ’s rounding applies to every country and period in their data, which means that none of the standard intuitions based on classical measurement error really apply.</p>

<h2> CIRCULARITY</h2>
<p> Many economists who use MJ’s figures think of population (or a derivative such as population density) as a proxy for an economic aggregate such as output. Critics such as Caldwell and Schindlmayr (<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Caldwell and Schindlmayr</span>2002</a>) and Austin (<a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Austin</span>2008</a>) note MJ often use ideas about the economy to derive an estimate of population size, thus making the population estimates a poor proxy for an economic aggregate. This is especially true in places and times for which the population data are thin. As noted, MJ defend an estimate for medieval Poland by referring to “likely population densities.” In a more explicit example, MJ discuss agricultural conditions in a region that comprises the modern states of Columbia, Venezuela, and the Guyanas to defend their assumption that until 1500, Colombia always accounted for 2/3 of the region’s population (McEvedy and Jones <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference McEvedy and Jones</span>1978</a>, p. 302).</p>
<p> Austin stresses that this approach makes their estimates hostage to ideas about an economy and economic change. It is a particular problem for Africa because we know relatively little about that continent’s economic history. Maddison (<a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Maddison</span>2001</a>, p. 238), for example, adopts MJ’s estimates for Africa in preference to earlier alternatives because MJ “assumed a more dynamic growth process.” That is, Maddison preferred MJ’s <em>population</em> estimates because he agreed with their assessment of the African <em>economy</em>. Neither Maddison nor MJ offer independent evidence about the African economy. To the extent MJ assigned population estimates based on their perceptions of economic performance, a regression using population as a proxy for growth tells us more about MJ than about economic growth.</p>

<h2> SOFT CLONES</h2>
<p> Researchers who use MJ’s data treat them as if they imply independent observations; put differently, if there are N countries listed for a given year, this reflects N pieces of information. This is not always true, for two distinct reasons that I will call “soft” and “hard” clones. MJ themselves create the soft clones. Frankly admitting that they lack meaningful data, they assign to some countries the population dynamics of countries they think are similar. Sometimes they make this approach explicit. After concluding that Afghanistan has no useful population data before the twentieth century, MJ say that “Perhaps the best approach is to compare Afghanistan with Iran” (McEvedy and Jones <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference McEvedy and Jones</span>1978</a>, p. 156). What they did, in fact, was to assume that Afghanistan had half the population of Iran in every year before 1900. The measurement error for Afghanistan thus has two sources. The Afghan numbers share any measurement error in the figures for Iran, and they also suffer from the error implied by any deviation of Afghanistan’s true population dynamics from Iran’s.</p>
<p> MJ includes many soft clones. Kenya and Uganda, for example, had identical populations through 1800, although the text does not say why. In some cases, they appeal to the idea that neighboring countries should have similar population growth rates: “… the fact that population doubled in most European countries between A.D. 1000 and 1300 can be taken as strong evidence for it doing so in other European countries for which direct evidence is lacking” (p. 11). Thus, in their reckoning, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia each grew 20 percent between 1000 and 1100. In the fifteenth century, European Russia and China each grew by one-third. As late as 1600–1700, Romania and Austria each grew by 11.11 percent. Soft clones probably underlie the patterns we see in Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl1">1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="s5" id="s5">
<h2> HARD CLONES</h2>
<p> A final problem reflects both MJ’s estimates and the way some economists have used them. MJ report many populations for regions rather than modern countries. Some economists create country-level populations out of the regions by allocating the regional population among the constituent modern nation-states. I will call the resulting countries “hard clones.” In the cross-section, these clones differ in size within the region. By construction, however, in the time series, all members of a clone group share the population growth rate MJ assigned to the region. Hard clones account for an especially large portion of the African country-level observations, but they appear in other parts of the world, as well. In Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>), hard clones account for 76 percent of the observations in Africa, 36 percent in Europe, and 41 percent in Asia. In Ashraf and Galor (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2011</a>), the clones are similar for these continents; three-quarters of their Western Hemisphere countries are clones.<a href="#fn16"><span>Footnote </span><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p> The literature includes two different ways to create countries out of regions. Nunn (<a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Nunn</span>2008</a>, p. 170) assumes that the relative sizes of the populations within each region are the same as reported for 1950. Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>) do not say explicitly how they disaggregated the regions, but for most countries, their population figures are similar to Nunn’s, so the approach is probably similar.<a href="#fn17"><span>Footnote </span><sup>17</sup></a> Ashraf and Galor (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2011</a>, <a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2013</a>) disaggregate the regions by assuming that each country within a region has the same population density in each year. In general, the resulting “country” populations created by the two methods differ in the cross-section; Nunn and Qian’s Nigeria in 1500 is not the same size as Ashraf and Galor’s. Yet both cloning methods imply that Nigeria has the same growth rate between any two years. This growth rate is simply the rate implicit in the region from which Nigeria is cloned.</p>
<p> Hard cloning adds further error to MJ’s guesses; how much is something we cannot say precisely because we do not know the true populations of the clones in those years. We can, however, study the implications of these two methods in contexts where we have the equivalent of valid country-level numbers. For the years 1900–1970, I constructed a panel from the population of the 50 United States as reported in the decennial census. I then aggregate the state populations into four standard regions. The state populations (which we know) are analogous to the unknown country populations that hard cloning attempts to recover. The U.S. regions are like the regions in the MJ book. I apply both the Nunn-Qian and Ashraf-Galor methods to estimating the population of each state in the period 1900–1960, as if all I knew was the population of each state in 1970 (for Nunn-Qian) and the state area and regional population in each year 1900–1970 (Ashraf-Galor). Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl3">3</a> summarizes the errors these methods produce. In most years, the Nunn-Qian approach produces smaller errors than Ashraf-Galor, although those errors are still large. Only in 1960 did the median error from the Nunn-Qian approach fall below 5 percent of the actual state population. The Ashraf-Galor approach produces a smaller median error in the early years, but the variance of the errors using this method is large. The two types of error are not highly correlated in the cross-section.<a href="#fn18"><span>Footnote </span><sup>18</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p> What does this exercise tell us about disaggregating MJ’s regions? The Nunn-Qian method assumes that population growth rates within each region are similar over time. The method goes wrong for regions with a state like California, which experienced especially rapid growth in the twentieth century. In 1900, California’s population accounted for 34 percent of the “West” region; in 1970, it was 57 percent. This is probably why the Nunn-Qian approach improves monotonically better over time; the 1970s weights better approximate the population distribution in 1960 than in 1900. It also illustrates the danger of their research, which starts with MJ’s estimates for 1000. Between the years 1000 and 1950, there was plenty of opportunity for the countries within a region to grow at different rates, producing a version of the problem noted for California.<a href="#fn19"><span>Footnote </span><sup>19</sup></a> Ashraf and Galor’s approach, on the other hand, requires that the population densities for countries within a region be identical. This approach fares poorly in the U.S. case because of the unequal population densities within some U.S. regions; the “Midwest” region, for example, includes states like Ohio (204 persons per square mile in 1900) as well as states like North Dakota (nine persons per square mile). The assumption is unlikely to hold at any point in time, and the discrepancy between assumption and reality could change over time with the introduction of new crops or other changes that lead to uneven economic development within the region. The U.S. experience may not provide a strict analogy to the regions these two methods attempt to disaggregate, but this exercise highlights how far wrong things can go if strong assumptions do not hold. The U.S. case also highlights the questions that we would need to ask before disaggregating data in this way. Do we really know enough about the sub-regional patterns in the Sahel in 1000, for example, to divide up a regional population?</p>
<p> The hard clones play an especially important role in Africa. MJ report only 12 regions for Africa. Nunn (<a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Nunn</span>2008</a>)’s Africa has 52 countries, while Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>)’s have 47.<a href="#fn20"><span>Footnote </span><sup>20</sup></a> Three-quarters of the African observations are thus clones. Given the difference in methods, we expect Nunn-Qian and Ashraf-Galor to assign different populations to the same country, but the differences can be huge. Online Appendix Figure&nbsp;<a href="#f1">1</a> reports the distribution of the ratio of Ashraf-Galor’s clones to Nunn-Qian’s for the Old World in 1500. This figure illustrates the great range in values for a given place and time that result from cloning the MJ regions. In Africa, this ratio ranges from .192 (Malawi) to .61 (Nigeria) through South Africa (1.003) to Congo (2.208) and Côte d’Ivoire (2.887).<a href="#fn21"><span>Footnote </span><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p> The disaggregation problems account for only one of two different sources of measurement error for hard clones. The first comes from MJ itself; MJ’s regional estimates are themselves noisy and rounded. Cloning assigns that noise to each of the country-level figures and adds additional error because we do not really know what the right allocations within a region should be. This additional disaggregation error is, by definition, negatively correlated for countries within a given MJ region and year. The cloned population estimates cannot be “correct.” The implications for change over time, however, are the same: every clone from a given region <em>must</em> grow at the same rate, the growth rate MJ assigned to the region. Breaking these regions up into observations does not create more information. It just creates clones.</p>
<div data-magellan-destination="s5-1" id="s5-1">
<h3> Econometric Implications of Hard Clones</h3>
<p> We cannot re-estimate earlier models using correct population data because that is obviously not available. The best check on the implications of cloning would be to dispense with the disaggregation and re-estimate the models using the units MJ reported. Since that check would require redefinition of all the other variables as well, it lies beyond the scope of this paper. We can, however, show that relying on clones significantly affects the results of published research. The following discussion only considers two cases and focuses on this issue alone. Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl4">4</a> considers the baseline results from Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>), which studies the old question of whether the potato’s introduction in the Old World caused population growth. The regressions use the population of all countries in the Old World at century intervals between 1000 and 1900, along with the years 1750 and 1850. The dependent variable is always population. Although they report and discuss other specifications, Nunn and Qian focus on models in which the regressor of interest is the interaction between an index of the fraction of a country’s land that is suitable for potato cultivation and a dummy for the years 1750 and later. They regard this interaction as a proxy for the effect of the potato’s actual introduction.<a href="#fn22"><span>Footnote </span><sup>22</sup></a> Every specification includes year and country fixed effects. Some models have no additional controls; we focus on models that include the “baseline” controls.</p>

</span></p>
</div>
<p> Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl4">4</a>, Column (1), reproduces the result from Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>, table IV, column (1)). As they stress, the interaction implies that the potato’s introduction increased population sizes in the years 1750 and later. When we drop the African clones (Column (2)), however, the point estimate (and the average marginal effect) are no longer significantly different from zero. Dropping all clones (Column (3)) does not produce this effect; the problem appears to be the African clones. On the other hand, if we drop all of Africa (Column (4)), the point estimate and average marginal effect (AME) become even smaller. Given that about three-quarters of the African observations are clones, it is difficult to know whether Africa in general does not fit the story or if there is something particular to African clones.</p>
<p> The next three specifications repeat (2)–(4) using Nunn and Qian’s data but use the Ashraf-Galor definition of clones. The results differ somewhat, but the overall message is the same. In this model, it does not matter how we construct the clones; dropping Africa’s clones, all clones, or all of Africa has the same effect as with Nunn and Qian’s definition. Table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl4">4</a> holds two lessons. First, the Nunn-Qian result depends critically on the inclusion of Africa or its clones. This may not hold for all of Nunn and Qian’s specifications, although Online Appendix Section 4 demonstrates the same problem in their fully flexible approach. Second, and more generally, in this example, it does not much matter how we construct the hard clones. This follows from including country-level fixed effects. Since identification comes from within-country change and since the clones, however constructed, all have the same growth rates as the regions from which they are disaggregated, in this type of model, the error created by cloning does not depend on how the clones are constructed.<a href="#fn23"><span>Footnote </span><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p> Fixed-effects models cannot cure measurement error in general, as I stressed earlier. Even the countries that are not clones in the Nunn-Qian or Ashraf-Galor datasets have rounding error plus the measurement error inherent in MJ’s guesses. This replication exercise makes a narrow and specific point. I have shown that first, Nunn and Qian’s results depend on including African observations that are really clones, and second, there is no important difference between the additional measurement error created by two different ways of creating hard clones.<a href="#fn24"><span>Footnote </span><sup>24</sup></a> Surely those who will rely on MJ in the future should at least dispense with the clones and use as their units of analysis the regions that appear in the population data.</p>

<h2> HOW ECONOMISTS USE MJ</h2>
<p> To obtain a more specific idea of how economists use these data, I examined every paper that cites MJ that was published in one of the “Top 5” economics journals through 2020.<a href="#fn25"><span>Footnote </span><sup>25</sup></a> I set aside many of these papers for the rest of this discussion. This list includes a few articles that cite MJ but do not use the data in econometric exercises. Shiue and Keller (<a href="#ref38"><span>Reference Shiue and Keller</span>2007</a>, p. 1194), for example, cite MJ and other authorities as implying that their two regions, China and Europe, had similar populations at the end of the eighteenth century. Rogers (<a href="#ref37"><span>Reference Rogers</span>1994</a>, p. 467) cites MJ to defend the assumption that long-term population growth rates were nearly zero until relatively recently. This usage seems consistent with the spirit in which MJ offer their estimates. I also set aside papers that only use MJ’s estimates for 1900 and later. By that date, the information MJ reports comes almost entirely from reasonable census reports (although they round even these figures). This includes articles such as Acemoğlu, Johnson, and Robinson (<a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Acemoğlu, Johnson and Robinson</span>2001</a>).<a href="#fn26"><span>Footnote </span><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p> A first question pertains to dates; the MJ data are more suspect in earlier periods. The year 1500 does not form a magical dividing line, but it is the earliest year for which we have anything like reliable estimates for populations of even most European countries, which tend to have the best-founded estimates. Several articles depend in a serious way on MJ’s population estimates from before 1500. Ashraf and Galor (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2011</a>) report econometric results that depend critically on population data from the years 1, 1000, and 1500. Population is the variable of interest in Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>), which starts with the year 1000. Nunn (<a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Nunn</span>2008</a>) uses the 1400 estimates alone.<a href="#fn27"><span>Footnote </span><sup>27</sup></a> Several other papers also rely on data from 1500–1800.</p>
<p> A second issue is whether MJ’s population figures form the dependent variable or a regressor. Many articles use population as the dependent variable, where it does least harm under the assumption of classical measurement error. These include Ashraf and Galor (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2011</a>, <a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2013</a>) and Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>).<a href="#fn28"><span>Footnote </span><sup>28</sup></a> In others, the MJ data scale the dependent variable. As noted previously, this means the measurement error in the dependent variable is not classical, and the estimates are biased in unpredictable ways. Acemoğlu, Johnson, and Robinson (<a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Acemoğlu, Johnson and Robinson</span>2005</a>)’s urbanization regressions are an example.</p>
<p> Some articles, however, create regressors from MJ’s estimates. This list includes Iyigun (<a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Iyigun</span>2008</a>) as well as Gennaioli and Voth (<a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Gennaioli and Voth</span>2015</a>). Iyigun (<a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Iyigun</span>2008</a>) studies whether military pressure from the Ottoman Empire helped reduce conflict among European states in the early-modern period. The econometric models rely on annual observations for the period 1450–1700. The dependent variables measure intra-European conflict. The controls include measures of Ottoman military pressure as well as the populations of Europe and, in some specifications, the Ottoman Empire’s. Iyigun (<a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Iyigun</span>2008</a>, p. 1476) describes the population data as a proxy for economic “size and strength.” The estimated effect for European population size is imprecisely estimated in most specifications, while the Ottoman population variable is more precisely estimated but switches signs, depending on the dependent variable. The point estimates for both population variables <em>must</em> be attenuated if this is classical measurement error, so we cannot really say whether Europe became more peaceful simply because of economic growth, nor can we assess the implications of Ottoman economic conditions for European conflict. Moreover, the estimates for his main variable of interest, the extent of Ottoman military incursions into Europe, may be biased because of the measurement error in population.</p>
<p> Gennaioli and Voth (<a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Gennaioli and Voth</span>2015</a>, table&nbsp;<a href="#tbl3">3</a>) address a related question, and their population figures cause similar trouble. They study the determinants of battle success in early-modern European conflicts. The authors set this up as a horse race between fiscal strength on the one hand and population size on the other. Greater fiscal strength allows a state to pay more mercenaries and support more allies. Population size could matter in early-modern war because larger populations make it easier to field larger armies. In most specifications, the fiscal variable has a positive and significant effect on battlefield success, while the relative populations of the two combatants have almost none. They conclude that “Differences in population size do not have a systematic effect on the chance of battlefield success” (Gennaioli and Voth <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Gennaioli and Voth</span>2015</a>, p. 1430). This result could reflect nothing more than the measurement error in MJ’s estimates.</p>
<p> A third issue pertains to how the authors confront the possibility of measurement error in the population data. Acemoğlu, Johnson, and Robinson (<a href="#ref3"><span>Reference Acemoğlu, Johnson and Robinson</span>2002</a>) and Acemoğlu et al. (2008) explicitly discuss measurement error and use IV methods to contend with measurement error in regressors. Others take a different approach. Ashraf and Galor (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Ashraf and Galor</span>2011</a>, p. 2011) claim:</p><p> The most comprehensive worldwide cross-country historical estimates of population and income per capita since the year 1 CE have been assembled by Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones (1978) and Angus Maddison (2003), respectively. Indeed, despite inherent problems of measurement associated with historical data, these sources remain unparalleled in providing comparable estimates across countries in the last 2,000 years and have, therefore, widely been regarded as standard sources for such data in the long-run growth literature.</p>
<p> They do not argue that MJ’s data meet any particular standard. Rather, they know of nothing better (it is “unparalleled”) and everyone else uses it (it is the “standard source in the long-run growth literature”).</p>
<p> Nunn and Qian (<a href="#ref49">2011</a>, p. 616) address measurement error more explicitly, but their discussion consists of general statements that are not relevant to the MJ data:</p><p> Accuracy is an obvious concern for historical data that span such a long time horizon and broad cross-section. However, classical measurement error in our outcome variables will not bias our regression estimates. Similarly, any systematic measurement error that varies by time-period or by country is captured by the country and year fixed effects, which are included in all specifications.</p>
<p> Population is their dependent variable, so they are correct that if the measurement error is classical, it does not bias their results. They provide no reason to think this is true, and, as noted, MJ say it is not true. The second statement about fixed effects is equally true but irrelevant to the case. Neither of these extreme assumptions is likely. Nor can they be true simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="s8" id="s8">
<h2> CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p> We know the population of the United States in 2020 to a high degree of accuracy. For historical episodes, we might not always do as well, but we can definitely do better than MJ. Palma, Reis, and Zhang (2020), for example, provide improved estimates for Portugal (1527–1850) by combining two sets of historical estimates with some judicious reasoning. Similar approaches may be possible for other times and places. Federico and Tena-Junguito (<a href="#ref20"><span>Reference Federico and Tena-Junguito</span>2022</a>) provide considerable improvement over MJ for the period since 1800 by making better use of published data. Earlier periods may require different approaches. Refining the estimates for Poland in 1400, for example, may not just require consulting more published works, but also original research using, for example, essentially archeological techniques. But it can be done. It would not be useful to assert that because we cannot know the population of Poland in 1400 with the same accuracy as we can in 2020, there is no point in using historical population counts. The opposite extreme is more common and pernicious: many economists take the view that the accuracy of historical data does not matter because it cannot be as precise as modern reports.</p>
<p> We can do, and have done, better. Consider one example. MJ’s estimates imply that the population of England and Wales grew at an average annual rate of .32 percent in the period 1600–1650. Wrigley and Schofield’s figures put that rate at .5 percent. For the period 1650–1700, the estimated growth rates are .26 in MJ and –0.07 in Wrigley and Schofield; for 1700–1750, they are .10 and .26. The differences are substantial. MJ missed the population stagnation of the second half of the seventeenth century and significantly understated the population growth of the first half of the eighteenth century. Population figures directly underlie, any statement about per-capita GDP or its growth rate and are thus central to understanding the Industrial Revolution. We can do much better than MJ’s guesses for many countries, especially in the period since 1500 (e.g., Vos <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Vos</span>2014</a>, pp. 366–69).</p>
<p> Econometric estimates that rely on MJ form a particular literature that takes a “cross-country regression” approach to economic growth, political economy, and related questions. Economists differ on the usefulness of the general research strategy, and those who favor such studies may insist that some data are better than none. Even those who take this view, however, should be aware of the pitfalls of the source and the way some use it. As I have noted, Acemoğlu and his co-authors tend to use MJ as carefully as one can. Others have compounded MJ’s weaknesses by trying to create information that is not in the source. Some of the research discussed here appeals to the idea that classical measurement error does not cause bias in linear models when the measurement error affects only the dependent variable. This observation is mathematically true but not relevant to the MJ data.</p>
<p> This paper documents a series of problems in a published source that underpins many articles published in the leading general-interest economics journals. Publication in these outlets has strong professional rewards and conveys signals. One signal is that if everyone does something inappropriate, then it is fine. A second signal discourages the original work necessary to improve the basis of our knowledge. The researchers who did the groundwork on which MJ is based understood themselves as contributing to a broader literature in the social sciences. Their contributions were rewarded within their own niches. The same applies to all of the effort that went into constructing the considerable information on historical economies that Maddison summarizes. To the extent the profession signals a lack of interest in such work, it is unlikely we will ever learn more about, for example, the population of Poland in 1400.</p>
<p> This discussion holds a simpler lesson. Many economists today download a dataset and merge it into other datasets without consulting the original sources. Examining MJ’s book is instructive. The introduction explains the problem of non-classical measurement error. A look at the graphs (such as my Figure&nbsp;<a href="#f1">1</a>) would lead most to treat the data with considerable caution. Anyone looking at MJ’s maps for Africa should wonder why their Africa has so many countries in the data.</p>

<p>The Costa Rican countryside showcases the interplay between farmlands and trees that serve as vital wildlife habitats in agricultural landscapes. Such landscapes underscore the importance of maintaining tree cover in farming areas, offering essential habitats for species outside of protected zones.<span> (Image credit: Nick Hendershot)</span></p>
</div>
<p>It seems intuitive that forests would provide better habitat for forest-dwelling wildlife than farms. Yet, in one of the longest-running studies of tropical wildlife populations in the world, Stanford researchers found that over 18 years, smaller farms with varying crop types – interspersed with patches or ribbons of forest – sustain many forest-dependent bird populations in Costa Rica, even as populations decline in forests.</p>
<p>In a paper published Sept. 4 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Nicholas Hendershot and colleagues compared trends in specific bird populations across three landscape types in Costa Rica: forests, diversified farms, and intensive agriculture. The steepest declines were found in forests, then in intensive agriculture (and the species succeeding in intensive agriculture were often invasive). But on diversified farms, a significant subset of bird species typically found in forests, including some of conservation concern, actually increased over time.</p>
<p>“Birds are kind of a proxy we use to track the health of ecosystems. And the birds we’re seeing today aren’t the same as we saw 18 to 20 years ago. This paper really documents this pattern,” said Hendershot, a postdoctoral fellow at the time of this research in Stanford’s Department of Biology in the <a href="https://humsci.stanford.edu/">School of Humanities and Sciences (H&amp;S)</a>, the Stanford <a href="https://ccb.stanford.edu/">Center for Conservation Biology</a> (CCB), and the Stanford-based <a href="https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/">Natural Capital Project</a> (NatCap).</p>
<h2>Food security at stake</h2>
<p>While this research implies that diversified farming could be key for biodiversity, the relationship goes both ways: biodiversity is key for food security. In this case, that means having a variety of types of birds feeding on insects and helping to pollinate crops.</p>
<p>“Identity does seem to matter a lot for pest control and other ecosystem services birds provide. These species are not interchangeable,” said Hendershot.</p>
<p>“We need a constant stream of pollinators servicing farms. About three-quarters of the world’s crops require pollinators to some extent, and that 75% is our most nutritious food – think of all the vitamins and minerals packed into fruits, nuts, and veggies,” explained <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/gretchen-daily">Gretchen Daily</a>,&nbsp;<span>faculty director of NatCap</span> <span>and CCB, Bing Professor of Environmental Science in H&amp;S,</span> <span>and a senior author on the paper</span>. “We need a constant stream of birds, bats, and other wildlife to help control pests: they suppress the vast majority naturally. And we need to start building flood protection, water purification, carbon storage, and many other vital benefits back into agricultural landscapes, way beyond what can be achieved in protected areas alone.”</p>
<p>Daily also noted that, in terms of food production, diversified farms are not necessarily lower yielding than intensive agriculture. “This is a recent assumption that is being overturned,” she said.</p>

<h2>Beyond protected areas</h2>
<p>It has become increasingly apparent around the world that while protected areas remain critical, they are too few and far between to provide the ecosystem services people and nature need to thrive. Working landscapes are crucial now for preserving biodiversity and its benefits. “People, including scientists, had the idea that farmland would not support a meaningful amount of biodiversity,” said Daily. In this case, not only are diversified farms themselves providing habitat, they connect otherwise fragmented forested areas.</p>

<p>Over time, Hendershot said, “I have moved away from the ‘fortress conservation’ model, which focused more on creating protected areas separate from human activities, and see more and more how much potential there is outside of forests. The forests are key – we need them, of course. But in addition to that, I’m always surprised by how important <em>how </em>you manage a farm is for biodiversity.”</p>
<p>“We believe the findings of our research are new to science, but in a sense, it merely confirms what Indigenous communities around the world have already known for a long time, which is that humans can and should have reciprocal relationships with the rest of the local ecological community they are part of,” said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/tadashi-fukami">Tadashi Fukami</a>, a professor of biology in H&amp;S and of Earth system science in the <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/">Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability</a>&nbsp;and a co-author of the paper.</p>
<h2>Incentivizing farmers</h2>
<p>In the 1980s and 90s, deforestation was occurring in Costa Rica at the fastest rate ever seen on a country scale. Then, they turned it around – becoming a renowned model of success. By setting up the world’s first countrywide payment for ecosystem services (PES) program, Costa Rica reversed this trend: today, forests cover almost 60% of its land, up from 40% in 1987.</p>
<p>The country currently aims to double the amount of protected forest in just a few years. In its existing PES program, any landowner can receive money for reforesting even small parts of their land. Now, the government is also working toward a new PES program to incentivize farmers to adopt best management practices.</p>
<p>This study will help inform Costa Rican policymakers in understanding the benefits provided over time by different farming practices. Said Daily, “We need to recognize the vital work many farmers are doing that supports biodiversity.”</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: In Which I Learn About the Various Divisions of the District 
Court of the State of Maryland</h3><b><i>Thursday, November 19, 1998:</i></b> 
It's an ordinary day. I get home from work, picking up the mail as I walk toward 
my house.&nbsp; I notice that the return address on one of the letters is the 
District Court of the State of Maryland. As I walk up the front steps, I think, 
"I just did jury duty last year; they can't be asking me to serve again so soon, 
can they?"&nbsp; After I settle in at home, I open the letter and read, "You 
have been summoned to appear as a defendant in a trial..."&nbsp;&nbsp; My first 
thought is that someone is suing me for something, but then I see at the top of 
the page 'State of Maryland vs. Sammel, Judith Lynne', and realize that this 
isn't a<b><i> person</i></b> suing me.&nbsp; My second thought is that I've 
gotten a parking ticket that blew off of my windshield and has gone unpaid, or 
maybe a speeding ticket from the traffic cameras I've heard about.&nbsp; It's 
too late to call the Court to see what the case is about, so I have to wait 
until the next day. 
<p>The next morning,&nbsp; I call the telephone number that's printed on the 
letter, and a recording says something like "press 1 for Civil Division, 2 for 
Traffic Division, 3 for Criminal Division, 4 for information about specific 
cases," etc.&nbsp; I choose the option for information about specific cases, and 
the person who answers the phone asks me to read her the case number.&nbsp; 
After I read it, I hear her say, "Just a minute.&nbsp; Let me transfer you to 
the Criminal Division." 
</p><p>"Whaaaaaaaaat?" I ask, but it's too late.&nbsp; I'm on hold. 
</p><p>Someone else picks up the phone, and again I read the case number and ask 
what the case is about. 
</p><p>"Cable fraud, " she replies. <br>
</p><hr>

<h3>Chapter 2: In Which Comcast Cablevision's Administrative Offices in 
Baltimore are Informed that "At Home" is More Than Just "A Place They'd Rather 
Be Than At The Office"</h3>Unfortunately, I think I know what the problem 
is.&nbsp; I had signed up for Comcast@home cable modem service last March, but 
had not signed up for cable TV service.&nbsp; (Last time I checked, this was 
legal.&nbsp; In fact, it is mentioned specifically as a service in the FAQ list 
on @home's web site.)&nbsp; But, when they came to install my @home service, 
they had neglected to install the filter (they call it a video trap) to filter 
out the video signal&nbsp; from reaching my home.&nbsp; (I live in a townhouse 
community, and there is a "pedestal" containing cable connections for several 
houses--this is a few houses away from mine.)&nbsp; The installers had told me 
that they would return to install the video trap, and that I could enjoy cable 
TV service until they came back to do so--they said I should consider it an 
incentive to sign up for the service.&nbsp; Well, they never came back to 
install the video trap. 
<p>Then, in early June, my @home service stopped working.&nbsp; I made several 
calls to Comcast Cablevision and Comcast@home customer service.&nbsp; Each 
claimed that it was the responsibility of the other to determine what the 
problem was, and fix it.&nbsp; During my conversations with Comcast Cablevision 
and Comcast@home, I told them both that nobody had come back to install the 
video trap.&nbsp; Finally, Comcast@home agreed to come out and see what the 
problem was.&nbsp; I told them that they should bring a video trap with them 
when they came to repair the service.&nbsp; Because of their schedule and my 
vacation schedule, they didn't come out to repair the service until late 
June.&nbsp; The repair technician, when he arrived, said that the reason that my 
@home service stopped working was that someone had disconnected the cable in the 
cable "pedestal" on my street.&nbsp; He said that it was likely that Comcast 
Cablevision personnel had done this, not realizing that I had Comcast@home 
service. When he'd reconnected my service,&nbsp; I asked him about the 
installation of the video trap.&nbsp; He said he hadn't brought one with him, 
but would take care of it later.&nbsp; Again, nobody came back to install the 
device. 
</p><p>So, after I receive this letter from the District Court, I figure that 
Comcast Cablevision has been out to my neighborhood and has seen that I was 
connected up again (and again not realized that I had Comcast@home cable modem 
service.)&nbsp; I call the administrative offices of Comcast Cablevision here in 
Baltimore, and explain the situation.&nbsp; They say that they will have 
Comcast's attorneys call me to discuss it.&nbsp; I also make the suggestion that 
they come out and install a video trap on my line so that this won't happen 
again.&nbsp; They assure me they will send someone out that day to do it.&nbsp; 
I get home fairly late that evening and find that the video trap hasn't been 
installed.&nbsp; Since the Comcast administrative offices are closed by this 
time, I call @home customer service. I call at 10:30 PM and remain on hold until 
11:15 PM, at which time a customer service representative takes the call. When I 
ask about getting a video trap placed on the line, his first response is that 
Comcast, not @home, should take care of that, and I should call Comcast customer 
service.&nbsp; I explain to him that, based on my prior experience with Comcast 
customer service, if I call them, the following situation will likely occur: 
</p><ul>
  <li>the Comcast customer service representative will ask for my Comcast 
  account number 
  </li><li>I will reply that I have none, since I am only a Comcast@home customer, 
  not a Comcast cable TV customer 
  </li><li>the service representative will tell me they can't do anything for me, and 
  I will have to call @home customer service </li></ul>He then agrees to talk to 
his supervisor.&nbsp; He returns to the line to tell me that he will place a 
work order for a video trap to be placed on the line. <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 3: In Which I Wait Not-So-Patiently for Comcast's Attorney to 
Call,&nbsp; and for the Video Trap to be Installed</h3><b><i>Saturday, November 
21, 1998:</i></b> After I place two calls to their offices, Comcast's attorney 
who is assigned to my case returns my call to assure me that the criminal 
charges will be dropped. I mention that the video trap wasn't installed the 
previous day. 
<p><b><i>Sunday, November 22, 1998:</i></b> As of&nbsp; Sunday morning, neither 
Comcast nor @home has arrived to place a video trap on the line.&nbsp; I call 
Comcast customer service to ask about the status of this, and am initially told 
that since I am not a Comcast cable TV customer, I have to call @home to resolve 
any problems.&nbsp; I explain that the situation is related to criminal charges 
that Comcast has filed against me, and ask the account executive to try to find 
a way to assist me from her location.&nbsp;&nbsp; She asks for my name and 
address.&nbsp; I give it to her, and she comes back on the line after a few 
moments and says that the only name she has listed at that address is that of 
former occupants of my home (from1989-1992).&nbsp; I explain again that I am not 
a Comcast cable TV customer, but only a Comcast@home customer, so there would 
likely not be a record of my name, unless she has records of Comcast@home 
customers as well as Comcast cable TV customers.&nbsp; She again asks me to hold 
the line.&nbsp; When she returns, she says that she has checked into the 
situation with @home, and has found out that the video trap was not placed on 
the line because the part is out of stock.&nbsp; She says that when parts are 
shipped, they will send an installer out to put it in.&nbsp; She says that in 
the meantime, I cannot be held responsible for the signal coming into my home. 
</p><p><b><i>Tuesday, November 24, 1998:</i></b> Comcast's attorney leaves a message 
on my answering machine saying: "I withdrew...did a request to withdraw those 
charging documents" .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will soon find out the hard way that 
the "withdrew...did a request to withdraw" wording actually means 
something--Comcast doesn't have the ability to get criminal charges dropped on 
their own, even though they're the ones who got the court to file them in the 
first place.&nbsp; Once the charges are "in the system", Comcast can only 
<b><i>request</i></b> that this be done. <br>
</p><hr>

<h3>Chapter 4: In Which A Police Officer Serves Me With&nbsp; A Criminal Summons 
in Front of an Out-of-Town Houseguest on the Eve of 
Thanksgiving</h3><b><i>Wednesday, November 25, 1998:</i></b> A uniformed police 
officer drives up to my house in his police cruiser and delivers the summons to 
me; it shows 4 counts of cable fraud, with the possibility of 6 months in jail 
on each count.&nbsp; I had always wondered why, when someone commits what 
appears to be a single crime, you hear things about being charged with "10 
counts" of something-or-other. In my case, Comcast's visit in June (when they 
cut off my service) was 2 counts--one for cable having been fraudulently hooked 
up, one for fraudulent receipt of service; and a subsequent visit they made in 
July, during which they saw that service had been reconnected, was again 2 
counts.&nbsp; I try to tell the police officer what Comcast's attorney has told 
me to tell him--that the charges are being dropped, and that he should call her 
to verify this--but he could care less about this--he just wants a signature on 
the papers and wants to leave.&nbsp; A friend of mine, who has driven up from 
Virginia to spend the holiday weekend with me, is sitting nearby in my kitchen 
watching this sorry event; it's a really humiliating experience. Anyway, by the 
end of the day, I find that the video trap has finally been installed on the 
line. <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 5:&nbsp; In Which I Come to the Conclusion that Lady Justice is Not 
Just Blindfolded, But Actually Blind</h3><b><i>Monday, November 30, 
1998:</i></b>&nbsp; I telephone the State's Attorney's office to see if they 
have received and processed Comcast's request to withdraw the charges.&nbsp; 
They tell me that it has been received, and that the State's Attorney's office 
has disapproved Comcast's request.&nbsp; They tell me that no reason for the 
disapproval was supplied. I begin to feel like a character in a Kafka 
novel.&nbsp; I call Comcast's administrative offices in Baltimore and tell them 
that the State's Attorney has denied the request to withdraw charges.&nbsp; 
"They can't do that!" the employee that I speak to exclaims.&nbsp; "Well, 
obviously they can, because...they have," I reply. <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 6: In Which I Determine That an Excellent Way to Pique Someone's 
Curiosity is to Ask, "Do You Have any Recommendations for a Good Criminal 
Defense Attorney?"</h3>No chapter here, but it's too good of a title to pass 
up.&nbsp; Actually, I am told by some colleagues who are attorneys that even in 
a cut-and-dried case like this, I should expect to pay $750 or $1000 for an 
attorney if I need to mount a defense in court. <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 7: In Which I Find Out that the Attorney for Comcast Actually Does 
Have a Sense of Humor</h3>I speak with the Comcast attorney about my call to 
State's Attorney's office. She says she was unaware that State's Attorney has 
denied the request to drop the charges, and that she will write another letter 
to ensure that the situation is taken care of.&nbsp; She also asks about whether 
the video trap has been installed and is working correctly. I tell her that 
everything is blocked except for 2 religious channels, 1 Spanish language 
channel, and the video portion of E! TV.&nbsp; She says something along the 
lines of, "I guess the signal of the Lord manages to find its way through 
somehow." <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 8:&nbsp; In Which I Learn That the Cable TV Franchising Authority is 
Willing to Handle Complaints About Cable TV Issues--But Only Up To a Point</h3>A 
friend of mine had suggested that I find out who the Franchising Authority for 
cable television in Baltimore County is, and that I ask them to assist in the 
getting the problem resolved. I find out that the Baltimore County Council is 
the local Franchising Authority. On November 30, I call the County Council's 
offices and speak to an employee who is assigned to handle cable television 
issues. I explain the situation; she says she will check into it. On December 
1,&nbsp; I speak to her again, and she says she had gotten in touch with the 
Assistant to the VP at Comcast Cablevision of Baltimore, and he will call her 
back with information.&nbsp; On December 3, when I speak to her again, she says 
that the assistant to the VP had assured her that Comcast is working on the 
problem. She is satisfied with this answer, and encourages me to "call her back 
to let her know when the problem's been resolved".&nbsp; It's nice to know that 
the employees of our local elected officials are really concerned about taking 
such a proactive role in ensuring that the problems of constituents are handled 
effectively. <br>
<hr>

<h3>&nbsp;Chapter 9:&nbsp; Boy, Do I Feel Like A Criminal</h3><b><i>Thursday, 
December 3, 1998:</i></b>&nbsp; One of the other Comcast&nbsp; attorneys calls 
me to say that the only person at the State's Attorney's office who can take 
care of the situation is an Assistant State's Attorney who is the Chief of the 
District Court Division, and that he has been out of the office all week.&nbsp; 
The attorney gives me the phone number, and tells me I can try to reach him 
myself.&nbsp; I call the number a few times during the day, and am alternately 
told that he is out of the office, or that "you're not allowed to call the 
State's Attorney, you're a defendant!".&nbsp; I leave a message for him, but it 
is not returned. 
<p>Also,&nbsp; around this time, I have a bizarre discussion with the 
Comcast&nbsp; attorney to try to find out why the State's Attorney disapproved 
the request to withdraw the charges.&nbsp; She explains that procedurally, they 
cannot withdraw the charges once the trial date has been set, and the summons 
has been served.&nbsp; She tells me that I should have "avoided being 
served".&nbsp; I never thought I'd ever get myself into a situation where I had 
to make a point of avoiding process servers. Anyway, it's true that the trial 
date had already been set (it was set on the same day Comcast applied for the 
Statement of Charges, November 17, 1998).&nbsp; But, the summons was not served 
to me until Wednesday, November 25.&nbsp; The State's Attorney disapproved the 
request for withdrawal of the charges on Tuesday, November 24, the day before I 
was served.&nbsp; So, either the State's Attorney's office doesn't know its own 
procedures, doesn't bother to follow them, or perhaps there's something more 
nefarious going on; I'm still not sure. <br>
</p><hr>

<h3>Chapter 10: In Which I Get To Speak With Sandra O'Connor's 
Second-In-Command</h3><b><i>Friday, December 4, 1998:</i></b> No, not 
<b><i>that</i></b> Sandra O'Connor.&nbsp; Baltimore County has its own, local, 
Sandra O'Connor.&nbsp; She's the State's Attorney (an elected official) and I've 
actually voted for her.&nbsp; I speak with her Deputy for Operations. Since he's 
responsible for the overseeing the District Court Division, he's the one that 
the Chief of the District Court Division reports to. I explain that Comcast said 
that the Chief of the District Court Division was the only one who could take 
care of the situation, but that he's been unavailable for several days.&nbsp; I 
ask the Deputy for Operations if he can take care of the situation in his 
employee's absence. He tells me no--that I should wait until his employee 
returns on the following Monday. He tells me that there is nothing in my file to 
show that Comcast has done anything related to the case since November 24, and 
that, if Comcast has promised to get the charges dismissed,&nbsp; I should be 
"on them" to take care of it. <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 11: In Which I Get to Sit and Stew About This for Another Weekend 
Because the Only Person on Earth Who Can Apparently Take Care of this Situation 
is Either in Training, on Vacation, or Simply Out of the Office, Depending Upon 
Whom You Talk To</h3><b><i>December 5-6, 1998:</i></b> My demeanor begins to 
degrade into "don't get mad, get even" mode. I do some research on what the 
elements of a case of malicious prosecution are. (And, of course, I can do all 
of my research over the Internet--at cable modem speeds.)&nbsp; Paraphrasing one 
article that I read, the elements are: <br>1.&nbsp; The people that you sue for 
malicious prosecution have to be the one that got charges filed against you in 
the first place. <br>2.&nbsp; The case has to have been decided in your favor, 
in one way or another. <br>3.&nbsp; There has to have been a lack of probable 
cause. <br>4.&nbsp; There has to have been malice. <br>5.&nbsp; There have to be 
damages. 
<p>Although "malice" in this situation might be hard to prove, one article 
published on the subject asserts that malice can be implied from a lack of 
probable cause, and from inadequate investigation and research.&nbsp; "Lack of 
probable cause" might also be difficult to prove here, but I believe that a good 
lawyer could argue that the fact that "cables have been connected and Comcast 
Cablevision was not the one who connected them" is no longer acceptable as 
probable cause, now that Comcast Cablevision has given @home (or its local 
affiliate, Comcast Online Communications) the authority to connect them. <br>
</p><hr>

<h3>Chapter 12: Things Finally Start Falling Into Place</h3><b><i>December 7, 
1998:</i></b>&nbsp; I leave a voice mail message for the General Counsel at 
Comcast's Corporate Headquarters in Philadelphia telling him I'm unhappy with 
the way the situation is being handled, and that I'm considering filing a case 
in civil court for malicious prosecution. I receive a conciliatory call back 
from him, and also from one of the local Comcast attorneys telling me that the 
situation is being taken care of promptly.&nbsp; I finally get a call from the 
Chief of the District Court Division of the State's Attorney's office saying 
they will "nol pros" the case.&nbsp; It's great; I'm getting to learn some Latin 
while I'm at it.&nbsp; "Nol pros" is short for "nolle prosequi", which is Latin 
for "I will not prosecute."&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe it's taken over two 
weeks just to get a verbal agreement from the State's Attorney not to prosecute 
a case that everyone involved clearly agrees was based on a Comcast error. 
<p><b><i>December 12, 1998:</i></b> I receive a courtesy copy of a letter from 
the State's Attorney to the Judge, requesting that the trial date be moved up, 
and saying that they intend to nol pros. 
</p><p><b><i>December 22, 1998:</i></b>&nbsp; I call the District Court, and find 
out that the Judge has moved the trial date up to January 12, 1999, instead of 
the original date, which was in March 1999. <br>
</p><hr>

<h3>Chapter 13:&nbsp; In Which I Get an Unsolicited Letter From a Local Criminal 
Defense Attorney</h3><b><i>December 30, 1998:</i></b>&nbsp; I come home from 
work to find another interesting letter in my mailbox; this time it's from a 
local criminal defense attorney.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reads, "Dear Ms. Sammel,&nbsp; 
When you are charged with a criminal offense, not only can your freedom and 
liberty be taken away, a criminal record can affect you the rest of your 
life."&nbsp; The attorney then proceeds to offer his services, and even provides 
me with a handy little reminder card with my trial date stamped on it.&nbsp; 
Great.&nbsp; I guess that since the court's records are considered public 
documents, anyone can come in and get copies of them.&nbsp; I'm afraid to think 
about what kinds of mailing lists I could end up on as a result of this.&nbsp; 
Will I start receiving notices asking me if I want to subscribe to <b><i>Prison 
Life</i></b> magazine? <br>
<hr>

<h3>Chapter 14:&nbsp; In Which I Go to the Trial "Just In Case"</h3>Although 
I've been told by Comcast that I don't need to show up in court on the trial 
date, I've never received notice from the District Court about this.&nbsp; And, 
considering that the last paperwork I received from the court said "a warrant 
for your arrest may be issued" if you don't show up at your trial, I decide it 
would be best to show up anyway. 
<p><b><i>January 12, 1999: </i></b>Just when I'm starting to think that 
Comcast's motto has been morphed&nbsp; into "Comcast--Everything You Convict 
With", the court appearance is pretty uneventful.&nbsp; I show up at 8:30 along 
with about a dozen other people who are involved in other cases in the same 
courtroom that morning. According to the list outside the courtroom, it looks 
like there are a couple of theft cases and a couple of drug cases on the 
schedule.&nbsp; I'm actually starting to look forward to an interesting morning 
in court, hearing about all of this stuff, but the State's Attorney calls my 
case first.&nbsp; I start walking up to the Defendant's table, and hear the 
State's Attorney say that he's entering a nol pros.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just 
reached the table when the judge says,&nbsp; "your case is dismissed, you're 
free to go," and so I turn back around and leave the courtroom. <br>

<h3>Chapter 15: In Which The Assembled Readership Gets To Find Out That I Never 
Got Sent To Jail, But Just Got Threatened With The Possibility Of&nbsp; 
It</h3>Sorry to disappoint those of you who were looking forward to hearing 
about that part. 
<p>I gave the "malicious prosecution" scenario a thought, but I'm not really a 
lawsuit kind of person.&nbsp; Unless I find out that Comcast has been involved 
in a pattern of cases like these without regard to the consequences, I don't 
intend to follow up on filing a malicious prosecution lawsuit.&nbsp; Besides, if 
I want to get my criminal record expunged, it looks like I will need to sign a 
waiver absolving them of liability for this incident.&nbsp; I am hoping, 
however, that Comcast will reimburse me for the $30 fee involved in getting my 
record expunged. <br>
</p><hr>

<h3>Epilogue:</h3>Although everyone I dealt with seemed apologetic, and willing 
to help get this fairly outrageous situation taken care of, I believe that there 
are still some problems that Comcast and @Home management need to address.&nbsp; 
For that reason, I decided to write to the Presidents of both companies, and ask 
them to respond to several issues.&nbsp; A copy of the letter is below: <br>

January 13, 1999 
</p><p>Brian L. Roberts <br>President, Comcast Corporation <br>1500 Market Street 
<br>Philadelphia PA 19102 
</p><p>Thomas A. Jermoluk <br>President,&nbsp; @Home Network <br>425 Broadway Street 
<br>Redwood City, CA 94063 
</p><p>Dear Messrs. Roberts and Jermoluk: 
</p><p>&nbsp;I am a Comcast@home cable modem subscriber (sammel@home.com) who is not 
concurrently a subscriber of Comcast cable television.&nbsp; Because of what I 
believe to be insufficient action by each of your companies, and insufficient 
coordination between them, I was recently criminally charged with cable fraud in 
the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County ("State of Maryland vs. 
Sammel, Judith Lynne", case number 5C00097816).&nbsp; I was charged because: 
</p><ul>
  <li>@Home installation and repair technicians failed to install protective 
  measures to block out the cable television signal when both installing and 
  repairing my cable modem service, and failed to mark the connection inside the 
  cable "pedestal" that serves my home to indicate that it was a valid @Home 
  connection; and, 
  </li><li>Comcast Cablevision did not bother to check the records of&nbsp; the @Home 
  Network to see if I was a subscriber of cable modem service before filing an 
  application for a criminal summons, after they saw that the cable wires 
  serving my home were connected. </li></ul>&nbsp;Although, after a review of the 
facts of the situation, Comcast Cablevision convinced the State's Attorney to 
enter a "nolle prosequi" (a decision not to prosecute) in this case, I am 
requesting that both of your companies review their procedures for handling 
Comcast@home subscribers who are not concurrently Comcast cable television 
subscribers, to ensure that this situation does not happen to anyone else.&nbsp; 
I would appreciate if you would both respond to me concerning the following 
issues: 
<blockquote>
  <li>What are the procedures used to mark the cable connections of 
  non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of Comcast@home to ensure that Comcast 
  technicians are aware that the connection is a valid Comcast@home connection? 
  How do you assure that these procedures are being followed? 
  </li><li>Who is responsible for installing protective measures to block out the 
  cable television signal on the lines of non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of 
  Comcast@home, and how do you assure that these protective measures are being 
  properly installed? 
  </li><li>I would like request that procedures be put in place, so that prior to 
  submitting a request to any court of law to file criminal charges for cable 
  fraud,&nbsp; Comcast Cablevision will check the records of the @Home Network 
  to see if the individual to be charged is a valid customer of 
  Comcast@home.&nbsp; I am also asking the Administrative Commissioner of the 
  District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County (who will be receiving a 
  courtesy copy of this letter) to ensure that these procedures are followed 
  prior to the issuing of any summons for cable fraud in our county.&nbsp; 
  Perhaps the Court could require some type of affirmation that this check of 
  @Home's customer records has been performed prior to determining that there is 
  "probable cause" for a summons to be issued in any cable fraud case.&nbsp; I 
  firmly believe that if Comcast Cablevision has given @Home technicians the 
  authority to connect/modify cable connections, they also need to accept some 
  responsibility for having done so, and not automatically assume that any lines 
  that Comcast Cablevision has not connected themselves have been fraudulently 
  connected by the homeowner. 
  </li><li>I would like to request that procedures be put in place by Comcast 
  Cablevision customer support so that the records of non-cable-TV-subscriber 
  customers of Comcast@home are available to them, and that they may be able to 
  respond to customer service calls related&nbsp; to the physical cable 
  connections of Comcast@home customers (instead of insisting that only @Home 
  customer support can handle these requests.) 
  </li><li>I would like to request that procedures be put in place by both Comcast 
  Cablevision and Comcast@home customer support, so that they are each fully 
  aware of what their respective company's responsibilities are with regard to 
  non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of Comcast@home. </li></blockquote>I would 
like to note that every Comcast Cablevision and Comcast@home customer service 
representative I have spoken with has been extremely courteous, has seemed 
knowledgeable, and has conscientiously attempted to assist me within the bounds 
of what their positions allowed them to do.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that 
the problem is more of a "systemic" one, that can only be addressed from a 
management level; this is why I am asking both of you to ensure that this never 
happens to anyone again.&nbsp; In addition, I am requesting an apology for the 
unfortunate situation which has occurred. 
<p>Please contact me at your earliest convenience to inform me about how each of 
the issues listed above is being addressed.&nbsp; My mailing address and e-mail 
address are listed above, and my telephone numbers are [deleted]. 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3>Acknowledgments:</h3>Thanks very much to attorneys S.A., S.B. (and her 
colleague H.), C.E., R.G. and B.H., who provided me with assorted legal advice. 
(Although, I imagine that "pro bono cable fraud work" won't really add much 
substance to your résumés.)&nbsp; I'd also like to offer thanks to various 
friends and colleagues who assisted me with such useful comments as, "we promise 
we'll visit you in jail," and to my 'unindicted coconspirator' S.R. for 
convincing me to get cable modem service in the first place. <br>

<br><span color="#ff0000"><b><span size="+2">Update</span></b>:</span> 
<p><b><i>25 January 1999:</i></b>&nbsp; I received a nice letter from Comcast's 
Baltimore Metro area Vice President, and the local General Manager of Comcast 
Online <br>apologizing for these events, and outlining the steps they've taken 
to make sure this doesn't happen again.&nbsp; They now have a procedure to note 
@Home subscribers without cable TV service in their cable service billing 
system, and have added some checks and balances to ensure that their cable fraud 
investigators will be able to identify this type of situation in the 
future.&nbsp; This is a welcome change from the initial conversations I had with 
Comcast's attorney about this issue, where she insisted that no change in 
procedures was necessary, other than to ensure that the Comcast Online 
installers installed video traps in all installations where it's warranted. They 
graciously offered to pay the Court processing fees to get my record expunged, 
but I haven't gotten around to filling out the paperwork yet.&nbsp; Since the 
court told me that it can take up to 120 days for the paperwork to go through 
one it's filed, I'm not in such a great hurry anyway. 
</p><p><b><i>31 January 1999: </i></b>The <b><i>Multichannel News</i></b> felt that 
this story was worth publishing in the February 1, 1999 edition of their 
magazine (on the front page, even!)&nbsp; They snarfed my title, too.&nbsp; They 
gave me permission to repost the articles on my web site: '<a href="http://members.home.net/sammel/mcnarticle1.htm">Get a Cable Modem...Go to 
Jail'</a>&nbsp; and <a href="http://members.home.net/sammel/mcnarticle2.htm">Sammel's Tale of @Jail</a> 
. 
</p><p><b><i>2 February 1999:</i></b>&nbsp; I got home from work and found two notes 
attached to my door.&nbsp; One was another letter of apology from the Baltimore 
Metro Area VP and the local Comcast Online General Manager, saying that they 
plan to extend my @home service for a year at no charge, along with a $50.00 
gift certificate from Bibelot (my favorite bookstore!) The second was a 
handwritten note--they had apparently come by to deliver this in person, but I 
wasn't home.&nbsp; This is a very nice gesture; I appreciate it very much. 
</p><p>Does it make me feel bad for having contacted <b><i>Multichannel 
News</i></b>?&nbsp; No; not at all--for two reasons: 
</p><ul>
  <li>Although Comcast made every effort to get this taken care of after I 
  contacted them about the summons back in November--the bottom line is that 
  <i>this never should have happened</i>.&nbsp; There were people at Comcast who 
  knew last June (at least) that the lack of communication between the cable TV 
  folks and the cable modem folks was causing problems.&nbsp; It just never made 
  it high enough on anyone's radar screen to do anything about it. 
  </li><li>I went to Multichannel News rather than a general-audience publication 
  because I wanted to try to reach the folks at Shaw, Cox, TCI, Rogers, and Road 
  Runner (and its associated cable partners) to get them thinking about whether 
  the same problems could exist at their operations. </li></ul><b><i>4 February 
1999: </i></b>I got a humorous surprise when I got home from work.&nbsp; I had 
asked Multichannel News if they could send me a copy of the print edition of 
their publication, and it arrived in today's mail.&nbsp; I found out that not 
only was my saga featured on the front page and the op-ed section, but there was 
a wonderful <a href="http://members.home.net/ccb/cartoon.htm">cartoon</a> to go 
with it. 
<p><b><i>7 February 1999:</i></b>&nbsp; Since <b><i>Multichannel News</i></b> 
updated their on-line edition,&nbsp; I changed&nbsp; the references for the 
articles they published about this case (see 31 January 1999 entry) to point to 
my reposts of their articles, instead.&nbsp; Also, since the print version of 
Mike Farrell's article in last week's edition had some text missing, they've 
reprinted the article in the February 8, 1999 print edition. All of the articles 
are searchable in Multichannel's archives available from their <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/">home page</a>. 
</p><p><b><i>16 February 1999:</i></b>&nbsp; It appears that "Broadband Bob" picked 
up my story and published a brief version to their mailing list, and on their <a href="http://www.catv.org/bbb-report/">web page</a>.&nbsp; Also, a Brazilian has 
written an <a href="http://www.geocities.com/WallStreet/Exchange/8822/Noticias/1999/news0199.html">article</a> 
in Portugese based on Mike Farrell's article in Multichannel News. 
</p><p>I had a problem last Friday (February 12) with my cable modem service.&nbsp; 
Everything was proceeding at a snail's pace--mail, news, web-browsing.&nbsp; It 
continued for several hours, so I called to see if there was a problem in our 
area, or if they knew what might be wrong.&nbsp; They tried some troubleshooting 
(Tier 1 and Tier 2), and they said there was an RF problem with my connection, 
and they'd need to send someone out to look at it. The first time they had 
available was Monday (yesterday).&nbsp; They said "9:00 AM with a 4 hour window" 
for their arrival time.&nbsp; At 1:40 PM, a technician showed up.&nbsp; He did 
some testing at the cable modem (found a very weak signal), then at the 
connection where the cable enters my house (again, a weak signal), and then at 
the "pedestal" out on the street (again a weak signal--he said it was likely 
weak because there were <b><i>two</i></b> video traps on my line.&nbsp; I don't 
know this for sure, but I strongly suspect that the Comcast@home folks still had 
the "order on the books" for the video trap to be placed (see Chapter 3 above), 
and did not get the word that one had already been installed by Comcast 
Cablevision; so they came by to install another one.&nbsp; (So, not only don't 
the two organizations talk to each other, but they don't even recognize each 
other's handiwork?)&nbsp; So, he removed one of the video traps, and the signal 
started coming through strongly, and my service resumed immediately.&nbsp; I 
told him I wanted to make sure he didn't remove both video traps.&nbsp; He 
seemed curious why I was concerned about that, so I showed him the court 
documents, and told him I wanted to prevent a recurrence of the bizarre 
situation I found myself in last November.&nbsp; He said he couldn't believe 
that something like that had actually happened.&nbsp; (Join the crowd!) 
</p><p>Keep the cards and letters (well...the e-mails) coming.&nbsp; One person has 
suggested that I post the titles of the books I purchased with the gift 
certificate Comcast gave me, in the hopes that I bought some books that were 
apropos to the issue at hand.&nbsp; Honestly, I hadn't thought of that when I 
was book shopping, so I didn't specifically look for books that might be 
pertinent (Is there a "Malicious Prosecution for Dummies" book out?)&nbsp; The 
books I got were:&nbsp; <i>The Pillars of Hercules</i>, by Paul Theroux (a 
travelogue of his trip through the Mediterranean); <i>Getting A Life</i>, by 
Blix/Heitmiller (financial and personal strategies for voluntary simplicity); 
<i>The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Home Repair, </i>by David Tenenbaum; and, <i>The 
Argument Culture: Stopping America's War of Words</i>, by Deborah Tannen (of 
<i>You Just Don't Understand</i> fame).&nbsp; Fairly boring--sorry to disappoint 
you. 
</p><p>I mailed all the paperwork to the District Court to get my criminal record 
expunged.&nbsp; It included the "General Waiver and Release" which says that I 
release and discharge Comcast and the Baltimore County Police "and any and all 
other persons" for any claims I may have for wrongful conduct related to this 
incident.&nbsp; So, Comcast can rest easy about the legal aspect of all of this. 

</p><p><b><i>9 April 1999:&nbsp; </i></b>I got an e-mail from Brian McWilliams at 
<b><i><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/">InternetNews</a></i></b>, asking me 
to give an interview for InternetNews Radio.&nbsp; I called and spoke to him, 
and voila--a couple of hours later, there's a segment on my story in Real Audio 
format on <a href="http://members.home.net/sammel/inr.ram">InternetNews 
Radio</a>. (© 1999 Internet.com&nbsp; Linked to with permission of Internet.com)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Ten years ago on Kickstarter, Gabriel Anzziani unveiled plans to produce an <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/920064946/oscilloscope-watch" data-url="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/920064946/oscilloscope-watch"><u>oscilloscope watch</u></a>. The project caught on in popularity before fading into the ether for about a decade. After nearly forgetting about the project, <a href="https://twitter.com/BitBangingBytes/status/1695192177310150993" data-url="https://twitter.com/BitBangingBytes/status/1695192177310150993"><u>early backers</u></a> were surprised this month to receive a package containing the oscilloscope watch.</p><p>The project page received an update on July 30th of this year from Anzziani confirming that backers are now officially starting to receive their watches. According to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/920064946/oscilloscope-watch/posts/3872064" data-url="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/920064946/oscilloscope-watch/posts/3872064"><u>post</u></a>, Anzziani is sending out between 10 and 20 rewards per week. The goal is to have all early rewards shipped by the end of 2023.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10 years ago I saw an oscilloscope watch on #Kickstarter Today it arrived! pic.twitter.com/svowwpAqQx<a href="https://twitter.com/BitBangingBytes/status/1695192177310150993" data-url="https://twitter.com/BitBangingBytes/status/1695192177310150993">August 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote><p><span role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></p></div><p>The oscilloscope watch has two modes. As the name suggests, it functions as both a watch and an oscilloscope. The watch mode has several useful features including formatting options for 24 vs 12 hour layouts and even an alarm. Of course, it also has an oscilloscope mode that works when the probes are inserted.</p><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-UirZBzrCVkFBWDErQZZYPn-imageGallery-5"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Oscilloscope"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gabriel Anzziani)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The watch is powered by an 8-bit Xmega microcontroller with an internal PDI. It can be programmed to use custom mods using C. It has 8 buttons that can be programmed, as well, that surround the watch face on the outer edge. According to Anzziani, one goal of the project was to enable users to create their own apps for the watch.</p><p>The screen is a 1.28-inch, low-power E Ink display. Anzziani explains the expected battery life varies depending on whether or not the oscilloscope is in use. Without using the oscilloscope the battery can last around 30 days on a single charge. Using the oscilloscope cuts that down to about 12 hours.</p><p>If you want to get a closer look at this project, you can find details about it over at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/920064946/oscilloscope-watch" data-url="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/920064946/oscilloscope-watch"><u>Kickstarter</u></a>. &nbsp;Rewards are no longer available but you can still read more about how the project goes together.

<p>Yes, we all love our fancy third-party packages. This starter kit focuses on what is built-in to Emacs. Why? Because there are too many good packages and picking and choosing the best is a joy we leave to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain every customization and encourage modification</p>
<p>The goal of this starter kit is to encourage end-user adaptation and growth. All of the <code>.el</code> files should be legible and, more importantly, justify in plain English the rationale for adding the configuration they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No magic</p>
<p>We keep things <em>crushingly</em> simple here. That means no fancy loadable modules or whatnot. Everything is as straight-forward as can be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two files of interest: <code>early-init.el</code> and <code>init.el</code>.</p>
<h4 id="codeearly-initelcode"><a href="#codeearly-initelcode" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a><code>early-init.el</code></h4>
<p>The early init file uses <em>strictly</em> built-in Emacs features to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve startup time</li>
<li>Set up initial frame behavior</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="codeinitelcode"><a href="#codeinitelcode" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a><code>init.el</code></h4>
<p>This is where the meat of all configuration goes. This file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add minor UI niceties (e.g. clock in the tab-bar, full-screen by default, etc.)</li>
<li>Set the default theme (<code>modus-vivendi</code>)</li>
<li>Turn on discovery aids (e.g. <code>help-quick</code>, <a href="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key" rel="nofollow noopener">which-key</a>, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Emacs 29.1 added the handy <code>--init-directory</code> flag. This means that you can run <code>emacs --init-directory path/to/emacs-bedrock/</code> and all the customizations and package installations will be isolated to the project directory. Emacs should only add files that are already in the <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<p>Once you're happy, you should just copy <code>init.el</code> and <code>early-init.el</code> to <code>~/.emacs.d/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="mixins"><a href="#mixins" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Mixins</h3>
<p>For those who'd like a little more help in tailoring Emacs for specific purposes, the <code>mixins/</code> folder contains a few files that can be included via <code>(load-file "mixin/mixin-name.el")</code> from the <code>init.el</code> file, or copied wholesale or in part into <code>init.el</code> directly.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you copy the <code>mixin/</code> directory to <code>~/.emacs.d/</code> or wherever you're setting <code>user-emacs-directory</code>, then simply incrementing the appropriate lines in the <code>init.el</code> file should work.</p>
<p>Mixins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base UI Enhancements</li>
<li>Development tools</li>
<li>Org-mode</li>
<li>Vim refugee</li>
<li>Email (TODO: mu4e, EBDB)</li>
<li>Researcher (TODO: denote)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="codemixinsbaseelcode"><a href="#codemixinsbaseelcode" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a><code>mixins/base.el</code></h5>
<p>Packages this mixin adds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy" rel="nofollow noopener">Avy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oantolin/embark" rel="nofollow noopener">Embark</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/minad/vertico" rel="nofollow noopener">Vertico</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/minad/corfu" rel="nofollow noopener">Corfu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/minad/consult" rel="nofollow noopener">Consult</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oantolin/orderless" rel="nofollow noopener">Orderless</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Along with a few ancillary packages that enhance the above.</p>
<p>These are some of the best UI enhancements that Emacs has to offer. Vertico and Consult make common operations like searching files, switching buffers, etc. a breeze. Corfu enhances the "completion at point" (aka "tab-to-complete") to show a little popup window like what you'd be used to in e.g. VS Code.</p>
<p>Avy is the fastest way to move around in a buffer, and it can do a <em>lot</em>.<a href="https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/" rel="nofollow noopener">^1</a> Embark is kind of like a right-click context menu, but entirely keyboard driven.</p>
<h5 id="codemixinsdevelcode"><a href="#codemixinsdevelcode" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a><code>mixins/dev.el</code></h5>
<p>Packages this mixin adds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://magit.vc/" rel="nofollow noopener">magit</a></li>
<li>Markdown, YAML, and JSON modes</li>
</ul>
<p>Magit is the best Git interface in the known universe. Some people use Emacs just so they can use Magit. It's that good. Entry point is bound to <code>C-c g</code> by default.</p>
<p>Built-in packages that this mixin configures:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot" rel="nofollow noopener">Eglot</a> (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow noopener">Language Server Protocol (LSP) client</a>)</li>
<li>Treesit (<a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter" rel="nofollow noopener">Tree-Sitter</a> support)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these packages are new in Emacs 29. Be sure to run <code>M-x treesit-install-language-grammar</code> to install the language grammar you'll need before editing a file the respective language for the first time.</p>
<h5 id="codemixinsvim-likeelcode"><a href="#codemixinsvim-likeelcode" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a><code>mixins/vim-like.el</code></h5>
<p>Packages this mixin adds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil" rel="nofollow noopener">Evil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you like Vim keybindings, then this is the mixin for you. It configures <code>evil-mode</code> and enables it, so you get Vim-like keybindings all throughout Emacs. I understand that this is the best Vim emulation outside of Vim itself. I use <code>evil-mode</code> in all my work.</p>
<p>Other packages that I use personally, but are not on GNU or non-GNU ELPA and so left out of the config include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection" rel="nofollow noopener">Evil-Collection</a> Add Evil-friendly keybindings to lots of corners of Emacs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader" rel="nofollow noopener">Evil-Leader</a> Setting a prefix (i.e. "leader") key</li>

</ul>
<h5 id="codemixinsorgelcode"><a href="#codemixinsorgelcode" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a><code>mixins/org.el</code></h5>
<p>This mixin configures <code>org-mode</code>. There is a <em>lot</em> that Bedrock cannot configure out of the box—you will need to modify all variables to fit your file system and needs, as explained in comments in the file.</p>

<p>Fire up Emacs and you're good to go!</p>
<h4 id="philosophy"><a href="#philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Philosophy</h4>
<p>Many people are looking for a good set of defaults and some easy-to-use switches that let Emacs get out of the way and let them work on what they want to. This is fine. This is not what Bedrock tries to do.</p>
<p>Emacs is the most customizable piece of software in existence. (No citation needed.) My goal with Bedrock is to make Emacs a little nicer by enabling some things that I personally think should be enabled by default. Bedrock goes a little further by suggesting a few well-built packages that go on to enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Bedrock encourages inspection and modification. I don't plan on making some core that periodically gets updated. You can think of this as just some guy's config that you wanted to adopt.</p>
<p>As an example of a deliberate choice, the <code>help-quick</code> buffer pops open on startup. Once a user has gotten used to this, they can just go into their <code>early-init.el</code> file and modify it themselves to remove that hook if they don't like it. It's a simple one-line change, and only users who are ready for it will do it.</p>
<p>When I started learning Emacs, my dad gave me his <code>.emacs</code> file. (That's what we used back in ye olden days instead of <code>.emacs.d/init.el</code> and stuff.) I used it without modification for many years. Eventually I learned how to write my own functions and customizations. This package aims to give other users a similar experience. When someone comes to me and expresses their desire to learn Emacs, I can point them at this to help them get over the initial hump, but not coddle them so much that they're afraid or unable to change things to their liking.</p>

<p>Emacs 29.1 or later.</p>
<p>Emacs 29.1 is, as of 2023-09-04, the latest stable release. The specific features from Emacs 29.1 that Bedrock relies on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>use-package</code> macro for configuration</li>
<li>Enhancements to the built-in completion help (<code>completions-auto-select</code>, <code>completion-auto-help</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Built-in tree-sitter support</li>
<li>Built-in LSP client (Eglot)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development"><a href="#development" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Development</h3>
<p>This is version <code>1.0.0</code>. No new <code>use-package</code> declarations will be added to <code>init.el</code>. No promises on the mixins. :)</p>
<p>This is a hobby project. Please be patient with development.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> Beginning in 1995 and for decades after, JavaScript was the only game worth playing when it came to web-based scripting. While incredibly versatile, JavaScript had its limitations, especially regarding performance-intensive tasks. As the web evolved, so did the demand for more power, speed, and flexibility in web applications. Enter WebAssembly (WASM).</p>
<p>Recognizing the need for a more efficient way to run code in web browsers, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and major browser vendors began working on a new binary format. This format aimed to be fast, efficient, and secure, allowing developers to run code at near-native speed. Thus, in 2015, <a target="_blank" href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a> was introduced as a low-level virtual machine that runs bytecode, which is translated from high-level languages.</p>
<p>Now, WASM is not a programming language per se. Instead it's a compact binary instruction format. Unlike JavaScript, which is interpreted, WASM is a low-level bytecode that runs in a sandboxed environment within the browser, ensuring both speed and security.</p>

    

<p>Developers love it because they can write code in languages they already know, such as C, C++, and Rust. Web developers were also pleased with it because they didn't need to replace their JavaScript programs. Instead they could <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/creating-and-working-with-webassembly-modules/" rel="nofollow">call WASM functions from JavaScript and vice versa</a>, allowing for a seamless integration between the two.</p>

        


        

<p>At first, WASM was a pure web play. Then things changed. In 2019, Mozilla introduced its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/29/mozilla_wasi_spec/">WebAssembly System Interface</a> (WASI) to access operating system resources. This <a target="_blank" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/">broke WebAssembly out of the browser</a>.</p>
<p>Once out of the browser box, it became, as WASM expert and Fastly Director of Engineering Lin Clark put it, "a fast, scalable, secure way to run the same code across all machines."</p>

        

<p>Does that sound familiar? It should, you could use that same description for containers.&nbsp; But you don't need to believe me. As Solomon Hykes, Docker co-founder, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225">tweeted</a> at the time: "If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to create Docker. That's how important it is. WebAssembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link."</p>
<p>More recently, in 2023, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's (<a target="_blank" href="https://cncf.io/?utm_content=inline-mention">CNCF</a>) head of ecosystem, Taylor Dolezal, said: "WebAssembly is the future because it is increasingly used for serverless, containerization and plug-in technologies and is expected to significantly impact web, serverless, gaming and containerization applications."</p>
<p>Strong words. So is WASM "the future of computing?"</p>

        

<p>Personally, I've been a cynic about it. While programs such as WASI and competing runtimes such as <a target="_blank" href="https://wasmedge.org/">WasmEdge</a> have made it much easier to run WASM optimized code on the edge and the backend, it strikes me that there's still a lot of work to be done. And I'm not the only one who sees this problem.</p>
<p>As Torsten Volk, Enterprise Management Associates analyst, <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewstack.io/is-webassembly-really-the-future/">has said</a>: "There is a lot of ground to cover in terms of reliably and efficiently supporting production use cases." Exactly.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/18/opinion_column/">A license to trust: Can you rely on 'open source' companies?</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/04/linux_desktop_cloud_desktops/">Soon the most popular 'real' desktop will be the Linux desktop</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/21/llama_is_not_open_source/">Meta can call Llama 2 open source as much as it likes, but that doesn't mean it is</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/07/red_hat_open_source/">Red Hat's open source rot took root when IBM walked in</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Python has become the quick, easy way for people to work with machine learning programs – thank you, <a target="_blank" href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. But you can't simply drop these programs into WASM in a runtime and expect them to work. The problem is that you also need many third-party dependencies, which aren't there yet.</p>
<p>If WASM continues to rise in popularity, companies and open source groups will do the hard work of building these nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>But, wait, you say – isn't Kubernetes the future? Well, yes, but as Adobe pointed out recently, WASM and Kubernetes can work hand-in-hand. They worked out a way to make a "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/11/17/better-together-a-kubernetes-and-wasm-case-study/">full microservice</a>, currently running in Kubernetes, and make it run in WASM."</p>
<p>Why? It gave them a more lightweight model that could be almost instantly scaled as traffic rose, giving more scheduling flexibility than a coarse-grained container, while still using Kubernetes to orchestrate everything. With this, Adobe could "securely enable high performance and efficiency, while still being compatible with Kubernetes." It was, for Adobe, the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Adobe had more resources than most companies to throw at their problems. Looking ahead, though, WASM may become easier for smaller businesses to use on the backend.</p>
<p>That's because of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/webassembly-component-model">WebAssembly Component Model</a> (WACM) and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/preview2-prototyping">WASI-Preview 2</a>.</p>
<p>The former project will <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/high-level/Goals.md">incrementally define a component model</a>. This will provide a portable, load and runtime-efficient binary format for separately compiled components built from WASM core modules that enable portable, cross-language composition. It will also provide better support for virtualizable, statically analyzable, capability-safe, language-agnostic interfaces.</p>
<p>The latter is the next version of <a target="_blank" href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>. This will expand WASI's APIs beyond POSIX to WASI filesystem, HTTP, cloud, and network sockets. It will also provide better bindings for non-C-like languages.</p>
<p>Put it all together, and I think WASM may well finally live up to its potential. Still, there's many a slip between developers' ideas and production code. But the bricks to build practical WASI backend designs are now being fired. By 2025, we'll know if WASM will indeed prove to be the future of backend software development. ®</p>
