<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Commission today (Feb 9) adopted new measures under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) to prevent the destruction of unsold apparel, clothing, accessories and footwear.</p><p>The rules will help cut waste, reduce environmental damage and create a level playing field for companies embracing sustainable business models, allowing them to reap the benefits of a more circular economy.</p><p>Every year in Europe, an estimated<strong> 4-9% of unsold textiles</strong> are destroyed before ever being worn. This waste generates around <strong>5.6 million tons</strong> of CO2 emissions – almost equal to Sweden’s total net emissions in 2021.</p><p>To help reduce this wasteful practice, the ESPR requires companies to disclose information on the unsold consumer products they discard as waste. It also introduces a ban on the destruction of unsold apparel, clothing accessories and footwear.</p><p>The Delegated and Implementing Acts adopted today will support businesses in complying with these requirements by:</p><ul><li><strong>Clarifying derogations</strong>: The Delegated Act outlines specific and justified circumstances under which the destruction will be permitted, for instance, due to safety reasons or product damage. National authorities will oversee compliance.</li><li><strong>Facilitating disclosure:</strong> The Implementing Act introduces a standardised format for businesses to disclose the volumes of unsold consumer goods they discard. This applies from February 2027, giving businesses sufficient time to adapt.</li></ul><p>Instead of discarding stock, companies are encouraged to manage their stock more effectively, handle returns, and explore alternatives such as resale, remanufacturing, donations, or reuse.</p><p>The ban on destruction of unsold apparel, clothing accessories and footwear and the derogations will apply to large companies from <strong>19 July 2026.</strong> Medium-sized companies are expected to follow in 2030. The rules on disclosure under the ESPR <strong>already apply</strong> <strong>to large companies</strong> and will also apply to medium-sized companies in 2030.</p><blockquote><p>"The textile sector is leading the way in the transition to sustainability, but there are still challenges. The numbers on waste show the need to act. With these new measures, the textile sector will be empowered to move towards sustainable and circular practices, and we can boost our competitiveness and reduce our dependencies."</p><p><strong>Jessika Roswall, Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular Economy</strong></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Background</strong></h4><p>The destruction of unsold goods is a wasteful practice. In France alone, around €630 million worth of unsold products are destroyed each year. Online shopping also fuels the issue: in Germany, nearly 20 million returned items are discarded annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Textiles are a major part of the problem, and a key focus for action. To cut waste and reduce the sector’s environmental footprint, the European Commission is promoting more sustainable production while helping European companies stay competitive.&nbsp;</p><p>The ESPR is central to this effort. It will make products on the EU market more durable, reusable and recyclable, while boosting efficiency and circularity.</p><h5><strong>More information</strong></h5><p><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-delegated-regulation-setting-out-derogations-prohibition-destruction-unsold-consumer_en">Delegated Regulation setting out derogations from the prohibition of destruction of unsold consumer products | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-implementing-regulation-details-and-format-disclosure-information-discarded-unsold_en">Implementing Regulation on the details and format for the disclosure of information on discarded unsold consumer products | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1781&amp;qid=1719580391746">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation | EUR-Lex</a></p><p><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/textiles-strategy_en">Textiles strategy | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/the-destruction-of-returned-and-unsold-textiles-in-europes-circular-economy">The destruction of returned and unsold textiles in Europe’s circular economy | European Environment Agency (EEA)</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content_body"><p><span>Hideki Sato, the designer behind virtually every Sega console, and the company’s former president, has died age 77.</span></p><p><span>Japanese games outlet <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?s=46">Beep21 </a>reports that Sato passed away this weekend.</span></p><p><span>Sato and his R&amp;D team were responsible for the creation of <a title="Companies > Sega [1,106 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/sega/">Sega</a>’s arcade and home console hardware, including the Master System, Genesis / Mega Drive, Saturn, and Dreamcast.</span></p><p><span>The engineer joined Sega in 1971 and was the company’s acting president between 2001 and 2003. He left the company in 2008.</span></p><p><span>“From the beginning, Sega’s home console development has always been influenced by our arcade development,” Sato previously told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">Famitsu</a> in an interview covering Sega’s history.</span></p><p><span>“Our first 8-bit machine was the </span><span>SC-3000</span><span>. This was a <a title="Platforms > PC [11,949 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/">PC</a> for beginner-level users. At that time, Sega only did arcade games, so this was our first challenge. We had no idea how many units we’d sell.”</span></p><p><span>Sato said of Mega Drive, Sega’s most successful console: “At that point, we decided to start developing a new home console. By then, arcade games were using 16-bit CPUs. </span></p><p><span>“Arcade development was something we were very invested in, so we were always using the most cutting-edge technology there. Naturally, it started us thinking: what if we used that technology in a home console? </span></p><p><span>“Two years after we started development, it was done: a 16-bit CPU home console, the Megadrive. The 68000 chip had also recently come down in price, so the timing was right.”</span></p><p><span>On Dreamcast, the release that ultimately ended Sega’s run in hardware, Sato said the keyword for the development was “play and communication.”</span></p><p><span>“The ultimate form of communication is a direct connection with another, and we included the modem and the linkable VMUs for that purpose,” he said. </span></p><p><span>“We had also planned to have some sort of linking function with cell phones, but we weren’t able to realize it. Consumers were now used to the raging ‘bit wars’, so even though we knew it was a lot of nonsense, we needed to appeal to them in those terms with the Dreamcast. </span></p><p><span>“And so we marketed it as having a ‘128 bit graphics engine RISC CPU’, even the SH-4 was only 64-bit. (laughs) On the other hand, we extensively customized the original SH-4 for the Dreamcast, to the point where I think you could almost call it something new.”</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

While the picture that emerges is grim, to put it mildly, at least Americans are again confronted with crystal clarity over how severe this has become.</span></p><p><span>The latest round of valid panic over privacy began during the Super Bowl held on Sunday. During the game, Amazon ran </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY" rel="">a commercial</a><span> for its Ring camera security system. The ad manipulatively exploited people’s love of dogs to induce them to ignore the consequences of what Amazon was touting. It seems that trick did not work.</span></p><p>The ad highlighted what the company calls its “Search Party” feature, whereby one can upload a picture, for example, of a lost dog. Doing so will activate multiple other Amazon Ring cameras in the neighborhood, which will, in turn, use AI programs to scan all dogs, it seems, and identify the one that is lost. The 30-second commercial was full of heart-tugging scenes of young children and elderly people being reunited with their lost dogs.</p><p>But the graphic Amazon used seems to have unwittingly depicted how invasive this technology can be. That this capability now exists in a product that has long been pitched as nothing more than a simple tool for homeowners to monitor their own homes created, it seems, an unavoidable contrast between public understanding of Ring and what Amazon was now boasting it could do.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png" width="2424" height="1243" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1243,&quot;width&quot;:2424,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5364048,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://greenwald.substack.com/i/187789911?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd64d01cc-601f-4649-bf9d-c537edb2bff8_2968x1522.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Amazon’s Super Bowl ad for Ring and its “Search Party” feature.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Many people were not just surprised but quite shocked and alarmed to learn that what they thought was merely their own personal security system now has the ability to link with countless other Ring cameras to form a neighborhood-wide (or city-wide, or state-wide) surveillance dragnet. That Amazon emphasized that this feature is available (for now) only to those who “opt-in” did not assuage concerns.</p><p><span>Numerous media outlets sounded the alarm. The online privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) </span><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/ring-flock-partnership-amazon-scraps-surveillance-company-safety-super-bowl-commercial-backlash/18596207/" rel="">condemned</a><span> Ring’s program as previewing “a world where biometric identification could be unleashed from consumer devices to identify, track, and locate anything — human, pet, and otherwise.”</span></p><p><span>Many private citizens who previously used Ring also reacted negatively. “Viral videos online show people removing or destroying their cameras over privacy concerns,” </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/10/ring-super-bowl-ad-dog-camera-privacy/88606738007/" rel="">reported</a><span> USA Today. The backlash became so severe that, just days later, Amazon — seeking to assuage public anger — </span><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/ring-flock-partnership-amazon-scraps-surveillance-company-safety-super-bowl-commercial-backlash/18596207/" rel="">announced</a><span> the termination of a partnership between Ring and Flock Safety, a police surveillance tech company (while Flock is unrelated to Search Party, public backlash made it impossible, at least for now, for Amazon to send Ring’s user data to a police surveillance firm).</span></p><p>The Amazon ad seems to have triggered a long-overdue spotlight on how the combination of ubiquitous cameras, AI, and rapidly advancing facial recognition software will render the term “privacy” little more than a quaint concept from the past. As EFF put it, Ring’s program “could already run afoul of biometric privacy laws in some states, which require explicit, informed consent from individuals before a company can just run face recognition on someone.”</p><p>Those concerns escalated just a few days later in the context of the Tucson disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, mother of long-time TODAY Show host Savannah Guthrie. At the home where she lives, Nancy Guthrie used Google’s Nest camera for security, a product similar to Amazon’s Ring.</p><p><span>Guthrie, however, did not pay Google for a subscription for those cameras, instead solely using the cameras for real-time monitoring. As CBS News </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybersecurity-experts-nancy-guthrie-surveillance-footage-recovery/" rel="">explained</a><span>, “with a free Google Nest plan, the video should have been deleted within 3 to 6 hours — long after Guthrie was reported missing.” Even professional privacy advocates have understood that customers who use Nest without a subscription will not have their cameras connected to Google’s data servers, meaning that no recordings will be stored or available for any period beyond a few hours.</span></p><p><span>For that reason, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/11/privacy-concerns-nancy-guthrie-google-nest-camera-footage-kidnapping/" rel="">announced</a><span> early on “that there was no video available in part because Guthrie didn’t have an active subscription to the company.” Many people, for obvious reasons, prefer to avoid permanently storing comprehensive daily video reports with Google of when they leave and return to their own home, or who visits them at their home, when, and for how long.</span></p><p>Despite all this, FBI investigators on the case were somehow magically able to “recover” this video from Guthrie’s camera many days later. FBI Director Kash Patel was essentially forced to admit this when he released still images of what appears to be the masked perpetrator who broke into Guthrie’s home. (The Google user agreement, which few users read, does protect the company by stating that images may be stored even in the absence of a subscription.)</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png" width="920" height="642" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:642,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:689574,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://greenwald.substack.com/i/187789911?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Image obtained through Nancy Guthrie’s unsubscribed Google Nest camera and released by the FBI.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>While the “discovery” of footage from this home camera by Google engineers is obviously of great value to the Guthrie family and law enforcement agents searching for Guthrie, it raises obvious yet serious questions about why Google, contrary to common understanding, was storing the video footage of unsubscribed users. A former NSA data researcher and CEO of a cybersecurity firm, Patrick Johnson, told CBS: “There's kind of this old saying that data is never deleted, it's just renamed.”</p><p><strong>It is rather remarkable that</strong><span> Americans are being led, more or less willingly, into a state-corporate, Panopticon-like domestic surveillance state with relatively little resistance, though the widespread reaction to Amazon’s Ring ad is encouraging. Much of that muted reaction may be due to a lack of realization about the severity of the evolving privacy threat. Beyond that, privacy and other core rights can seem abstract and less of a priority than more material concerns, at least until they are gone.</span></p><p>It is always the case that there are benefits available from relinquishing core civil liberties: allowing infringements on free speech may reduce false claims and hateful ideas; allowing searches and seizures without warrants will likely help the police catch more criminals, and do so more quickly; giving up privacy may, in fact, enhance security.</p><p>But the core premise of the West generally, and the U.S. in particular, is that those trade-offs are never worthwhile. Americans still all learn and are taught to admire the iconic (if not apocryphal) 1775 words of Patrick Henry, which came to define the core ethos of the Revolutionary War and American Founding: “Give me liberty or give me death.” It is hard to express in more definitive terms on which side of that liberty-versus-security trade-off the U.S. was intended to fall.</p><p><span>These recent events emerge in a broader context of this new Silicon Valley-driven destruction of individual privacy. Palantir’s federal contracts for domestic surveillance and domestic data management continue to expand rapidly, with more and more intrusive data about Americans consolidated under the control of this </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0" rel="">one sinister corporation</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Facial recognition technology — now fully in use for an array of purposes from Customs and Border Protection at airports to ICE’s patrolling of American streets — means that fully tracking one’s movements in public spaces is easier than ever, and is becoming easier by the day. It was only three years ago that we </span><a href="https://x.com/systemupdate_/status/1712828792320778590" rel="">interviewed</a><span> </span><em>New York Times</em><span> reporter Kashmir Hill about her new book, “Your Face Belongs to Us.” The warnings she issued about the dangers of this proliferating technology have not only come true with startling speed but also appear already beyond what even she envisioned.</span></p><p>On top of all this are advances in AI. Its effects on privacy cannot yet be quantified, but they will not be good. I have tried most AI programs simply to remain abreast of how they function.</p><p>After just a few weeks, I had to stop my use of Google’s Gemini because it was compiling not just segregated data about me, but also a wide array of information to form what could reasonably be described as a dossier on my life, including information I had not wittingly provided it. It would answer questions I asked it with creepy, unrelated references to the far-too-complete picture it had managed to create of many aspects of my life (at one point, it commented, somewhat judgmentally or out of feigned “concern,” about the late hours I was keeping while working, a topic I never raised).</p><p>Many of these unnerving developments have happened without much public notice because we are often distracted by what appear to be more immediate and proximate events in the news cycle. The lack of sufficient attention to these privacy dangers over the last couple of years, including at times from me, should not obscure how consequential they are.</p><p><span>All of this is particularly remarkable, and particularly disconcerting, since we are barely more than a decade removed from the disclosures about mass domestic surveillance enabled by the courageous whistleblower Edward Snowden. Although most of our reporting focused on state surveillance, one of </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" rel="">the first stories</a><span> featured the joint state-corporate spying framework built in conjunction with the U.S. security state and Silicon Valley giants.</span></p><p><span>The Snowden stories sparked years of anger, attempts at reform, changes in diplomatic relations, and even genuine (albeit forced) </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/end-to-end-encryption.html" rel="">improvements</a><span> in Big Tech’s user privacy. But the calculation of the U.S. security state and Big Tech was that at some point, attention to privacy concerns would disperse and then virtually evaporate, enabling the state-corporate surveillance state to march on without much notice or resistance. At least as of now, the calculation seems to have been vindicated.</span></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you’re maintaining a native project. You use Visual Studio for building on Windows, so you do the responsible thing and list it as a dependency</p><blockquote><p>Build Requirements: Install Visual Studio</p></blockquote><p>If you’re lucky enough not to know this yet, I envy you.  Unfortunately, at this point even Boromir knows…</p><figure><img src="https://marler8997.github.io/SimplyInstallVs.png">
<figcaption>Well put Boromir</figcaption></figure><p>What you may not realize is, you’ve actually signed up to be unpaid tech support for Microsoft’s “Visual Studio Installer”. You might notice GitHub Issues becoming less about your code and more about broken builds, specifically on Windows. You find yourself explaining to a contributor that they didn’t check the “Desktop development with C++” workload, but specifically the v143 build tools and the 10.0.22621.0 SDK. No, not that one, the <em>other</em> one. You spend less time on your project because you’re too busy being a human-powered dependency resolver for a 50GB IDE.</p><p>Saying “Install Visual Studio” is like handing contributors a choose-your-own-adventure book riddled with bad endings, some of which don’t let you go back. I’ve had to re-image my entire OS more than once over the years.</p><h3>Why is this tragedy unique to Windows?</h3><p>On <strong>Linux</strong>, the toolchain is usually just a package manager command away. On the other hand, “Visual Studio” is thousands of components. It’s so vast that Microsoft distributes it with a sophisticated GUI installer where you navigate a maze of checkboxes, hunting for which “Workloads” or “Individual Components” contain the actual compiler. Select the wrong one and you might lose hours installing something you don’t need. Miss one, like “Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)” or “Spectre-mitigated libs,” and your build fails three hours later with a cryptic error like <code>MSB8101</code>. And heaven help you if you need to downgrade to an older version of the build tools for a legacy project.</p><p>The Visual Studio ecosystem is built on a legacy of ‘all-in-one’ monoliths. It conflates the editor, the compiler, and the SDK into a single, tangled web. When we list ‘Visual Studio’ as a dependency, we’re failing to distinguish between the tool we use to write code and the environment required to compile it.</p><p>The pain compounds quickly:</p><ul><li><strong>Hours-long waits</strong>: You spend an afternoon watching a progress bar download 15GB just to get a 50MB compiler.</li><li><strong>Zero transparency</strong>: You have no idea which files were installed or where they went. Your registry is littered with cruft and background update services are permanent residents of your Task Manager.</li><li><strong>No version control</strong>: You can’t check your compiler into Git. If a teammate has a slightly different Build Tools version, your builds can silently diverge.</li><li><strong>The “ghost” environment</strong>: Uninstalling is never truly clean. Moving to a new machine means repeating the entire GUI dance, praying you checked the same boxes.</li></ul><p>Even after installation, compiling a single C file from the command line requires finding the Developer Command Prompt. Under the hood, this shortcut invokes <code>vcvarsall.bat</code>, a fragile batch script that globally mutates your environment variables just to locate where the compiler is hiding this week.</p><p>Ultimately, you end up with build instructions that look like a legal disclaimer:</p><blockquote><p>“Works on my machine with VS 17.4.2 (Build 33027.167) and SDK 10.0.22621.0. If you have 17.5, please see Issue #412. If you are on ARM64, godspeed.”</p></blockquote><p>On Windows, this has become the “cost of doing business”. We tell users to wait three hours for a 20GB install just so they can compile a 5MB executable. <strong>It’s become an active deterrent to native development</strong>.</p><h2>A new way</h2><p>I’m not interested in being a human debugger for someone else’s installer. I want the MSVC toolchain to behave like a modern dependency: versioned, isolated, declarative.</p><p>I spent a few weeks building an open source tool to make things better. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup" target="_blank">msvcup</a>. It’s a small CLI program. On good network/hardware, it can install the toolchain/SDK in a few minutes, including everything to cross-compile to/from ARM. Each version of the toolchain/SDK gets its own isolated directory. It’s idempotent and fast enough to invoke every time you build. Let’s try it out.</p><p>Create <code>hello.c</code> and <code>build.bat</code>:</p><pre><code><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>printf</span>(<span>"Hello, World\n"</span>)<span>;</span> }
</code></pre>
<pre><code>@setlocal

@if not exist msvcup.exe (
    echo msvcup.exe: installing...
    curl -L -o msvcup.zip https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup/releases/download/v2026_02_07/msvcup-x86_64-windows.zip
    tar xf msvcup.zip
    del msvcup.zip
) else (
    echo msvcup.exe: already installed
)
@if not exist msvcup.exe exit /b 1

set MSVC=msvc-14.44.17.14
set SDK=sdk-10.0.22621.7

msvcup install --lock-file msvcup.lock --manifest-update-off %MSVC% %SDK%
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

msvcup autoenv --target-cpu x64 --out-dir autoenv %MSVC% %SDK%
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

.\autoenv\cl hello.c
</code></pre><p>And we’re done.</p><p>Believe it or not, this <code>build.bat</code> script replaces the need to “Install Visual Studio”. This script should run on any Windows system since Windows 10 (assuming it has curl/tar which have been shipped since 2018). It installs the MSVC toolchain, the Windows SDK and then compiles our program.</p><p>For my fellow Windows developers, go ahead and take a moment. Visual Studio can’t hurt you anymore. The <code>build.bat</code> above isn’t just a helper script; it’s a declaration of independence from the Visual Studio Installer. Our dependencies are fully specified, making builds reproducible across machines. And when those dependencies are installed, they won’t pollute your registry or lock you into a single global version.</p><p>Also note that after the first run, the <code>msvcup</code> commands take milliseconds, meaning we can just leave these commands in our build script and now we have a fully self-contained script that can build our project on virtually any modern Windows machine.</p><h2>How?</h2><p>msvcup is inspired by a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mmozeiko/7f3162ec2988e81e56d5c4e22cde9977" target="_blank">small Python script</a> written by Mārtiņš Možeiko. The key insight is that Microsoft publishes JSON manifests describing every component in Visual Studio, the same manifests the official installer uses. msvcup parses these manifests, identifies just the packages needed for compilation (the compiler, linker, headers, and libraries), and downloads them directly from Microsoft’s CDN. Everything lands in versioned directories under <code>C:\msvcup\</code>. For details on lock files, cross-compilation, and other features, see the <a href="https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup" target="_blank">msvcup README.md</a>.</p><p>The astute will also notice that our <code>build.bat</code> script never sources any batch files to set up the “Developer Environment”. The script contains two msvcup commands. The first installs the toolchain/SDK, and like a normal installation, it includes “vcvars” scripts to set up a developer environment. Instead, our <code>build.bat</code> leverages the <code>msvcup autoenv</code> command to create an “Automatic Environment”. This creates a directory that contains wrapper executables to set the environment variables on your behalf before forwarding to the underlying tools. It even includes a <code>toolchain.cmake</code> file which will point your CMake projects to these tools, allowing you to build your CMake projects outside a special environment.</p><p>At <a href="https://tuple.app/" target="_blank">Tuple</a> (a pair-programming app), I integrated msvcup into our build system and CI, which allowed us to remove the requirement for the user/CI to pre-install Visual Studio. Tuple compiles hundreds of C/C++ projects including WebRTC. This enabled both x86_64 and ARM builds on the CI as well as keeping the CI and everyone on the same toolchain/SDK.</p><p>The benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Everything installs into a versioned directory.</strong> No problem installing versions side-by-side. Easy to remove or reinstall if something goes wrong.</li><li><strong>Cross-compilation enabled out of the box.</strong> msvcup currently always downloads the tools for all supported cross-targets, so you don’t have to do any work looking for all the components you need to cross-compile.</li><li><strong>Lock file support.</strong> A self-contained list of all the payloads/URLs. Everyone uses the same packages, and if Microsoft changes something upstream, you’ll know.</li><li><strong>Blazing fast.</strong> The <code>install</code> and <code>autoenv</code> commands are idempotent and complete in milliseconds when there’s no work to do.</li></ul><p>No more “it works on my machine because I have the 2019 Build Tools installed.” No more registry-diving to find where <code>cl.exe</code> is hiding this week. With msvcup, your environment is defined by your code, portable across machines, and ready to compile in milliseconds.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>msvcup focuses on the core compilation toolchain. If you need the full Visual Studio IDE, MSBuild-based project systems, or components like the C++/CLI compiler, you’ll still need the official installer. For most native development workflows, though, it covers what you actually need.</p><h2>A Real-World Example: Building Raylib</h2><p>Let’s try this on a real project. Here’s a script that builds <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib" target="_blank">raylib</a> from scratch on a clean Windows system. In this case, we’ll just use the SDK without the autoenv:</p><pre><code>@setlocal

set TARGET_CPU=x64

@if not exist msvcup.exe (
    echo msvcup.exe: installing...
    curl -L -o msvcup.zip https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup/releases/download/v2026_02_07/msvcup-x86_64-windows.zip
    tar xf msvcup.zip
    del msvcup.zip
)

set MSVC=msvc-14.44.17.14
set SDK=sdk-10.0.22621.7

msvcup.exe install --lock-file msvcup.lock --manifest-update-off %MSVC% %SDK%
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

@if not exist raylib (
    git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib -b 5.5
)

call C:\msvcup\%MSVC%\vcvars-%TARGET_CPU%.bat
call C:\msvcup\%SDK%\vcvars-%TARGET_CPU%.bat

cmd /c "cd raylib\projects\scripts &amp;&amp; build-windows"
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

@echo build success: game exe at:
@echo .\raylib\projects\scripts\builds\windows-msvc\game.exe
</code></pre><p>No Visual Studio installation. No GUI. No prayer. Just a script that does exactly what it says.</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://marler8997.github.io/build-zig/windows.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a page that shows how to use msvcup to build LLVM and Zig from scratch on Windows.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/fast-llm-inference/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/fast-llm-inference/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47022329">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p><a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode">Anthropic</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/">OpenAI</a> both recently announced “fast mode”: a way to interact with their best coding model at significantly higher speeds.</p>
<p>These two versions of fast mode are very different. Anthropic’s <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode#how-fast-mode-works">offers</a> up to 2.5x tokens per second (so around 170, up from Opus 4.6’s 65). OpenAI’s offers more than 1000 tokens per second (up from GPT-5.3-Codex’s 65 tokens per second, so 15x). So OpenAI’s fast mode is six times faster than Anthropic’s<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, Anthropic’s big advantage is that they’re serving their actual model. When you use their fast mode, you get real Opus 4.6, while when you use OpenAI’s fast mode you get GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, not the real GPT-5.3-Codex. Spark is indeed much faster, but is a notably less capable model: good enough for many tasks, but it gets confused and messes up tool calls in ways that vanilla GPT-5.3-Codex would never do.</p>
<p>Why the differences? The AI labs aren’t advertising the details of how their fast modes work, but I’m pretty confident it’s something like this: <strong>Anthropic’s fast mode is backed by <em>low-batch-size</em> inference, while OpenAI’s fast mode is backed by special monster Cerebras chips</strong>. Let me unpack that a bit.</p>
<h3>How Anthropic’s fast mode works</h3>
<p>The tradeoff at the heart of AI inference economics is <em>batching</em>, because the main bottleneck is <em>memory</em>. GPUs are very fast, but moving data onto a GPU is not. Every inference operation requires copying all the tokens of the user’s prompt<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> onto the GPU before inference can start. Batching multiple users up thus increases overall throughput at the cost of making users wait for the batch to be full.</p>
<p>A good analogy is a bus system. If you had zero batching for passengers - if, whenever someone got on a bus, the bus departed immediately - commutes would be much faster <em>for the people who managed to get on a bus</em>. But obviously overall throughput would be much lower, because people would be waiting at the bus stop for hours until they managed to actually get on one.</p>
<p>Anthropic’s fast mode offering is basically a bus pass that guarantees that the bus immediately leaves as soon as you get on. It’s six times the cost, because you’re effectively paying for all the other people who could have got on the bus with you, but it’s way faster<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> because you spend <em>zero</em> time waiting for the bus to leave.</p>
<p>edit: I want to thank a reader for emailing me to point out that the “waiting for the bus” cost is really only paid for the first token, so that won’t affect <em>streaming</em> latency (just latency per turn or tool call). It’s thus better to think of the performance impact of batch size being mainly that smaller batches require fewer flops and thus execute more quickly. In my analogy, maybe it’s “lighter buses drive faster”, or something.</p>
<p>Obviously I can’t be fully certain this is right. Maybe they have access to some new ultra-fast compute that they’re running this on, or they’re doing some algorithmic trick nobody else has thought of. But I’m pretty sure this is it. Brand new compute or algorithmic tricks would likely require changes to the model (see below for OpenAI’s system), and “six times more expensive for 2.5x faster” is right in the ballpark for the kind of improvement you’d expect when switching to a low-batch-size regime.</p>
<h3>How OpenAI’s fast mode works</h3>
<p>OpenAI’s fast mode does not work anything like this. You can tell that simply because they’re introducing a new, worse model for it. There would be absolutely no reason to do that if they were simply tweaking batch sizes. Also, they told us in the announcement <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/">blog post</a> exactly what’s backing their fast mode: Cerebras.</p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/">announced</a> their Cerebras partnership a month ago in January. What’s Cerebras? They build “ultra low-latency compute”. What this means in practice is that they build <em>giant chips</em>. A H100 chip (fairly close to the frontier of inference chips) is just over a square inch in size. A Cerebras chip is <em>70</em> square inches.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>You can see from pictures that the Cerebras chip has a grid-and-holes pattern all over it. That’s because silicon wafers this big are supposed to be broken into dozens of chips. Instead, Cerebras etches a giant chip over the entire thing.</p>
<p>The larger the chip, the more internal memory it can have. The idea is to have a chip with SRAM large enough <em>to fit the entire model</em>, so inference can happen entirely in-memory. Typically GPU SRAM is measured in the tens of <em>megabytes</em>. That means that a lot of inference time is spent streaming portions of the model weights from outside of SRAM into the GPU compute<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. If you could stream all of that from the (much faster) SRAM, inference would a big speedup: fifteen times faster, as it turns out!</p>
<p>So how much internal memory does the latest Cerebras chip have? <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11698v1#:~:text=Most%20recently%2C%20the%20Wafer%20Scale,of%2021%20petabytes%20per%20second.">44GB</a>. This puts OpenAI in kind of an awkward position. 44GB is enough to fit a small model (~20B params at fp16, ~40B params at int8 quantization), but clearly not enough to fit GPT-5.3-Codex. That’s why they’re offering a brand new model, and why the Spark model has a bit of “small model smell” to it: it’s a smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation">distil</a> of the much larger GPT-5.3-Codex model<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>OpenAI’s version is much more technically impressive</h3>
<p>It’s interesting that the two major labs have two very different approaches to building fast AI inference. If I had to guess at a conspiracy theory, it would go something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI partner with Cerebras in mid-January, obviously to work on putting an OpenAI model on a fast Cerebras chip</li>
<li>Anthropic have no similar play available, but they know OpenAI will announce some kind of blazing-fast inference in February, and they want to have something in the news cycle to compete with that</li>
<li>Anthropic thus hustles to put together the kind of fast inference they <em>can</em> provide: simply lowering the batch size on their existing inference stack</li>
<li>Anthropic (probably) waits until a few days before OpenAI are done with their much more complex Cerebras implementation to announce it, so it looks like OpenAI copied them</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously OpenAI’s achievement here is more technically impressive. Getting a model running on Cerebras chips is not trivial, because they’re so weird. Training a 20B or 40B param distil of GPT-5.3-Codex that is still kind-of-good-enough is not trivial. But I commend Anthropic for finding a sneaky way to get ahead of the announcement that will be largely opaque to non-technical people. It reminds me of OpenAI’s mid-2025 sneaky introduction of the Responses API to help them <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/responses-api">conceal their reasoning tokens</a>.</p>
<h3>Is fast AI inference the next big thing?</h3>
<p>Seeing the two major labs put out this feature might make you think that fast AI inference is the new major goal they’re chasing. I don’t think it is. If my theory above is right, Anthropic don’t care <em>that</em> much about fast inference, they just didn’t want to appear behind OpenAI. And OpenAI are mainly just exploring the capabilities of their new Cerebras partnership. It’s still largely an open question what kind of models can fit on these giant chips, how useful those models will be, and if the economics will make any sense.</p>
<p>I personally don’t find “fast, less-capable inference” particularly useful. I’ve been playing around with it in Codex and I don’t like it. The usefulness of AI agents is dominated by <em>how few mistakes they make</em>, not by their raw speed. Buying 6x the speed at the cost of 20% more mistakes is a bad bargain, because most of the user’s time is spent handling mistakes instead of waiting for the model<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, it’s certainly possible that fast, less-capable inference becomes a core lower-level primitive in AI systems. Claude Code already uses <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1098#issuecomment-2884244872">Haiku</a> for some operations. Maybe OpenAI will end up using Spark in a similar way.</p>

  <h3>Semantic, minimal, zero dependencies. ~8KB CSS and JS.</h3>

  <p>
    Oat is an ultra-lightweight HTML + CSS, semantic UI component library with zero dependencies.
    No framework, build, or dev complexity. Just include the tiny CSS and JS files and you are good to go building
    decent looking web applications with most commonly needed components and elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Semantic tags and attributes are styled contextually out of the box without classes, forcing best practices, and reducing
    markup class pollution. A few dynamic components are WebComponents and use minimal JavaScript.

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    This was made after the unending frustration with the over-engineered bloat, complexity, and dependency-hell of pretty much every Javascript UI library and framework out there. Done with the continuous PTSD of rug-pulls and lockins of the Node.js ecosystem trash.
    <sup><a href="https://nadh.in/blog/javascript-ecosystem-software-development-are-a-hot-mess/">[1]</a></sup>
    I've published this, in case other Node.js ecosystem trauma victims find it useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is a simple, minimal, vanilla, standards-based UI library that I can use in my own projects for the long term without having to worry about Javascript ecosystem trash. Long term because it's just simple vanilla CSS and JS.
    The look and feel are influenced by the shadcn aesthetic.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Last week, I helped build Super Bowl activations for DraftKings, Bud Light, and Spotify, turning San Francisco into a vice-centric Disneyland for the rich and famous. It was plastic. It was loud. It was profitable.</p><p>On Wednesday, I traveled from Berkeley to the Tenderloin. The rain was rushing down as I exited the Civic Center BART Station. I walked past the Main Library and water started filling my shoe through a hole I didn’t know existed. My sock got heavy. My foot got damp. Is there anything quite as awful?</p><p>The discomfort catapulted me back.</p><p><strong>March 2025.</strong></p><p>I stepped off a Greyhound into the shadow of the Salesforce Tower. It is the second tallest tower on the West Coast. It’s a giant glass needle that penetrates the clouds. Sometimes it looks the eye of Sauron. It’s a monument to a corporation that monetizes human connection. It is a machine that measures a human being’s worth based on how much money they can make you.</p><p>I arrived at its base with no money, no phone, and an empty backpack.</p><p>Time was ticking. The sky was gray. I didn’t want to sleep on the ground, or venture to the airport, or have to nod off on short bus routes that ended at nowheres in the middle of the night.</p><p>I walked up Market Street to the Main Library. As I sat in front of the computer, it was the first time I truly acknowledged the harsh truth I had been avoiding: I was homeless.</p><p>I found a list of shelters. I started with what I believed to be the nicest one.</p><p><em>Dignity Moves</em><span> on Gough Street. Seventy private rooms. A staff member looked at me through the fence as if I was an invasive species. He told me there was no one to talk to. I had to call The SFHOT line. I had to wait for the van to pick me up and drop me off where they find fit.</span></p><p>“I am in front of you right now,” I said. “I am a person. I don’t have a phone. I don’t want a phone. I am here. I am tired. This is a shelter. I need shelter.”</p><p>“Can’t help you.” he said.</p><p>He walked away. I walked away. Did dignity move?</p><p><span>I drifted south to SOMA. I passed a tent handing out clean needles. I thought of Huxley’s </span><em>Brave New World</em><span>. Soma: the government-produced drug for artificial happiness. An opiate for the masses. I arrived at the next shelter. They asked if I was an addict. I told them I had a couple beers in a couple months. </span></p><p>“This place is only for addicts,” they said. “Try the Human Services Agency.”</p><p>Sobriety was the disqualifier. And the Human Services Agency? The name felt wrong. Like how aliens might describe us. Or a department in a Kafka story.</p><p>It was getting close to dark. I went back to the library. I sat down in front of the computer again and found a temporary shelter a few blocks away at the Quaker’s Meeting Hall on 9th Street.</p><p>I joined the line. These were odd folks. I suppose I was an odd folk, too. A woman with purple hair held a clipboard like a shield. She pointed a thermometer at my head.</p><p>“Ninety-four degrees.”</p><p>“What?” I asked.</p><p>She wrote it down.</p><p>“Shouldn’t it be 97 or 98?”</p><p>“No. Ninety-four.”</p><p>She didn’t recognize the disconnect. I looked at her ledger. The temperatures ranged from eighty-eight to ninety-five.</p><p>It reaffirmed a delusion that had previously gripped my mind and begun my psychosis; I must be dead. This place, purgatory. I prayed for a quest or that my retribution was almost over, so that I could go back to land of the living.</p><p>I entered the hall.</p><p>The old lady’s came marching in, and fed us pasta and bread and cake and cookies. There was Coca Cola. I ate because I had no choice, but suspicious of the sugar they forced on us. We slept on green mats. Most of the folks, drenched theirs in Industrial Clorox. I thought they had it wrong. Embrace the filth.  Do you trust the chemicals?</p><p>At 8:05 PM, the lights died. I had no blue light. I had no screen. Just exhaustion and the collective breathing of fifty souls. Tired souls. Hurting souls. I slept as deep as you can until 5:30 AM.</p><p>The morning crew felt like NPCs (for those older folks, an NPC is a character in a video game that is scripted or run by AI). This morning crew was Sneakerheads. Starbucks and Air Force Ones, tracksuits and the chit chat of urban culture. I wonder how much they were getting paid?</p><p>One man marched in every morning and kept repeating, “Drago! Drago! Drago!” at an invisible enemy in the air. They brought French toast in white containers. Some of the people around me drenched theirs in mountains of maple syrup. Is sugar the enemy?</p><p>Out by 7am. I entered Mission Mode. Survival is a series of small, concrete objectives.</p><p>Find a shower. Find laundry. Find food.</p><p>There was a shelter in the Mission that offered laundry and showers on Tuesdays, but only for women.</p><p>“I identify as a woman,” I said.</p><p>She smiled. She said ok. You are smart. The gate opened.</p><p>I sat with some older women who knitted and shared some pizza. I looked around. I had a small breath of relief.</p><p>“Your turn.” I had five minutes to shower. I shaved too fast and cut my face. I watched the blood mix with the water.</p><p>I had found a shower. I had found laundry. I had food. Missions accomplished. I went back to the Quaker’s Meeting Hall that evening.</p><p>In the margins of the day, I started reading a lot and building a website for time travelers. I thought I might be able to communicate that way.</p><p>One day, I went to the St. Vincent’s clothing pantry. I tried on Miami Vice-like Hawaiian shirts that felt like Grand Theft Auto outfits. However after a few blocks with my new clothes, I decided they must be cursed.  Filled with the bad energy of their previous owners. I wore them 30 or so blocks. And donated my new clothes at a Goodwill. I stuck to my original avatar. Jeans and a Marine Layer hoodie. </p><p><span>I needed a guide. I stole </span><em>Don Quixote</em><span> from the library.</span></p><p>One night, in the Quaker Meeting Hall, I thought I found my Sancho Panza: an older Chinese man who waddled with three plastic bags filled with Pringles containers.  I don’t know what he did during the day. Or why he always carried those plastic bags. Or why the contents of those plastic bags never changed.  I thought we might be knights.</p><p>The end of March happened and so did the temporary shelter. I needed to find a new place.</p><p>I remembered a place in San Mateo I rejected back in February. It hadn’t crossed my mind when I first arrived back in San Francisco. When I had been offered it in February, I rejected the offer because I thought it was ludicrous to think I was homeless. I come from a relatively privileged upbringing, and the idea of homelessness was a distant concept to my naive brain.</p><p><em>Now that I was beginning to land in reality,</em></p><p>I hopped on the Cal Train to Redwood City and walked to LifeMoves Navigation Center. They accepted me for a night but said I needed an official recommendation from the Human Service Agency to stay. I would do it after my court case the next morning.</p><p><strong>April 2nd, 2025</strong></p><p>I stood in a courtroom. Four felonies.</p><p>My public defender reminded me of a woman I did ayahuasca with in upstate New York. But she didn’t like me the same as the ayahuasca friend.  She hadn’t responded to my emails. She was never in her office. I didn’t like the lack of communication.</p><p>I told her I wanted to represent myself.</p><p>She looked at me like I was insane. “You might not even be allowed to represent yourself.”</p><p>If there is one thing to know about me, it’s this: as soon as the words, “You can’t” or “You aren’t allowed” are spoken - especially when there is objective truth- it becomes my mission to prove the right way, to prove a truth. Purpose endowed.</p><p>The judge looked down from the bench. “Are you sure? If convicted, you could spend three to five years in prison.”</p><p>“I am sure,” I said. “I am capable. I understand the charges. I understand the possibility of the consequences. And I understand the process. I want to represent myself.”</p><p>She said, “Ok. I’ll see you at the end of the month.”</p><p>I walked out of the courtroom, a homeless felon acting as his own attorney.</p><p>I took the Caltrain back to Redwood City. I went to the library. I saw the email from my mom.</p><p><em>Your grandma passed away this morning.</em></p><p>Twenty-two days in hospice. Supposedly she broke the record in that hospice. She couldn’t die without winning.</p><p>I went to the Human Services Agency in Redwood City. My paranoia of the place had dissipated slightly as the idea of having my own room felt pretty nice. But they denied me from the LifeMoves Navigation Center. Instead they offered me a bed in a room with twenty men in Menlo Park. She pointed to 3 guys who were missing their teeth and I summed them up to be probable meth users. </p><p>“You can join them. I’m calling them an Uber right now.”</p><p>“No,” I said.</p><p>I was done with barracks and shared rooms in homeless shelters. I walked out.</p><p>I walked into a Savers. I didn’t have money. Since that 94 degree reading, I had refused to steal, convinced I was in purgatory and doing the “right thing” was the only way to pass the test. But standing there, the rules dissolved.  The moral guardrails of our broken systems suddenly felt absurd. Today, survival wasn’t a sin. It was a step in this journey. I felt a wink from my grandma. </p><p>I took a sleeping bag, and a Thermos. I walked out.</p><p>I walked into a Sports Basement. I grabbed a portable stove and a small propane tank.</p><p>I walked into a Safeway and grabbed some taro roots, tortillas, beans, and a steak.</p><p>I found a bridge in Redwood City. Concrete. Brutalist. A bit damp.</p><p>I unrolled my sleeping bag in the dirt. The moon came up. A raccoon walked on the other side of the river. I turned on the mini propane tank, cut and cooked the taro, the steak, and the beans - and made myself some delicious steak tacos.</p><p>A couple months ago, I found that particular bridge was next to an office building inhabited by some of my old colleagues. A start-up I had been a part of in New York. Where I was the first employee. I had owned equity. They had eventually sold for $350 million. At that moment, they were raising $140 million to build robots for the future.</p><p>And here I was, a man facing felony charges, homeless, penniless, sleeping in the dirt just a stone’s throw away from a future that could have been. </p><p>It was funny.</p><p>I closed my eyes. I could defend myself. I could fend for myself. I could survive.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

                <p><span>Welcome</span></p><hr>
<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nIbn3vvvMc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><p>

Flashpoint Archive is a community effort to preserve games and animations from the web.</p><p>

Internet history and culture is important, and the web is evolving at such a rapid pace that what might be commonplace today could be obsolete tomorrow. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time. Since December 2017, <a href="https://flashpointproject.github.io/flashpoint-database/statistics/">over 200,000 games and animations</a> have been preserved across more than a hundred browser plugins and web technologies.</p><p>

In addition to our preservation efforts, we also provide a highly flexible software package for reliable navigation and playback of preserved content. Among the software that powers Flashpoint is <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/launcher">a fully-featured launcher</a> that acts as a frontend for the collection, <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointProxy">a proxy</a> that tricks games into thinking they're running on the live web, and <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointSecureTools">a sandbox</a> that allows for secure playback of plugin-enabled content - all of which are <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/source">open-source software</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/images/launcher.png"><img src="https://flashpointarchive.org/images/launcher_thumb.png"></a>
</p><p>

The project <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/news#starting-date">was originally started</a> by BlueMaxima in an attempt to outrun the disappearance of webgames prior to the death of Flash. It has since evolved into a major undertaking involving hundreds of community contributors from around the world, encompassing both games and animations created for numerous internet plugins, frameworks, and standards.</p><p>

Flashpoint Archive operates as non-profit with the goal of furthering efforts in the preservation and accessibility of games, animations and other digital interactive experiences from the web. If you wish to support us or find out more about how we're funded and where these funds are spent, please use the Donate button in the left sidebar or visit our <a href="https://opencollective.com/flashpointarchive">Open Collective page</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>For this year's <a href="https://ilovefs.org/">"I love Free Software Day"</a> I
would like to thank the maintainers of Free Software documentation, and
here especially the maintainers of the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">ArchWiki</a>. Maintainers in general, and
maintainers of documentation most of the time get way too little
recognition for their contributions to software freedom.</p>
<p><img alt="Myself, Arch Project Leader Levente, ArchWiki maintainer Ferdinand, and FSFE's vice president Heiki at FOSDEM 2025 after I handed them over some hacker chocolate" src="https://k7r.eu/i-love-the-work-of-the-archwiki-maintainers/ilovefs-archwiki-reduced.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Myself, Arch Project Leader Levente, ArchWiki maintainer Ferdinand
(Alad), and FSFE's vice president Heiki at FOSDEM 2026 after I handed
them over some hacker chocolate.</em></p>
<p>The ArchWiki is a resource, I myself and many people around me regularly
consult - no matter if it is actually about Arch or another Free Software
distribution. There are countless times, when I read articles there to
get a better understanding of the tools I daily use, like e-mail
programs, editors, or all kinds of window managers I used over time. It
helped me to discover some handy features or configuration tips that
were difficult for me to find in the documentation of the software
itself.</p>
<p>Whenever I run into issues setting up a GNU/Linux distribution for
myself or family and friends, the ArchWiki had my back!</p>
<p>Whenever I want to better understand a software, the ArchWiki is most
often the first page I end up consulting.</p>
<p><em>You are one of the pearls of the internet!</em> Or in Edward Snowden's
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Is it just me, or have search results become absolute garbage for
  basically every site? It's nearly impossible to discover useful
  information these days (outside the ArchWiki). "
  <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1460666075033575425">https://x.com/Snowden/status/1460666075033575425</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, to all the ArchWiki contributors for gathering all the
knowledge to help others in society to better understand technology and for
the ArchWiki maintainers to ensure the long term availability and
reliability of this crucial resource.</p>
<p>If you also appreciated the work of the ArchWiki maintainers for our
society, tell them as well, and I encourage you to make a <a href="https://archlinux.org/donate/">donation to
Arch</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Thanks also to Morton for connecting me with Ferdinand and Levente
at FOSDEM.</p>

    This is a "byte" post. It may not be as detailed as other posts.
  </p><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I like things that are strange and a bit obscure. It’s a habit of mine, and a lot of this blog is to document things I haven’t heard of before, because I wanted to learn about them. I mean, jeez, I’m certainly not writing blog posts about <a href="https://nicole.express/2026/put-your-clothes-back-on.html">strip </a><a href="https://nicole.express/2026/spooky-ghost-stories.html">mahjong</a> because the people demand it. But I can’t stop seeing misinformation everywhere, and I have to say something. This post is just a rant.</p>

<h2 id="phantasy-star-fukkokuban"><em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em></h2>

<p>This is <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em>, a Japanese Sega Genesis game released in 1994 to commemorate the release of <em>Phantasy Star IV</em> by re-releasing the original. It has an interesting component: it is the Master System game, just packaged into a Genesis cart. The PCB wires the Genesis lines the same way your Power Base Converter would. My guess is the reason for this is because the Master System wasn’t very popular in Japan, and <em>Phantasy Star IV</em> tied together the whole series with a lot of tiebacks to the first one in particular.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/2sega/fuk.jpeg" title="You know, Sega could've included the FM soundtrack, if they had shelled out for a YM2413 in the cart" alt="Phantasy Star Fukkokuban, which uses the Phantasy Star box art on a Japanese cartridge shell."></p>

<p>As a Master System game disguised as a Genesis one, this game is technically interesting. Some Genesis consoles can’t play Master System games, and those ones can’t play this game either. Also, I love the <em>Phantasy Star</em> series; even if 2 is my favorite. This makes this cartridge a perfect subject for my interest, so I’ve talked about it before and will talk about it again. In fact, I have a post I’m working on where I mention it.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/ps1987.png" title="taken on my mega drive 2" alt="Phantasy Star title screen. (C) SEGA 1987"></p>

<p>So there I was, writing a blog post, and wanted to look up the release date. The first result I found in DuckDuckGo, my search engine?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/results.png" title="all results are personalized these days I assume" alt="DuckDuckGo search results. First, GameFAQs. Second, TCRF. Third, Press Start Gaming. An abandonware site is at the bottom"></p>

<p><a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/genesis/570415-phantasy-star-fukkokuban">GameFAQs</a> is at the top; a titan since the 1990’s. The second result is <a href="https://tcrf.net/Phantasy_Star">The Cutting Room Floor</a>, a wiki much beloved by myself. And then the third result is <a href="https://pressstartgaming.com/phantasy-star-fukkokuban-a-classic-reimagined/">“Press Start Gaming”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/start.png" title="finally, a console for my horrifying NES-Genesis hybrid" alt="Welcome to Press Start Gaming, your ultimate destination for gaming and tech enthusiasts! Founded with a passion for exploring the ever-evolving worlds of gaming and technology, we aim to deliver high-quality reviews, insightful articles, and the latest industry news to help you stay informed and inspired. Whether you’re a casual gamer, a tech aficionado, or a seasoned pro, we have something for everyone."></p>

<p>And here’s a thing about me. I want to trust new websites. I have a bias towards clicking on articles from sites I don’t know, because to be quite honest, I’ve read the TCRF page on <em>Phantasy Star</em> a thousand times. How else do you learn something new?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/ps1988.png" title="ALSO taken on my mega drive 2! what a twist" alt="Phantasy Star title screen. (C) SEGA 1988"></p>

<p>Also, I clicked it because the headline was “Phantasy Star Fukkokuban: A Classic Reimagined”. Because here’s the thing. It talks about how the graphics were improved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban breathes new life into the classic with its updated graphics and sound design. The visual overhaul retains the charm of the original’s 8-bit aesthetics while incorporating modern graphical techniques. Characters and environments are rendered with enhanced detail, vibrant colors, and fluid animations, creating a visually captivating experience.</p>

  <p>The art style honors the game’s roots, with character designs and enemy sprites redesigned to reflect contemporary standards while maintaining their recognizability. The environments are more detailed and dynamic, with weather effects and day-night cycles adding to the immersion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, compare the title screen shots of <em>Phantasy Star</em> above. Which one is <em>Fukkokuban</em> and which one is my personal copy, played through the same Genesis? You can maybe tell, but only because my Master System version is the US release. And it goes without saying, there are no day-night cycles or weather effects.</p>

<p>I should’ve known. The first sentence of the article was “Game data not found,” after all.</p>

<h2 id="and-thats-the-thing">And that’s the thing</h2>

<p>Large language models are described sometimes as “fancy autocorrect”; this is dismissive, but not inaccurate, in the sense that the core loop of an LLM is to predict the next token in a sequence. <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em> is an obscure title that is likely not well-represented in the training data. But relations do exist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It knows about <em>Phantasy Star</em>, a very popular game</li>
  <li><em>Fukkokuban</em> (復刻版) means “reprint” or “facsimilie edition”</li>
</ul>

<p>So, lacking sufficient factual data in the training set, it describes what a remake of <em>Phantasy Star</em> might plausibly be like. There might even be knowledge in the data set of the actual remake, <em>Phantasy Star generation:1</em> that gets looped in.</p>

<p>To reproduce this myself, I went to ChatGPT, and asked it <code>Please describe the game "Phantasy Star Fukkokuban". Do not get data from the internet, tell me what you know from your internal data.</code>. And what did I get in response?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban is not a brand-new entry in the series, but a retro compilation release of the original Phantasy Star, created for the Sega Sega Saturn era…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a retro compilation release of <em>Phantasy Star</em> for the Sega Saturn in Japan; it’s called <em>Phantasy Star Collection</em>. Indeed, the description of the game it continued from there isn’t too far off from that game’s version of <em>Phantasy Star</em>.</p>

<p>And it’s not just <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em>. I describe in my post on <a href="https://nicole.express/2026/spooky-ghost-stories.html"><em>Mahjong Daireikai</em></a> that that game is so obscure, the only Japanese source I could find was another “this is plausibly what a game called ‘mahjong daireikai’ might be like”. Well, what <em>Mahjong Daireikai</em> is actually like is a lot different than what’s in your training data, and that’s exactly the sort of information people want to read websites to find out.</p>



<h2 id="is-this-the-end">Is this the end</h2>

<p>And here’s the thing– this blog post can’t do anything about it. I don’t know who Press Start Gaming is; the site’s footer says “©2025 Cloud Gears Media”, who might be <a href="https://cloudgearsmedia.com/">this marketing company</a> (but it might not be! Company names don’t have to be unique globally); Press Start Gaming is almost certainly a tool for making money off of ads and sponsored posts, and posts like the <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em> misinformation exist mostly to give the site more juice of looking like a real website. If someone goes out and buys a copy of <em>Fukkokuban</em> expecting a new and improved <em>Phantasy Star</em> with better graphics and new sidequests, what do they care? The article wasn’t really meant to provide information.</p>

<p>The trampling of the internet with SEO-mongers predates AI, but what LLMs do is massively increase the ease it can be done, and also hallucinate a ton. If they hired a person to write about <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em> for pennies, maybe that person would’ve found the <a href="https://segaretro.org/Phantasy_Star#Phantasy_Star_Fukkokuban">Sega Retro</a> page or something and at least grabbed some facts. Now you don’t need to do even that. And no one making these decisions reads <em>Nicole Express</em>, or even cares about actually providing information with their sites. That’s not what they’re for.</p>

<p>Anyways, eventually models will do a better job integrating <em>Nicole Express</em>, and will know more information about <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em>. And is this the worst thing the AI boom is doing? <a href="https://www.aol.com/news/naacp-threatens-sue-musk-xai-233138040.html">No,</a> <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/groups-threaten-suit-over-xai-223759493.html">not</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/tech/openai-chatgpt-teen-suicide-lawsuit">even</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-fear-ai-permanently-displacing-workers-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-08-19/">close.</a> Even the <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">fully automated hit piece</a> against an open-source developer is probably worse than this.</p>

<p>But it’s a real shame. The commons of the internet are probably already lost, and while I might want to learn new things from new sites, I’ll just have to stick to those with pre-LLM reptuations that I trust. Well, until those sites burn their reputations to make a few extra pennies with AI, like <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@xot/116065688012051690"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> seems to just have. (link goes to a Mastodon thread in lieu of a better source for now)</p>

<p>This post is just a rant. Thanks for listening, at least.</p>

<p>It drew me a <em>really good</em> <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7e317ebb5cf8e75b2fcec4d0694a8199">SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a>! I think this is the best one I've seen so far - here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">my previous collection</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="This alt text also generated by Gemini 3 Deep Think: A highly detailed, colorful, flat vector illustration with thick dark blue outlines depicting a stylized white pelican riding a bright cyan blue bicycle from left to right across a sandy beige beach with white speed lines indicating forward motion. The pelican features a light blue eye, a pink cheek blush, a massive bill with a vertical gradient from yellow to orange, a backward magenta cap with a cyan brim and a small yellow top button, and a matching magenta scarf blowing backward in the wind. Its white wing, accented with a grey mid-section and dark blue feather tips, reaches forward to grip the handlebars, while its long tan leg and orange foot press down on an orange pedal. Attached to the front handlebars is a white wire basket carrying a bright blue cartoon fish that is pointing upwards and forwards. The bicycle itself has a cyan frame, dark blue tires, striking neon pink inner rims, cyan spokes, a white front chainring, and a dark blue chain. Behind the pelican, a grey trapezoidal pier extends from the sand toward a horizontal band of deep blue ocean water detailed with light cyan wavy lines. A massive, solid yellow-orange semi-circle sun sits on the horizon line, setting directly behind the bicycle frame. The background sky is a smooth vertical gradient transitioning from soft pink at the top to warm golden-yellow at the horizon, decorated with stylized pale peach fluffy clouds, thin white horizontal wind streaks, twinkling four-pointed white stars, and small brown v-shaped silhouettes of distant flying birds." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-pelican.png"></p>
<p>(And since it's an FAQ, here's my answer to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/13/training-for-pelicans-riding-bicycles/">What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles?</a>)</p>
<p>Since it did so well on my basic <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code> I decided to try the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/18/gemini-3/#and-a-new-pelican-benchmark">more challenging version</a> as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers. The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle. The image should show the full breeding plumage of the California brown pelican.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/154c0cc7b4daed579f6a5e616250ecc8">what I got</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Also described by Gemini 3 Deep Think: A highly detailed, vibrant, and stylized vector illustration of a whimsical bird resembling a mix between a pelican and a frigatebird enthusiastically riding a bright cyan bicycle from left to right across a flat tan and brown surface. The bird leans horizontally over the frame in an aerodynamic racing posture, with thin, dark brown wing-like arms reaching forward to grip the silver handlebars and a single thick brown leg, patterned with white V-shapes, stretching down to press on a black pedal. The bird's most prominent and striking feature is an enormous, vividly bright red, inflated throat pouch hanging beneath a long, straight grey upper beak that ends in a small orange hook. Its head is mostly white with a small pink patch surrounding the eye, a dark brown stripe running down the back of its neck, and a distinctive curly pale yellow crest on the very top. The bird's round, dark brown body shares the same repeating white V-shaped feather pattern as its leg and is accented by a folded wing resting on its side, made up of cleanly layered light blue and grey feathers. A tail composed of four stiff, straight dark brown feathers extends directly backward. Thin white horizontal speed lines trail behind the back wheel and the bird's tail, emphasizing swift forward motion. The bicycle features a classic diamond frame, large wheels with thin black tires, grey rims, and detailed silver spokes, along with a clearly visible front chainring, silver chain, and rear cog. The whimsical scene is set against a clear light blue sky featuring two small, fluffy white clouds on the left and a large, pale yellow sun in the upper right corner that radiates soft, concentric, semi-transparent pastel green and yellow halos. A solid, darker brown shadow is cast directly beneath the bicycle's wheels on the minimalist two-toned brown ground." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-complex-pelican.png"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jan.  28, 2026, 3:09 p.m.</p><p>Outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times are scrutinizing digital archives as potential backdoors for AI crawlers.</p><div id="content_div-247528">


<p>As part of its mission to preserve the web, the Internet Archive operates crawlers that capture webpage snapshots. Many of these snapshots are accessible through its public-facing tool, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>. But as AI bots scavenge the web for training data to feed their models, the Internet Archive’s commitment to free information access has turned its digital library into a potential liability for some news publishers.</p>
<p>When The Guardian took a look at who was trying to extract its content, access logs revealed that the Internet Archive was a frequent crawler, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-hahn-08b45719/">Robert Hahn</a>, head of business affairs and licensing. The publisher decided to limit the Internet Archive’s access to published articles, minimizing the chance that AI companies might scrape its content via the nonprofit’s repository of over one trillion webpage snapshots.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hahn said The Guardian has taken steps to exclude itself from the Internet Archive’s APIs and filter out its article pages from the Wayback Machine’s URLs interface. The Guardian’s regional homepages, topic pages, and other landing pages will continue to appear in the Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>In particular, Hahn expressed concern about the <a href="https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php">Internet Archive’s APIs</a>. </p>
<p>“A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,” he said. “The Internet Archive’s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.” (He admits the Wayback Machine itself is “less risky,” since the data is not as well-structured.)</p>
<p>As news publishers try to safeguard their contents from AI companies, the Internet Archive is also getting caught in the crosshairs. The Financial Times, for example, blocks any bot that tries to scrape its paywalled content, including bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and the Internet Archive. The majority of FT stories are paywalled, according to director of global public policy and platform strategy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrogerson/">Matt Rogerson</a>. As a result, usually only unpaywalled FT stories appear in the Wayback Machine because those are meant to be available to the wider public anyway.</p>
<p>“Common Crawl and Internet Archive are widely considered to be the ‘good guys’ and are used by ‘the bad guys’ like OpenAI,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellloydnelson/">said Michael Nelson</a>, a computer scientist and professor at Old Dominion University. “In everyone’s aversion to not be controlled by LLMs, I think the good guys are collateral damage.”</p>

<p>The Guardian hasn’t documented specific instances of its webpages being scraped by AI companies via the Wayback Machine. Instead, it’s taking these measures proactively and is working directly with the Internet Archive to implement the changes. Hahn says the organization has been receptive to The Guardian’s concerns.</p>
<p>The outlet stopped short of an all-out block on the Internet Archive’s crawlers, Hahn said, because it supports the nonprofit’s mission to democratize information, though that position remains under review as part of its routine bot management. </p>
<p>“[The decision] was much more about compliance and a backdoor threat to our content,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about The Guardian’s decision, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle said that “if publishers limit libraries, like the Internet Archive, then the public will have less access to the historical record.” It’s a prospect, he implied, that could undercut the organization’s work countering “<a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/training/information-disorder/">information disorder</a>.”</p>

<p>The Guardian isn’t alone in reevaluating its relationship to the Internet Archive. The New York Times confirmed to Nieman Lab that it’s actively “hard blocking” the Internet Archive’s crawlers. At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251223163226/http://nytimes.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">end of 2025</a>, the Times also added one of those crawlers — archive.org_bot — to its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">robots.txt file</a>, disallowing access to its content.</p>
<p>“We believe in the value of The New York Times’s human-led journalism and always want to ensure that our IP is being accessed and used lawfully,” said a Times spokesperson. “We are blocking the Internet Archive’s bot from accessing the Times because the Wayback Machine provides unfettered access to Times content — including by AI companies — without authorization.”</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">Reddit announced</a> that it would block the Internet Archive, whose digital libraries include countless archived Reddit forums, comments sections, and profiles. This content is not unlike what Reddit now licenses to <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/reddit-winning-ai-licensing-deals-openai-google-gemini-answers-rsl.php">Google as AI training data for tens of millions of dollars</a>.</p>
<p>“[The] Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we’ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” a Reddit spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">told The Verge</a> at the time. “Until they’re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies…we’re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.”</p>
<p>Kahle has also alluded to steps the Internet Archive is taking to restrict bulk access to its libraries. In a <a href="https://mastodon.archive.org/@brewsterkahle/115368911896794707">Mastodon post</a> last fall, he wrote that “there are many collections that are available to users but not for bulk downloading. We use internal rate-limiting systems, filtering mechanisms, and network security services such as Cloudflare.”</p>
<p>Currently, however, the Internet Archive does not disallow any specific crawlers through its robots.txt file, including those of major AI companies. As of January 12, the robots.txt file for <a href="http://archive.org/">archive.org</a> read: “​​Welcome to the Archive! Please crawl our files. We appreciate it if you can crawl responsibly. Stay open!” Shortly after we inquired about this language, it was changed. The file now reads, simply, “Welcome to the Internet Archive!”</p>

<p>There is evidence that the Wayback Machine, generally speaking, has been used to train LLMs in the past. An <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-chatbot-learning/">analysis of Google’s C4 dataset</a> by the Washington Post in 2023 showed that the Internet Archive was among millions of websites in the training data used to build Google’s T5 model and Meta’s Llama models. Out of the 15 million domains in the C4 dataset, the domain for the Wayback Machine (<a href="http://web.archive.org/">web.archive.org</a>) was ranked as the 187th most present.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the Internet Archive went <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/">offline</a> temporarily after an AI company caused a server overload, Wayback Machine director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjohngraham/">Mark Graham</a> told Nieman Lab this past fall. The company sent tens of thousands of requests per second from virtual hosts on Amazon Web Services to extract text data from the nonprofit’s public domain archives. The Internet Archive blocked the hosts twice before putting out a public call to “respectfully” scrape its site.</p>
<p>“We got in contact with them. They ended up giving us a donation,” Graham said. “They ended up saying that they were sorry and they stopped doing it.”</p>
<p>“Those wanting to use our materials in bulk should start slowly, and ramp up,” <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/">wrote Kahle in a blog post</a> shortly after the incident. “Also, if you are starting a large project please contact us …we are here to help.”</p>
<p>The Guardian’s moves to limit the Internet Archive’s access made us wonder whether other news publishers were taking similar actions. We looked at publishers’ robots.txt pages as a way to measure potential concern over the Internet Archive’s crawling.</p>
<p>A website’s robots.txt page tells bots which parts of the site they can crawl, acting like a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRlQ965pGCA&amp;t=0">doorman</a>,” telling visitors who is and isn’t allowed in the house and which parts are off limits. Robots.txt pages aren’t legally binding, so the companies running crawling bots aren’t obligated to comply with them, but they indicate where the Internet Archive is unwelcome.</p>
<p>For example, in addition to “hard blocking,” The New York Times and The Athletic include the archive.org_bot in their robots.txt file, though they do not currently disallow other bots operated by the Internet Archive. </p>
<p>To explore this issue, Nieman Lab used journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/palewire/">Ben Welsh</a>‘s <a href="https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/openai-gptbot-robotstxt.html">database of 1,167 news websites</a> as a starting point. As part of a larger side project to archive news sites’ homepages, Welsh runs crawlers that regularly scrape the robots.txt files of the outlets in his database. In late December, we downloaded a spreadsheet from Welsh’s site that displayed all the bots disallowed in the robots.txt files of those sites. We identified four bots that the AI user agent watchdog service <a href="https://darkvisitors.com/">Dark Visitors</a> has associated with the Internet Archive. (The Internet Archive did not respond to requests to confirm its ownership of these bots.) </p>
<p>This data is not comprehensive, but exploratory. It does not represent global, industry-wide trends — 76% of sites in the Welsh’s publisher list are based in the U.S., for example — but instead begins to shed light on which publishers are less eager to have their content crawled by the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>In total, 241 news sites from nine countries explicitly disallow at least one out of the four Internet Archive crawling bots. </p>
<p>Most of those sites (87%) are owned by USA Today Co., the largest newspaper conglomerate in the United States formerly known as Gannett. (Gannett sites only make up 18% of Welsh’s original publishers list.) Each Gannett-owned outlet in our dataset disallows the same two bots: “archive.org_bot” and “ia_archiver-web.archive.org”. These bots were added to the robots.txt files of Gannett-owned publications in 2025.</p>
<p>Some Gannett sites have also taken stronger measures to guard their contents from Internet Archive crawlers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260000000000*/desmoinesregister.com">URL searches for the Des Moines Register in the Wayback Machine</a> return a message that says, “Sorry. This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.”</p>
<p>“USA Today Co. has consistently emphasized the importance of safeguarding our content and intellectual property,” a company spokesperson said via email. “Last year, we introduced new protocols to deter unauthorized data collection and scraping, redirecting such activity to a designated <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/bot-detection">page</a> outlining our licensing requirements.”</p>
<p>Gannett declined to comment further on its relationship with the Internet Archive. In an October 2025 <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-gannett-cos-q3-2025-digital-focus-amid-revenue-dip-93CH-4320263">earnings call</a>, CEO Mike Reed spoke to the company’s anti-scraping measures. </p>
<p>“In September alone, we blocked 75 million AI bots across our local and USA Today platforms, the vast majority of which were seeking to scrape our local content,” Reed said on that call. “About 70 million of those came from OpenAI.” (<a href="https://www.usatodayco.com/pr/gannett-i-usa-today-network-and-perplexity-announce-strategic-ai-content-licensing-ageement/#:~:text=Gannett%20I%20USA%20TODAY%20Network,available%20for%20a%20broader%20audience.">Gannett signed a content licensing agreement with Perplexity in July 2025</a>.)</p>
<p>About 93% (226 sites) of publishers in our dataset disallow two out of the four Internet Archive bots we identified. Three news sites in the sample disallow three Internet Archive crawlers: Le Huffington Post, Le Monde, and Le Monde in English, all of which are owned by Group Le Monde.</p>

<p>The news sites in our sample aren’t only targeting the Internet Archive. Out of the 241 sites that disallow at least one of the four Internet Archive bots in our sample, 240 sites disallow Common Crawl — another nonprofit internet preservation project that has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-fight-against-ai-comes-to-a-foundational-data-set/">more closely linked to commercial LLM development</a>. Of our sample, 231 sites all disallow bots operated by OpenAI, Google AI, and Common Crawl.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/10/the-wayback-machines-snapshots-of-news-homepages-plummet-after-a-breakdown-in-archiving-projects/">previously reported</a>, the Internet Archive has taken on the Herculean task of preserving the internet, and many news organizations aren’t equipped to save their own work. In December, Poynter <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2025/poynter-ire-and-internet-archive-launch-todays-news-for-tomorrow-a-project-to-help-newsrooms-preserve-their-digital-footprint/">announced</a> a joint initiative with the Internet Archive to train local news outlets on how to preserve their content. Archiving initiatives like this, while urgently needed, are  few and far between. Since there is no federal mandate that requires internet content to be preserved, the Internet Archive is the most robust archiving initiative in the United States.</p>
<p>“The Internet Archive tends to be good citizens,” Hahn said. “It’s the law of unintended consequences: You do something for really good purposes, and it gets abused.”</p>
