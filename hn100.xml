            <p>Welcome back for a <strong>~~bonus post~~</strong> about Engineering for Slow Internet!</p>
            <p>For a 14-month period, while working in Antarctica, I had access to the Internet only through an
              extremely limited series of satellite links provided by the United States Antarctic Program.</p>

              Polar use.</p>

            <p>If you’re interested, perhaps also look into the
              <a href="https://www.usap.gov/news/4685/">2021 Antarctic Subsea Cable Workshop</a>
              for an overview of some hurdles associated with running traditional fiber to the continent.</p>
            <p><strong><em>I am absolutely not in a position of authority to speculate on the future of Antarctic connectivity!</em></strong>
              Seriously. I was a low-level, seasonal IT worker in a large, complex organization.
              Do not email me your
              ideas for improving Internet access in Antarctica – I am not in a position to do anything with them.</p>
            <p>I do agree with the widespread consensus on the matter: There is <strong>tremendous interest</strong> in
              improving connectivity to US research stations in Antarctica. I would timidly conjecture that, at some point,
              there will be engineering solutions to these problems.
              Improved connectivity will eventually arrive in Antarctica,
              either through enhanced satellite technologies or through the arrival of fiber to the continent.</p>
            <p>But – that world will only exist at some point in the future. Currently, Antarctic connectivity is
              <em>extremely limited</em>. What do I mean by that?</p>
            <p>Until very recently, at McMurdo, nearly <strong>a thousand people</strong>, plus numerous scientific
              projects and operational workloads, all relied on a series of links
              that provided max, aggregate speeds of a few dozen megabits
              per second to the <strong>entire station</strong>.
              For comparison, that’s less bandwidth shared by everyone <strong>combined</strong> than what
              everyone <strong>individually</strong> can get on a typical 4g cellular network in an American suburb.</p>
            <p>Things <strong>are</strong> looking up! The NSF recently
              <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=307974&amp;org=OPP">announced</a> some important developments
              regarding Starlink at McMurdo and Palmer.</p>
            <p>I’m aware that the on-the-ground experience in McMurdo and Palmer is better now than it was even just a year ago.</p>
            <p>But – as of October 2023, the situation was still pretty dire at the South Pole.
              As far as I’m aware, similar developments regarding Starlink have <strong>not</strong> yet been announced for South Pole Station.</p>
            <p>As of October 2023, South Pole had the limitations described above,
              <strong>plus</strong> there was only connectivity for a few hours a day, when the satellites rose above the horizon
              and the station was authorized to use them.
              The satellite schedule generally shifts forward (earlier) by about 4 minutes per day, due to
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">difference between Sidereal time and Solar (Civil) time</a>.</p>
            <p>The current satellite schedule can be found online, on the
              <a href="https://www.usap.gov/technology/sctnsouthpolesats.cfm">South Pole Satellite Communications</a> page
              of the public USAP.gov website. Here’s an example of the schedule from October 2023:</p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>These small intermittent links to the outside world are shared by <strong>everyone at Pole</strong>, for operational,
              science, and community / morale usage.</p>
            <p>Complicating matters further is the unavoidable physics of this connectivity.
              These satellites are in a high orbit, thousands of miles up. This means high latency. If you’ve used
              a consumer satellite product such as HughesNet or ViaSat, you’ll understand.</p>
            <p>From my berthing room at the South Pole, it was about <strong>750 milliseconds</strong>, round trip,
              for a packet to get to and from a terrestrial US destination.
              This is about <strong>ten times</strong> the latency of a round trip
              between the US East and West coasts (up to 75 ms).
              And it’s about <strong>thirty times</strong> the expected
              latency of a healthy connection from your home, on a terrestrial cable or fiber connection,
              to most major content delivery networks (up to 25 ms).</p>
            <p>Seriously, I can’t emphasize how jarring this is. At my apartment back home, on GPON fiber,
              it’s about 3 ms roundtrip to Fastly, Cloudflare, CloudFront, Akamai, and Google.
              At the South Pole, the latency was over <strong>two hundred and fifty times greater</strong>.</p>
            <p>I can’t go into more depth about how USAP does prioritization, shaping,
              etc, because I’m not authorized to share these details. Suffice to say, if you’re an enterprise network
              engineer used to working in a bandwidth-constrained environment, you’ll feel right at home with the
              equipment, tools, and techniques used to manage Antarctic connectivity.</p>
            <p>Any individual trying to use the Internet for community use at the South Pole, as of October 2023,
              likely faced:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Round-trip latency averaging around 750 milliseconds, with jitter between
                packets sometimes exceeding several seconds.</li>
              <li>Available speeds, to the end-user device, that range from a couple kbps (yes, you read that right),
                up to 2 mbps on a <strong>really good</strong> day.</li>
              <li>Extreme congestion, queueing, and dropped packets, far in excess of even the worst oversaturated ISP links
                or bufferbloat-infested routers back home.</li>
              <li>Limited availability, frequent dropouts, and occasional service preemptions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These constraints <em>drastically</em> impact the modern web experience! Some of it is unavoidable. The link characteristics
              described above are truly bleak. But – a lot of the end-user
              impact is caused by web and app engineering which fails to take slow/intermittent links
              into consideration.</p>
            <p>If you’re an app developer reading this, can you tell me, off the top of your head, how your app behaves
              on a link with 40 kbps available bandwidth, 1,000 ms latency, occasional jitter of up to 2,000 ms,
              packet loss of 10%, and a complete 15-second connectivity dropout every few minutes?</p>
            <p>It’s probably not great! And yet – these are real-world performance parameters that I encountered,
              under certain conditions, at the South Pole.
              It’s normally better than this, but this does occur, and it occurs often enough
              that it’s worth taking seriously.</p>
            <p>This is what happens when you have a tiny pipe to share among high-priority
              operational needs, plus dozens of community users. Operational needs are aggressively prioritized,
              and the community soaks up whatever is left.</p>
            <p>I’m not expecting miracles here! Obviously no amount of client engineering can make, say, real-time video
              conferencing work under these conditions. But – getting a few bytes of text in and out <strong>should</strong> still be possible!
              I know it is possible, because some apps are still able to do it. Others are not.</p>
            <h2 id="detailed-real-world-example">Detailed, Real-world Example</h2>
            <p>One day at the South Pole, I was trying to load the website of <strong><em>&lt;$enterprise_collaboration_platform&gt;</em></strong>
              in my browser. It’s <em>huge</em>! It needed to load nearly 20 MB of Javascript, <em>just</em> to render the main screen!
              And of course, the app had been updated since last time I loaded it, so all of my browser’s cached assets were
              stale and had to be re-downloaded.</p>
            <p>Fine! It’s slow, but at least it will work… eventually, right? Browsers do a decent job of handling
              slow Internet. Under the hood, the underlying protocols do a decent job at congestion control.
              I should get a steady trickle of data. This will be
              subject to the negotiated send and receive windows between client and server,
              which are based on the current level of congestion on the link, and which are further influenced by any
              shaping done by middleware along the way.</p>
            <p>It’s a complex webapp, so the app developer would also need to implement some
              of their own retry logic. This allows for recovery in the event that individual assets fail,
              especially for those long, multi-second total connectivity dropouts.
              But eventually, given enough time, the transfers should complete.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this is where things broke down and got really annoying. <em>The developers implemented
                a global failure trigger somewhere in the app.</em>
              If the app didn’t fully load within the parameters specified by the developer
              (time? number of retries? I’m not sure.), then the app
              <strong>stopped, gave up, redirected you to an error page, dropped all the loading progress you’d made, and
                implemented aggressive cache-busting countermeasures for next time you retried.</strong></p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/media/engineering-for-slow-internet/load-error-01.png">

                </picture>
                <em>The app wasn't loading fast enough, and the developers decided that the app should give up instead
                  of continuing to load slowly.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot tell you how frustrating this was! Connectivity at the South Pole was never going to meet the
              performance expectations set by engineers using a robust terrestrial Internet connection.
              It’s not a good idea to hardcode a single, static, global expectation for how long
              20 MB of Javascript should take to download.
              Why not let me load it at my own pace? I’ll get there
              when I get there. <em>As long as data is still moving, however slow, just let it run.</em></p>
            <p>But – the developers decided that if the app didn’t load within the parameters they set,
              I couldn’t use it at all.
              And to be clear – this was primarily a <strong>messaging</strong> app. The actual content payload here, when
              the app is running and I’m chatting with my friends, is measured in <em>bytes</em>.</p>
            <p>As it turns out, our Internet performance at the South Pole was  <em>right on the edge</em> of what the app
              developers considered “acceptable”. So, if I kept reloading the page, and if I kept
              letting it re-download the same 20 MB of Javascript, and if I kept putting up with the
              developer’s cache-busting shenanigans, <em>eventually</em> it finished before the artificial failure criteria.</p>
            <p>What this means is that I wasted <em>extra</em> bandwidth doing all these useless reloads, and it took sometimes
              <strong>hours</strong> before I was able to use the app. All of this hassle, even though, if left alone,
              I could complete the necessary data transfer in 15 minutes.
              Several hours (and a shameful amount of retried Javascript) later, I was finally able to send a short,
              text-based message to my friends.</p>

            <p>Does this webapp <strong>really need</strong> to be 20 MB? What all is
              being loaded that could be deferred until it is needed, or included in an “optional” add-on bundle?
              Is there a possibility of a “lite” version, for bandwidth-constrained users?</p>
            <p>In my 14 months in Antarctica, I collected <strong>dozens</strong> of examples of apps like this, with artificial
              constraints built in that rendered them unusable or borderline-unusable.</p>
            <p>For the rest of this post, I’ll outline some of my major frustrations, and what I would have liked
              to see instead that would mitigate the issues.</p>
            <p>I understand that not every app is in a position to implement all of these! If you’re
              a tiny app, just getting off the ground, I don’t expect you to spend all of your development time optimizing
              for weirdos in Antarctica.</p>
            <p>Yes, Antarctica is an edge case! Yes, 750 ms / 10% packet loss / 40 kbps <strong>is</strong> rather extreme.
              But the South Pole was not <strong>uniquely</strong> bad. There are entire commercial marine vessels that rely on older
              <a href="https://www.inmarsat.com/">Inmarsat</a> solutions for a few hundred precious kbps of data while at sea.
              There’s someone at a remote research site deep in the mountains right now, trying to load your app on
              a <a href="https://www.iridium.com/products/thales-missionlink-700/">Thales MissionLink</a> using the Iridium
              Certus network at a few dozen kbps.
              There are folks behind misconfigured routers, folks with flaky
              wifi, folks stuck with fly-by-night WISPs delivering sub-par service. Folks who still use dial-up
              Internet connections over degraded copper phone lines.</p>
            <p>These folks are worthy of your consideration. At the very least, you should make an effort to avoid
              <strong>actively interfering</strong> with their ability to use your products.</p>
            <p>So, without further ado, here are some examples of development patterns that routinely caused me grief at
              the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="hardcoded-timeouts-hardcoded-chunk-size">Hardcoded Timeouts, Hardcoded Chunk Size</h2>
            <p>As per the above example, <strong>do not hardcode your assumptions about how long a given payload will take to
                transfer, or how much you can transfer in a single request.</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>If you have the ability to measure whether bytes are flowing, and they are, <strong>leave them alone</strong>, no
                matter how slow. Perhaps show some UI indicating what is happening.</li>
              <li>If you are doing an HTTPS call,
                fall back to a longer timeout if the call fails. Maybe it just needs more time under current network
                conditions.</li>
              <li>If you’re having trouble moving large amounts of data in a single HTTPS call, break it up. Divide the
                content into chunks, transfer small chunks at a time, and <strong>diligently keep track of the progress</strong>, to
                allow resuming and retrying small bits without losing all progress so far. Slow, steady,
                incremental progress is better than a one-shot attempt to transfer a huge amount of data.</li>
              <li>If you can’t get an HTTPS call done successfully, do some troubleshooting. Try DNS, ICMP,
                HTTP (without TLS), HTTPS to a known good status endpoint, etc. This information might be helpful
                for troubleshooting, and it’s better than blindly retrying the same end-to-end HTTPS call.
                This HTTPS call requires a bunch of under-the-hood stuff to be working properly. Clearly it’s not,
                so you should make an effort to figure out why and let your user know.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-1---in-app-metadata-download">Example 1 - In-App Metadata Download</h3>
            <p>A popular desktop application tries to download some configuration information from the vendor’s website
              at startup. There is a hardcoded timeout for the HTTPS call. <strong>If it fails, the app will not load.</strong> It’ll
              just keep retrying the same call, with the same parameters, forever. It’ll sit on the loading page,
              without telling you what’s wrong. I’ve confirmed this is what’s happening by reading the logs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Luckily, if you kept trying, the call would eventually make it through under network conditions I
              experienced at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>It’s frustrating
              that just a single hardcoded timeout value, in an otherwise perfectly-functional and enterprise-grade
              application, can render it almost unusable. The developers could have:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fallen back to increasingly-long timeouts to try and get a successful result.</li>
              <li>Done some connection troubleshooting to infer more about the current network environment, and
                responded accordingly.</li>
              <li>Shown UX explaining what was going on.</li>
              <li>Used a cached or default-value configuration, if it couldn’t get the live one, instead of simply
                refusing to load.</li>
              <li>Provided a mechanism for the user to manually download and install the required data, bypassing the
                app’s built-in (and naive) download logic.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-2---chat-apps">Example 2 - Chat Apps</h3>
            <p>A popular chat app (“app #1”) maintains a websocket for sending and receiving data.
              The initialization process for that websocket uses a <strong>hardcoded 10-second timeout</strong>.
              Upon cold boot, when network conditions are especially congested, that websocket setup can sometimes take
              more than 10 seconds! We have to do a full TCP handshake, then set up a TLS session, then set up the
              websocket, then do initial signaling over the websocket.
              Remember – under some conditions, each individual roundtrip at the South Pole took multiple seconds!</p>
            <p>If the 10-second timeout elapses, the app simply does not work. It enters a very long backoff state
              before retrying. The UX does not clearly show what is happening.</p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/media/engineering-for-slow-internet/hardcoded-timeout-01.png">
                <picture>

                <em>Excerpt from debug log for chat app #1, showing the hardcoded 10-second timeout. We did indeed
                  have Internet access at this time -- it was just too congested to complete an entire TCP handshake +
                  TLS negotiation + websocket setup + request within this timeframe.
                  With a few more seconds, it may have finished.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, a competitor’s chat app (“app #2”) does <em>very well</em> in extremely degraded network
              conditions! It has multiple strategies for sending network requests, for resilience against
              certain types of degradation.
              It aggressively re-uses open connections. It dynamically adjusts timeouts.
              In the event of a failure, it intelligently chooses a retry cadence. And, throughout all of this,
              it has clear UX explaining current network state.</p>
            <p>The end result is that I could often use app #2 in network conditions when I could not use app #1. Both of
              them were just transmitting plain text! Just a few actual bytes of
              content! And even when I could not use app #2, it was at least telling
              me what it was trying to do. App #1 is written naively, with baked-in assumptions
              about connectivity that simply did not hold true at the South Pole.
              App #2 is written well, and it responds gracefully to the conditions it encounters in the wild.</p>
            <h3 id="example-3---incremental-transfer">Example 3 - Incremental Transfer</h3>
            <p>A chance to talk about my own blog publishing toolchain!</p>
            <p>The site you’re reading right now is a static Jekyll blog.
              Assets are stored on S3 and served through CloudFront. I build the static files locally here on my laptop,
              and I upload them directly to S3. Nothing fancy. No servers, no QA environment, no build system,
              no automated hooks, nothing dynamic.</p>
            <p>Given the extreme connectivity constraints at the South Pole,
              I wrote a Python script for publishing to S3 that
              worked well in the challenging environment. It uses the S3 API to upload assets in small chunks.
              It detects and resumes failed uploads without losing progress. It waits until everything is safely uploaded
              before publishing the new version.</p>
            <p>If I can do it, unpaid, working alone, for my silly little hobby blog, in 200 lines of Python…
              surely your team of engineers can do so for your flagship webapp.</p>
            <p>It’s amazing the usability improvements that come along with some proactive engineering. I had friends at Pole
              with blogs on commercial platforms, and who routinely shared large files to social
              media sites. They had
              to carefully time their day to maximize the likelihood of a successful “one-shot” upload, during a
              satellite window, using their platform’s poorly-engineered publishing tools.
              Often it took several retries, and it’s not always clear what was happening at every step of the process
              (Is the content live? Did the upload finish? Is it safe / should I hit “Post” again?).</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I was able to harvest whatever connectivity I could find.
              I got a few kilobytes uploaded here and there,
              whenever it was convenient. If a particular chunked POST failed, no worries!
              I could retry or resume, with minimal lost progress, at a later time.
              Once it was all done and staged, I could safely publish the new version.</p>

            <h2 id="bring-your-own-download">Bring-Your-Own-Download</h2>
            <p><strong>If you’re going to build in a downloader into your app, you have a high bar for quality that you have
                to meet.</strong> Otherwise, it’s going to fail in profoundly annoying or catastrophic ways.</p>
            <p>If I had to give one piece of advice:
              <strong><em>Let the user break out of your in-app downloader and use their own, if at all possible.</em></strong></p>
            <p>Provide a manual download link, ideally one that leads to whatever differential patch file the app was going
              to download. Don’t punish the user by making them download the full installer, just because your in-app patch
              downloader doesn’t meet their needs.</p>
            <p>This has the following benefits:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>If your downloader fails, the user can still get the file manually, using a more robust downloader
                of their choice, such as a web browser.</li>
              <li>The user can download the file one time, and share it with multiple devices.</li>
              <li>The user can download the file on a different computer than the one running the application.</li>
              <li>The user has the flexibility to schedule or manage the download based on whatever constraints they face.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this all so important when considering users at the South Pole?</strong></p>
            <p>Downloads <strong>are</strong> possible at the South Pole, but they are subject to unique constraints. The biggest
              constraint is the lack of 24x7 Internet. While I was there, I <em>knew</em> we would lose Internet access at a
              certain time!</p>
            <p>It’s a frustrating reality: with most apps that do their own downloads, we were powerless to do
              anything about this known break in connectivity. We just had to sit there and watch it fail, and
              often watch all our progress be lost.</p>
            <p>Let’s say I had a 4-hour window, every day, during which I could do (very slow!!) downloads. If the total
              amount of data I could download in those 4 hours was <strong>less</strong> than the total size of the payload
              I was downloading, then there is <em>no way</em> I could complete the download in one shot!
              I’d <em>have</em> to split it over multiple Internet windows. Often the app wouldn’t let me do so.</p>
            <p>And that’s not even considering the fact that access might be unreliable during that time! What if the
              underlying connection dropped and I had to resume the download? What if my plans changed and I needed
              to pause? I didn’t want to waste whatever precious little progress I’d made so far.</p>
            <p>A lot of modern apps include their own homegrown, artisanal, in-app downloaders for large payloads.
              By “in-app downloader”, I’m referring to the system that obtains the content for automatic updates,
              patches, content database updates, etc. The common theme here is
              that the app transparently downloads content for you, without you being exposed to the underlying
              details such as the URL or raw file. This includes UI patterns such as <em>Check for updates</em>,
              <em>Click here to download new version</em>, etc.</p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, most of these in-app downloaders are woefully ill-equipped for the task! Many of them lack
              pause/resume functionality, state notifications, retry logic, and progress tracking. Many of them have
              frustrating restrictions, such as time limits for downloading the payload. While most of these issues
              are mere annoyances in the land of fast Internet, at the South Pole, they can make or break
              the app entirely.</p>

            <p>Every app that includes an in-app downloader has to compete with an extraordinarily high bar for usability:
              <strong>web browsers</strong>.</p>
            <p>Think about it! Every modern web browser includes a download manager that contains
              Abort, Pause, and Resume functionality. It allows you to retry failed
              downloads (assuming the content URL doesn’t include an expiring token).
              It clearly shows you current status, download speed, and estimated time remaining. It allows you to choose
              where you save the underlying file, so you can copy it around if needed. And – it doesn’t include arbitrary
              performance cutoffs! If you really want to download a multi-gigabyte file at 60 kbps, go for it!</p>

            <p>The patch size for minor OS updates is usually between 0.5 and 1.5 gigabytes. Major OS upgrade patches are
              sometimes 6+ gigabytes. Additional tools, such as Xcode, are often multiple gigabytes.</p>

                <em>Sigh, yet another 1 GB patch for my personal macOS device at the South Pole.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>If every single macOS device at the South Pole downloaded these updates, directly from Apple, we would
              have wasted a tremendous amount of bandwidth. And the built-in macOS downloader certainly wanted
              us to do this! Look at this interface – few controls, no way to break out and easily get
              the underlying patch files. If I canceled the download, or if it failed for some reason, it didn’t always
              intelligently resume. Sometimes, I lost all my progress.</p>

                <em>The macOS updater. No pause button! Was I expected to leave my laptop on, connected to the Internet,
                  and untouched, for 15 days??</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Now – Apple <em>does</em> have a caching server feature built into macOS. In theory, this should alleviate some
              of the burden! We should be able to leverage this feature to ensure each patch is only downloaded to
              the South Pole one time, and then client Macs will hit the cache.</p>
            <p>I experimented with this feature in my spare time, with a handful of my own Apple devices.
              In practice, this feature still
              required each client Macbook to make a successful HTTPS call directly to Apple, to negotiate cache parameters.
              If this call failed, which it often did (<em>because of hardcoded short timeouts!!!</em>), then
              the client Mac just fetched the patch from public Apple servers. No retry, no notification. The client
              Mac just made a unilateral decision to bypass the cache, without any recourse or even a notification for
              the user. In practice, this initial cache negotiation call failed often enough
              at the South Pole that the caching feature wasn’t useful.</p>
            <p>What we <em>could</em> do was to fetch the full installer (12 gigabytes!) from Apple. Links to the full installer
              packages are conveniently aggregated on the
              <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-ventura-13-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/">Mr. Macintosh</a>
              blog. We could pull the full installer down to the South Pole slowly
              and conscientiously: throttled, at low,
              background priority, using robust, interrupt-tolerant
              tooling, with support for caching and resumption of paused or failed transfers.
              Once we had the file, we could distribute it on station.
              This process could take several days, but it was reliable.</p>
            <p>

                <em>The macOS full installer, painstakingly and conscientiously downloaded to the South Pole.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>But <em>even this</em> didn’t solve the problem! If the client Mac is Apple Silicon, it <em>still insisted</em> on
              downloading additional content directly from Apple, <em>even if</em> you ran the update using the full, 12 GB
              installer.
              There is no way to bypass or cache this. If the OS update required certain types of
              firmware updates or Rosetta updates, then <em>every Apple Silicon client Mac</em> would <em>still</em>
              download 1-2 GB of data directly from Apple during the install process.</p>
            <p>Even worse, the download process was sometimes farmed out to a separate component in
              macOS, which didn’t even report progress to the installer! Installing a macOS update at
              the South Pole meant staring at a window that said “installing, 32 minutes remaining”,
              for <em>several hours</em>, while a subcomponent of macOS downloaded a gigabyte of un-cacheable
              data in the background.</p>
            <p>Apple naively assumed that the 1 GB download would be so fast that they didn’t bother
              incorporating download speed feedback into the updater’s time estimate.
              They did not anticipate people installing
              macOS updates from a location where a gigabyte of downloads can take <strong>several hours</strong>, if not <strong>days</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can’t cache it, and you can’t download it directly using a web browser (or other mechanism). You have
              to let Apple’s downloader do it directly. And, of course, there’s no pause button. It is a major
              inconvenience to users, and a major waste of bandwidth, for each individual client Mac to
              download 1-2 GB of data in a single, uninterrupted shot.</p>
            <p><strong>Ways that Apple could make this significantly better for users with slow or otherwise-weird Internet:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Compute the required patch, and then give us a download link, so we can download it outside of
                Apple’s downloader.</li>
              <li>Improve the built-in update download tool with pause/resume functionality and intelligent state
                management, to ensure progress isn’t lost.</li>
              <li>Fix the full installer, so it includes <em>everything</em>, including all the currently-excluded items
                such as firmware and Rosetta updates for Apple Silicon Macs.
                It would be much more useful if it included everything. I
                could download it once, and then distribute it, without worrying about each Mac <em>still</em> needing to fetch
                additional data from Apple.</li>
              <li>Improve the Apple Caching Server feature, so it’s more reliable in situations where direct Internet
                access is unreliable. Give us more controls so that we can force a Mac to use it, and so that we can force
                the caching server to proactively download an item that we know will be needed in the future.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As it stands, it was a huge hassle for me to help people with macOS updates at the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="example-2---samsung-android-phone-os-updates">Example 2 - Samsung Android Phone OS Updates</h2>
            <p>My Samsung Android phone receives periodic OS updates. These updates include relevant Android
              patches, as well as updates to the Samsung UI and other OS components.</p>
            <p>The updater is a particularly bad example of an app that fails to consider slow / intermittent Internet
              use cases.</p>
            <p>

                <em>Downloading an OS update for my Samsung Android phone at the South Pole.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>First, the basics. There is no speed indicator, no numeric progress indicator (good luck counting pixels on
              the moving bar), no pause button, no cancel button, no indicator of the file size, and no way to get at
              the underlying file to download separately.</p>
            <p>Second – if the download fails, it cannot be resumed. It will restart from the beginning.</p>
            <p>In practice, at the South Pole, the phone could not download an entire OS update on a single satellite
              pass. So – it inevitably failed as soon as connectivity dropped, and I had to restart it from the
              beginning.</p>
            <p>The <strong>only way</strong> I was able to get this done was by <strong>turning off the phone entirely</strong>, right before
              Internet access dropped, and then turning it back on when Internet access resumed at the next satellite pass.
              This tricked the phone into not giving up on the download, because it was totally off during the period
              without Internet. It never had a chance to fail.
              By doing this, I was able to spread out the download across multiple satellite passes, and I could complete
              the download.</p>
            <p>This is an absurd workaround! I should not have had to do this.</p>
            <p>My US carrier (Verizon) does offer a downloadable application for macOS and Windows which should, in theory,
              allow me to flash the OS updates from my computer, instead of relying on the phone to download the patches.
              In practice, the Verizon app is even worse. Buggy, unreliable, and also insists on using its own in-app
              downloader to fetch the update files (sigh…).</p>
            <p>I’m sure there’s a way I could have gotten the images and flashed them manually.
              This is not an invitation for a bunch
              of Android enthusiasts to email me and explain bootloaders and APKs and ROMs and sideloading and whatever else is
              involved here.
              That’s not the point. The point is – the mainstream tools that vendors ship are <em>hopelessly deficient</em>
              for users on slow Internet, and that’s a bummer.</p>

              <li>No cancel button.</li>

              <li>No progress tracking and no graceful resumption of an interrupted download.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is actually one of my favorite desktop apps! It’s a shame to call them out like this.
              A quick, easy way to make this MUCH better for users at the South Pole would be to provide a manual download
              link. Then, the developers wouldn’t need to reimplement all the nice download features that my
              browser provides. I could just use my browser.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I hope the examples I’ve shown in this post have been a helpful illustration of how minor oversights
              or under-developed features back home can become <strong>major issues</strong> in a place with slow Internet.</p>
            <p>Again, I’m not asking that every app developer spend a huge amount of time optimizing for edge cases like
              the South Pole.</p>
            <p>And I’m also definitely not asking for people to work miracles. Internet access at the South Pole, as of
              October 2023, was <strong><em>slow</em></strong>. I don’t expect immersive interactive streaming media to work
              under the conditions I described here, but it would be nice if apps were resilient enough to
              get a few bytes of text up or down. Unfortunately, what
              often ended up happening is that apps got stuck in a loop because of an ill-advised hardcoded timeout.</p>
            <p>I hope everyone found this helpful, or at least interesting.</p>
            <p>And thank you again to everyone who followed along with me on my Antarctic journey! I’ve been off-ice for about
              six months now, and going through my old posts here have brought back fond memories.</p>
            <p>I hope the current winter-over
              crew is doing well, and that everyone is enjoying the <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/polar-night">Polar Night</a>. If the egg supply and
              consumption rate is the same as it was during Winter 2023, they should soon be
              finishing up <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/the-last-egg">The Last Egg</a>.</p>
            <p>I won’t promise any more content, but I do have a handful of other half-finished posts sitting in my

The United States also implemented an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1" data-track-category="body text link">OA mandate</a> in 2022 that requires all research funded by US taxpayers to be freely available from 2026.</p><h2>Institutional repositories</h2><p>When the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) announced Japan’s pivot to OA in February, it also said that it would invest 10 billion yen (around US$63 million) to standardize institutional repositories — websites dedicated to hosting scientific papers, their underlying data and other materials — ensuring that there will be a mechanism for making research in Japan open.</p><p>Among the roughly 800 universities in Japan, more than 750 already have an institutional repository, says Shimasaki Seiichi, director of the Office for Nuclear Fuel Cycles and Decommissioning at MEXT in Tokyo, who was involved with drawing up the plan. Each university will host the research produced by its academics, but the underlying software will be the same.</p><p>In 2022, Japan also launched its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01359-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01359-x" data-track-category="body text link">own national preprint server, Jxiv</a>, but its use remains limited with only the few hundred preprint articles posted on the platform to date. Ide says that publishing as preprints is not yet habitual among many researchers in Japan, noting that only around one in five respondents to his 2023 survey<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> on Jxiv were even aware that it existed.</p><h2>Green OA</h2><p>Japan’s move to greater access to its research is focusing on 'green OA' — in which authors make the author-accepted, but unfinalized, versions of papers available in the digital repositories, says Seiichi.</p><p>Seiichi says that gold OA — in which the final copyedited and polished version of a paper is made freely available on the journal site — is not feasible on a wide scale. That’s because the cost to make every paper free to read would be too high for universities. Publishers levy an article-processing charge (APC) if the paper is made free to read, rather than being paywalled, a fee that covers a publisher's costs.</p><p>APCs are increasing at an average rate of 4.3% per year, notes Johan Rooryck, a scholar of French linguistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and executive director of cOAlition S.</p><p>Rooryck says that Japan’s green OA strategy should be applauded. “It's definitely something that one should do,” he says. “Especially for all the content that is still behind the paywall.”</p><p>Kathleen Shearer, executive director of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories in Montreal, Canada, says that the Japanese plan is “equitable”.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter where you publish, whether you have APCs or not, you are still able to comply with an open-access policy,” she says.</p><p>She adds that the policy will mean that Japan has a unified record of all research produced by its academics because all institutional repositories are hosted on the same national server. “Japan is way ahead of the rest of us,” Shearer says. “More countries are moving in this direction but Japan really was one of the first.”</p><p>Focusing on institutional repositories will have another benefit: it will not discriminate against research published in Japanese, Shearer says. “A big part of their scholarly ecosystem is represented in Japanese.”</p><article data-label="Related">

Figure&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig1">1</a> shows the modeled reduction in aerosol optical depth due to decreased SO<sub>2</sub> emission from the international shipping industry. The AOD reduction reaches peak values of around 0.01 in the South China Sea and Eastern North Atlantic off the coasts of Western Europe. In the South Atlantic the regulations create AOD reductions that follow the shape of shipping routes. We then calculate the ratio between the AOD change due to IMO2020 and that between pre-industrial and present day. Over most of the ocean, the ratio is smaller than 10% because of sparse shipping outside the major shipping routes. Over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, on the other hand, it can exceed 10% and reaches 25% in the Norwegian Sea and off the western European and northwestern African coasts. In these regions, the total anthropogenic aerosol concentration is relatively low because of declining emissions of aerosols and their precursors since the 1980s, making ship-emitted aerosols an important component of the anthropogenic maritime aerosols. The IMO2020 is therefore effective in reducing total aerosol loading for these regions. The impact of IMO2020 on the cloud droplet number concentration (N<sub>d</sub>) of low-level maritime clouds as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig1">1C</a> (see Methods). Globally, IMO2020 leads to a modest reduction of 0.5 cm<sup>−3</sup> in mean modeled N<sub>d</sub>. Regionally, however, the reduction is more pronounced. The strongest reduction occurs in the North Atlantic, the Caribbeans and the South China Sea, reaching 3 cm<sup>−3</sup>. These are regions with the busiest shipping lanes and thus strongest reduction of ship emissions. The reduction in the South Atlantic shows the most well-defined shipping lane shapes likely due to the unique circulation pattern in this region<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Yuan, T. et al.

For simplicity, we ignore the heat uptake by the deep ocean during the short-term, i.e. O(10) years. 0.2 W m<sup>−2</sup> translates to around 0.16 K of warming with a timescale of 7 years. It is equivelant to 0.24 K/decade, which is more than double the average warming rate since 1880 and 20% higher than the mean warming rate since 1980, linear trend of 0.19 K/decade. We also calculated the lower and upper bounds of the forcing and corresponding expected warming (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig3">3</a>). The IMO2020 is expected to provide a substantial boost to the warming rate of global mean temperature in the 2020 s. The rate of warming is expected to ramp up quickly from 2020 and asymptotes to the longer-term trend line at the end of 2020<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Geoffroy, O. et al.

The 2023 record warmth is within the ranges of our expected trajectory. The magnitude of IMO2020 induced warming means that the observed strong warming in 2023 will be a new norm in the 2020 s. The mean temperature anomaly of the 2020 s will be 0.3 K higher than that of the 2010s. Regionally, the warming effect from IMO2020 on SST is harder to estimate since basin-wide SST changes can be affected by variations in factors like other aerosol concentration, ocean circulation, and air-sea interactions. However, the strong geographical variations in the forcing suggest the impact of IMO2020 on SST may have significant variation among ocean basins. For example, the North Atlantic SST may be disproportionally warmed more by the IMO2020 given the radiative forcing is more than three times the global average, which is likely a contributing factor to the pronounced warming of the North Atlantic SST in recent years<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Record-breaking North Atlantic Ocean temperatures contribute to extreme marine heatwaves | Copernicus.

This is evident in the North Atlantic where the IMO2020 produced the strongest forcing. Figure&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig4">4</a> shows the monthly mean time series of forcing and its three components. We use a simple functional form for cloud adjustments that only depends on background N<sub>d</sub> to illustrate the point. The total forcing varies between 0.19Wm<sup>−2</sup> and 0.38Wm<sup>−2</sup>, a 100% relative change. The seasonal variation of incoming solar radiation is the dominant driver for this (SOM). But seasonal variations of background CF, N<sub>d</sub>, and ΔN<sub>d</sub> due to IMO2020 also contribute as they affect the magnitude of the Twomey effect and macrophysical (LWP and CF) cloud adjustments. We estimate the contribution from each variable after removing the seasonal change in solar insolation, and report the results in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig4">4B–D</a> (see Methods). ΔN<sub>d</sub> induced by IMO2020 is the strongest contributor. Its variations can affect the forcing by more than 30% in some months such as Jan, Apr, and Dec. Its impact on LWP and CF adjustments contributes equally to the total radiative forcing. The seasonal variation of background N<sub>d</sub> is also an important factor (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig4">4C</a>).

The comparison does not prove causality but provides a context to assess the impact of IMO2020. The low cloud dimming forcing of 0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> from the IMO2020 represents a strong temporary shock to the net planetary heat uptake (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig5">5A</a>) that has been increasing at a rate of ~0.05 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/yr<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Loeb, N.

The net planetary heat uptake has increased by 0.25 Wm<sup>−2</sup> since 2020, making the 0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> due to IMO2020 nearly 80% of the total increase. The long-term trend of CERES TOA net radiation is 0.46 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/decade while it changes to 0.67 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/decade since IMO2020 took effect. The difference is 0.21 Wm<sup>−2</sup> that is consistent with our estimated forcing. However, the record since 2020 is too short to ascertain the impact of IMO2020 on the long-term trend of the energy balance given its large interannual variations. The IMO2020 effect also has an asymmetric impact on aerosol loading in the northern and southern hemispheres because of higher baseline ship emissions in the northern hemisphere. This creates interhemispheric contrast in the resulting radiative forcing, which has important implications for deliberate geoengineering schemes because interhemispheric forcing contrast can create significant perturbations in precipitation patterns<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Jones, A., Haywood, J. &amp; Boucher, O.

We calculate the interhemispheric contrast in IMO2020 induced warming effect to be around 0.22 Wm<sup>−2</sup>, with the northern hemisphere at 0.32 Wm<sup>−2</sup> and the southern hemisphere at 0.1 Wm<sup>−2</sup>.

Since IMO2020 took effect, the northern hemisphere (NH) absorbed solar radiation has increased by 0.5 Wm<sup>−2</sup> from a plateau between 2017 and 2020 while the southern hemisphere (SH) increased at a much slower rate. The low cloud dimming effect of IMO2020 represents around 60% of increase in NH absorbed solar radiation. The interhemispheric contrast in absorbed solar radiation has increased by ~0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> based on measurements, one of the highest rates of increase during the whole record, which is almost the same as that induced by low cloud dimming effect of IMO2020. Another rapid increase period is associated with a phase shift in Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) starting 2014/2015 followed by a strong El-Nino event<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Loeb, N.

The forcing magnitude of this inadvertent shock has exceeded this limit by a large margin. However, it does suggest that MCB is a viable solar radiation modification scheme in temporarily slowing the rate of climate warming. Our analysis also points to strong spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the forcing produced by the event. Such heterogeneities need to be considered in any MCB scheme to minimize their potential undesired impacts on regional climate in addition to the desired slowing of climate warming rate. Important part of the heterogeneity exists because of background low cloud distribution and its spatiotemporal variability creating an interhemispheric contrast of radiative forcing having similar magnitude as the global mean radiative forcing. Understanding this contrast is important because to achieve the goal of substantially slowing down the warming rate or limit the maximum warming to be within 1.5<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="IPCC.

As a result, the interhemispheric contrast needs to be minimized to avoid substantial perturbations to regional monsoons and other precipitation patterns. It should be noted that the forcing due to IMO2020 will take time for it to be directly detectable at the global scale in the observation records, but regionally, e.g., in the North Atlantic, its impact may be detectable sooner.

They do not predict cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentrations (N<sub>d</sub>). We estimate N<sub>d</sub> using a diagnostic deep learning-based approach, involving the usage of two neural network (NN) parameterizations. The first NN (termed MAMnet) is an emulator for the Modal Aerosol Module, which takes bulk aerosol mass for 5 externally-mixed species (sulfates, sea salt, dust, black carbon, and organics) and the atmospheric state (temperature, pressure) as input, and predicts the number concentration and composition for 7 internally-mixed lognormal modes (accumulation, aitken, coarse/fine dust, coarse/fine sea salt, primary carbon matter). MAMnet was trained on 5 years of data from a GEOS simulation implementing the MAM7 aerosol module, and validated against ground observations. The CCN concentration at a given supersatureation can be readily estimated using the 7-modal size distribution and composition<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Fountoukis, C. &amp; Nenes, A.

The top-of-atmosphere net fluxes provides constraints to the ocean heat storage. It is used here to calculate the interhemispheric contrast in absorbed solar radiation and energy balance. We note that although the interhemispheric contrast is a residue of two large numbers, e.g., the amount of mean absorbed solar radiation in both hemispheres, the observed variation of the contrast is always small. Therefore, even though we cannot directly attribute the variations in the interhemispheric contrast to IMO 2020, it is reasonable to discuss their temporal evolutions and compare the IMO 2020 impact with the observed changes.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Transient warming of IMO2020</h3><p>We consider the simple one-layer energy balance model<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Geoffroy, O. et al.

The peak season for the forcing is now wintertime instead of summertime. This serves as our baseline to test sensitivity of forcing to different variables.</p><p>The sensitivity of the forcing to each factor is assessed through the following procedure. We first calculate the seasonal variations of the forcing using observations that contain its seasonal variations. We then calculate a map of annual mean for each variable and use it to calculate the forcing, effectively removing its impact on the seasonal changes. The relative difference between these two calculations can be taken as a measure of how much each variable contributes to the seasonal changes.</p></div></div>

<p><em>Last week we shared a number of <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/create-a-web-page-for-a-feature-roadmap/idi-p/5805">updates</a> with our community of users, and now we want to share them here</em>:</p>



<p>At Mozilla, we work hard to make Firefox the best browser for you. That’s why we’re always focused on building a browser that empowers you to choose your own path, that gives you the freedom to explore without worry or compromises. We’re excited to share more about the updates and improvements we have in store for you over the next year.</p>



<h2><strong>Bringing you the features you’ve been asking for</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve been listening to your feedback, and we’re prioritizing the features you want most.</p>



<ul>
<li>Productivity boosters like
<ul>
<li><strong>Tab Grouping, Vertical Tabs, </strong>and our handy <strong>Sidebar</strong> will help you stay organized no matter how many tabs you have open — whether it’s 7 or <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/firefox-power-user-keeps-7400-plus-browser-tabs-open-for-2-years">7,500.</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plus, our new <strong>Profile Management system</strong> will help keep your school, work, and personal browsing separate but easily accessible.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Customizable new tab wallpapers</strong> that will let you choose from a diverse range of photography, colors, and abstract images that suits you most.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Intuitive privacy settings</strong> that deliver all the power of our world-class anti-tracking technologies in a simplified, easy-to-understand way.</li>



<li><strong>More</strong><strong> </strong><strong>streamlined menus</strong> that reduce visual clutter and prioritize top user actions so you can get to the important things quicker.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Continuous work on speed, performance and compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>Speed is everything when you’re online, so we’re continuing to work hard to make Firefox as fast and efficient as possible. You can expect even <strong>faster, smoother browsing on Firefox</strong>,<strong> </strong>thanks to<strong> quicker page loads and startup times</strong> – all while <strong>saving more of your phone’s battery life</strong>. We’ve already improved responsiveness by 20 percent as measured by <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/03/improving-performance-in-firefox-and-across-the-web-with-speedometer-3/">Speedometer 3</a>, a collaboration we’ve spearheaded with other leading tech companies. And in that collaborative spirit, we’re also working with the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/">Interop project</a> to make it easy for people to build sites that work great across all browsers. We value your support in our efforts to improve cross-browser compatibility which is why we’ve added new features to easily report when websites aren’t working quite right; this feedback is critical as we look to address even small functionality issues that affect your day-to-day online experience.</p>



<h2><strong>Making the most of your time online — without sacrifice</strong></h2>



<p>Ensuring your privacy is core to everything we do at Firefox. Unlike other companies, who ask you to exchange your data in order to do even basic, everyday things online — you don’t have to give up your personal information to get a faster, more efficient browser experience with Firefox. Reading a news story in a different language or signing a form for school or work shouldn’t require you to give up your privacy. So, we’ve worked hard to make things like translation and PDF editing in Firefox happen locally on your device, so you don’t have to ship off your personal data to a server farm for a company to use it how they see fit — to keep tabs on you, sell your information to the highest bidder, or train their AI. With Firefox, you have a lot of choice — but you don’t have to choose between utility and privacy. Your data is secure, and most importantly, just yours.</p>



<p>We are approaching the use of AI in Firefox — which many, many of you have been asking about — in the same way. We’re focused on giving you AI features that solve tangible problems, respect your privacy, and give you real choice.</p>



<p>We’re looking at how we can use local, on-device AI models — i.e., more private — to enhance your browsing experience further. One feature we’re starting with next quarter is <strong>AI-generated alt-text for images inserted into PDFs</strong>, which makes it more accessible to visually impaired users and people with learning disabilities.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Editor’s Note:</em></strong><em> This post highlights data from Webb science in progress, which has not yet been through the peer-review process.</em></p>
<p>Over the last two years, scientists have used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (also called Webb or JWST) to explore what astronomers refer to as Cosmic Dawn –&nbsp; the period in the first few hundred million years after the big bang where the first galaxies were born. These galaxies provide vital insight into the ways in which the gas, stars, and black holes were changing when the universe was very young. In October 2023 and January 2024, an international team of astronomers used Webb to observe galaxies as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Using Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph), they obtained a spectrum of a record-breaking galaxy observed only two hundred and ninety million years after the big bang. This corresponds to a redshift of about 14, which is a measure of how much a galaxy’s light is stretched by the expansion of the universe. We invited Stefano Carniani from Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, and Kevin Hainline from the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, to tell us more about how this source was found and what its unique properties tell us about galaxy formation.</p>
<p>“The instruments on Webb were designed to find and understand the earliest galaxies, and in the first year of observations as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we found <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/universe/early-universe-crackled-with-bursts-of-star-formation-webb-shows/" rel="noopener">many hundreds of candidate galaxies</a> from the first 650 million years after the big bang. In early 2023, we discovered a galaxy in our data that had strong evidence of being above a <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a138baf3-5963-4640-a405-aa3552a5152e" rel="noopener">redshift</a> of 14, which was very exciting, but there were some properties of the source that made us wary. The source was surprisingly bright, which we wouldn’t expect for such a distant galaxy, and it was very close to another galaxy such that the two appeared to be part of one larger object. When we observed the source again in October 2023 as part of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12340" rel="noopener">JADES Origins Field</a>, new imaging data obtained with Webb’s narrower NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) filters pointed even more toward the high-redshift hypothesis. We knew we needed a spectrum, as whatever we would learn would be of immense scientific importance, either as a new milestone in Webb’s investigation of the early universe or as a confounding oddball of a middle-aged galaxy.</p>

The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. One such galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0 (shown in the pullout), was determined to be at a redshift of 14.32 (+0.08/-0.20), making it the current record-holder for the most distant known galaxy. This corresponds to a time less than 300 million years after the big bang.<br>In the background image, blue represents light at 0.9, 1.15, and 1.5 microns (filters F090W + F115W + F150W), green is 2.0 and 2.77 microns (F200W + F277W), and red is 3.56, 4.1, and 4.44 microns (F356W + F410M + F444W).

<p>“In January 2024, NIRSpec observed this galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0, for almost ten hours, and when the spectrum was first processed, there was unambiguous evidence that the galaxy was indeed at a redshift of 14.32, shattering the previous most-distant galaxy record (<a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/12/09/nasas-webb-reaches-new-milestone-in-quest-for-distant-galaxies/">z = 13.2 of JADES-GS-z13-0</a>). Seeing this spectrum was incredibly exciting for the whole team, given the mystery surrounding the source. This discovery was not just a new distance record for our team; the most important aspect of JADES-GS-z14-0 was that at this distance, we know that this galaxy must be intrinsically <em>very </em>luminous. From the images, the source is found to be over 1,600-light years across, proving that the light we see is coming mostly from young stars and not from emission near a growing supermassive black hole. This much starlight implies that the galaxy is several hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun! This raises the question: How can nature make such a bright, massive, and large galaxy in less than 300 million years?</p>
<p>“The data reveal other important aspects of this astonishing galaxy. We see that the color of the galaxy is not as blue as it could be, indicating that some of the light is reddened by dust, even at these very early times. JADES researcher Jake Helton of Steward Observatory and the University of Arizona also identified that JADES-GS-z14-0 was detected at longer wavelengths with Webb’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), a remarkable achievement considering its distance. The MIRI observation covers wavelengths of light that were emitted in the visible-light range, which are redshifted out of reach for Webb’s near-infrared instruments. Jake’s analysis indicates that the brightness of the source implied by the MIRI observation is above what would be extrapolated from the measurements by the other Webb instruments, indicating the presence of strong ionized gas emission in the galaxy in the form of bright emission lines from hydrogen and oxygen. The presence of oxygen so early in the life of this galaxy is a surprise and suggests that multiple generations of very massive stars had already lived their lives before we observed the galaxy.</p>

<p>“All of these observations, together, tell us that JADES-GS-z14-0 is not like the types of galaxies that have been predicted by theoretical models and computer simulations to exist in the very early universe. Given the observed brightness of the source, we can forecast how it might grow over cosmic time, and so far we have not found any suitable analogs from the hundreds of other galaxies we’ve observed at high redshift in our survey. Given the relatively small region of the sky that we searched to find JADES-GS-z14-0, its discovery has profound implications for the predicted number of bright galaxies we see in the early universe, as discussed in another concurrent JADES study (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10033" rel="noopener">Robertson et al., recently accepted</a>). It is likely that astronomers will find many such luminous galaxies, possibly at even earlier times, over the next decade with Webb. We’re thrilled to see the extraordinary diversity of galaxies that existed at Cosmic Dawn!”</p>

<p>Whenever <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-larson-a44b543/?ref=review.firstround.com"><strong><u>Will Larson</u></strong></a> meets up with fellow CTOs or heads of engineering at other startups, he often finds himself having the same conversation over and over again — an engineering leader’s version of Groundhog Day. The biggest challenge these leaders are facing is pressure from their CEOs to drive engineering velocity. The message is usually: ship more value, more quickly. “The problem is that no one has a whole lot of conviction that there is a simple way to do this,” says Larson.&nbsp;</p><p>“There's no lever like there is in sales. I think this is not totally true in sales either, by the way, but if you talk to people, there's the theory that in sales, you could just add more people and more sales will happen,” he says. “People look at recruiting the same way. ‘If we do five hires per quarter per recruiter, we just need to add two more recruiters and we’ll be hitting our targets.’”&nbsp;</p><p>However, engineering leaders will be hard-pressed to find a similar lever to pull. “For engineering, there are just no measures that I find super helpful here. There are teams where one individual may be pulling a ton of weight,” he says. “Then there are teams that have one individual who might be getting in the way and creating conflict, and the rest of the team can’t move forward unless they’re removed.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Larson’s keenly aware of how this predicament sounds to non-technical leaders. “Engineering leaders, especially at large companies, are managing a team of a couple hundred people. That team might cost $50 to 100 million in salary a year. So as a CEO, when you hear from your eng leaders that ‘Engineering is an art, and you can’t predict how it’s going to work,’ it’s frustrating. They’re sitting there thinking, ‘They’re telling me this is art, but I’m spending $100 million on this art each year.’ That’s not reassuring.”&nbsp;</p><p>As the CTO at <a href="https://www.carta.com/?ref=review.firstround.com"><strong><u>Carta</u></strong></a>, Larson is no stranger to the intricate challenges like these that engineering leaders wrestle with on a daily basis. His winding career has landed him in leadership roles at <strong>Stripe</strong>, <strong>Uber </strong>and <strong>Calm</strong> (also in the CTO seat) — and he’s scaled engineering teams from tens to hundreds of people.&nbsp;</p><p>As he’s teased out lessons from his own experiences, he’s become a go-to resource for many, penning several highly-circulated essays on his ever-excellent engineering blog, <a href="https://lethain.com/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>Irrational Exuberance</u></a>, and three books. His latest, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Executives-Primer-Will-Larson-ebook/dp/B0CV4QGPXD/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=mgGna&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&amp;pf_rd_p=cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&amp;pf_rd_r=131-3454494-9143647&amp;pd_rd_wg=GqqH7&amp;pd_rd_r=8ce3dba2-a0e0-438a-ad35-f210dc21e1a3&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk&amp;ref=review.firstround.com"><u>An Engineering Executive’s Primer,</u></a> hit the shelves last year. (Larson has also shared his wisdom right here on the Review before, unpacking <a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-size-and-assess-teams-from-an-eng-lead-at-stripe-uber-and-digg/"><u>his highly practical framework on the optimal size and state of engineering teams</u></a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Across his work, Larson has consistently seen that this misalignment between eng leaders and other executives stems from a lack of flexibility. As he sees it, too many well-meaning engineering leaders go by the book of conventional leadership advice.</p><p><strong>"Anytime you apply a rule too universally, it turns into an anti-pattern,”</strong> Larson says. In other words, once a practice is labeled as generally helpful or unhelpful, it blinds leaders to how that practice would work in the context of <em>their </em>organization. The key to effective engineering leadership, Larson argues, lies in figuring out <em>which</em> scenarios are worth deliberately defying conventional logic, and when to simply follow the rules.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>We have to have the openness to think through whether a different approach might make sense in a very specific case. That’s a fundamental part of engineering.</blockquote><p><a href="https://review.firstround.com/podcast/a-masterclass-in-engineering-leadership-from-carta-stripe-uber-and-calm-will-larson-cto-at-carta/"><u>In this exclusive interview,</u></a> Larson lays out <strong>three commonplace engineering leadership practices that he thinks have become anti-patterns.</strong> First, he argues the case against always avoiding micromanagement, providing two concrete tactics leaders can use to get closer to the details. Next up, he explores why measuring an imperfect metric isn’t the worst-case scenario. He wraps with a thought-provoking reflection on why leaders shouldn’t be umbrellas for their teams, and how they can strike the right balance between management by committee and unwieldy bottoms-up decision-making.</p><p>Sprinkled throughout are anecdotes from managing teams at Stripe, Uber, Carta and Calm, full of contrarian thinking meant to push engineering leaders out of their comfort zones. But his advice extends far beyond engineering. Startup leaders in any function will find new tactics and frameworks to apply to their own strategy, and CEOs and founders might just find a new perspective when managing their eng leaders. Let’s begin.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="unexpected-anti-pattern-1-shying-away-from-micromanagement"><strong>UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERN #1: SHYING AWAY FROM MICROMANAGEMENT</strong></h2><p>To start, Larson maps out what skills make the top 1% of engineering execs stand out from the top 50%. “The core challenge for engineering execs is they have to wear three different, kind of opposing hats. The best ones can toggle back and forth between them deftly.” He lays out the opposing goals for each “hat:”&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Executive team member. </strong>Finding ways to drive the business forward. “Sometimes that means making decisions that are ‘bad for engineering overall,’ like reducing the engineering budget, for example. Or moving to a business unit model where there is less engineering voice in the room on certain topics,” Larson says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Engineering manager. </strong>Figuring out the structure of policies needed to run the engineering org, and how to be an effective people leader.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Engineer. </strong>Keeping the bar for technical excellence high. “You’re still responsible for the technical excellence and execution of engineering, despite any outside stressors,” Larson says.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“I find a lot of executives tend to lean a little bit too heavily on one of these dimensions,” he says. But a common denominator lurks in all three of these roles that keep execs from excelling to the engineering leadership hall of fame. No matter which hat they’re wearing, leaders stumble when they carry over<em> </em>management practices that no longer serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>“Typically when you first start managing, you're coming from a functional expertise role, like a staff engineer or the tech lead for a team. Then all of a sudden you become the manager for that team. So you're in an interesting place where you have the most context technically about everything the team is doing, but you're also now the people manager,” Larson says.</p><p>“Now you have the authority to set work and tell people what to do. At that moment, the advice that people constantly get is to step away from the details. You are told to step away from the code because staying involved will make you a bad manager,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>For some people, he recognizes that this can be helpful advice. Folks who are extremely particular about the way they want things done <a href="https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/"><u><em>should </em>let go of the reins</u></a> and let their teams make decisions on their own. But the vast majority of engineering managers who turn into execs, follow this advice to their detriment. “<strong>One of the biggest lessons in management over the last decade is that micromanagement is bad. But I think this is an anti-pattern</strong>, <strong>because it creates disengaged and context-free leadership</strong>, and leadership can be so much more than that,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“Too many executives take this kernel of advice and as they grow more senior, start to think of themselves only as resource allocators — that their main job is to allocate budgets to different teams and periodically check in on the quality. While that’s certainly an important part of management, that’s not the entirety of it,” Larson says.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>New engineering managers are often advised to “step away from the code.” But an extremely high-functioning exec understands the domain they are operating in at some level of detail. As you get too far out of the details, you just become a bureaucrat. Too many well-meaning engineering managers end up as bureaucrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Larson urges engineering execs to forget the term micromanagement altogether and focus instead on cultivating <a href="https://lethain.com/developing-leadership-styles/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>a different set of leadership styles</u></a> they can pick from. “In cases where there are no clear paths forward or where the folks who have the context around the path forward are violently in disagreement, it pays to get into the details and make the decision yourself,” he says. “That way, you can understand the levers that could really transform the business, the outcomes your team needs to accomplish, the time frame to do it in and how it serves your users better.” &nbsp;</p><p>Developing a stronger conviction around your <a href="https://review.firstround.com/the-6-decision-making-frameworks-that-help-startup-leaders-tackle-tough-calls/"><u>decision-making</u></a> is a career-long practice and one that Larson is still working on himself. “Asking questions like ‘What are we doing? Why are we doing it? What’s the data? Where is the actual source of data?’ monthly or quarterly help me drill further into the details,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But if you are looking for more tactical ways to zoom in as a manager or exec, Larson also unpacks two tried-and-tested tactics that will bring engineering leaders closer to the details:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id="1-get-up-to-speed-by-%E2%80%9Cconflict-mining%E2%80%9D"><strong>1. Get up to speed by “conflict mining”</strong></h3><p>“<strong>The number one way that I see new engineering leaders struggle when they come into a new place is that they assume the context from their previous company applies as is</strong>,” says Larson.&nbsp;</p><p>This tends to happen most <a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-scale-yourself-down-not-up-as-a-leader/"><u>when leaders transition from large to small organizations</u></a>, but missing even small contextual details in a new environment has the potential to damage the success of the operation.&nbsp;</p><p>Larson has tripped over this hurdle himself. “One of the challenges we had on Uber’s infrastructure team back in 2014 is that teams were spinning up new services, and a new kind of function code almost every week,” he says. “We were supposed to help them provision these new services. From the very first week, I started to realize my team was further behind every week than when they started. So, my first week there, we were two weeks behind, my tenth week there, we were four weeks behind, and we were just getting worse.”</p><p>As a solution, Larson’s team went down a path of creating self-service provisioning and automation tooling that made it possible for anyone at the company to spin up a new service themselves. “We felt really good about that. We were at the forefront of a movement of many companies doing that,” Larson says.</p><p>“Then I came to Stripe and I saw the same problem. Teams were feeling stuck. I wanted to employ the same solution,” he says. “But I had just started, so I wanted to talk to a bunch of the senior engineers about the idea first and say ‘Hey, here's what we did at Uber. I think we should do it here too.’”&nbsp;</p><p>Larson calls this the <strong>“mining for conflict”</strong> stage of getting up to speed in a new role, and it’s one of his favorite tactics to deploy as a senior engineering leader starting fresh in a new company to get closer to the details, even if it means long conversations with folks with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>“One of Stripe’s most senior engineers absolutely hated my automated tooling idea,” Larson says. “I kept trying to pitch him though. I remember one conversation we had where I asked him, ‘What could I tell you about this idea for you to be comfortable with us trying it out?’ His response was that there was nothing I could tell him. He’d never be on board. At first, I thought, ‘This is a really unreasonable person.’ But later as I dug into it, I discovered he was right. How Stripe did technology was pretty different from Uber. One of the core undocumented strategies at Stripe was they used a Ruby monolith, and so everything was done in the Ruby programming language with a few minor exceptions. The way I wanted to approach this problem wasn't aligned with that.”&nbsp;</p><p>This process of conflict mining served Larson a key lesson. “I could have just ignored him, But then I would have missed the key learning, which is that <em>I</em> was the one who was missing context, and needed to refine my approach.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Things are not the same across companies, and you can figure that out pretty quickly by finding something controversial and testing for conflict. The wrong way to solve this is to actually implement the conflict-heavy thing. The right way to do it is just to go have a bunch of conversations.</blockquote><p>Another example happened when Larson was at Calm — which scaled from five engineers to over 100 under his leadership. He ended up making the tough call to cancel a major product migration from the monolith to a multi-product suite.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I got to Carta, I had the instinct to do the exact same thing,” says Larson. “I thought, ‘If it worked at Calm, why wouldn’t it work here?’ But I had to test that idea and get sped up on the context and everyone else's perspectives.”</p><p>It’s key to not confine your conflict mining strategy to your peer group on the leadership team. . “You can usually get buy-in from other executives pretty easily, but it’s much more difficult to get buy-in from people with the most context around a given problem,” he says, “Their opinion is most valuable because they are the ones who live in the details. You can’t lie to them. They know the truth of how things run.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Successful leaders come in and ask, ‘How can I change myself to fit?’ not ‘How can I force my entire organization to fit to work with me?’ It's hard to move organizations, and you shouldn't do it if you don’t need to.</blockquote><h3 id="2-write-the-details-down"><strong>2. Write the details down</strong></h3><p>Any executive who has come in fresh to a new company, no matter the size or industry, will probably be familiar with the following scenario: “Every company you come into, you’ll start asking around and the engineers will say, ‘There's no product strategy,’ Then you turn around and go to the product managers and they'll say things like, ‘There's no business strategy.’ Then you go back to the engineers, and they say ‘There’s not even a technology strategy written. What sort of company are we?’” Larson says. “<strong>What ends up happening is that senior leaders coming in will just assume that their last company’s strategy will apply because nothing is written down that would say otherwise</strong>.” (His transition from Uber to Stripe which he details above is a prime example.)&nbsp;</p><blockquote>There’s this pervasive belief that there’s no strategy anywhere, but that’s not true. There is strategy everywhere, it’s just rarely written.&nbsp;</blockquote><figure><img src="https://review.firstround.com/content/images/2024/05/headshot.jpeg" alt="Photo of Will Larson sitting on a blue coach" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1332" srcset="https://review.firstround.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 600w, https://review.firstround.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 1000w, https://review.firstround.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 1600w, https://review.firstround.com/content/images/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Will Larson, CTO at Carta</span></figcaption></figure><p>Complicating things even further, Larson also has found that many companies do have a habit of writing things down, they just aren’t the <em>right </em>things. “It’s the small decisions that end up getting documented,” Larson says. “You’d think it would be the opposite, but in my experience, the answers to important questions like, ‘Why did we go into this business? Why are we shutting down this business line? Why are we doing this services migration that's going to take five years?’ literally aren't written down anywhere.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://review.firstround.com/investing-in-internal-documentation-a-brick-by-brick-guide-for-startups/"><u>Building a culture of documentation is essential</u></a> to unlocking a fast-moving engineering org, and most leaders and companies do seem to have a good grasp on this. However existing leaders are often faced with a ton of inertia. “Where there’s already momentum, it’s particularly hard to course correct on large things,” Larson says. “It takes much more activation energy than continuing down the path they were already on.”&nbsp;</p><p>So for those new leaders coming into a company, they have a unique opportunity to create a lot of<a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-make-an-impact-in-your-first?ref=review.firstround.com"><u> impact in their first 90 days</u></a> just by coming in with fresh eyes. Larson stresses that before leaders jump the gun and start to etch their own strategies into stone, it’s important to consider these two pieces of advice:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>1. Get your shovel and go digging.</strong> Understand the <em>why </em>behind every decision made. “Sometimes the underlying context or beliefs about something is no longer true, but people continue going down that path because they haven’t stepped back,” Larson says. “So it’s up to you to do some archeological digging to figure out the rationale.” He suggests having as many conversations with longtime employees as possible. “From that you can figure out if the underlying beliefs are still true,” he says.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>2. Use other companies' success as benchmarks. </strong>“Sometimes the decision-making is good, but three years in, the execution is still not working. The easiest way to get a sense of what is real and what’s not, especially for new leaders coming in, is by looking at examples of progress at other companies. See how long it took Airbnb or Dropbox to accomplish the same task and set it as a benchmark,” says Larson. “It might not be a perfect truth, but it gives you a reasonable guess. If you are taking three times longer than them, and still haven’t gotten any meaningful complexity moved out of your monolith, then it’s fundamentally not working and time to have some challenging conversations.” <strong> </strong><br>who’s</li></ul><p>After thoroughly investigating everything that’s already happened, combined with fresh benchmarks and goals to reach, now it’s time to actually put pen to paper. If you’re a leader who’s staring down a blank strategy doc, Larson recommends starting with Richard Rumelt’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>good strategy, bad strategy” framework</u></a> as an outline. </p><p>“Rumelt believes that each business decision should be explained in a way that answers three questions,” Larson says. He walks through how an imaginary startup would frame its answers when figuring out a cost strategy:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>What’s the diagnosis?&nbsp; </strong>The first thing you should do is codify the reality of the circumstances you are working in. Rumuelt calls this a diagnosis. “For example, a diagnosis could be that it’s 2024 and funding is really hard to get. We have $10 million in the bank and spent about $2.5 million last year. Our revenue is steady, but it's not growing. That’s our diagnosis.” Larson says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>What are the guiding policies?</strong> Next, intercept your diagnosis and turn it into an approach to deal with the problems at hand with guiding policies. “Strong guiding policies include parameters for both how decisions are going to get made and what the goals of those decisions are,” Larson says.“So in our example, as long as costs are kept flat year over year and the startup maintains its current revenue, we’ll have four years of runway, and we’re comfortable with that. So we plan to spend $2.5 million. We also will aggressively prevent any initiative that's going to cause us to spend more money,” he says. <br></li><li><strong>What’s the coherent action? </strong>“Rumelt's biggest concern about strategy is that it consists of a lot of spoken words that don't actually get implemented or used anywhere. So he has this idea of coherent action, which says a strategy is only real if you are specifically doing something today, based on the guiding policies to make that a real thing. An example could be a monthly meeting with finance to review every expenditure. If you start seeing an increase in the curve, you can immediately spot the fix to get back on track,” he says.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each point should be detailed enough to give the full picture, but concise enough to get across a clear message. One last point to consider is documenting your beliefs on technology investment and how broad you want your investment to be.&nbsp;</p><p>“Do you want to have one programming language for everything? Or do you want to pick the best programming language for each problem that you work on?” Larson says. “Uber was more in the latter half-camp of supporting many things. Stripe leaned toward having one tool for all problems. When that’s written down and codified somewhere, it can help inform your conviction in making decisions in the future.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>If you just write things down, no matter how bad they are, your strategy will improve almost overnight. If you don’t write things down, it’s impossible to improve your strategy.&nbsp;</blockquote><h2 id="unexpected-anti-pattern-2-pushing-back-on-measuring-flawed-metrics"><strong>UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERN #2: PUSHING BACK ON MEASURING FLAWED METRICS&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>“<a href="https://lethain.com/measuring-engineering-organizations/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>Measurement</u></a> is ripe with anti-patterns,” says Larson. Like many engineers, earlier in his career, Larson was a self-described “purist” when it came to finding and measuring the right thing to anchor his team’s strategy around. “What I found is that 1) This took forever and 2) You can’t guide people to the perfect thing if they don’t have the context of why the earlier, simpler measures didn’t make sense,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Only after spending time in several leadership roles did Larson realize that <strong>getting caught up on finding the right measurement <em>was </em>the anti-pattern</strong>. “Often when people start measuring, there's always a concern that their measurement is flawed. And that's true for all functions,” he says. “But I’m a believer in measuring something imperfect, but useful, versus holding out for the perfect metric while measuring nothing in the interim.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>You can be ideologically pure and say we shouldn't measure something, but all that does is slow down the learning of the organization around you. It doesn't actually help you accomplish your goal.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>He gives a simple example of using story points as a success metric. “Everyone you talk to about story points in a sprint is going to say this is a terrible way to measure velocity, it’s a waste of time,” he says. “And that may be true, but if your CEO disagrees with that, then that’s actually interesting, right? Because it means that they haven't built an intuition about how these things work.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he says engineering leaders are better off helping their CEO build an intuition in this area. “That only happens by actually measuring story points, reporting to them and then getting into the details of why it’s not a useful metric to show velocity,” he says.</p><blockquote>I’m coming to appreciate that the most valuable thing you can do as an engineering exec is to educate other execs on how engineering works, instead of shielding your org from everyone else.</blockquote><p>The ultimate goal when it comes to laying out the measurements in your eng strategy isn’t getting into the weeds of a debate over whether reliability more accurately measures the progress of your team then, say, the volume of pull requests. Instead, Larson says engineering leaders should place a premium on how much their CEO absorbs. “Remember, measurements are going to change every quarter, for the rest of time at your company,” Larson says. “So the real goal when you measure upwards is how much does your CEO understand the real substance of the work your team is getting done?”</p><p>In this section, Larson offers up two ways engineering executives can prioritize context and alignment with their CEO and wider leadership team:&nbsp;</p><h3 id="focus-on-improving-mental-models">Focus on improving mental models&nbsp;</h3><p>Early on at Stripe, Larson’s team implemented a controversial metric to track his team’s success: reliability. It started by tracking uptime for their enterprise customers (“If we dipped below four-nines of API availability, there was a financial consequence to the business,” Larson recalls.)</p><p>His org took the idea one layer deeper and started setting targets for the number of production incidents they had. They assigned different levels of severity to incidents: low, medium and high. Across the eng org, success was tracked by how many high-severity incidents occurred, signaling to higher-ups that their team was focused on reliability. “This sparked an internal debate on if having targets around this was even helpful because people started to hide incidents,” Larson says. “There were debates on whether it would be more useful to have a target around customer impact of incidents. We really started to go all the way down.”&nbsp;</p><p>He remembers that his team and other eng leaders were frustrated by this, but to Larson, that was okay. “Again, it came back to this idea that measurements aren’t perfect. <strong>The goal was to improve the mental model of how our leaders think about these areas.</strong> Was tracking the number of incidents the perfect metric to start out with? No. But was it useful? Absolutely. It was a great platform to refine the company’s mental model on reliability,” he says.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>When you think about how to show off measurements to your CEO or your board, I would encourage engineers to worry less about things that offend their personal mental model, and think more about things that would inform the mental models of their board, their CEO, etc.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>If you are looking for more in-depth technical metrics that will help you gauge success, Larson recommends checking out <a href="https://dora.dev/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>DORA</u></a>, the more recent <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>SPACE</u></a> framework or the business software book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339?ref=review.firstround.com"><em><u>Accelerate</u></em></a>. But there is a caveat.</p><p>“The metrics in these frameworks are great for understanding where problems are, so you know where to invest so you can improve. But they're not going to increase engineering velocity from 100 to 120. They're simply going to say, ‘Deployments going pretty slowly right now, here’s where we can make an investment to improve deployment,’” Larson says.&nbsp;</p><p>“An easier way to think about what to measure is just by looking at when you drop below a target. That usually means that you want to invest a little bit more in improving those areas as well.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>People want metrics to show reality. They want them to show the truth. But metrics are only partly about showing the truth. The other half is about educating people, to inform their mental model about how the truth works. &nbsp;</blockquote><h3 id="pull-your-ceo-into-the-details"><strong>Pull your CEO into the details&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Larson says that one of the growing trends he sees inside the engineering world that is challenging its leaders is an executive interest in volume.&nbsp;</p><p>“I remember one request from a CEO who wanted to understand the volume of the lines of code being written by the different engineers,” Larson says. “One challenge with that is there’s no direct correlation between the volume of code and the impact on the product. How do you track the value of people who are coaching others or improving the quality of others’ PRs against the folks who are actually contributing a significant amount of code? Sometimes more code is in fact worse,” he says.</p><p>“This is tricky because it's super nuanced. Within each pull request, there are the lines of code, sure, but some of them are bad,” Larson says. “Some of the lines of code are external libraries being added. Some of these are mostly tests, which are very valuable but might be very robust.”&nbsp;</p><p>When Larson is faced with executives or people pushing for specific things, he always takes it back to building their mental model. “I tell them that I’ll get them this data, but we have to talk through it,” he says. “Let's drill into it and understand the cases where this is actually a bad proxy. I think where I’ve gone wrong in the past, and where engineering leaders get into trouble, is by pushing back. They focus on saying ‘This is a terrible way to measure,’ instead of saying, ‘Let’s start here and drill in until we can understand the limitations of measuring this way.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Trying to force people out of the details is never a good way to build alignment. You want to pull them into the details, and educate them there.&nbsp;</blockquote><h2 id="unexpected-anti-pattern-3-serving-as-the-umbrella-for-your-team"><strong>UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERN #3: SERVING AS THE UMBRELLA FOR YOUR TEAM</strong></h2><p>“There's this graphic that circulated a long time ago that showed managers acting as ‘umbrellas,’ protecting their team from interruptions and other managers who kind of direct problems at their team,” Larson says. “I used to be a big believer in the umbrella concept; I wanted to protect my team from the reality and problems around them so they could focus.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The more senior teams I’ve worked with, the more I’ve come to believe that protecting your team from reality just makes things worse for them in the long term.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Now, Larson tries to throw his team into the gory details much more quickly. “In the past, I used to think I was energizing my team by sparing them the details. But now it feels like lying to them,” he says. On a tactical level, Larson adjusted this habit by buffering less information. “That means even if it’s disappointing for folks, I’d rather them process news bit by bit, rather than deal with a huge ocean of mess all in one moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>One other tactic to try here is to simply give both managers and engineers a seat at the table when big conversations are being had, rather than relying on yourself to represent so many different viewpoints. “I’m a big believer in bringing folks into the room so that they can represent themselves rather than having small decision groups. I like working out problems in larger groups where you can hold people accountable for showing up in thoughtful and effective ways,”&nbsp; Larson says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>While we’re on the topic of bringing in more people, Larson also found that strategic decision-making is often in need of a fresh perspective. Whether you’re new to a company or have been scaling the same team for years, he examines the two most common approaches: </p><ul><li><strong>The Bottoms-Up Strategy. </strong>This is the hands-off approach to management, where executives essentially just let teams execute on their own. The reigning theory here is that if something major occurs, like switching to a new cloud vendor or a team starting to use a different programming language, it will naturally escalate up to the CTO, who can pass judgment on it. “There's a good amount of literature about how this approach empowers teams to move quickly and have control over their tools,” Larson says. “The downside is you have no ability to make concentrated technology investments and you usually find out information a little bit too late. But in a growth moment where you have a ton of budget and you want to optimize for 1 in 100 wins, bottoms-up investments can be great.”</li><li><strong>Top-down strategy. </strong>The other common model is where a few senior folks (typically either a CTO or a handful of people who make up an architecture group) make most of the decisions for the whole org. But Larson says these aren’t always the best for every decision. “Chief architects and CTOs are pretty inefficient in terms of actually getting enough context in their heads to make a good decision on any given point,” he says. “Almost every architecture group turns into a committee where they have to balance their different perspectives, making them slow or inelegant. <strong>It's rarely true that a committee gets the best decision, though the upside is it does at least bring all the context into the room.” &nbsp;</strong></li></ul><h3 id="use-%E2%80%9Cnavigators%E2%80%9D-to-speed-up-decision-making"><strong>Use “Navigators” to Speed Up Decision-Making&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Unsatisfied with the outcomes from both of these approaches, Larson decided to try something a little different for his latest role. “At Carta, we have a handful of different business units, so to <a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-make-decisions-faster/#to-evaluate-the-strength-of-an-idea-and-see-if-it%E2%80%99ll-have-staying-power-use-the-prfaq-approach-from-amazon-as-you-identify-key-assumptions-and-risks"><u>speed up our decision-making </u></a>we’ve been relying on people we call ‘navigators.’ Essentially, we appoint one person per business unit to act as a mini-CTO. They get to be the final decision maker for their area’s technology.”&nbsp;</p><p>For example, think of the fund administration area of Carta’s business. “On that team, we have one navigator and 60 engineers working together. In many other areas at Carta, we’ve started rolling out Kafka as a messaging system, but the navigator in fund administration called out that they didn’t think it was the right tool for them to use. So they didn’t. We’ve seen a lot of success by empowering the folks with the most context on the ground to make the tech-stack decisions that make the most sense for them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this role being a good blend of different ways to execute, navigators call back to Larson’s earlier point on building a culture that rewards good judgment and leaders to spot changes and reverse course on the rules. If you are curious to try something similar for your org, Larson shares three lessons he’s learned so far: <br></p><ul><li><strong>Don’t skip your documentation: &nbsp;</strong>“We have a written strategy there to guide navigators when making decisions,” Larson says. “They can make exceptions if they want to, and then they're accountable to me in terms of the exceptions they make. But it all gets written down.” <br></li><li><strong>Do a post-mortem: </strong>“I always like to follow up with navigators after a decision is made. This is mostly because I’m curious, but it also helps me to see around corners I might have missed.” <br></li><li><strong>Be highly intentional in who you put conviction in. </strong>While a pure management view dictates that companies should be resilient to departures and that <a href="https://lethain.com/load-bearing-career-minded-act-two-rationales/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>people should not be load-bearing</u></a>, Larson ultimately feels that good judgment is difficult to replicate. So when choosing a navigator, don’t ignore your gut on who you trust. “You want to be extremely explicit in who is approved to exercise their judgment,” Larson says. “The point of a navigator is to have all questions routed up to one person, that’s not you as the executive. So spending time digging into people’s decision-making process is worthwhile.”&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote>Organizations, even large ones, are just the culmination of a few individuals’ judgments. No amount of budget can allow you to escape that.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Zooming out, as an engineering team starts to scale alongside a company, leaders shouldn’t lose sight of what has gotten so many well-meaning execs into messes before: Following the rules too closely. “Your ultimate goal is to create this high-quality mechanism around people being curious and looking for the exceptions,” Larson says. But that also doesn’t mean that leaders have to figure out the answers for everything alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Larson has been holding a bi-weekly <a href="https://lethain.com/rough-notes-learning-circles/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>“learning circle”</u></a> for the past three and a half years. It’s a group of six to ten CTOs, VPs of Engineering or other senior engineering executives at tech companies who come together to catch up, exchange tactics and process issues together.&nbsp;</p><p>“We start each meeting out by going around the room and giving each person one minute to say what they are focused on this week and give a topic they’d like to talk about. After five minutes or so talking about topics, we choose one as a group and spend the next 20 minutes or so really drilling into it,” he says. Topics range from “I’m getting screwed over by this project,” to “I just hired someone really good that I’m excited about.”&nbsp;</p><p>For those who learn by doing, leaning into routine reflections like a learning circle or solo can force the introspection needed to scale rules with nuance. “I’ve become a better leader learning from the lessons of others who have made similar mistakes before me,” Larson says.&nbsp;</p><div><p><em>This article is a lightly edited transcript of our interview with Larson on the In Depth podcast.

<h2><a name="1"></a>Growth and sustainability</h2>

<p>Our journey over the past two years has been marked by continuous growth and improvement. We have expanded our paid member base (which is now <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">more populous than 14 world countries!</a>), introduced a <a href="https://kagi.com/changelog">slew of innovative features</a>, and maintained a steadfast commitment to <a href="https://kagi.com/privacy">privacy</a> and the <a href="https://x.com/vladquant/likes">quality</a> of the search experience.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716361973-858686-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-001246.png" width="800"></center>
<center><em>Kagi member growth over time. Note the expansion after the $10/mo unlimited plan was introduced.</em></center>

<p>We are also thrilled to report that we have achieved profitability. This significant milestone is a testament to our sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility. It demonstrates that our approach of offering a premium, ad-free search experience resonates with users who support a service aligning with their values. Becoming profitable allows us to reinvest in the business, further enhancing our offerings and ensuring that we can continue to provide a top-notch search experience.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the support of our users who have played a crucial role in reaching this milestone. Together, we will continue to build a better, more user-centric web.</p>

<p>As we look to the future, our focus remains on sustaining this momentum. If we continue on the path of current growth, which so far has been completely organic, we will reach 1 million paying users in the next 36 months.</p>

<center><em>Public comment from a member on Reddit 🙏</em></center>

<p>Support like this not only means a lot to us but has been the main driver of Kagi adoption so far, and for that we are forever thankful!</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>New shareholders and team members</h2>

<p>We are excited to announce that so far, 93 Kagi members have joined Kagi as investors through our two investment rounds, most recent closing a few weeks ago. The investment not only brought in capital (which we will use for hiring, R&amp;D and search index expansion) but also strengthens our community-centric approach, as these investors are also users who deeply believe in our mission. The rest of the company remains owned by the founder, employees, and advisors, ensuring that those who are directly involved in building and sustaining Kagi have a significant stake in its success.</p>

<p>This diverse ownership structure fosters a sense of shared purpose and collaboration and aligns the incentives of everyone involved. Having users as investors provides invaluable insights and feedback (and sometimes key leadership talent!), helping us better understand and meet their needs. It also reinforces our commitment to transparency and accountability, as we are directly answerable to a community that is both invested in and supportive of our long-term vision. While we have no immediate plans to raise additional funding, if you are interested to be notified about any future fundraising, <a href="https://forms.gle/1Try2v6JtXbKSjKx9">get in touch</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716360672-296077-screenshot-2024-05-21-at-235107.png" width="600"></center>
<center><em>Kagi team members around the globe</em></center>

<p>Our team has expanded to 37 people around the globe, working together to bring a friendly version of the web to people, families, and organizations worldwide. We are actively <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/hiring-kagi.html">hiring</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="4"></a>Kagi becomes a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)</h2>

<p>The Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC) is an entity created by amendment to the Delaware General Corporation Law in 2013, and is structurally identical to the familiar Delaware C corporation with one major difference: company directors and officers are given explicit permission to consider a purpose beyond simply maximizing shareholder value.</p>

<p>Kagi transitioned to a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), marking a significant milestone in our journey. This structural change allows the legal entity to consider a purpose beyond simply maximizing shareholder value, balancing it with the best interests of all stakeholders, including the communities we serve, along with the specific public benefit.</p>

<p>In particular, the public benefit statement entered into Kagi’s charter is: “<strong>Kagi is committed to creating a more human-centric and sustainable web that benefits individuals, communities, and society as a whole, with a transparent business model that aligns the incentives of everyone involved.</strong>”</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716360472-761510-screenshot-2024-05-21-at-234747.png" alt="Kagi PBC"></p>

<p>This transition ensures that our mission-driven approach is not just a guiding principle but a legal obligation, protecting us from external pressures that might otherwise divert us from our path. The PBC designation also resonates with our community of users, who value ethical business practices and corporate responsibility. It provides a clear signal that Kagi is dedicated to making a positive impact on the world, aligning our business practices with the broader goal of societal benefit.</p>

<p>Some examples of companies structured as PBC  out there include Laureate, Plum Organics, Kickstarter and Anthropic. We’d like to thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a> for introducing us to the PBC structure.  You can read more about it <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=public+benefit+corporation+PBC&amp;r=us&amp;sh=FuSMLpCLQlOTugxwnnQo6g">on Kagi</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="5"></a>Kagi’s unique approach to search</h2>

<p>From day one, Kagi Search was built with one goal in mind — show the world that a high-quality, user-centric search engine is possible. Why was this not possible before? In short, in every market economy, there has to be a customer. For search, that customer can be either you or an advertiser, and this simple choice determines all incentives and outcomes in the search experience. With Kagi, for the first time in history of search engines, you are the customer and everything is built around you and your needs alone.</p>

<p>And we know what our customers want because it is the same thing we want: no ads, no spam, no low-quality content, and no insult to our intelligence from the search engine we use. We want results that include human discussions, not LLM-generated content. We value opinions and expertise from personal websites and blogs over ad-filled, and tracking-infested content silos.</p>

<p>We want to explore and discover the web, versus being told what to buy. We want to connect to and understand other humans and their work, not be consumers of the content created with the only purpose of monetizing our attention and wasting our time and brain cycles in the process.</p>

<p>And this is what Kagi strives to deliver.</p>

<p>For instance, when you ask your search engine a programming question, you want to see official documentation, industry experts, personal blogs, and other authentic sources of information.</p>

<center><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392268-405998-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-083623.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392268-405998-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-083623.png"></a></center>
<center><em>User-centric vs ad-supported, click to enlarge</em></center>

<p>Similarly, searching for “best headphones” should yield genuine recommendations, not headphone ads from the highest bidder. What you often find in Kagi is information from people who are truly knowledgeable and passionate about their topic.</p>

<center><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392725-691336-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-084426.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392725-691336-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-084426.png"></a></center>
<center><em>User-centric vs ad-supported, click to enlarge</em></center>

<p>Whenever possible we want to make sure that facts shown in Kagi are accurate and computable. This is why we <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-wolfram">integrate with Wolfram|Alpha</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-03-05/1709654440-735786-screenshot-2024-03-05-at-080035.png" width="600"></center>

<p>We are not trying to influence users’ search results; instead, we aim to provide users with tools and features to <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/website-info-personalized-results.html">personalize</a> their search experience according to their preferences. For example, with Kagi, users can <a href="https://kagi.com/stats?stat=leaderboard">block sites</a> they do not like and promote those they prefer.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716393012-475138-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-085004.png" width="600"></center>

<p>Use <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/lenses.html">Kagi lenses</a> to narrow down searches to the academic realm or one of the many predefined lenses - or create your own search lens with your favorite sites.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716393399-721245-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-085620.png" width="800"></center>
<center><em>Search results with “Academic” lens enabled</em></center>

<p>The continuous shipping of features and improvements has been largely driven by our active member community and would not have been possible without it. The Kagi Search <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/">feedback forum</a> currently hosts over <strong>3,500</strong> discussions, while the Kagi’s Orion Browser <a href="https://orionfeedback.org/">feedback forum</a> boasts over <strong>6,400</strong> discussions!</p>

<p>These massive public forums are among the most active web search and browser product communities on the web, reflecting the incredible level of engagement and valuable insights provided by our users. This is also why <strong>we do not have or need any telemetry in our products</strong> - we can barely keep up with what our users are directly asking us to do!</p>

<h2><a name="6"></a>Orion - Web browser that has your back</h2>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-30/1717079482-339174-04.png"></center>
<center><em>Orion is a lightweight Mac browser, with native support for horizontal, vertical and compact tabs</em></center>

<p>Most people may not know this, but Kagi started developing <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion browser</a> even before the search engine (and Orion’s feedback forum has almost twice as many discussion than the one for Kagi Search!). It is clear to us that no successful search engine could thrive without a companion web browser built on the same set of core values, including the alignment of all incentives.</p>

<p>We are pleased to see so many people excited about the prospect of Orion and willing to <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/orionplus.html">pay for it</a>, which may sound like an even more “outrageous” idea than paying for search.</p>

<p>But think about it: a web browser is one of the most important and intimate tools we use on our computers and devices every single day, yet we as a society, have somehow allowed most browsers in use to be directly or indirectly paid for and controlled by advertisers! It is like the situation with search, just worse. This is insanity to me and this is why we are building Orion, a user-centric web browser with a paid business model and no other sources of revenue, to bring sanity back and help support our mission to humanize the web.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-30/1717079301-260116-screenshot-2024-05-30-at-072813.png"></center>
<center><em>Native support for web extensions, profiles, and much more…</em></center>

<p>Orion is WebKit-based, built from scratch for high performance, zero-telemetry by default, <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/#privacy">truly privacy respecting</a>, with built-in ad and tracking blocking like no other web browser in the world. On top of that, we brought the same Web Extensions API used by Chrome and Firefox to WebKit, allowing Orion to run both Chrome and Firefox extensions natively out of the box (you can follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14IgSRVop4psUTgtLZlvYJYrAArhvL3WvRlUdzdQbIoQ/edit?usp=sharing">our progress</a>, with many extensions already working, including on iOS!).</p>

<p>For the Mac fans out there, you will be pleased to know that Orion has ported the latest WebKit to macOS Mojave and Catalina, even though Apple stopped updating it years ago. Yes, it is incredibly hard to do this and maintain it with our limited resources, but we believe it should be done, and we are known for doing things the hard way.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-30/1717083278-428587-screen-shot-2024-05-30-at-83125-am.png"></center>
<center><em>Orion on macOS Catalina using WebKit that is newer than not only WebKit in Safari on Catalina, but also the one used in Safari on Sonoma. Kudos for the Orion dev team.</em></center>

<p>And the best thing - Orion is free (truly free, not like ad-supported browser “free”) and you can choose to <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/orionplus.html">pay for it</a> and support your browser directly.</p>

<p>We continue to work very hard on Orion, aiming to exit beta status by the beginning of 2025. It is currently <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/#download_sec">available</a> for Mac and iPhone/iPad, with plans (resource permitting) to expand to Windows, Android, and Linux.</p>

<h2><a name="7"></a>Chapter 2: Setting up for success</h2>

<p>The relentless pursuit of excellence ensures that Kagi users receive a seamless and trustworthy search experience, setting us apart in an industry driven by ads, tracking, and misaligned incentives.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716359822-625955-screenshot-2024-05-21-at-233656.png" width="700"></center>
<center><em>Note from a Kagi member, shown with their permission</em></center>

<p>As we look behind us, we are proud of what we have built together over the last two years, with our incredible member community.</p>

<p>We realize that we are now entering the next chapter of Kagi’s journey, Chapter 2, where we are intensifying our focus on craftsmanship and delighting users, supported by a more mature organization.</p>

<p>We have hired key leadership positions to lead our efforts in these critical areas.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716358485-924099-img-7462.jpg" width="600"></center>
<center><em>Kagi leadership meeting, New York, April 2024.<br> From left to right: Zac Nowicki, Vladimir Prelovac, Hugh O’Brien, Luis Da Silva.</em></center>

<p>Additionally, we are reorganizing our internal structure, creating specialized teams, establishing new processes, and setting ourselves up for success over the next two years.</p>

<h3><a name="8"></a>Moving forward: Relentless focus on core search experience</h3>

<p>In a rapidly evolving digital landscape where “AI” continues to dominate the conversation, especially in search (it is almost as if the rest of the industry forgot that the purpose of search engines is to focus on relevant search results), Kagi’s unwavering commitment to refining the core search experience has never been more critical.</p>

<p>We are dedicated to delivering the most accurate, privacy-respecting, and user-centric search results, reinforcing our belief that the human element remains essential in the search experience. We will be investing in expanding our index, launching an API so that everyone can build on top of Kagi’s search quality, and improving the UX of search itself with new widgets, customization and quality of life improvements.</p>

<p>We recognize that the search experience should be intuitive, fast, reliable, and most importantly, of the highest possible quality. As such, our development efforts are centered around improving search algorithms, expanding our own index, reducing latency, and ensuring that our platform remains free of low-quality and LLM-generated content.</p>

<h3><a name="9"></a>What about “AI”?</h3>

<p>Although “AI” has been used in search for decades, it has recently resurfaced in public discourse with the proliferation of large language models (LLMs). We never integrated features (including AI) for the sake of having them, but did so <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-ai-search#philosophy">as thoughtfully as we could</a> to enhance the user experience without compromising our core values. The job of technology is not to make humans do more; the job of technology is to make our journey in this world more enjoyable.</p>

<p>I have been using LLMs as a tool for coding (acknowledging their <a href="https://x.com/vladquant/status/1791341643351880050">limitations</a>). I am using them for factual summarization through Kagi’s <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/quick-answer.html">Quick Answer</a> and <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html">Assistant</a>, which are on-demand features that work well thanks to grounding in Kagi Search. And as someone diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hands, I will rely increasingly on voice-to-text AI for typing and interaction. I believe that other AI modalities, such as image understanding, will greatly improve the quality of life for people with disabilities like visual impairment.</p>

<p>LLM research has produced advanced models, and some companies have paved the way for the public to accept paying $20-$30 per month to use top LLMs. We see an opportunity to compete in this market with Kagi Assistant. We will offer access to world’s best LLMs, with answers grounded in Kagi Search, all in one place and included in a single $25/month Kagi Ultimate subscription. Kagi Assistant is currently in <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html">open beta</a>, with the full version expected to launch in July.</p>

<p>It is clear that the quality of any AI integration built on top of search will only be as good as the underlying search engine. Our primary goal is to keep providing the best search results in the world.</p>

<h3><a name="10"></a>Roadmap ahead</h3>

<p>Our roadmap includes several ambitious projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expansion of Kagi’s own index, aiming to cover 100 million of the highest quality pages on the web. (we will keep focusing on quality vs quantity.)</li>
<li>Doing more with the wonderful <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Kagi Small Web</a> initiative that has grown to over 12,000 websites and is <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">open-source</a>.</li>
<li>A complete revamp of our search widgets, including stock, sports, weather, and calculator widgets, including <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/36-custom-widgetscomputer-plugins">user-defined widgets</a> - all right inside search results.</li>
<li>Launching Kagi mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms.</li>
<li>Launching <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html">Kagi Assistant</a>: Access the world’s best LLMs, grounded in Kagi Search.</li>
<li>Kagi Maps, based on Mapbox and OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li><a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a> exiting public beta and offering high-performance (WebKit based), zero-telemetry, ad-free, and tracking-free browsing. Also, similar to Kagi Search, you can <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/orionplus.html">pay for your browser</a>.</li>
<li>Seamless integration between Kagi products, for great user experience inside our ecosystem.</li>
<li>Launch of Kagi Search APIs to enable others to build upon our legendary search results.</li>
<li>Expanding our offering to enterprise and education sectors with a tailored solution. (We’d love to see Kagi in schools, and if you would as well, <a href="mailto:vlad@kagi.com">let us know</a> or mention Kagi to your kid’s teacher.)</li>
</ul>

</p><center><em>Kagi product roadmap. Dates are aspirational.</em></center>

<p>These initiatives are designed to enhance our core search offering, introduce other products with the same core values to our ecosystem, enlarge the number of people who will benefit from Kagi, and provide even more value to our member community included in their subscription. We are excited about the future and committed to delivering on these promises, one step at a time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Lumen Technologies’ Black Lotus Labs</span> <span data-contrast="none">identified a destructive event, as over 600,000 small office/home office (SOHO) routers were taken offline belonging to a single internet service provider (ISP). The incident took place over a 72-hour period between October 25-27, rendered the infected devices permanently inoperable, and required a hardware-based replacement. Public scan data confirmed the sudden and precipitous removal of 49% of all modems from the impacted ISP’s autonomous system number (ASN) during this time period.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our analysis identified “Chalubo,” a commodity remote access trojan (RAT), as the primary payload responsible for the event. This trojan, </span><a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2018/10/22/chalubo-botnet-wants-to-ddos-from-your-server-or-iot-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">first identified in 2018</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, employed savvy tradecraft to obfuscate its activity; it removed all files from disk to run in-memory, assumed a random process name already present on the device, and encrypted all communications with the command and control (C2) server. We suspect these factors contributed to there being only </span><span data-contrast="auto">one report on the Chalubo malware family</span><span data-contrast="none"> to date. Chalubo has payloads designed for all major SOHO/IoT kernels, pre-built functionality to perform DDoS attacks, and can execute any Lua script sent to the bot. We suspect the Lua functionality was likely employed by the malicious actor to retrieve the destructive payload.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Lumen’s global telemetry indicates the Chalubo malware family was highly active in November 2023 and remained so into early 2024. Based on a 30-day snapshot in October, Lumen identified over 330,000 unique IP addresses that communicated with one of 75 observed C2 nodes for at least two days, indicating a confirmed infection. This suggests that while the Chalubo malware was used in this destructive attack, it was not written specifically for destructive actions. We suspect the threat actors behind this event chose a commodity malware family to obfuscate attribution, instead of using a custom-developed toolkit. At this time, we do not have an overlap between this activity and any known nation-state activity clusters. We assess with high confidence that the malicious firmware update was a deliberate act intended to cause an outage, and </span><span data-contrast="none">thought</span><span data-contrast="none"> we expected to see a number of router make and models affected across the internet, this event was confined to the single ASN.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Having verified a potential impact to a specific ASN, we queried Black Lotus Labs global telemetry for connections from that ASN, leading us to the first payload server – which had an open directory. Our finding shows the path of a multi-stage infection mechanism that would install the Chalubo RAT, a botnet with a global footprint targeting SOHO gateways and IoT devices.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Figure 3: Excerpt of the malicious script</em></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Next, the get_scrpc script decides if the md5 hash of the usb2rci file matches a known string. If not matched, it retrieves the payload from one of the first stage payload servers. One such URL was hxxp://104.233.210[.]119:51248/get_fwuueicj. The last step retrieves a second bash script called “get_strtriiusj.” This script verifies the presence of a file named “/tmp/.adiisu,” if the file was present it would exit. If not, it would create the file, then copy the main payload file to the /tmp/ directory and rename it “/tmp/crrs.” With access to the tmp directory it can modify the permissions to make it executable, and then execute the file. This loader file appeared to be compiled on October 25, 2023, at 9:55:18 UTC. It was a big-endian shared object, .so file, compiled for MIPS R3000 CPU.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When the malware ran, it attempted to retrieve some host-based information such as the MAC address, device ID, device type, device version and the local IP. Chalubo would first try to send that information to the threat actor-created domain and URL at coreconfig[.]net8080/E2XRIEGSOAPU3Z5Q8. If unable to resolve the domain, it would fall back to the hard-coded IP address 185.189.240[.]13, which is where the current domain resolved on October 30, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As for the binary “get_fwuueicj,” it first forks itself and then attempts to open the file “/tmp/tmp.lck,” or “/var/tmp/tmp.lck” and then “/data/local/tmp/tmp.lck” if /tmp/tmp.lck fails.</span><br>

<h2>Global Telemetry Associated with Chalubo Malware</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there were interactions between the impacted ASN and payload servers, we needed to determine if this was an isolated event or if similar activity patterns were occurring elsewhere in the world with other Chalubo bot infections. Examining the bot’s ecosystem, we found that from September to November of 2023, there were about 45 malware panels on the internet. While 28 of the panels interacted with 10 or fewer bots, the top ten panels interacted with anywhere between ~13,500 to ~117,000 unique IP addresses over a 30-day timeframe. Telemetry associated with those IP addresses revealed that over 650K unique IP addresses had contact with at least one controller over a 30-day period ending on November 3. Another observation from this timeframe showed that 95% of the bots communicated with only one control panel. This suggests the entity behind these operations had distinct silos of operations: whereas most botnets tend to communicate with multiple C2 nodes for greater redundancy in case one server was taken offline. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A closer look at the data showed that roughly half of those bots communicated with C2s for just one to two days. We felt this could denote various internet noise, such as scanners or security researchers, so we removed all suspect IP addresses from the dataset. With the cleaned dataset we plotted the IP addresses and their corresponding country for the timeframe in which the event took place, and generated the following heat map: </span><br>

<p><em>Figure 14: Global heat map showing the distribution of bots by distinct IP addresses October 2023</em></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By analyzing the controllers, we identified a tier-two server located at 103.140.187[.]149, which appeared to administer controllers around the globe. Using URLScan to investigate this address brought us to the </span><a href="https://urlscan.io/result/e7681c6c-5a46-4c35-b5d0-f7fd5ee2c001/"><span data-contrast="none">landing page</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which showed only a login panel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">During this timeframe only one panel was used for the destructive attack. This led us to believe that while Chalubo itself was the RAT used to perform the destructive event, not all Chalubo infections resulted in a destructive attack. This suggests that the malicious cyber actor behind this event likely purchased a panel for non-attribution.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Black Lotus Labs has reported on SOHO activity from </span><a href="https://blog.lumen.com/hacktivist-campaign-spreads-manifesto-through-router-configuration-files/"><span data-contrast="none">hacktivist</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://blog.lumen.com/chaos-is-a-go-based-swiss-army-knife-of-malware/"><span data-contrast="none">cybercriminals</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://blog.lumen.com/routers-roasting-on-an-open-firewall-the-kv-botnet-investigation/"><span data-contrast="none">nation-state actors</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> over the past several years. However, this investigation stood out for two reasons. First, this campaign resulted in a hardware-based replacement of the affected devices, which likely indicates that the attacker corrupted the firmware on specific models. The event was unprecedented due to the number of units affected – no attack that we can recall has required the replacement of over 600,000 devices. In addition, this type of attack has only ever happened once before, with AcidRain used as a precursor to an active military invasion. At this time, we do not assess this to be the work of a nation-state or state-sponsored entity. In fact, we have not observed any overlap with known destructive activity clusters; particularly those prone to destructive events such as Volt Typhoon, or SeaShell Blizzard.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The second unique aspect is that this campaign was confined to a particular ASN. Most previous campaigns we’ve seen target a specific router model or common vulnerability and have effects across multiple providers’ networks. In this instance, we observed that both Sagemcom and ActionTec devices were impacted at the same time, both within the same provider’s network. This led us to assess it was not the result of a faulty firmware update by a single manufacturer, which would normally be confined to one device model or models from a given company. Our analysis of the Censys data shows the impact was only for the two in question. This combination of factors led us to conclude the event was likely a deliberate action taken by an unattributed malicious cyber actor, even if we were not able to recover the destructive module.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Black Lotus Labs has added the IoCs from both this campaign and the Chalubo malware into the threat intelligence feed that fuels the Lumen Connected Security portfolio. We continue to monitor new infrastructure, targeting activity, and expanding TTPs including those in this report, and will provide updates as appropriate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We will continue to collaborate with the security research community to share findings related to this activity and ensure the public is informed. We encourage the community to monitor as well as alert on these and any similar IoCs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/operation-endgame-hits-malware-delivery-platforms/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/operation-endgame-hits-malware-delivery-platforms/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40524823">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Law enforcement agencies in the United States and Europe today announced <strong>Operation Endgame</strong>, a coordinated action against some of the most popular cybercrime platforms for delivering ransomware and data-stealing malware. Dubbed “the largest ever operation against botnets,” the international effort is being billed as the opening salvo in an ongoing campaign targeting advanced malware “droppers” or “loaders” like&nbsp;<strong>IcedID</strong>, <strong>Smokeloader</strong> and <strong>Trickbot</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_67699"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67699" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill.png" alt="" width="749" height="678" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill.png 998w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill-768x696.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill-782x708.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-67699">A frame from one of three animated videos released today in connection with Operation Endgame.</p></div>
<p>Operation Endgame targets the cybercrime ecosystem supporting droppers/loaders, slang terms used to describe tiny, custom-made programs designed to surreptitiously install malware onto a target system. Droppers are typically used in the initial stages of a breach, and they allow cybercriminals to bypass security measures and deploy additional harmful programs, including viruses, ransomware, or spyware.</p>
<p>Droppers like IcedID are most often deployed through email attachments, hacked websites, or bundled with legitimate software. For example, cybercriminals have long used <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/using-google-search-to-find-software-can-be-risky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid ads on Google to trick people into installing malware</a> disguised as popular free software, such as Microsoft Teams, Adobe Reader and Discord. In those cases, the dropper is the hidden component bundled with the legitimate software that quietly loads malware onto the user’s system.</p>
<p>Droppers remain such a critical, human-intensive component of nearly all major cybercrime enterprises that the most popular have turned into full-fledged cybercrime services of their own. By targeting the individuals who develop and maintain dropper services and their supporting infrastructure, authorities are hoping to disrupt multiple cybercriminal operations simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/largest-ever-operation-against-botnets-hits-dropper-malware-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from the European police agency <strong>Europol</strong>, between May 27 and May 29, 2024 authorities arrested four suspects (one in Armenia and three in Ukraine), and disrupted or took down more than 100 Internet servers in Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States and Ukraine. Authorities say they also seized more than 2,000 domain names that supported dropper infrastructure online.</p>
<p>In addition, Europol released information on eight fugitives suspected of involvement in dropper services and who are wanted by Germany; their names and photos were added to Europol’s “Most Wanted” list on 30 May 2024.<span id="more-67691"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_67696"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67696" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de.png" alt="" width="748" height="329" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de.png 1307w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de-768x337.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de-782x343.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-67696">A “wanted” poster including the names and photos of eight suspects wanted by Germany and now on Europol’s “Most Wanted” list.</p></div>
<p>“It has been discovered through the investigations so far that one of the main suspects has earned at least EUR 69 million in cryptocurrency by renting out criminal infrastructure sites to deploy ransomware,” Europol wrote. “The suspect’s transactions are constantly being monitored and legal permission to seize these assets upon future actions has already been obtained.”</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/08/u-s-hacks-qakbot-quietly-removes-botnet-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous such coordinated malware takedown efforts</a> in the past, and yet often the substantial amount of coordination required between law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms involved is not sustained after the initial disruption and/or arrests.</p>
<p>But a new website erected to detail today’s action — <a href="https://www.operation-endgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operation-endgame.com</a> — makes the case that this time is different, and that more takedowns and arrests are coming. “Operation Endgame does not end today,” the site promises. “New actions will be announced on this website.”</p>
<div id="attachment_67697"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67697" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgame-think.png" alt="" width="633" height="521"></p><p id="caption-attachment-67697">A message on operation-endgame.com promises more law enforcement and disruption actions.</p></div>
<p>Perhaps in recognition that many of today’s top cybercriminals reside in countries that are effectively beyond the reach of international law enforcement, actions like Operation Endgame seem increasingly focused on mind games — i.e., trolling the hackers.</p>
<p>Writing in this month’s issue of <em>Wired</em>, <strong>Matt Burgess</strong> makes the case that Western law enforcement officials have turned to psychological measures as an added way to slow down Russian hackers and cut to the heart of the sweeping cybercrime ecosystem.</p>
<p>“These nascent psyops include efforts to erode the limited trust the criminals have in each other, driving subtle wedges between fragile hacker egos, and sending offenders personalized messages showing they’re being watched,” Burgess <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cop-cybercriminal-hacker-psyops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>When authorities in the U.S. and U.K. announced in February 2024 that they’d <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/02/feds-seize-lockbit-ransomware-websites-offer-decryption-tools-troll-affiliates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infiltrated and seized</a> the infrastructure used by the infamous <strong>LockBit</strong> ransomware gang, they borrowed the existing design of LockBit’s victim shaming website to link instead to press releases about the takedown, and included a countdown timer that was eventually replaced with the personal details of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/how-did-authorities-identify-the-alleged-lockbit-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LockBit’s alleged leader</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_66436"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66436" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized.png" alt="" width="750" height="474" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized.png 1379w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized-768x486.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized-782x494.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66436">The feds used the existing design on LockBit’s victim shaming website to feature press releases and free decryption tools.</p></div>
<p>The Operation Endgame website also includes a countdown timer, which serves to tease the release of several animated videos that mimic the same sort of flashy, short advertisements that established cybercriminals often produce to promote their services online. At least two of the videos include a substantial amount of text written in Russian.</p>
<p>The coordinated takedown comes on the heels of another law enforcement action this week against what the director of the FBI called “<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/is-your-computer-part-of-the-largest-botnet-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely the world’s largest botnet ever</a>.” On Wednesday <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ) announced the arrest of <strong>YunHe Wang</strong>, the alleged operator of the ten-year-old online anonymity service <strong>911 S5</strong>. The government also seized 911 S5’s domains and online infrastructure, which allegedly turned computers running various “free VPN” products into Internet traffic relays that facilitated billions of dollars in online fraud and cybercrime.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The problem with vector-only search</h2><p>At Assembled, <a href="https://www.assembled.com/blog/unveiling-assembled-assist">our issue resolution engine</a> is designed to assist customer support by suggesting potential answers to support queries. We use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for much of this pipeline because it's quicker to iterate on than fine-tuning, doesn’t require training on customer data (which many companies prefer), and generally provides high-quality results.</p><p>However, we encountered a significant challenge with RAG: relying solely on vector search (even using both dense and sparse vectors) doesn’t always deliver satisfactory results for certain queries. This issue was particularly evident when users entered specific keywords that didn’t accurately match stored knowledge articles.</p><p>Customer support teams often have multiple articles on similar topics and lack a tightly curated knowledge base, leading vector search to sometimes return irrelevant results to our RAG engine and reduce response accuracy. Users familiar with traditional keyword searches were puzzled when our system couldn't find the right documents, especially for short queries with prominent but ambiguous keywords.</p><p>For example, if a user asked “what features are included in a premium plan?”, vector search would excel at pulling documents about different plans, customer testimonials, or marketing materials. However, vector search would often fail at finding articles specifically targeting premium plans.</p><h2>The solution: Hybrid Search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion</h2><p>To address this issue, we integrated a new keyword search infrastructure that combines its results with vector search for optimal performance. In the above example, keyword search would hone in on “features”, “premium”, and “plan”, and narrow search results to documents specifically matching these keywords. A hybrid approach with both vector and keyword search allows us to effectively return articles with semantic matches while also providing users with the familiar feel of traditional keyword search. Our intuition was based on our experience with other machine learning systems where ensemble models <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/improving-retrieval-performance-in-rag-pipelines-with-hybrid-search-c75203c2f2f5">generally outperform single models</a>.</p><h3>Document store abstraction</h3><p>To enable a hybrid store solution, we developed a document store abstraction in our code, allowing us to integrate multiple search algorithms. The abstraction is simple but captures all the essential functionalities of a document store and search system. It handles document management and querying and is agnostic to the actual implementation (vector search, keyword search, etc.). Here’s what it looks like:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/610225ff318d106f5343df0c/66560d105c674222981cdd13_Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%209.57.24%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>With this abstraction, we had the primitives we needed to swap different search systems in and out easily. Uploading a document could be done once and then sync across multiple document stores. Similarly, searching for a document could be done in parallel across multiple document stores using a standardized query.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/610225ff318d106f5343df0c/66560c2a2d3e9978690f41d9_hybridsearch.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The interesting part is that our hybrid search store itself implements the <strong><code>DocumentStore</code></strong> interface. This means that, from the perspective of the caller, it doesn't matter whether they are interacting with a single store or our complex hybrid store — they use the same interface and methods. This design ensures that all of the logic for determining which documents are retrieved is hidden from the caller and can be tested separately. To implement the hybrid store, we passed in multiple child document stores and parallelized the search across all of the child stores.</p><h3>Syncing documents across stores</h3><p>Enabling multiple document stores introduced technical challenges, especially around ensuring synchronization. Out-of-sync document stores could lead to subtle bugs, such as a document being present in one store but not another. To address this, we implemented the following:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> We maintain a document store in PostgreSQL (for metadata)&nbsp;and S3 (for the actual documents themselves) as a source of truth. This store implements document storage interfaces but is not included in queries. It serves solely for record keeping, allowing us to resync content if necessary.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous updates:</strong> Due to higher latency in storing articles, we first update our source of truth in the database and provide an acknowledgement to the frontend. We then asynchronously store the documents in our child stores. This approach helps manage latency across multiple stores and ensures our document stores are eventually consistent.</li><li><strong>Error handling:</strong> We also need to handle errors across different platforms. For example, one store might experience a network outage while another completes the storage process successfully. Our PostgreSQL database tracks the synchronization status of each store. If a store fails to sync, we employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a> to retry the operation, ensuring that all stores are eventually brought into sync.</li></ul><h2>Combining results across multiple search engines</h2><p>To optimize search performance, we explored several algorithms for merging the results from our different document stores.</p><h3>Weighting-based fusion</h3><p>Our initial approach involved experimenting with various weighting mechanisms for sparse/dense vectors and keyword search. The goal was to find optimal weightings that leverage the strengths of each search method. However, identifying the correct weightings proved challenging due to the unknown distribution of vector search scores. This variability made it difficult to determine the relative importance of different weightings.</p><p>What’s more, empirical data showed that similarity scores (dot product and Euclidean distance) varied widely across our customer base. The differential performance across these metrics made it impractical to develop a universal weighting scheme for combining vector and keyword searches. Tuning these weights on a per-customer basis was not scalable.</p><h3>Rank fusion</h3><p>Next, we turned to rank fusion algorithms, inspired by literature reviews and their demonstrated effectiveness in search optimization (see <a href="https://rodgerbenham.github.io/bc17-adcs.pdf">[0]</a> and <a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf">[1]</a>). Rank fusion algorithms, particularly Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), provided a promising alternative. Here’s how most rank fusion algorithms work:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Rank assignment:</strong> Each document from the individual ranked lists is assigned a score based on its rank position. Typically, the score is the reciprocal of its rank (i.e., 1/rank). For example, a document ranked first gets a score of 1, the second gets 0.5, the third gets 0.33, and so on.</li><li><strong>Score summation:</strong> The scores from all ranked lists are summed for each document. Documents appearing in multiple lists accumulate higher combined scores.</li><li><strong>Final ranking:</strong> Documents are re-ranked based on their combined scores, producing a final ranked list that integrates the rankings from all individual search engines.</li></ol><h3>Why we chose RRF</h3><p>After extensive testing, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) consistently outperformed many of the more complex methods we evaluated. Several factors contributed to this:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Simplicity and robustness:</strong> RRF's simplicity makes it less prone to overfitting specific scenarios, aligning with the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam’s razor</a>. This simplicity enhances its robustness across different contexts.</li><li><strong>Minimal tuning:</strong> RRF provides a straightforward and effective way to rank results without the need for extensive parameter tuning. This is particularly advantageous given our diverse customer base and their varying knowledge bases.</li></ul><p>By implementing RRF, we achieved a flexible and scalable method for combining search results. Using RRF, we not only enhanced the accuracy and relevance of search outcomes but also simplified the overall search infrastructure, ensuring a robust solution for our diverse customer set.</p><h2>Optimizing our search infrastructure</h2><p>Finally, a note on our search engine choices. At Assembled, we use <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a> for vector search and <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> for keyword search. After minimal testing with other providers, we concluded that the marginal benefits of further optimization were not significant. Consequently, we decided against hosting our own open-source vector database, such as <a href="https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus">Milvus</a>, or managing our own keyword search on <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>.</p><p>Using B2B solutions like Pinecone and Algolia offers several advantages:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> These services are reasonably cost-effective (especially when comparing to engineering time) and eliminate the need for significant upfront investment in infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Maintenance reduction:</strong> Like most companies, we’re resource constrained by engineering resources, so by outsourcing to specialized search companies, we avoid the substantial maintenance burden associated with self-hosted solutions. This allows our team to focus on our core functionality of AI&nbsp;replies for support issues.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> Algolia in particular provides low-latency responses, a robust API, and highly optimized search outputs which would likely outperform anything we could build on Elasticsearch.</li></ul><h2>We’re hiring!</h2><p>We’re seeing exciting results, but there’s always a lot more to do. Since implementing this framework, there have been a lot of developments in RAG-based techniques, such as fine tuning of embedding models, applying matrix transformations on vector results, HyDE, etc. If you’re interested in helping us solve these problems, <a href="https://www.assembled.com/careers-at-assembled#openings">check out our open roles</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Tanzania, which registered the ship where Saleh was abandoned, never acted on his case or even responded to emails, said Mohamed Arrachedi, a union organizer who worked on Saleh’s case.</p>
    
<p>Shipowners often abandon crew members when they are hit by rising fuel costs, debt or unexpected repairs they can’t afford. Some owners vow to pay when their finances turn around. But those promises can mean little to the men on board, who often resort to handouts for food and basic supplies. Many are also supporting families back home and risk losing everything if they step off their ships.</p><p>Crew members or the countries where the ships are registered or docked can pursue the shipowners in court. But recovering past wages can be a yearslong battle that often fails.</p><p>Returning to Egypt in April was joyous, Saleh, 62, told The Associated Press, but also brought sad news.

While stuck in Saudi Arabia, Saleh and a small group of crewmates, also from war-torn Syria, placed a prayer mat in the pilothouse overlooking the port. A stray cat they named Apricot took up residence on the ship and followed Saleh around.</p><p>Saleh ran laps along the deck at sunrise and sunset. Every day he clocked 1,500 meters, while around him mammoth container ships arrived and departed from the busy port as his situation stayed the same. His debts accumulated from years of borrowing money to help his family pay rent.</p><p>The days blurred into a painful monotony.</p><p>“I can’t tell day from night anymore,” he said in a video recording he shared with the AP in January while still aboard the ship, filmed as the day’s light faded and a pinkish glow cast over the harbor.</p>
    

<h2>A SURGE IN CASES</h2><p>Owners abandon ships and crews for a myriad of reasons.</p><p>Cases first jumped in the early days of the pandemic, at a time when canceled shipments, port delays and quarantine restrictions pushed shipping traffic into disarray. At the same time, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-business-jerome-powell-3ce105edc2615e7d31ebeeda01710b3c">demand for goods by homebound consumers</a></span> led to a rush of new orders for ships. But global trade soon shrank, and combined with spikes in fuel and labor costs, many of those new vessels are now at risk of being idled.</p>
    
<p>The increase in the number of cases logged in recent years is also due to better reporting efforts by the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization — the two U.N. agencies responsible for tracking abandonments. With seafarer advocates, they’ve worked to identify cases and assist abandoned crews.</p><p>Cases last year were “alarmingly surpassing the previous year’s record,” the ILO and IMO said in a report this winter.</p><p>Many ships that are abandoned are barely seaworthy and servicing less profitable routes unattractive to the world’s major container lines. They represent a fleet of smaller companies sometimes operating on the edge of legality, for which a minor financial hit can lead to a cascade of unforeseen problems.</p><p>Owners might decide it’s cheaper to abandon a ship than try to save it.</p><p>The U.S., which has some of the stiffest maritime regulations in the world, isn’t immune to the global phenomenon. </p><p>In 2022, Teeters Agency &amp; Stevedoring, a family-run company registered in Florida, dumped two 1970s-era cargo vessels — the Monarch Princess and Monarch Countess — that for years operated as a bridge for sending beat-up cars, cheap electronics and other goods to Haiti. The two ships were flagged to registries run by small island nations — Vanuatu, located east of Australia, and St. Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean — criticized by watchdog groups for lax oversight and financial secrecy.</p><p>After the owners became insolvent and stopped paying dockage fees, the Port of Palm Beach and a private marina sued and a federal judge ordered the two vessels sold at auction. One fetched just $5,000.</p>
    

<p>Abandoned ships are sometimes so old and worn that “even the scrap guys lose money stripping it of anything of value,” said Eric White, a ship inspector for the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.itfglobal.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Transport Workers’ Federation</a></span>, or ITF, a seafarers’ union.</p><p>Left hanging by Teeters were the ships’ crews of mostly Ukrainian seafarers, who suddenly had no way of sending money to families back home in what was now a war zone after Russia’s invasion. In total, the 22 men were owed $130,000 covering more than three months, White said. If not for $22,000 in donations from local seafarers’ charities, none of them would have made it off the ship and back home, according to White.</p><p>The ship’s captain, Ievgen Slautin, said although he was still owed around $15,000, he thanked God he was abandoned in the United States.</p><p>“If it was in some other country, I could have been left there to simply die,″ he said.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

<h2>LAX OVERSIGHT</h2><p>Under the Maritime Labor Convention, a widely ratified international agreement considered a bill of rights for seafarers, workers at sea are deemed abandoned when shipowners withhold two months of wages, stop supplying adequate food supplies, or fail to pay to send them home.</p><p>The convention requires flag states to step in when shipowners abandon crews. They’re responsible for ensuring the seafarers’ welfare, repatriation, and verifying that shipowners have insurance to cover up to four months of wages.</p><p>The regulations are aimed at encouraging countries to thoroughly vet shipowners — and spot risks — before ships are registered under their flag.</p><p>But the rules aren’t uniformly followed, and beyond naming and shaming there are few ways to enforce the standards. Last year, nearly half of abandoned ships had no insurance, according to the IMO. In dozens of cases, flag states that are signatories to the international treaty never even responded when told by the IMO that crews on board their ships were stranded without pay. AP’s review found that countries notified the IMO of their efforts to resolve cases less than a quarter of the time.</p><p>The flag states with the most abandoned ships tend to have large ship registries by dint of offering lower fees. Panama has registered 20% of all ships abandoned since 2019, according to AP’s analysis of the U.N. data, followed by Tanzania, Palau, and Togo which each were responsible for about 5%. The four countries are all considered by the ITF to be “flags of convenience” with minimal oversight.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>Of the four flag states, only Togo responded to questions from the AP. A spokesperson for the country’s international ship registry said it is difficult to vet shipowners’ financial stability, and Togo is “deeply concerned about the complex phenomenon of abandonment.”</p><p>The uneven regulations also influence the ports where ships are abandoned most often. More than a quarter of recent cases have taken place in Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, which haven’t agreed to the abandonment language in the maritime convention. </p><p>In the eyes of Arrachedi, the ITF organizer who worked as Saleh’s case manager, such countries are an ideal haven for shipowners who want to shirk their responsibilities.</p><p>“They know that this is happening in their port,” he said.</p><p>None of the countries responded to AP’s questions about abandonment.</p><p>Saleh’s troubles began in 2015, when the Saudi owners of the ship, then called the Jeddah Palace I and subsequently renamed the Al-Fahad 1, first abandoned him and the rest of the crew along the coast of Sudan. He’d been working on the ship for three years at that point, aiding in the transport of sheep, cows and camels.</p><p>In all, he said, he was marooned in Sudan for seven years awaiting his wages. Though he had no income, he said, Sudanese officials let him come and go by day, and he returned to sleep on the ship.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>When the ship sailed to Jeddah for repairs in June of 2022, Saleh expected his situation to finally turn around. He and the shipowner signed a settlement, reviewed by the AP, acknowledging that the company would pay him $140,000 to cover his overdue wages. He said he was told the ship would soon resume its normal trade routes.</p><p>But nearly two years passed after that agreement with no sign of new business — or Saleh’s money. He continued waiting, stuck on board but just steps from shore.</p><p>The ship’s flag state, Tanzania, which ratified the seafarer convention in 2019, didn’t respond to requests for assistance after being notified more than a year ago, Arrachedi said. </p><p>“This shouldn’t be normalized,” said Arrachedi, who worked for months to stir action from authorities on Saleh’s case. “You have a ship, this ship is in a port. There are maritime authorities there, and there is a flag there.”</p><p>Officials in Saudi Arabia gave little indication that they would resolve Saleh’s case quickly, Arrachedi said, despite the rusting vessel standing out like an eyesore in the country’s most important port.</p><p>The Al-Maha’s owner, Mishal Fahad Abalkhail, said he inherited the ship in 2019 from his father when he was 21 years old. He said the business was already deeply in debt. He said he disagreed with the terms of the failed settlement that he signed and noted that he is in a legal dispute with the shipping agent in Jeddah, which provided port services and ship supplies.</p><p>AP’s attempts to contact the shipping agent were unsuccessful.</p><p>Neither Tanzania’s maritime agency nor the Saudi Arabian Ports Authority responded to AP’s questions.</p>
    

<h2>FISHING BOATS NOT IMMUNE</h2><p>Of the scores of ships reported abandoned last year, just 12 were fishing boats. Despite being highly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, fishing crews have historically made up a tiny fraction of cases — likely because they are less empowered to complain.</p><p>Thousands of miles from Saleh, on the west coast of the United States, Reyner Dagalea spent three months in Westport, Washington, scrubbing the fish hold of a tuna ship, washing the deck, and playing solitaire — anything, he said, to keep his mind off the money his family in the Philippines was waiting on.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>He wasn’t alone: Nearly two dozen other crew members, all Filipino, were confined to fishing vessels belonging to their American employer, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://mcadamsfish.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAdam’s Fish</a></span>, a supplier of sushi-grade Albacore tuna with whom Dagalea was locked in a bitter wage dispute. Without visas, U.S. immigration laws would not permit the fishermen on land.</p><p>Dagalea, 49, urged his family to be patient. “I cannot support you right now because I am stuck here,” he said he told them.</p><p>Though Dagalea said he worked 17-hour days for months catching tuna in the North Pacific, pay stubs shared by the fishermen and their employer show his pay arrived in small, halting sums — $200 one month; nothing the next. By Christmas, documents show that he and five other crew members who spoke with the AP were paid less than half of the wages they should have received. Their pay amounted to around $8 a day.</p><p>The fleet of four ships the men worked on are the first U.S.-flagged vessels listed as abandoned by the U.N. in 15 years. Their ongoing wage dispute reflects the precarious position of fishermen in an industry with few regulations guiding how and when workers are paid.</p><p>Unionization in the seafood industry is minimal, giving fishing crews few protections if they complain. They also have fewer rights than merchant mariners because they’re excluded from the Maritime Labor Convention. Instead, fishing labor standards are set by the weaker Work in Fishing Convention, which requires regular wages but has no formal definition of abandonment, and which only a handful of countries — not including the U.S. — have ratified.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>McAdam’s Fish acknowledged the payment delays but blamed Pescadores International, a recruitment agency based in the Philippines, for being slow to disburse the six months of wages that McAdam’s said it had paid the agency in advance.</p><p>“Regrettably, it appears from a review of the manning agency’s report, that its payments were untimely,” Eric Sternberger, an attorney for McAdam’s, said in an emailed statement. The company asserted that it never heard complaints from the fishermen, and that in its decade-plus track record, no crewman had been underpaid at the end of a contract.</p><p>Pescadores’ owner offered no explanation for the payments delay when asked by AP but said that in previous years the fishermen earned far in excess of the minimum wage. He and Sternberger also sent the AP affidavits from fellow crew members alleging that the complaints were a scheme to obtain U.S. work visas — an accusation that Dagalea and the others denied.</p><div data-align-center="">

But last season’s catch was the worst on record, making it impossible to pay the same catch bonuses as in the past.</p><p>“Over the years, we’ve literally changed lives,” said McAdam, adding that some of the most loyal fishermen have made upwards of $100,000 a year. “It’s one of the few upsides of this business.”</p><p>Shortly after Christmas, officials with <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeland Security Investigations</a></span> boarded the ships and union advocates with ITF began a campaign for Dagalea and the others to recoup the wages. </p><p>Six weeks after authorities intervened, and one week after AP interviewed the six complaining fishermen, Pescadores paid them each about $4,000 — amounting to much of the backpay.</p><p>Federal authorities have since granted the fishermen temporary immigration status to the U.S., and they’ve moved to a rental house in Seattle with the help of Filipino community members. </p><p>During those three months in Westport, before they complained, Dagalea’s crewmates faced similar strains, the fishermen and their families said. Richard Zambales wasn’t sure he would be able to pay for his wife’s heart medication. Albert Docuyan’s wife moved from the Philippines to Malaysia to find work that could pay the fees for their children’s school. Norberto Cabrela missed the birth of his son, then scrambled to find the money to pay the hospital bills.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

<h2>BETTER THAN NOTHING</h2><p>Back in Jeddah, Saleh kept praying for things to change — for the shipowner to relent and agree to pay him; for some way by which he could finally leave. He said he had trouble eating, concerned that his family wasn’t getting enough food. He barely slept.</p><p>“My whole life is anxiety and fear,” Saleh wrote to AP in February.</p><p>That same month, AP contacted Saudi Arabia’s media ministry, their U.S. embassy staff and the port authority in Jeddah with questions about his case. None responded.</p><p>Within two weeks of the AP contacting Saudi Arabian authorities, Saleh received an offer from the shipping agent to pay him. Over weeks of back and forth, they reached an amount Saleh agreed to take. The shipping agent visited the Al-Maha and told Saleh to be ready to leave in three hours for the airport, Arrachedi said.</p><p>“By God, I am happy to have reached this settlement,” Saleh told AP from Egypt. “I did not receive the full amount, but this is better than nothing and better than these problems, sitting on the ship, being abroad, and being far from family and homeland.”</p><p>For now, he’s focused on ensuring his family is healthy and safe. Someday soon, he wants to buy a house.</p><p>“It’s one of the worst cases I have seen in my 23 years as an ITF inspector,” Arrachedi said.</p><div data-align-center="">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2025-05-30-how-i-run-book-clubs.html">https://notes.eatonphil.com/2025-05-30-how-i-run-book-clubs.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40523047">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I've been running software book clubs almost continuously since last
summer, about 12 months ago. We read through <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2023-ddia.html">Designing Data-Intensive
Applications</a>, <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2023-database-internals.html">Database
Internals</a>,
<a href="https://eatonphil.com/2024-systems-performance.html">Systems
Performance</a>, and
we just started <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2024-understanding-software-dynamics.html">Understanding Software
Dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>The DDIA discussions were in-person in NYC with about 5-8 consistent
attendees. The rest have been over email with 300, 500, and 600
attendees.</p>
<p>This post is for folks who are interested in running their own book
club. None of these ideas are novel. I co-opted the best parts I saw
from other people running similar things. And hopefully you'll improve
on my experience too, should you try.</p>
<p>Despite the length of this post running a book club takes almost no
noticeable effort, other than when I need to select and confirm
discussion leaders. It is the limited-effort-required to thank that
I've kept up the book clubs so consistently.</p>
<h3 id="google-groups">Google Groups</h3><p>I run the virtual book clubs over email. I create a Google Group and
tell people to send me their email for an invite. I use a Google Form
to collect emails since I get many. If you're doing a small group
book club you can just collect member emails directly.</p>
<p>In the Google Form I ask people to volunteer to lead discussion for a
chapter (or chapters). And I ask for a Twitter/GitHub/LinkedIn
account.</p>
<p>When I've gotten enough responses I go through the list and check
Twitter/GitHub/LinkedIn info to find people who might have a
particularly interesting perspective to lead a discussion.</p>
<p>"Lead a discussion" sounds formal but I mean anything but. All I am
looking for is someone to start a new Google Group thread each week
and for them to share their thoughts.</p>
<p>For example a discussion leader might share:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they liked about the chapter</li>
<li>Something new they learned from the chapter</li>
<li>A story about their work that the chapter reminded them of</li>
<li>A little project they hacked on, inspired by reading the chapter</li>
<li>A paper or YouTube video this chapter reminded them of</li>
<li>Something from the chapter that was confusing</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "discussion leader" has no responsibility for remaining in the
discussion after posting the thread. There just isn't an easy way to
say "person who kicks off discussion" than to call them a "discussion
leader".</p>
<p>By the way, I didn't do discussion leaders for the first book club,
reading DDIA. And that book club took noticeably more effort. Because
I organized it, I was effectively the discussion leader every
time. Having discussion leaders disperses the effort of the book
club. And I think it makes the club much more interesting.</p>
<h4 id="sparknotes-ification">SparkNotes-ification</h4><p>One thing I noticed happening often was that the discussion leader
might do a large summary of the chapter. I greatly appreciate and
respect that effort, but I think this is not the ideal thing to
happen. Of course you can't control what people do and maybe they
really wanted to write a summary. But since noticing this happen I now
try to discourage the discussion leader from summarizing since 1) it
must be quite time-consuming and 2) it isn't as interesting as some of
the above bullet points.</p>
<h4 id="confirming-with-leaders">Confirming with leaders</h4><p>When I have picked out folks who seem like they'd be fun discussion
leaders, I bcc email them all asking them to confirm. At the same time
I explain what being a discussion leader means. As I just explained it
here above.</p>
<p>Each week's discussion gets a new Google Group thread. Discussion
happens in responses to the thread.</p>
<p>I ask the discussion leaders to create the new discussion thread
between Friday and Saturday their local time.</p>
<p>For folks who don't confirm, I email them one last time and then if
they still haven't confirmed I find someone new.</p>
<p>I always lead the first week's discussion so that the discussion
leaders can see what I do and so that I can establish the pattern.</p>
<h4 id="managing-leaders">Managing leaders</h4><p>It takes a while to read a book. Sometimes the leaders forget to do
their part. If it gets to be Sunday and the discussion leader for the
week hasn't started discussion, I email them to gently ask if they are
still available to kick off discussion. And if they are not, no
worries, I can step in.</p>
<p>I have had to step in a few times to start discussion and it's no
problem.</p>
<h4 id="managing-non-leaders">Managing non-leaders</h4><p>Just as you need to clarify and set expectations for discussion
leaders, you need to clarify and set expectations for everyone else.</p>
<p>When I invite people to the Google Group I typically also create an
Intro thread where I explain the discussion format.</p>
<p>An annoying aspect of Google Groups is that I cannot limit who can
<em>create</em> a thread without limiting who can <em>respond</em> to a thread.</p>
<p>It would simplify things for me if I could limit thread creation to
discussion leaders. But since I cannot, I try to repeatedly and
explicitly mention in the Intro thread that no one should start a new
discussion thread unless they are a discussion leader. And that new
threads will come out each weekend to discuss the previous chapter.</p>
<h4 id="setting-the-tone">Setting the tone</h4><p>One of the most important things to do in the Intro email is to set
the tone. I try to clarify this is a friendly and encouraging group
focused on learning and improving ourselves. We have experts in the
group and we have noobs in the group and they are all welcome and will
all come away with different things.</p>
<h3 id="why-email?">Why email?</h3><p>Email seems to be the most time-friendly and demographic-friendly
medium. Doing live discussion sounds stressful and difficult to
schedule, although I believe Alex Petrov <a href="https://x.com/ifesdjeen/status/1795813863197409384">runs live
discussions</a>. Email
forces you to slow down and think things through. And email is
built around an inbox. If you didn't get to read some discussion,
you can mark it unread. You can't do that in Discord or Slack.</p>
<h3 id="avoiding-long-term-commitments">Avoiding long-term commitments</h3><p>When I pick a book, aside from picking books I think are likely to be
exceptionally well-written, I try to avoid books that we could not
finish within 3 months. It concerns me to try to get people to commit
to something longer than that.</p>
<p>This has led to some distortion though. Systems Performance has only
16 chapters. One chapter a week means about 3 months in total. But
each chapter is 100 pages long.</p>
<p>I was hesitant to do a reading of Understanding Software Dynamics
because it has 28 chapters. But each chapter is only 10-15 pages
long. So when I decided to go with it, I decided we'd read 2 chapters a
week. Each discussion leader is responsible for 2 chapters at a
time. That means we can finish within 3 months. And each week we read
only 20-30 pages, which is still much more doable than 100 pages of
Systems Performance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did make it through Systems Performance! Which
gives me confidence to pick other books that are physically daunting,
should they otherwise seem like a good idea.</p>
<h4 id="a-book-ends">A book ends</h4><p>Many public book clubs go through a book a month and have no
ending. That is totally fair. But what I love about the way I organize
book clubs is that each reading is unrelated to the next. It's an
entirely new signup for each book. You need only "commit" (I mean, you
can drop off whenever and definitely people do) to a 3-month reading
and then you can justly feel good about yourself and join again in the
future or not.</p>
<p>In contrast a paper reading club has no obvious ending, unless you
pick all the papers in advance and organize them around a school year
or something. This has made running a paper reading club feel more
concerning to me. Though I greatly appreciate folks like Aleksey
Charapko and Murat Demirbas <a href="https://charap.co/category/reading-group/">who
do</a>.</p>
<h3 id="most-people-don't-actively-contribute,-but-they-still-value-it">Most people don't actively contribute, but they still value it</h3><p>In a group of 500 people, maybe 1-2% of those people actively
contribute to discussion. 5-10 people. But I often hear from people
who didn't participate that they still highly valued the group. And
this high percentage of non-active-participants is part of why I keep
allowing the group size to grow. There's little work I have to do and
a bunch of people benefit.</p>
<h3 id="doing-it-at-your-company-likely-won't-go-well">Doing it at your company likely won't go well</h3><p>I wrote about this
<a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/eight-years-of-tech-meetups.html">before</a>. For
some reason it's hard to get people who would otherwise join an
external reading club to join a company-internal reading club.</p>
<p>Though perhaps I'm just doing it wrong because I hear of others like
<a href="https://twitter.com/sqlliz/status/1745463496161325087">Elizabeth Garrett
Christensen</a>
who run an internal software book club successfully.</p>
<h3 id="good-luck,-have-fun!">Good luck, have fun!</h3><p>That's all I've got. Send me questions if you've got any. But mostly,
just give it a shot if you want to and you'll learn!</p>
<p>And if you still don't get it, you can of course just join one of my
book clubs. :)</p>

<p>An updated version of the methodology to be used in the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-24-conseil-csam-criteres-classification-services-risque.pdf">leaked by the news portal Contexte</a>, reveals more details on the approach pursued by the Belgian Council Presidency: The text doubles-down on services that allow people to protect themselves. If services are used through pseudonyms, VPNs, encryption or without an account, they will score worse on the risk scale, and will be more likely to be served a detection order mandating scanning of all communications content. The same applies if a services allows users to use cryptocurrencies or if it allows users to connect from another jurisdiction (like VPNs, TOR). If a services enables the „direct sharing of content without using centralised servers“, via P2P, that makes it score worse, because it would evade server-side scanning. If a privacy-friendly platform cannot or does not collect data on users (to monitor their behaviour or metadata), it will score worse. Services through which users “predominantly engage in public communication” (i.e. instead of private chats) will score better and thus be less likely to receive detection orders.</p>



<p>Pirate Party Member of the European Parliament and digital freedom fighter Patrick Breyer comments: “Basic services such as Signal, TOR, encrypted email services like ProtonMail, torrenting platfroms are being demonized by this methodology. Privacy-friendly communication services are to become the most extremely monitored. This leaked paper reveals most EU government’s push to mass surveillance and undermining encryption on services essential to citizens, NGOs, lawyers, etc. In contrast, the European Parliament’s approach would only permit the interception of conversations by people connected to child sexual abuse, while mandating many more safety-by-design measures than the Council only mentions in this paper without making them mandatory. We Pirates will not stop fighting for our fundamental right to digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyQuietlyWorking">https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyQuietlyWorking</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40522241">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>PyPy has been quietly working for me for several years now</h2>

	<p><small>May 29, 2024</small></p>
</div><div><p>A number of years ago I switched to installing various Python
programs through <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/">pipx</a> so that each
of them got their own automatically managed virtual environment,
rather than me having to wrestle with various issues from <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PipUpgradingPrograms">alternate
approaches</a>. On <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">our Ubuntu servers</a>, it wound up being simpler to do
this using <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyEasyHandInstall">my own version of PyPy</a> instead
of Ubuntu's CPython, for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyAndPipx">various reasons</a>. I've been
operating this way for long enough that I didn't really remember how
long.</p>

<p>Recently we got <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/FirstCloudVMAndAutomation">our first cloud server</a>, and I wound up installing
our cloud provider's basic CLI tool. This CLI tool has a number of
official ways of installing it, but when the dust settles I discovered
it was a Python package (with a bunch of additional complicated
dependencies) and this package is available on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi</a>.
So I decided to see if 'pipx install &lt;x&gt;' would work, which it did.
Only much later did it occur to me that this very large Python and
stuff tool was running happily under PyPy, because this is the
default if I just 'pipx install' something.</p>

<p>As it turns out, everything I have installed through pipx on our
servers is currently installed using PyPy instead of CPython, and
all of it works fine. I've been running all sorts of code with PyPy
for years without noticing anything different. There is definitely
code that will notice (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyView">I used to have some</a>), but either
I haven't encountered any of it yet or significant packages are now
routinely tested under PyPy and hardened against things like deferred
garbage collection of open files.</p>

<p>(Some current Python idioms, such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with">the '<code>with</code>' statement</a>,
avoid this sort of problem, because they explicitly close files and
otherwise release resources as you're done with them.)</p>

<p>In a way there's nothing remarkable about this. PyPy's goal is to
be a replacement for CPython that simply works while generally being
faster. In another way, it's nice to see that PyPy has been basically
completely successful in this for me, to the extent that I can forget
that my pipx-installed things are all running under PyPy and that a
big cloud vendor thing just worked.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="descript" itemprop="description"><p>This is a new English translation of the book from the original Russian published in 1950.</p><h2>About the book</h2><blockquote><div class="page" title="Page 17"><p>Geometry for Entertainment is written both for friends of mathematics and for those readers from whom many attractive aspects of mathematics have somehow been hidden.</p><p>More importantly, this book is intended for those readers who studied (or are currently studying) geometry only at the blackboard and therefore are not used to noticing familiar geometric relationships in the world of things and phenomena around us, have not learnt to use the acquired geometric knowledge in practise, in difficult cases of life, on a hike, in a bivouac or front-line situation.</p></div><div class="page" title="Page 18"><p>To arouse the reader’s interest in geometry or, in the words of the author, “to inspire a desire and cultivate a taste for its study is the objective of this book.”</p></div></blockquote><h2><em>Release Notes</em></h2><p>Yakov Perelman's books always have had a special place in my heart. Several of his classic works are translated, though this one was not. This was a rather ambitious first project of translating an entire book, I was not sure if I could complete it in a reasonable time frame. To my own surprise the project got completed in&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/mirtitles/perelman-geometry/-/commits/master" rel="nofollow">little over a month:</a>&nbsp;first commit on 25 April and last on 30 May 2024. I took help from several online translators for the translations. I did learn to read a bit of Russian in the process. :)</p><p>Hopefully there are no major blunders in the translation. Please do let me know if you find any errors either in the translation or the mathematics.</p><p>Though I have credited the link on the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/20220910_perelman_geometry/" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive</a>&nbsp;(IA user&nbsp;<em>Philipp Zanko</em>&nbsp;aka&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/@philipp_zanko" rel="nofollow">Russian Lutheran),</a>&nbsp;I must thank the original scanner who made this file available (if it was not Russian Lutheran). The processing of these scans was done with GIMP (for selection and editing) and Inkscape (for vector pdf conversion). The final file size is slightly larger (~ 55 M) primarily due to the heavy illustrations. They were converted to vector pdf for the book from the original scans.</p><p>I have use LuaLaTeX engine for compilation and Linux Libertine font for the book. The typesetting in LaTeX also provided several challenges which were sorted through expert help at&nbsp;<a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">tex.stackexchange</a>. I have used a square profile for the book with wide margin which allows for a nicer reading.</p><p>The book is released with an open but a restrictive license, CC By NC SA. We might go for a print version of the book (though others are still pending ikik), this step is towards that goal.</p><p>Overall, I am very satisfied with the outcome, and it gives me great pleasure to share it with you. I hope you enjoy reading it too. I am optimistic that this is first of many translations of to come. Do wish me luck!</p><p><em>Damitr Mazanav – "The Mitr"</em></p><p>PS: An electronic version of&nbsp;<em>Astronomy for Entertainment</em>&nbsp;updated with all the recent discoveries in astronomy is in the pipeline, hopefully we should see its release in next couple of months. Also, Irodov's&nbsp;<em>Fundamental Laws of Mechanics</em>and&nbsp;<em>Basic Laws of Electromagnetism</em>&nbsp;are about ready (figures remain to be redrawn).</p><p>**********************************************************</p><p>Translated from the Russian by&nbsp;<em>Damitr Mazanav&nbsp;</em>from Seventh Revised edition published in 1950.</p><p>This English edition first Published online in May 2024 by&nbsp;<em>The Mir Titles Project.</em></p><p>Source files available&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/mirtitles/perelman-geometry/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br></p><p>**********************************************************</p><h2>Contents</h2><p>Editor’s Preface xv<br>Translator’s Preface xix</p><h2>I.

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> was one of the best-known and most influential physicists of his generation. In the 1940s, he played a part in the development of the atomic bomb; in 1986, as a key member of the Rogers Commission, he investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and identified its cause; in 1965, he and two colleagues were awarded the Nobel Prize “for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles.” He was also an incredibly likeable character, and made countless other advances in his field, the complexities of which I will never be able understand.</p>
<p>In June of 1945, his wife and high-school sweetheart, Arline, passed away after succumbing to tuberculosis. She was 25-years-old. 16 months later, in October of 1946, Richard wrote his late wife a heartbreaking love letter and sealed it in an envelope. It remained unopened until after his death in 1988.</p>
<p>(This letter, along with 124 other fascinating pieces of correspondence, can be found in the bestselling book, <em><a href="https://lettersofnote.com/books/letters-of-note/">Letters of Note</a></em>. Reproduced with permission of Richard Feynman’s Estate.)</p>


<article><header>The Letter</header><div>
<p>October 17, 1946</p>



<p>D’Arline,</p>



<p>I adore you, sweetheart.</p>



<p>I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.</p>



<p>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.</p>



<p>But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.</p>



<p>I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures.</p>



<p>When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.</p>



<p>I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.</p>



<p>My darling wife, I do adore you.</p>



<p>I love my wife. My wife is dead.</p>



<p>Rich.</p>



<p>PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>GraphQL is an incredible piece of technology that has captured a lot of mindshare since I first started slinging it in production in 2018. You won’t have to look far back on this (rather inactive) blog to see I have previously championed this technology. After building many a React SPA on top of a hodge podge of untyped JSON REST APIs, I found GraphQL a breath of fresh air. I was truly a GraphQL hype train member.</p>

<p>However, as the years have gone on and I have had the opportunity to deploy to environments where non functional requirements like security, performance, and maintainability were more of a concern, my perspective has changed. In this article I would like to take you through why today, <strong>I would not recommend GraphQL to most people</strong>, and what I think are better alternatives.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Throughout I will use Ruby code with the excellent <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/">graphql-ruby</a> library for examples, but I believe many of these problems are ubiquitous across choice of language / GraphQL library.</p>

<p>If you know of better solutions and mitigations, please do leave a comment. Now, lets begin…</p>

<h2 id="attack-surface">Attack surface</h2>

<p>It was obvious from GraphQL’s beginning that exposing a <strong>query language</strong> to untrusted clients increases the attack surface of the application. Nevertheless, the variety of attacks to consider was even broader than I imagined, and mitigating them is quite a burden. Here’s the worst I’ve had to deal with over the years…</p>



<p>I think this is the most widely understood risk of GraphQL, so I won’t go into too much depth here. TLDR: if you expose a fully self documenting query API to all clients, you better be damn sure that <strong>every field</strong> is authorised against the current user appropriately to the context in which that field is being fetched. Initially authorising <strong>objects</strong> seems like enough, but this quickly becomes insufficient. For example, say we are the <del>Twitter</del> X 🙄 API:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>user</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>321</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>handle</span><span> </span><span># ✅ I am allowed to view Users public info</span><span>
    </span><span>email</span><span> </span><span># 🛑 I shouldn't be able to see their PII just because I can view the User</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>user</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>blockedUsers</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span># 🛑 And sometimes I shouldn't even be able to see their public info,</span><span>
      </span><span># because context matters!</span><span>
      </span><span>handle</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>One wonders how much GraphQL holds responsibility for Broken Access Control climbing to the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/">OWASP Top 10’s #1 spot</a>. One mitigation here is to make your API secure by default by integrating with <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/authorization/authorization">your GraphQL library’s authorisation framework</a>. Every object returned and/or field resolved, your authorisation system is called to confirm that the current user has access.</p>

<p>Compare this to the REST world where generally speaking you would authorise <strong>every endpoint</strong>, a far smaller task.</p>

<h3 id="rate-limiting">Rate limiting</h3>

<p>With GraphQL we cannot assume that all requests are equally hard on the server. There is no limit to how big a query can be. Even in a completely empty schema, the types exposed for <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/">introspection</a> are cyclical, so its possible to craft a valid query that returns MBs of JSON:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>__schema</span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>types</span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>__typename</span><span>
      </span><span>interfaces</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>possibleTypes</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>interfaces</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>possibleTypes</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
              </span><span>name</span><span>
            </span><span>}</span><span>
          </span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I just tested this attack against a <strong>very</strong> popular website’s GraphQL API explorer and got a 500 response back after 10 seconds. I just ate 10 seconds of someone’s CPU time running this (whitespace removed) <strong>128 byte</strong> query, and it doesn’t even require me to be logged in.</p>

<p>A common mitigation<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for this attack is to</p>

<ol>
  <li>Estimate the complexity of resolving <strong>every single field in the schema</strong>, and abandon queries that exceed some maximum complexity value</li>
  <li>Capture the actual complexity of the run query and take it out of bucket of credits that resets at some interval</li>
</ol>

<p>This calculation is a <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/complexity_and_depth#prevent-complex-queries">delicate affair to get right</a>. It gets particularly tricky when you are returning list fields whose length is not known prior to execution. You can make an assumption about the complexity of these, but if you are wrong, you may end up rate limiting valid queries or not rate limiting invalid queries.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, its common for the graph that makes up the schema to contain cycles. Lets say you run a blog with Articles which each have multiple Tags, from which you can see associated Articles.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Article</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>tags</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Tag</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Tag</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>relatedTags</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Tag</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>When estimating the complexity of <code>Tag.relatedTags</code>, you might assume that an article will never have more than 5 tags, so you set this fields complexity to <strong>5</strong> (or 5 * <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/complexity_and_depth#how-complexity-scoring-works">its children’s complexity</a>). The problem here is that <code>Article.relatedTags</code> can be its own child, so your estimate’s inaccuracy can compound exponentially. The formula is <code>N^5 * 1</code>. So given this query:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>tag</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"security"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

<p>You expect a complexity of <code>5^5 = 3,125</code>. If an attacker is able to find an Article with 10 tags, they can trigger a query with a “true” complexity of <code>10^5 = 100_000</code>, <strong>20x</strong> greater than estimated.</p>

<p>A partial mitigation here is to <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/complexity_and_depth#prevent-deeply-nested-queries">prevent deeply nested queries</a>. However, the example above demonstrates that this is not really a defense, as it’ts not an unusually deep query. GraphQL Ruby’s default maximum depth is <strong>13</strong>, this is just 7.</p>

<p>Compare this to rate limiting a REST endpoint, which generally have comparable response times. In this case all you need is a bucketed rate limiter that prevents a user exceeding, say, 200 requests per minute across all endpoints. If you <strong>do</strong> have slower endpoints (say, a CSV report or PDF generator) you can define more aggressive rate limits for these. With some HTTP middleware this is pretty trivial:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Rack</span><span>::</span><span>Attack</span><span>.</span><span>throttle</span><span>(</span><span>'API v1'</span><span>,</span> <span>limit: </span><span>200</span><span>,</span> <span>period: </span><span>60</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>req</span><span>|</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>path</span> <span>=~</span> <span>'/api/v1/'</span>
    <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>[</span><span>'rack.session'</span><span>][</span><span>'session_id'</span><span>]</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="query-parsing">Query parsing</h3>

<p>Before a query is executed, it is first parsed. We once received a pen-test report evidencing that its possible to craft an invalid query string that OOM’d the server. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>__typename</span><span> </span><span>@a</span><span> </span><span>@b</span><span> </span><span>@c</span><span> </span><span>@d</span><span> </span><span>@e</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span># imagine 1k+ more of these</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is a <strong>syntactically</strong> valid query, but invalid for our schema. A spec compliant server will parse this and start building an errors response containing thousands of errors which we found consumed <strong>2,000x</strong> more memory than the query string itself. Because of this memory amplification, its not enough to just limit the payload size, as you will have valid queries that are larger than the the smallest dangerous malicious query.</p>

<p>If your server exposes a concept of maximum number of errors to accrue before abandoning parsing, <a href="https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/4154">this can be mitigated</a>. If not, you’ll have to roll your own solution. There is no REST equivalent to this attack of this severity.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>When it comes to performance in GraphQL people often talk about it’s incompatibility with HTTP caching. For me personally, this has not been an issue. For SaaS applications, data is usually highly user specific and serving stale data is unacceptable, so I have not found myself missing response caches (or the cache invalidation bugs they cause…).</p>

<p>The major performance problems I <strong>did</strong> find myself dealing with were…</p>

<h3 id="data-fetching-and-the-n1-problem">Data fetching and the N+1 problem</h3>

<p>I think this issue is pretty widely understood nowadays. TLDR: if a field resolver hits an external data source such as a DB or HTTP API, and it is nested in a list containing N items, it will do those calls N times.</p>

<p>This is not a unique problem to GraphQL, and actually the strict GraphQL resolution algorithm has allowed most libraries to share a common solution: <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/dataloader/overview.html">the Dataloader pattern</a>. Unique to GraphQL though is the fact that since it is a query language, this can <strong>become</strong> a problem with no backend changes when a client modifies a query. As a result, I found you end up having to defensively introduce the Dataloader abstraction everywhere <em>just in case</em> a client ends up fetching a field in a list context in the future. This is a lot of boilerplate to write and maintain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in REST, we can generally hoist nested N+1 queries up to the controller, which I think is a pattern much easier to wrap your head around:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BlogsController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>index</span>
    <span>@latest_blogs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blog</span><span>.</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:author</span><span>,</span> <span>:tags</span><span>)</span>
    <span>render</span> <span>json: </span><span>BlogSerializer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>@latest_blogs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span>
    <span># No prefetching necessary here since N=1</span>
    <span>@blog</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blog</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:id</span><span>])</span>
    <span>render</span> <span>json: </span><span>BlogSerializer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>@blog</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="authorisation-and-the-n1-problem">Authorisation and the N+1 problem</h3>

<p>But wait, there’s more N+1s! If you followed the advice earlier of integrating with your library’s authorisation framework, you’ve now got a whole new category of N+1 problems to deal with. Lets continue with our X API example from earlier:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>UserType</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>GraphQL</span><span>::</span><span>BaseObject</span>
  <span>field</span> <span>:handle</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>field</span> <span>:birthday</span><span>,</span> <span>authorize_with: :view_pii</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>UserPolicy</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationPolicy</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>view_pii?</span>
    <span># Oh no, I hit the DB to fetch the user's friends</span>
    <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>friends_with?</span><span>(</span><span>record</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>me</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>friends</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span># returns N Users</span><span>
      </span><span>handle</span><span>
      </span><span>birthday</span><span> </span><span># runs UserPolicy#view_pii? N times</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is actually trickier to deal with than our previous example, because authorisation code is not always run in a GraphQL context. It may for example be run in a background job or an HTML endpoint. That means we can’t just reach for a Dataloader naively, because Dataloaders expect to be run from within GraphQL (in the Ruby implementation anyway).</p>

<p>In my experience, this is actually <strong>the biggest source of performance issues</strong>. We would regularly find that our queries were spending more time authorising data than anything else. Again, this problem simply does not exist in the REST world.</p>

<p>I have mitigated this using nasty things like <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html">request level globals</a> to memoise data across policy calls, but its never felt great.</p>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>

<p>In my experience, in a mature GraphQL codebase, your business logic is forced into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">transport layer</a>. This happens through a number of mechanisms, some of which we’ve already talked about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solving data authorisation leads to peppering authorisation rules throughout your GraphQL types</li>
  <li>Solving mutation / argument authorisation leads to peppering authorisation rules throughout your GraphQL arguments</li>
  <li>Solving resolver data fetching N+1s leads to moving this logic into GraphQL specific dataloaders</li>
  <li>Leveraging the (lovely) <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/pagination/using_connections">Relay Connection</a> pattern leads to moving data fetching logic into GraphQL specific <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/pagination/custom_connections">custom connection objects</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The net effect of all of this is to meaningfully test your application you <strong>must</strong> extensively test at the integration layer, i.e. by running GraphQL queries. I have found this makes for a painful experience. Any errors encountered are captured by the framework, leading to the fun task of reading stack traces in JSON GraphQL error responses. Since so much around authorisation and Dataloaders happens inside the framework, debugging is often much harder as the breakpoint you want is not in application code.</p>

<p>And of course, again, since its a query language you’re going to be writing a lot more tests to confirm that all those argument and field level behaviours we mentioned are working correctly.</p>

<h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2>

<p>Taken in aggregate, the various mitigations to security and performance issues we’ve gone through add <strong>significant</strong> complexity to a codebase. It’s not that REST does not have these problems (though it certainly has fewer), it’s just that the REST solutions are generally much simpler for a backend developer to implement and understand.</p>

<h2 id="and-more">And more…</h2>

<p>So those are the major reasons I am, for the most part, over GraphQL. I have a few more peeves, but to keep this article growing further I’ll summarise them here..</p>

<ul>
  <li>GraphQL discourages breaking changes and provides no tools to deal with them. This adds needless complexity for those who control all their clients, who will have to <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/changesets/overview.html">find workarounds</a>.</li>
  <li>Reliance on HTTP response codes turns up everywhere in tooling, so dealing with the fact that 200 can mean everything from everything is Ok through to everything is down can be quite annoying.</li>
  <li>Fetching all your data in one query in the HTTP 2+ age is often not beneficial to response time, in fact it will worsen it if your server is not parallelised, vs sending separate requests to separate servers to process in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>Ok, end of the rant. What would I recommend instead? To be up front, I am definitely early in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">hype cycle</a> here, but right now my view is that if you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Control all your clients</li>
  <li>Have ≤3 clients</li>
  <li>Have a client written in a statically typed language</li>
  <li>Are using &gt;1 language across the server and clients<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>You are probably better off exposing an <strong>OpenAPI 3.0+</strong> compliant JSON REST API. If, as in my experience, the main thing your frontend devs like about GraphQL is its self documenting type safe nature, I think this will work well for you. Tooling in this area has improved a lot since GraphQL came on the scene; there are many options for generating typed client code even down to <a href="https://orval.dev/overview">framework specific data fetching libraries</a>. My experience so far is pretty close to “the best parts of what <strong>I</strong> used GraphQL for, without the complexity Facebook needed”.</p>

<p>As with GraphQL there’s a couple of implementation approach…</p>

<p><strong>Implementation first</strong> tooling generates OpenAPI specs from a typed / type hinted server. <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> in Python and <a href="https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa">tsoa</a> in TypeScript are good examples of this approach<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This is the approach I have the most experience with, and I think it works well.</p>

<p><strong>Specification first</strong> is equivalent to “schema first” in GraphQL. Spec first tooling generates code from a hand written spec. I can’t say I’ve ever looked at an OpenAPI YAML file and thought “I would love to have written that myself”, but the recent release of <a href="https://typespec.io/">TypeSpec</a> changes things entirely. With it could come a quite elegant schema first workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a succinct human readable TypeSpec schema</li>
  <li>Generate an OpenAPI YAML spec from it</li>
  <li>Generate statically typed API client for your frontend language of choice (e.g. <a href="https://orval.dev/overview">TypeScript</a>)</li>
  <li>Generate statically typed server handlers for your backend language &amp; server framework (e.g. <a href="https://docs.buildwithfern.com/server-boilerplate/server-boilerplate/express-js">TypeScript + Express</a>, <a href="https://docs.buildwithfern.com/server-boilerplate/server-boilerplate/fast-api">Python + FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen">Go + Echo</a>)</li>
  <li>Write an implementation for that handler that compiles, safe in the knowledge that it will be type safe</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is less mature but I think has a lot of promise.</p>

<p>To me, it seems like powerful <strong>and</strong> simpler options are here, and I’m excited to learn their drawbacks next 😄.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Stack Overflow" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/05/29/stackoverflow-header.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Cybercriminals are abusing Stack Overflow in an interesting approach to spreading malware—answering users' questions by promoting a malicious PyPi package that installs Windows information-stealing malware.</p>
<p>Sonatype researcher Ax Sharma (and a writer at BleepingComputer) discovered this new PyPi package is part of a previously known 'Cool package' campaign, named&nbsp;after a string in the package's metadata, that&nbsp;targeted Windows users last year.</p>
<p>This PyPi package is named 'pytoileur' and was uploaded by threat actors to the PyPi repository over the weekend, claiming it was an API management tool. Notice how the package has the "Cool package" string in the Summary metadata field, indicating it is part of this ongoing campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Malicious pytoileur PyPi package" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/malware/c/cool-package-stackoverflow/pytoileur-package.jpg" width="899"><figcaption><strong>Malicious pytoileur PyPi package</strong><br><em>Source: Sonatype</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Malicious packages like this are usually promoted using names similar to other popular packages, a process called typo-squatting.</p>
<p>However, with this package, the threat actors took a more novel approach by <a href="https://archive.is/MU5JA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">answering</a> <a href="https://archive.is/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78545964/pandas-dataframe-select-dtypes-not-selecting-intended-datatypes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">questions</a> on Stack Overflow and promoting the package as a solution.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Stack Overflow answer promoting malicious PyPi package" height="400" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/malware/c/cool-package-stackoverflow/stackoverflow-answer.jpg" width="693"><figcaption><strong>Stack Overflow answer promoting malicious PyPi package</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>As Stack Overflow is a widely used platform for developers of all skill sets to ask and answer questions, it provides a perfect environment to spread malware disguised as programming interfaces and libraries.</p>
<p>"We further noticed that a StackOverflow account "EstAYA G" created&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/25291597/estaya-g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">roughly 2 days ago</a> is now exploiting the platform's community members seeking debugging help [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78544624/kivy-file-produces-blank-screen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78545964/pandas-dataframe-select-dtypes-not-selecting-intended-datatypes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78545955/how-to-get-manipulated-table-from-put-datatable-in-pywebio/78546345#78546345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">3</a>] by directing them to install this malicious package as a "solution" to their issue even though the "solution" is unrelated to the questions posted by developers," explained Sharma in the <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/blog/pypi-crypto-stealer-targets-windows-users-revives-malware-campaign" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sonatype report</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, the&nbsp;pytoileur package contains a 'setup.py' files that pads a base64 encoded command to execute with spaces so it is hidden unless you enable word wrap in your IDE or text file editor.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Obfuscated command to execute in setup.py" height="600" width="679" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/malware/c/cool-package-stackoverflow/obfuscated-command.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/malware/c/cool-package-stackoverflow/obfuscated-command.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Obfuscated command to execute in setup.py</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>When deobfuscated, this command will download an executable named 'runtime.exe' [<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/48004654bf491a126acc07b5ad376012a43c4b5254ebbf516b762254d7be3fbd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">VirusTotal</a>] from a remote site and execute it.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Deobfuscated Base64-encoded command" height="400" width="834" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/malware/c/cool-package-stackoverflow/deobfuscated-command.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/malware/c/cool-package-stackoverflow/deobfuscated-command.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Deobfuscated Base64-encoded command</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>This executable is actually a Python program converted into an .exe that acts as an information-stealing malware to harvest cookies, passwords, browser history, credit cards, and other data from web browsers.</p>
<p>It also appears to search through documents for specific phrases and, if found, steal the data as well.</p>
<p>All of this information is then sent back to the attacker, who can sell it on dark web markets or use it to breach further accounts owned by the victim.</p>
<p>While malicious PyPi packages and information-stealers are nothing new, the cybercriminals' strategy to pose as helpful contributors on Stack Overflow is an interesting approach as it allows them to exploit the trust and authority of the site in the coding community.</p>
<p>This approach serves as a reminder of the constantly changing tactics of cybercriminals and, unfortunately, illustrates why you can never blindly trust what someone shares online.</p>
<p>Instead, developers must verify the source of all packages they add to their projects, and even if it feels trustworthy, check the code (with word wrap enabled) for unusual or obfuscated commands that will be executed.</p>

  <p>I set off on this path because I’m working on a series of generative diagrams and I wanted them to have titles. Immediately I was drawn in by the effect of the diagrams next to the semi-nonsensical words. Since then, I have developed these diagrams a lot, including using my sentence generating system to add scribbled notes to the sides of them. </p><p>Here’s an early example and one of where my diagrams are up to now. </p>

<p>When the code runs, it goes through the list of nouns and creates two new lists, one of singular nouns and one of plural nouns, using the specified rules. Then the sentence structures can call for either ‘noun’ (a singular noun) or ‘nouns’ (a plural noun). </p>

  <p>When the sentence structure puts an adjective ahead of a noun, the adjective must be put after the article. i.e. we say ‘<em>a curious cat’</em> not, ‘<em>curious a cat’</em>. </p><p>This creates an additional difficulty, because we now need to use ‘<em>a</em>’ or ‘<em>an</em>’ based on the sound at the start of the adjective instead of the noun. (TIL this is called allomorphy!)</p><p>For example, if we’re describing ‘<em>a fire’</em> as ‘<em>enigmatic’, </em>we need to change the article to ‘an’ accommodate the ‘<em>e</em>’ in ‘<em>enigmatic</em>’ - we say ‘<em>an enigmatic fire’</em> not<em> ‘a enigmatic fire’. </em>To handle this, the sentence generator looks at whether the adjective starts with a vowel and adjusts the article accordingly. There are also a few exceptions coded in specifically, for example ‘<em>universal</em>’ which starts with a vowel but is pronounced with a y sound and therefore would go with ‘<em>a</em>’ not ‘<em>an</em>’.

<p>Some verbs are usually paired with a <strong>preposition</strong> (e.g. <em>through</em>, <em>towards</em>, <em>about)</em>. Alongside the list of verbs, I have a list of prepositions, which will fix those awkward sentences. Here’s a sample of them. </p>

<p>The optional fourth position in the verb array points to entries in the preposition array, indicating which ones that verb can be paired with. Here are some examples once the prepositions are paired with <em>flow</em> and <em>move</em>. </p>

  <h3>Semantic similarity</h3><p>I experimented with semantic similarity for labels on diagrams - using words that are related to the title. I won’t go into detail about the process here, but I used a Python library called <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/" target="_blank">gensim</a> and a model called <a href="https://huggingface.co/fse/glove-wiki-gigaword-100" target="_blank">glove-wiki-gigaword-100</a> to analyse my word lists. For each word, I generated a list of the most related other words. </p><p>Here’s an excerpt of the results: </p>

  <p>I was excited about this when I first got it working but I am not sure if I will use it in the final version of the diagrams because I think often it’s more interesting if the words and ideas are a bit scattered. To some degree, I feel like all the words are “related” because they are all in the category of “words I thought would work in this project”, and that might be enough. </p><p>However, it could be worth experimenting more with semantic similarity within sentences or paragraphs in the future. </p>

  <h3>A conduit for truth</h3><p>In addition to the titles and notes on my diagrams, I’ve been using this system to generate “truths”. In April, I created the first series of “56 Truths”. I plotted them with my coded handwriting, using gold ink on small black cards which were placed into gold envelopes and stamped with their number. I handed the majority of them out at the Venice Biennale/Bright Moments weekend (I have about 8 left!) </p>

  <p>To generate these “truths” I used an adapted list of sentence structures and I created a system for joining sentences together using connectors like ‘<em>and’</em>, ‘<em>-’</em>, ‘<em>because’</em> and ‘<em>when’,</em> to create longer sentences. </p><p>I have since created a new, more bespoke set of sentence structures for these kinds of outputs and I look forward to releasing more “truths” into the world 😉</p>

  <h3>A journey of meaning </h3><p>I mentioned earlier the idea of a meaning-nonsense continuum on which these sentences could be placed. This metamodernist oscillation between sincerity and irony is at the heart of this system (and of my generative diagrams). </p><p>I simultaneously hold two quite contradictory feelings towards them. Firstly that obviously they are nonsense. It’s just an algorithm, they’re made up, almost a joke. Obviously, <em>obviously </em>it’s meaningless. But, on the other hand - they do mean something. As is often the case, even when no specific meaning is intended, it is possible to find or infer a meaning. </p>

  <p>Let’s take the first sentence, “The beginning is essential for consciousness”. Nonsense. Gibberish almost. But actually, what if the beginning <em>is</em> essential for consciousness? What’s meant by “the beginning”? The big bang? Is it saying there is some element of the first microseconds after the start of existence that is the key to understanding consciousness? Or perhaps it means the moment of conception? </p><p>If you don’t enjoy reading and contemplating these sentences like this, we are simply very different people. </p><p>A third, quieter feeling - if the universe was to communicate some message, who’s to say it would not choose this as a conduit?

Words like <em>thixotropic</em> are fun to scatter around but (as in most writing) understandable words are usually more impactful.  </p><p><strong>Add possessives<br></strong>In some contexts it would be great to talk about “your memory” instead of “a memory” or “our fears” instead of “fears”. </p><p><strong>Develop the system for labels<br></strong>Currently diagram labels use the noun list, but I plan to create a specific wordlist for them and/or to create short sentence structures for labels. </p><p><strong>More, more, more<br></strong>I’m really enjoying these outputs already but, like many generative systems, there are almost infinite ways in which I could expand and improve upon it. I’m continuing to add more sentence structures and more rules for increasingly complex outputs and to create opportunities to uncover deeper meanings.  </p>
