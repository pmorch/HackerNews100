<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://medium.com/@thetateman?source=post_page-----94816bde4ceb--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Tate Smith" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*i8DvUi3xBFiTI_jQDk3MYg.jpeg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy" data-testid="authorPhoto"></p></div></a></div><p id="30f3">(Not an anti-AI post — Copilot is great, I use it all the time.)</p><p id="cc58">Early this year I built some cryptocurrency trading and data gathering tools for personal use and to get more experience in Rust programming. While asking questions in various groupchats, it didn’t take too long to see that lots of other people were demanding similar tools — and would be willing to pay for them. Pretty soon after that realization, I had some API endpoints set up where people could access the data for free and submit trades for a small commission.</p><p id="3136">I started getting a few customers, a very cool experience since this was the first time people were paying for software I built myself! I started a Telegram channel for feature announcements and support, which worked well at first. But, as my customer base slowly grew, support began taking up more and more of my time. I know this is the case for any SAAS startup, so the increasing support burden was hardly a surprise, and, after all, more customers is a good problem to have! What became irritating was not the quantity, but the quality of the support requests I was receiving.</p><p id="ad0b">My API is just a few well documented endpoints. If you can figure out how to send a POST request using any programming language, you should have no problem using it. But that seems to be too high a bar for the new generation of prompt-engineer coders. Since opening my support channel, I have fielded many a “Help! My trading bot is not working!!” support request. More often than not, I will be sent customer code that is mostly fine, but has some error that should be glaringly obvious to anyone who has read the documentation and has some programming ability. Often this takes the form of trying to access an endpoint that does not exist, or read a property off the API response that does not exist. After probing a bit more, my suspicions are usually confirmed — ChatGPT hallucinated that endpoint or property, and the customer I’m talking to has little to no programming knowledge. If they are just trying to build a simple script I’ll help them out, and fix the hallucinations — it’s not much effort and creates a potentially paying customer. Often, though, the customer is envisioning a more complex application, and I just have to tell them, “Sorry, you’re going to have to hire a professional developer for this.” The worst is when a request starts out simple — I help them fix one hallucination — but then that customer wants to build more complex logic, and somehow I’ve set the expectation that I will provide unlimited free support forever. I’ve gotten a number of angry messages from customers who essentially want me to build their whole app for free.</p><p id="2841">I’m sure these challenges sound familiar to anyone who has run support for a SAAS business, but AI programming tools have exacerbated the problem. Helping a customer solve challenges is often super rewarding, but only when I can remove roadblocks for customers who can do most of the work themselves. When customers offload software engineering to AI because they don’t have the capability themselves, they still need to find a developer to fix the bugs that AI creates. I don’t want to be that developer!</p></div></div>]]></description>

Applying pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) methods to isolate and quantify MNPs from human samples, we compared MNP accumulation in kidneys, livers, and brains. Autopsy samples from the Office of the Medical Investigator in Albuquerque, NM, collected in 2016 and in 2024, were digested for Py-GC/MS analysis of 12 polymers. Brains exhibited higher concentrations of MNPs than liver or kidney samples. All organs exhibited significant increases from 2016 to 2024. Polyethylene was the predominant polymer; the relative proportion of polyethylene MNPs was greater in brain samples than in liver or kidney. Transmission electron microscopy verified the nanoscale nature of isolated particles, which largely appeared to be aged, shard-like plastics remnants across a wide range of sizes.

Samples were available from 2016 and 2024; the same collection protocol was used for 2016 and 2024. Small pieces of representative organs (3 to 5 cm<sup><a href="#R2" rid="R2">2</a></sup>) are routinely collected at autopsy and placed in a small container with 10% formalin. Limited demographic data was available due to the conditions of specimen approval. In the 2016 samples, 17 samples were from males and 10 were from females. In 2024, 13 samples were from males and 11 were from females.

While TEM does not provide spectroscopic identification to confirm particulate composition, we observed common shapes and sizes among the numerous samples and tissue types. Notably, there were innumerable particulates with shard-like appearance, often less than 200 nm in length. Currently, MNP uptake and distribution pathways are incompletely understood; this new appreciation of the size and shape aids in our appreciation of potential mechanisms.

Shard-like appearances, with dimensions ranging from micrometer to nanometer sizes, suggest an aged, friable polymer composition.</p></div></div><p id="P10">The concentrations in liver and kidney were not as high (relative to brains) as we would have suspected, as these are “front line” organs for xenobiotic uptake and clearance. That said, the lipophilic nature of plastics may make them easily handled by the liver, which has a major role in uptake and repackaging of dietary triglycerides and cholesterol. A recent study found higher MNP numbers in the cirrhotic liver compared to the healthy liver; whether the microplastics promote disease or are simply accumulating along with intracellular fats has not been elucidated<sup><a href="#R13" rid="R13">13</a></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Following this logic, the human brain has the second highest lipid content in the body, with only adipose tissue being higher; brain MNP concentrations are comparable to recently published Py-GC/MS data from carotid plaques, which are also a lipid depot<sup><a href="#R3" rid="R3">3</a></sup>. Furthermore, the brain receives a high blood flow, approximately 25–30% of the cardiac output, and has a tremendous metabolism. The blood-brain barrier poses a notorious challenge. However, modeling of transfer across cellular membranes suggests the uptake is dependent on the association of particulates with cholesterol and, furthermore, that particles &lt;1μm rapidly traversed the blood-brain barrier within 2h of ingestion in mice<sup><a href="#R14" rid="R14">14</a></sup>. Longer-term gavage studies similarly found that larger (5 μm) polystyrene microspheres could access the brain and promote metabolomic alterations<sup><a href="#R15" rid="R15">15</a></sup>. Lastly, clearance rates from the brain are unknown for polymer particulates. The lack of correlation with the decedent age suggests that an equilibrium occurs and may depend on genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors that ultimately contribute to the wide between-subject variability in MNP concentrations. In zebrafish exposed to constant concentrations, nanoplastics uptake increased to a stable plateau and cleared after exposure<sup><a href="#R16" rid="R16">16</a></sup>; however, the maximal concentrations were increased proportionately with higher exposure concentrations. While the time course for kinetics is assuredly longer in humans, we postulate that the exponentially increasing environmental concentrations of MNPs<sup><a href="#R1" rid="R1">1</a>,<a href="#R17" rid="R17">17</a></sup> will analogously increase internal maximal concentrations, which is corroborated by our finding that total plastics mass concentration in brains increased over 50% in the past 8 years.</p></div><div id="S6"><h2 id="S6title">LIMITATIONS</h2><p id="P12">The present data are derived from novel analytical chemistry methods that have yet to be widely adopted and refined. Several quality control steps ensure that external contaminants are not incorporated into the sample calculations, including KOH blank samples and measurement of the polymer composition of all plastic tubes and pipette tips that are essential in the digestion and measurement process. Notably, given the consistent nature of handling and processing across varying organ samples (<em>i.e</em>., brain, liver, kidney), the dramatic, selective accumulation of MNPs in the brain cannot be dismissed as an artefact of contamination. Furthermore, the far longer duration of samples in plastic stock jars from 2016 (84–96 months) compared to those samples from 2024 (1–3 months) and the significantly lower plastics content in 2016 samples suggests that contamination from fresh plastics is not a concern to the conclusions from these data.</p><p id="P13">Both laboratories (UNM and OSU) observed a within-sample coefficient of variation of approximately 25%. This does not alter the conclusions regarding the temporal trends of selective accumulation in brains, given the magnitude of those effects. However, we believe several steps may be valuable to improve the precision of Py-GC/MS output, which in turn should improve assessment of health outcomes for future studies. There may be value in limiting assessments to the nanoscale range, which could incorporate longer ultracentrifugation times as well as a filtration of &gt;1 μm particulates. Ambient air particulate matter research provides some justification that “smaller is worse”, which led to the transition from air quality standards based on particles &lt;10 μm in diameter to those &lt;2.5 μm, which aligned more closely with health outcomes<sup><a href="#R18" rid="R18">18</a></sup>. Additionally, the Py-GC/MS method is limited to small sample weights (~1–2mg), which presents challenges for sampling and weighing accuracy when even small portions of tissue (~500 mg) generate large polymer-containing pellets; however, larger sample sizes may not be feasible due to the rapid combustion required for this approach. Lastly, by obtaining only a single sample from each organ for each subject, distribution heterogeneity within tissues remains uncharacterized.</p></div><div id="S7"><h2 id="S7title">CONCLUSIONS</h2><p id="P14">MNP concentrations in decedent brain samples ranged from 7-to-30 times the concentrations seen in livers or kidneys. With independent confirmation from another laboratory and visual evidence from FTIR and TEM approaches, we have high confidence that MNPs selectively accumulate in the brain, with the majority being nanometer-scale, shard-like particulates. However, linking MNP concentration data to health outcomes in larger cohorts will require refinements to the technique, more complex study designs, and larger cohorts. The parallels between the present data showing an increasing trend in MNP concentrations in the brain with exponentially rising environmental presence of microplastics<sup><a href="#R19" rid="R19">19</a>–<a href="#R21" rid="R21">21</a></sup> and increasing global rates of age-corrected Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia<sup><a href="#R22" rid="R22">22</a>–<a href="#R25" rid="R25">25</a></sup>, given the potential role of anionic nanoplastics in protein aggregation<sup><a href="#R26" rid="R26">26</a></sup>, add urgency to understanding the impacts of MNP on human health.</p></div><div id="S8"><h2 id="S8title">Funding/Support:</h2><p id="P15">This research was funded by NIH P20 GM130422 (MJC), R01 ES032037 (EFC), R01 ES014639 (MJC), K12 GM088021 (MAG), P50 MD015706 (EEH), P30ES032755 (BB), and R15 ES034901 (JGE).</p></div><div id="fn-group-a.g.b"><h2 id="fn-group-a.g.btitle">Footnotes</h2><!--back/fn-group--><div><p id="P16"><strong>Statement of Interests:</strong> The authors declare no conflicts of interest with the content of this manuscript.</p></div></div><div id="article-aaff-info"><h2 id="article-aaff-infotitle">Contributor Information</h2><p><span>Matthew Campen, </span><span id="A1"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Alexander Nihart, </span><span id="A2"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Marcus Garcia, </span><span id="A3"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Rui Liu, </span><span id="A4"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Marian Olewine, </span><span id="A5"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Eliseo Castillo, </span><span id="A6"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Barry Bleske, </span><span id="A7"> University of New Mexico.</span></p><p><span>Justin Scott, </span><span id="A8"> Oklahoma State University.</span></p><p><span>Tamara Howard, </span><span id="A9"> University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.</span></p><p><span>Jorge Gonzalez-Estrella, </span><span id="A10"> Oklahoma State University.</span></p><p><span>Natalie Adolphi, </span><span id="A11"> New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator.</span></p><p><span>Daniel Gallego, </span><span id="A12"> New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator.</span></p><p><span>Eliane El Hayek, </span><span id="A13"> University of New Mexico.</span></p></div><div id="ref-list-a.g.c"><h2 id="ref-list-a.g.ctitle">REFERENCES</h2><div id="reference-list"><p>1. <span>Stubbins A., Law K.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Jessie Peterson’s family spent a year searching for her after they were told that she had checked herself out of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">California</a> hospital against medical advice – before they learned that she had been dead all along.</p><p>The 31-year-old died in the care of Mercy San Juan medical center in Sacramento in April 2023. The hospital shipped her body to a storage facility and did not inform her mother and sisters. The family only learned her fate the following April after months of trying to find her, according to a civil lawsuit against the hospital.</p><p>In the lawsuit, filed earlier this month, the family described the hospital’s conduct as “malicious and outrageous” and accused the facility of negligence, the negligent handling of a corpse and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p><p>“Mercy San Juan hospital failed in its most fundamental duty to notify Jessie’s family of her death,” the lawsuit states. “Mercy San Juan stored<strong> </strong>Jessie in an off-site warehouse morgue and she was left to decompose for nearly a year while her family relentlessly inquired about her whereabouts.”</p><p>Peterson, whom her family described in the lawsuit as “loving and energetic”, had type 1 diabetes. She was experiencing a diabetic episode when she was admitted to Mercy San Juan on 6 April 2023. Her mother, Ginger Congi, stated that Peterson had called her two days later asking for a ride because she would be leaving the hospital, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Congi was later told that Peterson had left the hospital against medical advice, and her medical records indicate she was discharged on 8 April. After her sudden disappearance, the family spent months “relentlessly” searching for her, posting flyers, speaking with unhoused residents in the area, and contacting police and the coroner’s office, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>On 12 April 2024, more than a year after Peterson was last seen, the Sacramento county detective’s office informed the family that she had been found dead at Mercy San Juan, the suit states. According to her death certificate, which was completed in April 2024, Peterson died of cardiopulmonary arrest at age 31.</p><figure id="4fa9fbba-5a61-436c-a35b-3aac46440d98" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Outside of building." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40cc543f18f79dd497ebea63faf0894d5fa95c2e/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.10355718085106" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Mercy medical center.</span> Photograph: Chris Allan/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Peterson’s sister went to the coroner’s office seeking her remains, but a worker told her that the office did not have Peterson’s body and directed her to contact the hospital.

            <p>Market highlights and explanations from a day of records in ERCOT.</p>

        


    </div><section>
        <p>On August 20th, 2024, The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (<a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?ref=blog.gridstatus.io" rel="noreferrer">ERCOT</a>) saw records for demand, solar generation, net load, and battery discharge alongside <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/map?t=1724201100&amp;node=CALAVER_JTD2&amp;zoom=6.50&amp;center=-98.32030%2C29.80972&amp;ref=blog.gridstatus.io" rel="noreferrer">prices near the cap</a>; a prime example of how operations in the market are evolving.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="solar-and-demand-were-high-throughout-the-day">Solar and Demand Were High Throughout the Day</h2><p>Solar generation was high all day, keeping prices under control even through the record-setting peak load. However, as solar ramped down and the proportion low marginal cost resources on the grid was reduced and prices began to take off.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--1--1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--1--1.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--1--1.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As the resource mix has evolved, high prices correlate more to high net load rather than gross load. Net load is demand that must be met by resources with a higher marginal cost. Because load remained high as the sun set ERCOT began to call on more resources with fuel costs and higher O&amp;M components, eventually reaching the upper echelon of energy prices from peaking units. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--2-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--2-.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--2-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="batteries-and-prices-hit-their-peaks">Batteries and Prices Hit Their Peaks</h2><p>Shattering the previous record, battery discharge peaked 20% higher than the previous record, which was set only the day before. The fulsome deployment of ECRS contributed to juicing battery discharge above and beyond the previous peak. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--3-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--3-.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--3-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Hub average fifteen-minute settlement point price (SPP) nearly reached the $5,000 bid cap. ERCOT’s ORDC also contributed to sustained high prices. The ORDC adders were a major contributor to price action in 2021 and 2022, but were greatly reduced in 2023 and have been largely absent so far in 2024 due to changes in the ancillary services market and how ERCOT handles tight situations.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--4-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--4-.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--4-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="tight-on-capacity-without-conservation">Tight on Capacity Without Conservation</h2><p>Physical Responsive Capacity (PRC) and capacity available to SCED within 5 minutes declined significantly despite 2,000 MW of extra capacity released from ECRS. </p><p>Despite the demand, prices, and ancillary deployments, ERCOT didn't issue a general call for conservation, indicating its operators were confident that the grid had sufficient resources to make it through the net load peak.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--7-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--7-.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--7-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yesterday set a number of <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/records/ercot?ref=blog.gridstatus.io" rel="noreferrer">records</a> at or near the top of the ERCOT leaderboards. While we may not see another load record this summer, solar generation could still set new peaks and an unexpected grid event at any time could trigger another coordinated response from batteries.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--6-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--6-.png 600w, https://blog.gridstatus.io/content/images/2024/08/ERCOT-Recap-8.19-8.20.2024--6-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Code review seems like a great idea, right? Two developers
      looking at the same code means two chances to spot problems; it
      spreads understanding of the way the project is evolving; the
      reviewer can learn useful tricks from reading the author’s code
      in detail, or spot opportunities to teach the author a useful
      trick that they didn’t know already.</p>
    <p>But that’s only for ‘light side’ code reviewers, who use it to
      try to improve the code base and the developers’ collective
      skills. Code review can also be a powerful tool for totally
      different purposes. When a code reviewer turns to the dark side,
      they have a huge choice of ways to obstruct or delay
      improvements to the code, to annoy patch authors or discourage
      them completely, or to pursue other goals of their own.</p>
    <p>If you’ve only recently turned to the dark side, you might not
      have thought of all the possibilities yet. So here’s a list of
      code-review antipatterns, for the dark-side code reviewer who’s
      running out of ideas.</p>
    <h2 id="antipatterns">The antipatterns</h2>

    <h3 id="round-trips">The Death of a Thousand Round Trips</h3>
    <p>You start reading the code. As soon as you see a nitpick, you
      add a review comment pointing it out. Then you stop reading.</p>
    <p>The developer conscientiously fixes your nitpick, and submits a
      revised patch.</p>
    <p>You start reading that version. You spot another nitpick,
      independent of the first. You <em>could</em> perfectly well have
      mentioned it the first time, but you didn’t, because you didn’t
      get that far. So you point that out – and stop reading
      again.</p>
    <p>And so on. Iterate until the developer loses hope.</p>
    <p>If you’re in a very different time zone from the developer, you
      get a natural 24-hour round-trip time, so that the patch evolves
      as slowly as possible. If you’re in a nearby time zone, or the
      same one, then to delay the patch properly, you’ll have to
      arrange to be busy with several other things, so you have a good
      excuse for it taking you a day or two to get round to looking at
      each new version.</p>
    <p>Resist the temptation to make any remarks like ‘This is
      looking much better now.’ If you hint that you’re getting closer
      to being satisfied, you’ll give them reason to keep trying!</p>

    <h3 id="ransom-note">The Ransom Note</h3>
    <p>This particular patch seems <em>especially</em> important to
      the developer who submitted it. (Maybe they said that outright,
      as part of their argument trying to persuade you to take the
      patch. Or maybe you just read between the lines.)</p>
    <p>But this patch isn’t especially vital to you – so you’re in a
      position of power! Now you can hold the change they need hostage
      until they do lots of extra tangentially related work, which
      doesn’t really need to be in the same commit, but which is
      important to <em>you</em>.</p>
    <p>‘If you ever want to see your beloved patch again …’</p>

    <h3 id="double-team">The Double Team</h3>
    <p>One patch. Two reviewers.</p>
    <p>Every time one of you demands a change, the developer
      obediently makes it – and now the other one can complain
      instead!</p>
    <p>Keep taking turns to make incompatible demands. But always
      direct your comments at the developer. Avoid arguing directly
      with <em>each other</em> on the review thread, and don’t
      acknowledge any suggestion from the patch author that the two of
      you should talk to each other and come to a consensus about what
      the patch is supposed to look like.</p>
    <p>See how many times you can ping-pong the developer back and
      forth before they give up.</p>
    <p>(In a real emergency, if you can’t find an accomplice, you can
      try contradicting <em>your own</em> previous review comments.
      But normally someone will notice. It works better with two
      reviewers.)</p>

    <h3 id="guessing-game">The Guessing Game</h3>
    <p>There’s a problem, and lots of different possible ways to
      solve it. A developer has picked one solution and submitted a
      patch.</p>
    <p>Criticise that <em>particular</em> solution, on some grounds
      that don’t relate to whether or not it solves the problem. Keep
      your criticism vague and woolly: violation of an obscure design
      principle, perhaps, or incompatibility with some vapourware plan
      for future development in the same area. Make the criticism as
      irrelevant as possible to the thing they were really trying to
      achieve.</p>
    <p>If you make it vague enough, the developer won’t be able to
      think of any way to adapt their existing patch that they’re
      confident will address your criticisms. Their best bet is to
      choose a totally <em>different</em> solution to the original
      problem, and try implementing that instead.</p>
    <p>So now you can smack that one down too, in just as unhelpful a
      way!</p>
    <p>Don’t let the developer trap you into any conversation like
      ‘ok, how do you think this problem <em>should</em> be solved?’,
      or give any hint at a solution you’d be happy with. Sooner or
      later, they’ll lose the will to keep guessing.</p>

    <h3 id="priority-inversion">The Priority Inversion</h3>
    <p>In your first code review passes, pick small and simple nits.
      Variable names are a bit unclear; comments have typos in.</p>
    <p>Wait for the developer to fix those, and <em>then</em> drop
      your bombshell: there’s a much more fundamental problem with the
      patch, that needs a chunk of it to be completely rewritten –
      which means throwing away a lot of the nitpick fixes you’ve
      already made the developer do in that part of the patch.</p>
    <p>Nothing says ‘your work is not wanted, and your time is not
      valued’ better than making someone do a lot of work and then
      making them throw it away. This might be enough to make the
      developer give up, all by itself.</p>

    <h3 id="late-design">The Late-Breaking Design Review</h3>
    <p>An enormously complicated piece of work has been ongoing for
      weeks or months, in lots of separate patches. Half the work is
      already committed.</p>
    <p>You personally don’t agree with the design of the entire piece
      of work, but you weren’t consulted in the original discussions.
      Or maybe you were, but you were on the losing side of the
      debate.</p>
    <p>But now you’ve been asked to review a minor but important thing
      in the middle of it, like an easy fix for a bug that’s blocking
      lots of developers. This is your opportunity!</p>
    <p>Demand justification for the entire design of the work so far.
      If the developer doesn’t know the answers, because they’re just
      working on one small part of the overall job, then shrug –
      that’s not your problem, and you’re not hitting the ‘Approve’
      button until you’re satisfied.</p>
    <p>If you’re really lucky, perhaps you can even manipulate this
      developer into undoing some of the already-done work, by giving
      a plausible excuse why it’s necessary. Carefully avoid letting
      them know where to find the design discussions that contradict
      you.</p>

    <h3 id="catch-22">The Catch-22</h3>
    <p>If there’s one big patch, then it’s too hard to read! Demand it
      be split up into self-contained sub-pieces.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if there are lots of little patches, then
      some of them make no sense on their own! So insist that they be
      glued back together.</p>
    <p>With any large enough piece of work you can surely find a
      reason to make <em>one</em> of those complaints; it’s just a
      matter of deciding which.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be ‘number of patches in the pull request’.
      You can do this one with any kind of tradeoff that seems
      relevant in the particular case. For example, if the code is
      written legibly, it probably has unacceptably poor performance –
      or if it’s well optimised, it’s unreadable and hard to
      maintain.</p>

    <h3 id="flip-flop">The Flip Flop</h3>
    <p>There’s a type of change that people commonly make to the same
      part of the code, like adding an extra thing to a list. You’ve
      reviewed several of these changes before. Another one has just
      come along: the author has looked at the prior changes,
      carefully followed the existing pattern, and chosen you as a
      code reviewer because you’re clearly used to this area.</p>
    <p>Keep everybody on their toes by suddenly objecting to an aspect
      of the change that you’ve never had a problem with before.
      Following the existing pattern just isn’t good enough! The
      author ought to have anticipated that you’ve recently changed
      your mind about what this type of change should look like.</p>
    <p>What if the author points out your inconsistency, by showing
      the previous three identical changes where you didn’t raise this
      objection?</p>
    <p>Then you say ‘You’re right, those should be changed too.’ Be
      careful not to take any personal responsibility
      – <em>you’re</em> not volunteering to change all the existing
      cases. If you’re really lucky the developer will interpret this
      as instructions to change the existing cases themself, and then
      you’ve saved yourself a lot of effort.</p>

    <h2 id="the-point">But seriously, folks …</h2>
    <p>Up to here, this article has been a joke.</p>
    <p>(I’d hope I don’t even have to say that at all, but I’m
      sure <em>somebody</em> would have misunderstood otherwise.)</p>
    <p>I’m not <em>really</em> intending to encourage code reviewers
      to be annoying and obstructive. And I’m not even really
      suggesting that code reviewers <em>do</em> do all these bad
      things, at least on purpose, at least most of the time. Most of
      the descriptions above are exaggerations of what the reviewer
      really does. Or not even that: just an exaggeration of what
      it <em>feels</em> like, when you’re the frustrated patch
      submitter, and your patch has been stuck in review for weeks,
      and doesn’t feel as if it’s getting any closer.</p>
    <p>I really mean: <em>don’t</em> do these things! Try to minimise
      round trips, rather than maximising them. Ask for important
      rewrites (if needed) <em>before</em> picking all the trivial
      nits. When you criticise the patch, make constructive
      suggestions about what version of it you <em>would</em> accept.
      If you have opinions about the code base as a whole, raise them
      with all the developers in a general discussion, rather than
      being petty with the one developer whose patch you’re assigned
      to review. And if you do any of these things <em>by
      accident</em>, have some self-awareness about it: notice that
      you’ve made the developer’s life extra difficult by mistake,
      apologise, and try to compensate by being extra helpful. (Maybe
      even help to improve the actual code, either by writing your own
      revised version of this patch, or doing extra polishing in a
      followup patch of your own.)</p>
    
    <p>But if there’s a serious point to make here, I think it’s this.
      When one developer becomes the code reviewer for another one’s
      patch, that relationship creates temporary <em>authority</em>.
      The reviewer has the power to prevent that particular patch
      being committed, even if they don’t have any kind of authority
      over the patch submitter the rest of the time.</p>
    <p>With authority comes responsibility. You’re supposed to use the
      authority only for its intended purpose, and only as much as
      necessary. In this case, that’s to make the patch as good as
      possible, according to whatever definition of ‘good’ the
      development team as a whole has agreed on.</p>
    <p>So most of these antipatterns (or the milder behaviours that
      they’re caricaturing) are <em>abuses of authority</em>. The
      reviewer is using that temporary power over another developer as
      leverage to pursue some other personal agenda, perhaps
      independent of the goodness of the patch, or perhaps actively
      opposed to it.</p>
    <p>The personal agenda in question varies between these
      antipatterns. It could be some unrelated piece of work the
      reviewer is in favour of; it could be personal stylistic
      preferences that the reviewer hasn’t been able to get the rest
      of the team to adopt; it could be laziness, taking advantage of
      the opportunity to write a one-line description of what you want
      and let someone else do the hard work; it could just be plain
      resistance to change, or perhaps even a personal dislike of the
      patch submitter.</p>
    <p>And that dislike might be quite justifiable, if the patch
      submitter has done any of these bad behaviours when it was
      last <em>their</em> turn to be the code reviewer! That’s another
      reason you should use the code reviewer’s authority sparingly.
      If developers manage to get locked into a cycle of revenge
      against each other, your software project is doomed.</p>
    <h3 id="types">Gatekeeping code review</h3>
    <p>Up to this point, I’ve been focused on <em>peer</em> code
      review. The code reviewer and the patch submitter are
      colleagues; neither is in charge of the other; neither has the
      final say over the code base in general. That’s why the
      authority you get in a code review is <em>temporary</em>:
      tomorrow, after this patch lands, you won’t have it any more.
      The day after that, it might be the other way round.</p>
    <p>Also, in peer review situations, the code reviewer and the
      author are supposed to have basically the same goal. If there’s
      any serious disagreement about what features should go into the
      code at all, or how polished something needs to be before
      approval, or what the acceptable coding style is, it’s supposed
      to be dealt with outside the context of the code review.</p>
    <p>But in other kinds of code review situation, that’s not quite
      the way it works. In particular, if an outsider to your software
      project sends you an unsolicited patch, that’s very different.</p>
    <p>(This scenario usually comes up in free software, since anyone
      in the world can modify your source code, and some of them will
      try sending the changes back to you. But it can happen in other
      situations too – inside a company developing proprietary code, a
      developer in one team might try their luck sending a patch to
      another team’s project, if they particularly want a feature or
      fix that the other team hasn’t found effort for.)</p>
    <p>In this situation, there’s a much bigger chance that the
      receiver of the patch will be unwilling to accept it at all,
      either because they don’t think that change should be made in
      the first place, or they disagree completely with the way it was
      done. And in this case, that’s <em>not</em> an abuse of the
      temporary authority granted by being a peer reviewer: it’s a
      legitimate exercise of the <em>permanent</em> authority of being
      the person or team in charge of the project. It’s my software
      project – I get to decide what direction it goes in.</p>
    <p>When the code reviewer is in this ‘gatekeeping’ role, it’s not
      always wrong to criticise the patch on the grounds that it
      violates an existing general design principle or requirement
      (<a href="#guessing-game">The Guessing Game</a>), without
      suggesting how the same problem could be solved better. Maybe I
      don’t <em>know</em> how that problem could be solved in a way
      that’s consistent with the requirement. In fact, maybe that’s
      precisely the hard part, and the only reason why I haven’t
      already made the same change myself!</p>
    <p>But even in a gatekeeping context, it’s rude to deploy ‘The
      Guessing Game’ <em>without explaining</em>. When I do this, I
      generally try to explain how the developer has overlooked the
      hard part, and if I don’t know the answer myself, I’ll say so.</p>
    <p>And, of course, there’s still no excuse
      for <em>passive-aggressive</em> obstructiveness
      like <a href="#round-trips">The Death of a Thousand Round
      Trips</a>. If you genuinely don’t want the patch in the code at
      all, and you’re in a gatekeeping role with the legitimate
      authority to make that decision, you can <em>say so</em> in
      words, so the submitter doesn’t waste any more time on it!</p>

          One of applications at my work has always been RAM-bound - it's a
          pricing engine that basically loads tons of hotels, builds some
          in-memory indices and then allows you to issue queries like
          <i>find me the cheapest hotel in berlin, pronto</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A pricing engine's main purpose is to price <s>engines</s> hotels, but
          in order to do that effectively, there's a lot of "meta work"
          involved, like:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Where do we load the data from, how do we do it?</li>
          <li>Do we load the entire dataset or just some parts of it?</li>
          <li>
            Should we precalculate prices in order to speed-up the most popular
            queries?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Such an engine poses an interesting technical challenge, even greater
          so when one day it starts OOMing on production, even though the entire
          dataset should fit in the memory multiple times...

          Of course IRL there's <kbd>ArcSwap</kbd> instead of <kbd>RwLock</kbd>,
          every hotel contains much more information (like taxes, discounts or
          supplements) etc., but we've got a reasonably good approximation here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, what if I told you that this code has <i>totally</i> different
          memory characteristics depending on which allocator you use?
        </p>

        <h2 id="practical-reasons">
          <a href="#practical-reasons"> Practical Reasons </a>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Memory allocator is the piece of software invoked whenever your
          program needs to get hands on extra memory, like when you're calling
          <kbd>Box::new()</kbd>. And memory allocation is quite a complex topic,
          with different solutions offering different trade-offs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Say, when implementing a firmware you might pick an allocator that
          works slower, because its implementation is just simpler and doesn't
          occupy much space in the final binary.
        </p>

        <p>
          (some would argue that embeddeed programs shouldn't allocate, yadda
          yadda, but you get the idea -- replace <i>firmware</i> with
          <i>wasm</i> and you end up with the same problem.)
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc">mimalloc</a> is an
          allocator that fights tooth and nail for performance - and while most
          applications don't have to worry about allocation performance, in our
          case internal benchmarks have proven it gives us extra 10% for free;
          when your response times have to be within milliseconds, this matters.
        </p>

        <p>But there's a catch.</p>

        <h2 id="desenchantee"><a href="#desenchantee"> Désenchantée </a></h2>

        <p>
          That program from before, on my x86_64 Linux machine it allocates
          around 4 GB of memory and it remains on this level through the
          refreshing.
        </p>

        <p>
          This makes sense, right? We're using lazy iterators, replacing stuff
          in place one-by-one, there's no reason we'd need more RAM.
        </p>

        <p>But if you use mimalloc:</p>

        <div>
          <pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>mimalloc</span>::<span>MiMalloc</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[global_allocator]</span>
<span>static</span><span> </span><span>GLOBAL</span>: <span>MiMalloc</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>MiMalloc</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          ... the program will first allocate 4 GB and then allocate
          <i>extra</i> 4 GB during the refreshing, oh noes!
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting to this point already took three days of my life - believe me
          or not, when faced with 200k lines of Arc-ridden Rust code that
          <i>seems</i> to generate a memory leak, one's first thought is not
          "let's try with different allocator", but rather "probably something's
          holding onto an Arc for too long".
        </p>

        <p>
          And so I've valgrind-ed. I've perf-ed. I've analyzed assembly. I've
          headbanged and I've cried.
        </p>

        <p>No more.</p>

        <p>
          From now on I'm always assuming it's someone else's fault - it's the
          allocator, it's the compiler, it's that crate Mike pulled last night.
          WHY DO YOU HATE ME MIKE, WHY ARE YOU PULLING RANDOM CRATES TO MY PURE
          <span>~~~tv noise~~~</span>
        </p>

        <h2 id="remede"><a href="#remede"> Remède </a></h2>

        <p>
          Allocators have different characteristics for a reason - they do some
          things differently between each other. What do you think mimalloc does
          that could account for this behavior?
        </p>

        <p>
          Let me give you two hints, two pieces of code that solve the problem,
          but feel cursed:
        </p>

        <div>
          <pre><span></span><span>// Approach 1:</span>

<span>    </span><span>}).</span><span>join</span><span>().</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();</span>

<span>    </span><span>/* ... */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Approach 2:</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>/* ... */</span>

<span>    </span><span>loop</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>Box</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1234</span><span>);</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Any ideas? Last chance to win a plushie polar bear!</p>

        <p>
          Alright then, the issue is that mimalloc assumes that
          <b>every thread allocates every now and then</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every now and then during <kbd>malloc()</kbd> mimalloc performs some
          internal bookkeeping, so when a thread goes to sleep (say, because it
          delegates handling HTTP requests into a separate thread pool...), this
          bookkeeping doesn't happen (for that particular thread).
        </p>

        <p>
          The most nasty edge case that can happen here, and the one that we've
          stumbled upon, is when your thread allocates a lot of data, then
          launches other threads to work on that data, and then goes to sleep.
          As other threads work on memory and override stuff, Rust destructors
          <i>are</i> launched properly, but the underlying memory blocks simply
          get marked as "to be released".
        </p>

        <p>
          Under normal conditions, these blocks get processed a moment later,
          during a call to <kbd>malloc()</kbd> on the thread that created them -
          but if that thread is asleep, those blocks never become available
          again (unless the thread dies, of course).
        </p>

        <p>
          To be sure, the problem is not that the memory is not returned to the
          kernel - that's alright. It's that unless this bookkeeping happens,
          mimalloc can't even use the memory <i>for itself</i> - all this free
          estate just lays there, dormant:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/537">https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/537</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/214">https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/214</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Anyway, the solution we went with was to keep all refreshing on the
          same thread - when program starts, we spawn a dedicated
          refreshing-thread and use channels to let it know to do its thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          So yeah, that was fun; and health-wise probably more like seven
          cigarettes.

The invention of the jet engine made it possible for aircraft to fly far higher and faster than ever before. While the fastest propeller-driven aircraft of World War II topped out at slightly less than 500 miles per hour in level flight, jet-powered aircraft in the mid-1950s were flying at over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_B-58_Hustler#Specifications_(B-58A)" rel="">1,300 miles per hour</a><span>, twice the speed of sound, with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XB-70_Valkyrie" rel="">even faster aircraft</a><span> on the horizon. Achieving this level of performance required not only powerful jet engines, but a whole host of new aircraft technologies: materials like </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/building-apollo" rel="">inconel</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-story-of-titanium" rel="">titanium</a><span>, and manufacturing methods that could produce far stronger and lighter aircraft parts.&nbsp;</span></p><p>One promising technological advance was to use large forged or extruded parts. Forging is a manufacturing method that shapes metal by applying pressure, usually by hammering it or squeezing it with large presses. Extruding is a similar process that shapes metal by squeezing it through an opening of the proper shape. At the time, both forging and extrusion were used to produce aircraft parts, but parts were limited in size and needed to be stitched together with hundreds or thousands of fasteners. By using very large forgings and extrusions to replace many smaller parts, components could be thinner, lighter, and stronger. Aerodynamic surfaces could be smoothed, and seals could be tightened. And by eliminating so many individual parts (along with the time and effort to attach them together), large forgings and extrusions could potentially reduce the time and cost required to build an aircraft. While there were a variety of different methods for making very large parts, such as casting and machining from plate or billet, forging and extrusion had several distinct advantages.</p><blockquote><p><em><span>…Machining from plate or billet requires tremendous machines and many machine-hours. A part machined from plate or billet is not as consistent in its mechanical properties as a part forged or extruded to finished or nearly finished dimensions. Mechanical properties in the center of thick plate or billet are questionable. Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design. The large percentage of stock going into chips [in machining] is unfavorable. Casting materials do not have sufficiently high physical properties, nor have casting techniques developed to the point where efficient metal distribution and thin sections can be obtained. –&nbsp; </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_american-society-of-mechanical-engineers-transactions_1953-11_75_8" rel="">Symposium on Heavy Presses</a></em></p></blockquote><p>But the size of forgings or extrusions was limited by the size of the presses used to make them. Very large forgings or extrusions would require building presses of unprecedented size. Machines would need to be ten stories tall and capable of exerting hundreds of millions of pounds of force.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1950s, the Department of Defense undertook a program to build such presses. Known as the Heavy Press Program, it funded the construction of four large forging presses and six extrusion presses. Upon completion, the largest of them were the largest presses in the world.</p><p>The program was an enormous success. Not only did the large parts produced by the presses greatly reduce the cost and increase the performance of military aircraft, but the presses proved useful for making parts for things like helicopters, submarines, spacecraft, and commercial jets. Within roughly a decade the presses had returned more than double their investment in reduced manufacturing costs, and they continued to produce complex, high quality forged and extruded parts over the subsequent decades. Six of the ten presses are still operational today.</p><p>The origins of the Heavy Press Program can be traced to Germany in the 1920s. As a condition of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forced to give up many of its western iron-producing regions, creating a chronic shortage of iron and steel. This drove Germany to make greater use of other metals, like magnesium and aluminum. Germany was the first country to produce magnesium on a commercial scale, starting in the 1880s, and it was an early leader in the development and use of high-strength aluminum alloys.&nbsp;</p><p>It was found that while aluminum and magnesium responded poorly to being shaped by hammering (they tended to shatter, particularly magnesium), good results could be achieved by squeezing them in hydraulic presses. As a result, Germany built a series of increasingly large presses in the years following WWI&nbsp; to make large forgings and extrusions from magnesium and aluminum. For forgings, it built a 7,000-ton press, followed by three 16,500-ton presses, followed by a 33,000 ton press, with plans for an even larger 55,000 ton press. Progress in extrusion presses was similar: by the end of WWII, Germany had four 12,000-ton extrusion presses in various stages of completion, and a 25,000-ton press on the drawing board. (“tons” refers to the pressure capacity of a press, not its weight. So a 7,000-ton press is capable of exerting 7,000 tons of force.)</p><p>The U.S. became aware of Germany’s large press capabilities as early as 1942, when inspection of the wreckage of German aircraft revealed forgings far larger than anything the U.S. could produce. The U.S. responded by starting work on a large, 18,000 ton forging press at the Wyman-Gordon plant in Massachusetts, but it wouldn’t be completed until 1946.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png" width="1166" height="487" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:487,&quot;width&quot;:1166,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7cec4ed-894c-4416-98a2-35a3394afa8a_1166x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>German large aircraft forging (left) vs same assembly made from multiple smaller parts, via </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ50nZU3oG8" rel="">USAF</a></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Following Germany’s surrender, the U.S. and the Soviet Union divided up its large press capabilities as well as its </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/building-apollo" rel="">rocket scientists</a><span>. The U.S. dismantled four German presses and had them shipped back to the states, while the Soviet Union secured the 33,000-ton press, the designs for the 55,000-ton press, and a number of German metallurgical experts.</span></p><p>By the late 1940s, a confluence of factors was pushing the U.S. towards building its own series of large presses. Rapidly improving aircraft performance was creating a need for lighter, stronger aircraft parts. The Germans had shown what could be achieved by using very large aircraft forgings and extrusions, and the U.S. had several years of experience from operating its own 18,000-ton press. The Soviet Union had taken the largest of the German presses and was presumably building more of its own, creating the risk that the U.S. might fall behind in aircraft manufacturing capabilities.</p><p><span>The Air Force studied seventeen different aircraft then under production, surveyed several different aircraft manufacturers, and concluded there were large potential benefits from building very large presses for forgings and extrusions.</span><em> </em><span>In 1950, the Department of Defense initiated a program to build 17 large presses: 9 die-forging (where hot metal was squeezed into a mold) and 8 extrusion. The expected cost, including presses and necessary supporting facilities, was $389 million. This was later cut down to 10 presses: 4 extrusion and 6 forging (in addition to the 18,000-ton Wyman-Gordon and the four presses taken from Germany), which would ultimately cost $239 million ($2.8 billion in 2024 dollars).</span></p><p>The program would be funded by the Department of Defense and managed by the Air Force, but the presses themselves would be leased to and operated by private industry (a choice that was controversial at the time). In return for very attractive lease rates, the companies would be responsible for any costs associated with maintaining and operating them, and the government would receive 4 to 5% of the revenue made from their operation.</p><p>This arrangement required some degree of selling on the part of the government. Private industry had to be convinced to participate, and that the presses would be sources of revenue and not simply a constant drain due to maintenance costs. Aircraft designers likewise had to be convinced that the presses would be available, and to design parts to take advantage of them. (Historically, aircraft designers had been reluctant to design parts that could only be made in a limited number of facilities.)</p><p>Construction on the presses began in 1952 and was a monumental undertaking. The largest, the 50,000-ton forging presses, were behemoths: each was the size of a ten-story building, and could exert enough force to lift an entire battleship. The 35,000-ton forging presses weren’t much smaller. Even the 12,000-ton extrusion presses were 120 feet long, with parts twice as tall as a man, and more than twice the capacity of the previous largest American extrusion presses.</p><div><figure><a

themselves would be underground, and required a 100-foot deep hole lined with concrete walls 13 feet thick. The forging and extrusion presses alike were made up of massive iron and steel components that were some of the largest metal parts ever produced: 200-ton cross beams, 90-ton cylinder supports, 145-ton tie rods. The parts were so large that special manufacturing and transportation methods were devised to handle them. Special furnaces needed to be built to fabricate the 108-foot tie rods for the forging presses, and multiple cranes were needed to move them. Some press components exceeded the weight limit for what a single rail car could support, and so were carried by multiple rail cars at once. Parts were produced by American fabricators like Bethlehem Steel, but also came from all over the world: England, Scotland, France, and Japan.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png" width="483" height="608.3870967741935" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:651,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:483,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46449d3f-01a8-4258-b299-06002e191051_651x820.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>275 ton steel ingot prior to being forged into part of a steel column for the Loewy 50,000 ton forging press.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>The huge presses required equally huge supporting infrastructure.

At Alcoa, an entire 500,000 square foot factory was built in Cleveland to accommodate the 50,000- and 35,000-ton forging presses being installed.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png" width="558" height="429.8988326848249" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:594,&quot;width&quot;:771,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:558,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cafb18f-45a8-44f2-9553-1fbe1e1411e1_771x594.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Turning a steel column for the 50,000 ton Mesta press on a 110 inch lathe.</figcaption></figure></div><p>By 1954 the first heavy presses were operational, and by 1956 they had all been completed.

Typically, a forging or extrusion didn’t come out of a press perfectly accurate, which required machining to carve the part down to its final dimensions. Likewise, very large parts had often needed to be cut down from large pieces of plate or billet. While machining wasn’t totally eliminated by the heavy presses, their ability to produce thin and complex parts near in size to the final shape required meant that machining time was greatly reduced. In one case, a part that started weighing 1,600 pounds and had more than 1,200 pounds removed by machining, at a cost of $18,000, was replaced by a part that started at just 321 pounds and required $500 worth of machining. Another part went from needing 23 pounds of material removed to just 2 pounds removed.</p><p>These savings had a significant effect on the total cost of aircraft being produced. Savings on the Convair F-102A were estimated to be $20,000, around 1.6% of the cost of the aircraft. The savings on a heavy bomber was estimated to be even greater, around 5-10% of its total cost; savings on the B-52 alone were estimated to be greater than the entire cost of the Heavy Press Program. By the 1960s, the heavy presses had saved the government an estimated $500 million in reduced manufacturing costs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png" width="775" height="474" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:474,&quot;width&quot;:775,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31df45e9-0ff5-42ff-8b37-23fb204471b3_775x474.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Aircraft components that could be made on the heavy presses, via Aviation Week.</figcaption></figure></div><p>And it wasn’t just aircraft that were able to take advantage of the new press capabilities; parts from the presses were used in ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines, and armored vehicles for the Army. The presses were used to forge the beryllium heat shield on the Mercury space capsule, and the huge aluminum “anchors” that attached the Saturn V rocket to the launch pad. In 1956, the presses were first used to produce parts for commercial aircraft, and by the 1960s this was common — a 4,000-pound titanium beam made on the heavy presses to support the landing gear on the Boeing 747 was the largest titanium forging that had ever been produced.</p><p>Partly this broad range of uses for the heavy presses came from expanding the range of materials used in them. Originally the presses were designed to make parts from aluminum and magnesium, but by the 1960s they were not only pressing aluminum and magnesium but steel, titanium, nickel, copper, columbium, beryllium, and a variety of other metals.</p><p>The heavy presses have been described as “the most rapid and far reaching advance in metal processing in industrial history,” as well as the biggest leap for aircraft manufacturing in industry history. By the early 2000s, parts from the heavy presses were in every U.S. military aircraft in service, and every airplane built by Airbus and Boeing. The two 50,000-ton forging presses remained the largest closed-die forging presses in the U.S. until 2018, when they were surpassed by an even larger 60,000-ton press.</p><p><span>The Heavy Press Program is a classic example of military technological spillovers, and the potential returns from government investment in technological capabilities. The heavy presses were built specifically for military purposes — making lighter and stronger parts for supersonic aircraft — but once they were built, they proved useful for all sorts of other things, from spacecraft to power systems to commercial aircraft. The U.S. has accrued the benefits of the presses for 70 years and counting, and at least part of America’s success in commercial aircraft manufacturing can be attributed to their existence. Some have gone so far as to say that the entire modern American aerospace industry </span><a href="https://riancwhitton.substack.com/p/start-the-presses" rel="">owes its existence to the heavy presses</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The Heavy Press Program also shows the importance of manufacturing improvements for technological progress. The sorts of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability" rel="">design for manufacturing</a><span> optimizations that the presses made possible — replacing a large number of parts and fasteners with a smaller number of larger components, reducing machining time — not only reduce manufacturing costs, but they changed the economic calculus as to what sorts of technologies are commercially viable, and thus get further developed. The heavy presses made it possible to build strong, precise, lightweight aircraft components more cheaply than other manufacturing methods, making things feasible that otherwise might not have been. An official Air Force statement from 1964 states that “to catalogue the significant accomplishments of the heavy press program is almost to relate the history of our modern advanced aircraft,” and credits it for making things like aircraft wet wings (where the wing of the airplane holds the fuel) inexpensive enough to be viable.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-147930799" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-a-50000-ton-forging#footnote-1-147930799" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>We can see a modern, obvious parallel between the Air Force Heavy Press Program and Tesla, which has created a similar revolution in car manufacturing by using large aluminum castings to replace dozens or hundreds of smaller parts. Like the Heavy Press, using large castings required building new, larger capacity machinery, in the form of “Giga-casting” machines of unprecedented size. Tesla was the first car manufacturer to adopt large castings, but the savings were so significant — an estimated 20 to 40% reduction in the cost of a car body — that they’re being adopted by many other car manufacturers, particularly Chinese ones. Large, complex castings have been described as a key tool for not only reducing cost but also </span><a href="https://www.diecasting-mould.com/news/the-casting-expert-behind-byd-and-xpengs-components" rel="">good EV charging performance</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The experience of Tesla with large castings suggest that there’s still opportunities available to push technology forward by making large, complex parts in a single step. Even with large presses, we may not have exhausted the possibilities. The largest closed-die forging presses have now reached 80,000 tons (in China, naturally), but as early as the 1950s experts were speculating that presses of up to 200,000 tons might be useful for aircraft manufacturing. Experience developing the SR-71 led Kelly Johnson to believe that the U.S. needed even larger, 250,000-ton presses, and in the 1980s the Army studied </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA132398/mode/1up?q%3D%E2%80%9CAlcoa%E2%80%9D%2B%E2%80%9C50%252C000%2Bton=" rel="">whether presses</a><span> of up to 200,000 tons might be useful. But no such presses were ever built, either in the U.S. or elsewhere.</span></p><p>And in fact, recent experience suggests the U.S. might no longer be willing or able to take advantage of this type of opportunity. Much of the experience in building machinery of this magnitude has been lost, or has migrated elsewhere. The original heavy presses were built by American companies like Loewy Hydropress and Mesta, but when the 50,000-ton Alcoa press was refurbished in the early 2000s, the parts came from German company SMS, the same company that built the 60,000-ton forging press. And while American car manufacturers are using large Giga-casting machines in their manufacturing operations, those machines themselves are overwhelmingly built by Chinese or Chinese-owned companies like IDRA.</p><p>Technological progress means building things that have never been built before, which often means pushing the boundaries of manufacturing technology forward. Fail to do this, and you risk being outcompeted by people who do.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Electrostatic Motors Reach the Macro Scale"><p>It’s a pretty sure bet that you couldn’t get through a typical day without the direct support of dozens of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-motors">electric motors</a>. They’re in all of your appliances not powered by a hand crank, in the climate-control systems that keep you comfortable, and in the pumps, fans, and window controls of your car. And although there are many different kinds of electric motors, every single one of them, from the 200-kilowatt traction motor in your electric vehicle to the stepper motor in your <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/quartz-watch" target="_self">quartz wristwatch</a>, exploits the exact same physical phenomenon: electromagnetism.</p><p>For decades, however, engineers have been tantalized by the virtues of motors based on an entirely different principle: electrostatics. In some applications, these motors could offer an overall boost in efficiency ranging from 30 percent to close to 100 percent, according to experiment-based analysis. And, perhaps even better, they would use only cheap, plentiful materials, rather than the rare-earth elements, special steel alloys, and copious quantities of copper found in conventional motors.</p><p>“Electrification has its sustainability challenges,” notes <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Ludois_Daniel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel Ludois</a>, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. But “an electrostatic motor doesn’t need windings, doesn’t need magnets, and it doesn’t need any of the critical materials that a conventional machine needs.”</p><p>Such advantages prompted Ludois to cofound a company, <a href="https://www.c-motive.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C-Motive Technologies</a>, to build macro-scale electrostatic motors. “We make our machines out of aluminum and plastic or fiberglass,” he says. Their current prototype is capable of delivering torque as high as 18 newton meters and power at 360 watts (0.5 horsepower)—characteristics they claim are “the highest torque and power measurements for any rotating electrostatic machine.”<strong></strong></p><p>The results are reported in a paper, “Synchronous Electrostatic Machines for Direct Drive Industrial Applications,” to be presented at the 2024 <a href="https://www.ieee-ecce.org/2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition</a>, which will be held from 20 to 24 October in Phoenix, Ariz. In the paper, Ludois and four colleagues describe an electrostatic machine they built, which they describe as the first such machine capable of “driving a load performing industrial work, in this case, a constant-pressure pump system.”</p><h2>Making Electrostatic Motors Bigger</h2><p>The machine, which is hundreds of times more powerful than any previous electrostatic motor, is “competitive with or superior to air-cooled magnetic machinery at the fractional [horsepower] scale,” the authors add. The global market for fractional horsepower motors is <a href="https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/industrial-fractional-horsepower-motors-market-111323" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than US $8.7 billion</a>, according to consultancy Business Research Insights.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="3/4 view cutaway inside the motor" data-rm-shortcode-id="dc238cae9ff249c229d3a194ed73358d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3-4-view-cutaway-inside-the-motor.jpg?id=53382090&amp;width=980" height="620" id="eb478" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3-4-view-cutaway-inside-the-motor.jpg?id=53382090&amp;width=980" width="620"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">C-Motive’s 360-watt motor has a half dozen each of rotors and stators, shown in yellow in this cutaway illustration.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">C-Motive Technologies</small></p><p>Achieving macro scale wasn’t easy. Electrostatic motors have been available for years, but today, these are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/smallest-drone" target="_self">tiny units</a> with power output measured in milliwatts. “<a href="https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Electricity_and_Magnetism/Electromagnetics_and_Applications_(Staelin)/06%3A_Actuators_and_sensors_motors_and_generators/6.02%3A_Electrostatic_actuators_and_motors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrostatic motors</a> are amazing once you get below about the millimeter scale, and they get better and better as they get smaller and smaller,” says Philip Krein, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “There’s a crossover at which they are better than magnetic motors.” (Krein does not have any financial connection to C-Motive.)</p><p>For larger motors, however, the opposite is true. “At macro scale, electromagnetism wins, is the textbook answer,” notes Ludois. “Well, we’ve decided to challenge that wisdom.”</p><p>For this quest he and his team found inspiration in a lesser-known accomplishment of one of the United States’ founding fathers. “The fact is that Benjamin Franklin built and demonstrated a macroscopic electrostatic motor in 1747,” says Krein. “He actually used the motor as a rotisserie to grill a turkey on a riverbank in Philadelphia” (a fact unearthed by the late historian I. Bernard Cohen for his 1990 book <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674066595" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Benjamin Franklin’s Science</em></a> ).</p><p>Krein explains that the fundamental challenge in attempting to scale electrostatic motors to the macro world is energy density. “The energy density you can get in air at a reasonable scale with an electric-field system is much, much lower—many orders of magnitude lower—than the density you can get with an electromagnetic system.” Here the phrase “in air” refers to the volume within the motor, called the “air gap,” where the machine’s fields (magnetic for the conventional motor, electric for the electrostatic one) are deployed. It straddles the machine’s key components: the rotor and the stator.</p><p>Let’s unpack that. A conventional electric motor works because a rotating magnetic field, set up in a fixed structure called a stator, engages with the magnetic field of another structure called a rotor, causing that rotor to spin. The force involved is called the Lorentz force. But what makes an electrostatic machine go ‘round is an entirely different force, called the Coulomb force. This is the attractive or repulsive physical force between opposite or like electrical charges.</p><h2>Overcoming the Air Gap Problem</h2><p>C-Motive’s motor uses nonconductive rotor and stator disks on which have been deposited many thin, closely spaced conductors radiating outward from the disk’s center, like spokes in a bicycle wheel. Precisely timed electrostatic charges applied to these “spokes” create two waves of voltage, one in the stator and another in the rotor. The phase difference between the rotor and stator waves is timed and controlled to maximize the torque in the rotor caused by this sequence of attraction and repulsion among the spokes. To further wring as much torque as possible, the machine has half a dozen each of rotors and stators, alternating and stacked like compact discs on a spindle.</p><p><img alt="The C-Motive motor sitting on a desk in front of a black background" data-rm-shortcode-id="c247bb09dc231427d17ae7e582bcf94e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-c-motive-motor-sitting-on-a-desk-in-front-of-a-black-background.jpg?id=53382092&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="e164c" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-c-motive-motor-sitting-on-a-desk-in-front-of-a-black-background.jpg?id=53382092&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The 360-watt motor is hundreds of times more powerful than previous electrostatic motors, which have power output generally measured in milliwatts.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">C-Motive Technologies</small></p><p>The machine would be feeble if the dielectric between the charges was air. As a dielectric, air has low permittivity, meaning that an electric field in air can not store much energy. Air also has a relatively low breakdown field strength, meaning that air can support only a fairly weak electric field before it breaks down and conducts current in a blazing arc. So one of the team’s greatest challenges was producing a dielectric fluid that has a much higher permittivity and breakdown field strength than air, and that was also environmentally friendly and nontoxic. To minimize friction, this fluid also had to have very low viscosity, because the rotors would be spinning in it. A dielectric with high permittivity concentrates the electric field between oppositely charged electrodes, enabling greater energy to be stored in the space between them. After screening hundreds of candidates over several years, the C-Motive team succeeded in producing an organic liquid dielectric with low viscosity and a <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/relative-permittivity-d_1660.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relative permittivity</a> in the low 20s. For comparison, the relative permittivity of air is 1.</p><p>Another challenge was supplying the 2,000 volts their machine needs to operate. High voltages are necessary to create the intense electric fields between the rotors and stators. To precisely control these fields, C-Motive was able to take advantage of the availability of inexpensive and stupendously capable power electronics, according to Ludois. For their most recent motor, they developed a drive system based on readily available <a href="https://www.littelfuse.com/products/power-semiconductors/discrete-igbts/xpt/high-voltage_xpt/ixyh30n450hv.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4.5-kilovolt insulated-gate bipolar transistors</a>, but the rate of advancement in power <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> means they have many attractive choices here, and will have even more in the near future.</p><p>Ludois reports that C-Motive is now testing a 750-watt (1 hp) motor in applications with potential customers. Their next machines will be in the range of 750 to 3,750 watts (1 to 5 hp), he adds. These will be powerful enough for an expanded range of applications in industrial automation, manufacturing, and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning.</p><p>It’s been a gratifying ride for Ludois. “For me, a point of creative pride is that my team and I are working on something radically different that, I hope, over the long term, will open up other avenues for other folks to contribute.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Wednesday, August 21, 2024
  

  </p><p>It has been a few months since I wrote about <a href="https://rye.astral.sh/">Rye</a> here last.  You might remember that in
February I passed over stewardship of my Rye packaging too to <a href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a>.  The folks over there have been super busy in
building a lot of amazing tooling for Python packaging in the last few
months.  If you have been using Rye in the last few months you will have
noticed that the underlying resolver and installer <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> got a lot better and faster.</p>
<p>As of the most recent release, <cite>uv</cite> also gained a lot of functionality that
previously required Rye such as manipulating <cite>pyproject.toml</cite> files,
workspace support, local package references and script installation.  It
now also can manage Python installations for you so it's getting much
closer.</p>
<p>If you are using Rye today, consider this blog post as a reminder that you
should probably starting having a closer look at <cite>uv</cite> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/discussions/1342">give feedback to
the Astral folks</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk just recently in Prague at EuroPython about my current view
of the Python packaging, the lessons I learned when creating Rye and one
of the things I mentioned there is that the goal of a packaging tool has
to be that it will dominate the space.  The tool that absolutely everybody
uses has to be the best tool: it's the thing any new person to Python gets
to see when they start their programming journey.  After that talk a lot
of people walked up to me and had a lot of questions about that in
particular.</p>
<p>Python in the last two years has become an incredibly hot and popular
platform for many new developers.  That has in part been fueled by all the
investments and interest that went into AI and ML.  I really want
everybody who gets to learn and experience Python not to remember it as an
old language with bad tooling, but as an amazing language with a stellar
developer experience.  Unfortunately that's not the case today because
there is so much choice, so many tools that are not quite compatible, and
by the inconsistency everywhere.  I have seen people walk down one tool,
just to re-emerge moving their entire stack to conda and back because they
hit some wall.</p>
<p>Domination is a goal because it means that most investment will go into
one stack.  I can only re-iterate my wish and desire that Rye (and with it
a lot of other tools in the space) should cease to exist once the
dominating tool has been established.  For me <cite>uv</cite> is poised to be that
tool.  It's not quite there today yet for all cases, but it will be in no
time, and now is the moment to step up as a community and start to start
to rally around it.  That doesn't mean that this tool will be the tool
forever.  Things come and go and maybe there is a future for some other
tool.</p>
<p>But today I'm looking forward to the moment when there will be a final
release of Rye that is no remaining functionality other than to just
largely alias to uv, that retires Rye specific functionality and migrates
you over to uv.</p>
<p>However I <em>only have the power to retire one tool, and that won't be
enough</em>.  Today we are using so many other package managing solutions for
Python and we should be advertising fewer.  I understand how much time and
effort went into many of those, and everybody's contributions are
absolutely appreciated.  Software like Rye and uv were built on the
advancements of the ecosystem underneath it.  They leverage years and
years of work that went into migrating the Python ecosystems from setup.py
files to eggs and finally wheels.  From not having a metadata standard to
having one.  From coupled to decoupled build systems.  Much of what makes
Rye so enjoyable were individuals that worked towards making
redistributable and downloadable Python binaries a possibility.  There was
a lot of work that was put into building out an amazing ecosystem of Rust
crates and Python libraries needed to make these tools work.  All of that
brought us to that point where we are today.</p>
<p>But it is my believe that we need to take the next step and be willing to
say as a community that some tools are no longer recommended.  Maybe not
today, but that moment will come quicker than we think.  I remember a time
when many of us who maintained Python libraries pointed new developers to
using <cite>ez_setup.py</cite> and <cite>easy_install</cite> in our onboarding guides.  Years
later we removed the mentions of <cite>ez_setup.py</cite> from our guides to replace
them with <cite>pip</cite>.  Some of us have pointed developers at <cite>pip-tools</cite>, at
<cite>poetry</cite> or <cite>PDM</cite>.  Many projects today even show 5 different installation
guides because of that wild variety of tools available because they no
longer feel like they can recommend one.</p>
<p>If you maintain an important Python project I would ask you to give <cite>uv</cite> a
try and ask yourself if you would consider pointing people towards it.  I
think that this is our best shot in the community at finding ourselves in
a much better position than we have ever been.</p>
<p>Have a look at the blog post that Charlie from Astral wrote about what <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging">uv
can do today</a>.
It's a true accomplishment worth celebrating and enjoying.</p>
<hr>
<p><small><p><strong>Postscriptum:</strong> there is an elephant in the room which is that Astral is a
VC funded company.  What does that mean for the future of these tools?
Here is my take on this: for the community having someone pour money into
it can create some challenges.  For the PSF and the core Python project
this is something that should be considered.  However having seen the code
and what uv is doing, even in the worst possible future this is a very
forkable and maintainable thing.  I believe that even in case Astral shuts
down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the
community would be better off than before uv existed.</p>

<p>In 2020, I built my first side project. I <em>scratched my own itch</em>, then started selling it, and since then, the project has earned me over $15,000. But a few months after releasing it, I was so tired of the maintenance that I wanted to shut it down. Here is a story about my short entrepreneurial adventure.</p>

<p>In the second part of 2020, I had some spare time. I just finished a project for a client, and I've decided to dedicate a few months to making a <a href="https://modernpythonprojects.com/">Python course</a> – just to try something new. At the same time, I became interested in using technical analysis to trade stocks. Following one of the "internet investment gurus" (yes, I know how bad it sounds), I started day-trading stocks following some "mystical knowledge" on how to leverage price formation called "harmonic patterns" to figure out when to buy or sell (look, I'm sorry, I also cringe when I write those words).</p>
<p>Like many <s>traders</s> investors, I was using <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">TradingView</a>, the most popular free platform for technical analysis. Compared to the tools offered by stock brokers at that time, TradingView was far superior with its user-friendly web interface and a plethora of tools. You could even write your own scripts using an abomination of a scripting language called PineScript to implement all sorts of additional tools, graphs, and metrics for your charts.</p>
<p>But there was no script that would draw harmonic patterns for me, and after a few days of drawing them manually, I got tired and decided to automate the process. It took me a few weeks to learn the language and implement a script to automatically draw harmonic patterns on the chart. The script significantly decreased the time I had to spend searching for stocks to trade. Then, I wrote another script - one that was drawing potential future patterns.</p>
<p><em>Great! If those scripts work for me, maybe someone will pay money to use them too.</em> After all, the idea of harmonic patterns wasn't new – the earliest harmonic pattern, the "Gartley Pattern", was first described in 1935. There are books, articles, and videos on this topic, so for sure, I wasn't the only one using them.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, TradingView supports selling access to scripts, although in a slightly convoluted way. With the most expensive subscription, if you publish your script with "invite only" access, you can control which users can use it. So, I bought that subscription and created a landing page connected to Gumroad to accept payments for monthly and yearly subscriptions.</p>

<p>Now, I needed to find a way to tell TradingView's users about my scripts, as those "invite only" scripts are not easy to find. TradingView doesn't promote them in the search results; instead, it prioritizes free-to-use scripts with publicly available source code. And even if someone found my scripts or my website, I needed to convince them that my scripts are useful and do what they are supposed to do. Even though I offered a 14-day money-back guarantee on any subscription, people were reluctant to give their credit card details on some random website.</p>
<p>So, I've created a couple of smaller scripts by reusing large chunks of code from the existing scripts. Their source code was still hidden, but people could use the scripts for free - with limited functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>you could find only some types of price formations</li>
<li>there was a limit to how many past days you could check</li>
<li>there were no automatic notifications when a new pattern appeared</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, people liked them and started using them. When they asked about missing features like the notifications or detecting more patterns, I directed them to the paid scripts.</p>
<p>Then, I published some "ideas" on TradingView - screenshots of popular stocks with drawings of the existing and potential future harmonic patterns generated with my scripts. Finally, I created a YouTube channel where I published videos showing all the features of my scripts (this was partially so I didn't have to explain over and over again how they work).</p>
<p>And I started waiting for the cash to roll in.</p>
<p>Nothing happened for the first two weeks, but then I got my first sale! Someone bought access to one of the scripts for a month. For the first time in my life, I got paid for selling something on the internet. It felt amazing! Later, they requested a refund because they didn't find the script helpful, but to this day, I clearly remember the excitement of laying on the sofa in the evening and getting an email from Gumroad saying, "Hey, someone just paid you $9 for the thing you've built".</p>

<figcaption>The first sale felt more rewarding than any other that followed, although hitting a $1,000 revenue per month was also a nice milestone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Slowly, more people started using my free scripts, and some also bought the paid ones. To strike while the iron was still hot, I posted a message saying that anyone interested can leave a comment under the paid scripts, and I will give them a free 1-week trial. So people started doing that, and each time, I would log in to TradingView and manually grant them access for a week. Some of those trials turned into paid subscriptions, but most didn't. Slowly but steadily, the number of subscribers started increasing.</p>

<p>As more people used my scripts, I started getting more emails with questions and requests for new features. Many of the emails contained requests for free access to the scripts. Others had very basic questions, answers to which were given in the description of each script.</p>
<p>Some people wanted to buy the source code:

<p>Quite a few folks were asking for some "hot tips" on how to trade <em>something</em> or if that <em>something</em> was going to go up or down (almost always, this <em>something</em> was cryptocurrencies or forex).

<p>Even worse, sometimes such requests were accompanied by a backstory like "I'm a poor student and want to make some money" or "I've lost some money trading, but your script looks very cool, and I will use it to make money back". Why on earth would you bet your money on some random tool you don't even understand? And then ask some random stranger on the internet for financial advice?! This was sad. I built a tool for people who knew what harmonic patterns were. People who had an investment strategy and only needed a tool to automate the drawing of the charts that they would normally draw by hand. Not some gung-ho <em>investors</em> whose entire investment strategy consists of "this random script I found five minutes ago says that stock X will go up, so I buy."</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would get a job offer. Yay! For writing PineScript for a living. Nay!</p>

<h3 id="disputes" tabindex="-1">Disputes </h3>
<p>Sometimes, people would open a "dispute". A dispute means someone complained to PayPal that their credit card was wrongfully charged and then it's up to PayPal to decide if they are right (and refund them the full amount of money + charge me additional $20 for "chargeback fees") or if they are not (then I get to keep the payment).</p>
<p>In general, I try to be as accommodating to customers as possible. I'm selling software, so unlike with a physical product, I have unlimited stock of my products; producing new copies costs me nothing, and I don't have costs related to handling shipments or returns. So if someone writes to me and asks, "Hey, I forgot to cancel my subscription, and it renewed for another month", or "It's past the 14-day money-back guarantee, but it turns out that the script is not useful for me", I give them their money back. I want to be nice to people. I started selling those tools to help others. I don't want to charge them for a product they don't like.</p>
<p>But I also don't want people to open disputes. If you have too many disputes, you risk that PayPal will freeze your account.</p>
<p>Sometimes, being nice to people is not enough. Especially if you don't get a chance to show your goodwill because you're sleeping. My first dispute came from a customer who sent me a message in the middle of the night asking how to cancel their subscription and, half an hour later, proceeded to open a dispute. Even though all they had to do was check the emails from Gumroad that contained a link to manage their subscription. And those are short emails with a few lines of text, so it's not that the link is hidden somewhere - at least other people who wanted to cancel their subscription managed to find it. Or they could at least send me an email without opening a dispute right away.</p>
<p>Luckily, after I explained that I could (and wanted to) refund their payment, provided they closed the dispute first, the customer cooperated with me. So we closed the dispute, and shortly afterwards, they got their money back.</p>
<p>A few more disputes happened throughout the years but were less thrilling. Usually, someone would open a dispute through PayPal, not answer my messages (or PayPal's), and then PayPal would dismiss that dispute as unfounded.</p>
<h3 id="and-yes-fraud" tabindex="-1">And yes, fraud </h3>
<p>Being polite and accommodating will take you a long way and make your online interactions much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>It also means that, at some point, someone will try to take advantage of you.</p>
<p>For me, it happened three times. Most of the time, someone tried using a stolen credit card, but Gumroad caught that and cancelled the payment. But the first time a fraud happened, it caught me a bit off guard. I don't have many screenshots left because that person deleted their TradingView account, but here's how it went.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Scammer (that's not his real name 😉) asked for free access to the script. That's not uncommon - sometimes, people send me requests like that. When I kindly but firmly denied his request, he tried to pay, but his payment was declined with a message saying he should contact Gumroad. Again, this didn't sound like a red flag, more like a technical issue. Eventually, I got a confirmation email that he had paid for the subscription.</p>
<p>Two months later, a "sale has been disputed" email dropped. The dispute was initiated by Mr. Scammer. I asked him why he initiated the dispute because he never mentioned wanting to cancel his subscription or getting a refund. This is when things started to be very fishy:</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-250.webp 250w, https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-473.webp 473w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-250.jpeg 250w, https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-473.jpeg 473w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><img alt="Screenshot of me asking the scammer about the dispute" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://switowski.com/img/NrBw1iXww8-250.jpeg" width="473" height="400"></picture></p>
<p>Weird grammar errors were not a red flag. They are common in emails I get from existing and potential customers, so it doesn't automatically mean an email is a scam. But a story of your wife controlling the finances and you forgetting to tell her about buying a script for TradingView, which made her open a dispute? That's even weirder than the "I'm a student who can't afford $15, but I <em>really</em> need this script for my day-trading" emails I sometimes get.</p>
<p>While waiting for the dispute to be resolved, Mr. Scammer tried to buy the subscription one more time, this time with less success:
<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-250.webp 250w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-600.webp 600w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-920.webp 920w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-1228.webp 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-250.jpeg 250w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-600.jpeg 600w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-920.jpeg 920w, https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-1228.jpeg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) calc(100vw - 32px), (max-width: 767px) 608px, (max-width: 960px) calc(100vw - 40px), 920px"><img alt="Email about fraud attempt from Mr. Scammer" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://switowski.com/img/vlwB-CFoFG-250.jpeg" width="1228" height="1065"></picture></p>
<p>So, was his "wife" not only controlling the finances but also using stolen credit cards? I wrote him that he's permanently banned from buying any scripts from me, and the next time he tries, I will immediately revoke his access. That stopped any further attempts.</p>
<p>That was the most interesting case of fraud. Usually, when people got caught, they ignored my messages instead of coming up with a creative story:

<h3 id="burn-out" tabindex="-1">Burn out </h3>
<p>Answering emails and checking TradingView comments to give out trial access took a bit of time every day. Not much, but I tried to answer at least every day. It was a minor annoyance when I wasn't working full-time. But when I had to do this after a full day of work, and I got yet another email asking to add some <em>magical</em> method for determining take profit levels that was invented by a crypto-trading YouTuber with 50 followers<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, I had enough.</p>
<p>The worst part was that after a few months, I wasn't even using those scripts anymore. I had fun day trading when I wasn't working full-time. It was a nice break from recording videos and a motivation to learn about financial markets. But when a new contract started, I stopped day trading due to the lack of time.</p>
<p>But I still had existing customers that I needed to take care of and potential new customers asking me all sorts of questions. I was growing tired of maintaining this project. Sometimes, I would spend an hour answering many detailed questions from a potential customer only to never hear back from them. At times, someone would leave a 1-star review on Gumroad because I didn't want to add some weird functionality they requested. On days like that, I wanted to close down this project, refund the money to the existing clients, and delete my TradingView account.</p>
<p>Still, the project was bringing in a bit of money every month. I didn't want to kill the goose that laid tiny golden eggs. So, I've decided that I'm going to sell my "goose".</p>
<h2 id="selling-my-project-well-trying-to" tabindex="-1">Selling my project. Well, trying to... </h2>
<p>I looked for platforms where I could list my project for sale. I found a few and decided to submit an ad to <a href="https://indiemaker.co/">IndieMaker</a> and <a href="https://transferslot.com/">Transferslot</a> (which looked much more active three years ago). I prepared a detailed description of the project and shared details like the number of views on my YouTube channel, unique visitors to the website, the number of followers and subscribers on various platforms, and, of course, the revenue. I even shared some ideas on how to move this project forward. For example, getting one of the free scripts promoted in the weekly TradingView newsletter could accelerate the sales of paid scripts.</p>
<p>Then, following some random advice on the internet, I came up with a number to ask for that was around 5x the revenue from last year. I then sent my ad for publication.</p>
<p>IndieMaker published my ad, and shortly after, I received an inquiry from a potential buyer. But after answering questions about the Monthly Recurring Revenue growth and what assets come with the project, there was no follow-up. I got more messages later, but those were just spam ("Hey, I'm interested in your project, send us a list of your inventory"). Transferslot never published my ad. I think the website was already abandoned when I submitted it.</p>
<p>If you have any experience selling projects online (and if you don't, <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/selling_software_business">this article</a> from Patrick McKenzie is the best way to understand how it works), you're probably shaking your head by now. People buying software businesses look for <strong>simple, low-risk, boring-tech projects</strong> with a proven track record of stable or increasing profits. No one wants to buy a project written in an esoteric language (PineScript) running on a proprietary platform (TradingView) that targets a very specific niche of traders.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks with no more replies, I had to decide what to do next. I could submit my ad to bigger platforms like <a href="https://flippa.com/">Flippa</a> and pay to have it listed there. But I felt that this project was so niche that I wouldn't find a potential buyer on other platforms either. Especially a potential buyer who knew the PineScript language necessary to maintain and improve the scripts' source code.</p>
<p>While waiting for more bids from potential buyers, I started thinking about what I could do to ease the burden of this project. I'm an engineer, goddamit! We're not meant to click buttons in the browser or send the same email over and over again!</p>
<h2 id="turning-the-autopilot-on" tabindex="-1">Turning the autopilot on </h2>
<p>I checked my options and decided to automate the following parts of my work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gumroad payment should automatically grant access to the script on TradingView and send a "welcome" email. This would cover the most time-critical part of my work, so I didn't have to start my day from logging in to TradingView and granting access to people who bought subscriptions during the night.</li>
<li>A chatbot to manage subscriptions so that I could do all the manual work (removing access from people who cancelled subscriptions, extending trial access, etc.) with simple commands from my phone without logging in to TradingView.</li>
<li>Finally, I could create an online form where people could request trial access by leaving their TradingView username. This form would then trigger a Python script granting them one week's access to the selected TradingView script.</li>
</ul>
<p>I implemented all those features using <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a> to connect various services together - webhooks, a Telegram bot, Python scripts, sending emails, etc. I will write a separate article describing this setup's technical details.</p>
<p>Once I had the automation in place, users could request free trial access through an online form or buy a subscription on Gumroad, and everything would be handled automatically. From time to time, when they cancelled their subscription, I had to send a short message to my Telegram bot to set an expiration date for their access.</p>
<p>The hardest part was to stop caring so much about this project and disconnect myself. I like helping people. That's why I became a programmer - to build things that help me or help others. When I get an email, I try to answer it as best as I can. Years of working with clients taught me to explain things in a simple and easy-to-understand way. So, I spent hours patiently answering questions from potential customers only to never hear back from them. And even though I posted a link to the form where people could request trial access, plenty of folks didn't bother reading the description and kept commenting or sending me messages requesting trials.</p>
<p>This had to stop. I started by checking TradingView messages only on the weekends and granting trial access in bulk. For every comment about trial access, I replied "I gave you access now, but it would have been faster if you used the form I posted", hoping that others would see my reply and use the form next time. I still paid special attention to my existing clients and answered their emails every evening. But if someone was not an existing client, I would only respond to their questions on weekends. Eventually, I stopped checking the TradingView comments or messages. If people really wanted a trial, they would eventually read the two-sentence instruction, click the link, and fill in the form.</p>
<p>Did this affect my sales significantly? I don't think so. Most of the people asking basic questions would never convert to paying customers anyway. They were window shopping. They found a script that seemed to predict price changes, and they wanted to know how to make money with it. And the theory behind how it works and why it's supposed to work? Nah, they didn't care. They had ten more random scripts to test out today.</p>
<p>Did disconnecting from my project affect my sanity? Oh, hell yes! The project went on autopilot, and it no longer felt like a dreaded chore when I was checking my emails or logging in to my TradingView account. It lost a lot of traction because I stopped updating it, so people think it's not useful anymore (even though it does its job as well as it did a few years ago). Its revenue declined in the past years. But I don't care. I'm happy again.</p>
<p>What's next for this project? I guess I will keep running it until I decide that including it in my monthly accounting is not worth the effort, which is when I will shut it down. But for now, the $200 I get every month with almost no work is a nice passive income.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-ve-learned" tabindex="-1">Things I've learned </h2>
<h3 id="don-t-let-a-side-project-burn-you-out" tabindex="-1">Don't let a side project burn you out </h3>
<p>The dreaded truth that most programmers learn the hard way is that releasing a product is just the beginning. Once it's out there, you have to maintain it: fix bugs, implement new features, deal with disputes or frauds, and answer a LOT of emails (often from curious window shoppers who never convert to paying customers).</p>
<p>This maintenance is easier if you have more products and you do support in bulk. Or if your project can replace your full-time job and maintaining it is the only thing you do during the day. But if you do this on top of your regular job, it's a terrible time sink. You need to set some boundaries. Otherwise, working on your project will take all your available time.</p>
<p>Working on a side project is much more fun if you're also one of its users and genuinely want to keep improving it. It's incredibly smooth if you love your project, and the perspective of working on it full-time sounds like a dream job. And accordingly, it's much harder to support a project when you move on to doing something else and you're no longer interested in maintaining it, but you still have existing customers you need to keep happy.</p>
<p>If your side project is not a source of genuine joy and you have other priorities, it's important to set some boundaries. I've decided to focus my support only on the paying customers. I also stopped adding new features and told myself that unless my scripts break, I'm not touching the code. Even though I still had a list of additional improvements I wanted to make one day, I deleted that list. I already had paying customers, which means people find value in what I've built. Sure, I can add new features to attract new customers. But that means even more coding and maintenance for a <em>chance</em> to attract new customers.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-merchant-of-record" tabindex="-1">Use a merchant of record </h3>
<p>If you're planning to sell products globally, consider using a "merchant of record" like Gumroad or Paddle. This way, you won't have to figure out how much tax to charge for each country (basically, you only sell to Gumroad, and they resell your product to the final customer). Figuring out taxes was the last thing I wanted to do when selling my products. I went with Gumroad, which - at the time of writing - charges a 10% fee, plus around 3% of PayPal/Stripe fees on top of that.</p>
<p>There might be cheaper options, so do your research before choosing one. Once you get some recurring payments rolling in, you can't easily move your existing customers to a different company. When the Gumroad fees increased throughout the years, I always thought that migrating to another service was too much of a hassle, so that's why I'm still using Gumroad.</p>
<h3 id="selling-stuff-to-customers-is-hard" tabindex="-1">Selling stuff to customers is hard </h3>
<p>I had this one guy where the conversation looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hey, amazing script, I rated it 5 stars! Can you implement the take profit levels for me?</li>
<li>I'm sorry, but I can't. The original methodology doesn't specify exact take profit levels. It also doesn't make sense because take profits should be manually determined, for example, based on support or resistance levels visible on the chart. Different people will use different take profit levels based on their risk appetite.</li>
<li>Ok, but can you please put them for me? I follow this [insert some YouTube crypto day-trader], and he uses [some very specific take profit levels]. I would like the script to draw them for me.</li>
<li>Look, I can't do this. Those take profit levels are very specific to your trading system. They won't work for most other people, but they will slow down the script for everyone.</li>
<li>Ok, bro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>He cancelled his subscription a few days later and lowered his 5-star review to 2 stars.</p>
<p>Business-to-consumer (B2C) is difficult (not that business-to-business is much easier - it has a different set of challenges). But this doesn't mean that B2C is not worth pursuing. There are many people who did great selling to customers. One of the most well-known is Pieter Levels (<a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a>), creator of projects like NomadList, RemoteOK, and, more recently, PhotoAI. According to his Twitter profile stats, he makes an astonishing $200k Monthly Recurring Revenue from his projects. But B2C, while easier to get into than establishing a relationship with a company in a B2B business model, means that you will need many more customers to have the revenue levels that B2B can bring. And more customers mean more work.</p>
<h3 id="be-nice" tabindex="-1">Be nice </h3>
<p>Try to be nice to people. I mean, being nice to people in general will make the world a better place. But when dealing with customers, never assume they do something in bad faith. Sure, some folks will try to take advantage of you. But many "problems" are just a matter of misunderstanding. People will request a chargeback because they think it's the only way to get a refund for a subscription they forgot about. If someone asks me for a refund, then no matter what's the reason, I give them their money back and wish them good luck with their investments. Fighting disgruntled customers over $20 is not a good way to spend time.</p>
<p>If you're nice to people, they are more likely to use and recommend your products. One of the reasons why Amazon got so popular early in the days was because of its extraordinary customer support. Ten years ago, when my Kindle stopped turning on (which might or might not have been caused by accidental yet excessive force applied to it), Amazon's support said "no worries, we'll send you a new one for free". Someone would send me a free product instead of requesting to prove that it broke by itself? This blew me away! Especially since I was living in Poland, where the strong post-communism roots mean that if a seller is not mean to you, then this already counts as them being nice.😉</p>
<p>So, I wanted to do the same with my customers. I tried to accommodate their needs, write detailed explanations to their questions, and generously issue refunds or even discounts when requested. When someone complained that something didn't work because it didn't work the way <em>they</em> wanted, I suggested alternative scripts and offered refunds. And that paid back. I received a lot of nice messages from customers, and even though I was getting tired of supporting my project, getting positive feedback from time to time kept me going for all those years.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that's the story of my first side project. It was fun at the beginning, frustrating in the middle, and now it's mostly a passive income that will eventually dry up.</p>
<p>Was it worth the money? Not really. Spending equal time working for a client would probably earn me more. But the experience I gained from this side project will be invaluable when I build the next one.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the next article, where I describe the technical setup I used to automate most of this project.</p>

<p dir="auto"><b> ✍️ A Handwriting Synthesizer by abusing <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Harfbuzz WASM Shaper</a>.</b></p>
<p dir="auto"><b> 🔗 Check more stupid stuff at <a href="https://github.com/hsfzxjy/Harfbuzz-WASM-Fantasy">Harfbuzz-WASM-Fantasy</a>.</b></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">During the hype of <a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a> months ago, I was speculating the potential of WASM shaper for even crazier purpose, one that fitter to a font shaper's duty -- to synthesize font at runtime. This project as proof-of-concept implements a synthesizer that generates and rasterizes handwriting-style font, backed by <a href="https://github.com/X-rayLaser/pytorch-handwriting-synthesis-toolkit/blob/main/my-app/synthesis_network_52.onnx">a super-lightweight RNN model</a> (~14MiB).</p>
<p dir="auto">The project must be run in an application linked against <code>libharfbuzz</code> with the experimental WASM shaper enabled, which does not hold for any products currently. Considering that it's not easy to build such a library from scratch, I prebuilt a Docker image <code>hsfzxjy/harfbuzz-wasm-handwriting-synthesis</code> which contains both the TTF file and a modified version of <code>gedit</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Usage</strong> You may try out this project with the following steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>On a Linux system with X11 (WSL is fine), run <code>GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/hsfzxjy/handwriter.ttf</code>;</li>
<li>In directory <code>handwriter.ttf</code>, run <code>make run</code>, which fetches Docker image <code>hsfzxjy/harfbuzz-wasm-handwriting-synthesis</code> and starts the <code>gedit</code> application inside;</li>
<li>Start typing in the pop-up gedit window. Each line should prefixed by <code>#</code> to trigger the shaper, e.g., typing <code>#hello world</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Some strokes might look cursed due to the limitation of the model, appending a space <code> </code> should make it better.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Algorithm</h3><a id="user-content-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink: Algorithm" href="#algorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The project follows Alex Graves's paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850" rel="nofollow">Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks</a> and adopts an RNN model for handwriting synthesis. Shortly, the generation process undergoes multiple steps to produce a series of strokes given the input text. At each step the model predicts the next pen position given the current one. Afterwards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Bresenham's line algorithm</a> rasterizes the strokes into pixel locations, which are set as the offsets for an array of "black-box" glyphs.</p>
<p dir="auto">I've tried some more recent models, but their runtime latency is unaffordable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h3><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The final TTF file is highly optimized, reaching the speed of 0.08 sec/character on Intel Ultra 125H. Each text run's generation time is proportional to the text length.</p>
<p dir="auto">The journey to perfect optimization is interesting, which I shall introduce in blog posts later. Some important notes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/robertknight/rten">rten</a> as inference backend to make sure neural ops are executed with SIMD instructions.</li>
<li>Pre-transpose the RHS of MatMul to make them col-major, improving the performance by ~15%.</li>
<li>To run modules containing SIMD instructions, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">wasm-micro-runtime</a> should be compiled with <code>-DWAMR_BUILD_SIMD=1</code> and WASM file must be AOT-compiled by <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/tree/main/wamr-compiler">wamrc</a>.</li>
<li>Enable specific optimization in <code>wamrc</code> (<code>--opt-level=3</code>, <code>--enable-segue=i32.load,f32.load,i32.store,f32.store</code> and <code>--enable-tail-call</code>), improving the performance by ~55%.</li>
