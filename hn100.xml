</div>
<div>
    <p>Until November 1, 2023, Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, and Adobe Stock paid subscribers won't be subject to generative credit limits. Starting November 1, 2023, credit limits will apply.<br>

            <p>Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that enhances creativity by producing amazing results from simple text prompts. Generative AI features powered by Firefly are now available in our core creative tools and the standalone Firefly web app. We’re starting with images, text effects, and vectors, with Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Adobe Photoshop, Text to Image in Adobe Firefly, Generative Recolor in Adobe Illustrator, Text Effects in Adobe Express, and more. Next, we plan to bring generative AI powered by Firefly to 3D, animation, and video. Each groundbreaking generative AI feature unlocks new creative possibilities, empowering users to play, experiment, dream, and create the extraordinary.</p>
<p>Since generating content with AI models requires significant computational resources, we have updated our plans to include a monthly allocation of “generative credits.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Creative Cloud and Adobe Stock paid subscriptions include a plan-specific number of monthly generative AI creations of vector graphics or standard-resolution images* powered by Adobe Firefly. After the plan-specific number of generative credits is reached, you can keep taking generative AI actions, but your use of generative AI features may be slower.</li>
<li>Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly paid plans also include a plan-specific number of monthly generative AI creations of vector graphics or standard-resolution images* powered by Adobe Firefly. After the plan-specific number of generative credits is reached, you'll be able to take two generative AI actions to create vector graphics or standard-resolution images per day until your credits reset the next month.</li>
<li>Creative Cloud, Adobe Firefly, and Adobe Express free plans receive a plan-specific number of monthly generative AI creations of vector graphics or standard resolution images* powered by Adobe Firefly. After the plan-specific number of generative credits is reached, you can upgrade to a paid plan to continue creating assets with features powered by Firefly or wait until credits reset the next month.</li>

            <p>We want you to play, experiment, dream, and create the extraordinary using the new Adobe Firefly generative AI technology in our apps. Each groundbreaking feature unlocks new creative possibilities, from Text to Image in Adobe Firefly to Generative Fill in Adobe Photoshop, Text Effects in Adobe Express, and so much more.</p>
<p>Since generating content with AI models requires significant computational resources, we have updated our plans to include a monthly allocation of generative credits that provide priority processing of generative AI content across features powered by Firefly in the applications to which users are entitled. The number of monthly generative credits each user receives depends on&nbsp;<span>their subscription. The consumption of generative credits depends on the generated output's computational cost and the value of the generative AI feature used.<br>

            <p>No, Adobe Stock credits can't be used to generate content using Firefly-powered features. Only generative credits are used to generate content using Firefly-powered features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Java 21 will be released on September 19, 2023, supporting record patterns in switch blocks and expressions. Such syntax is monumental (At least, in Java land). It marks the point where Java could be considered to properly support functional programming patterns in ways similar to Kotlin, Rust, or C#. And it marks the first point where I can say, as a Kotlin developer, that I feel jealous.</p>

<p>There are a few notable releases here.</p>
<p>Java 14 stabilised switch expressions, 16 records and <code>instanceof</code> pattern matching, 17 sealed classes, and now, 21 will stabilise record patterns and switch pattern matching.</p>
<p>This set of changes allows Java to express one of the foundations of functional programming that the language never could before - Algebraic data types, along with idiomatic ways of using them.</p>
<p>Algebraic data types are a concept born from <em>Type theory</em>, which is a branch of Set theory that focuses specifically on questions like “Is an <em>Apple</em> a <em>Fruit</em>?” and other such whimsical conundrums math teachers like to pose to hapless students the world over.</p>

</h2><p>Type theory has quite a lot of meat to it, and most of it isn’t relevant to this article.</p>
<p>So, instead of explaining type theory, I will talk about a few specific kinds of types that it would be useful to know about.</p>
<h3 id="the-bottom-or-empty-type-">The Bottom, or Empty Type (<code>⊥</code>)
<span>
    <a href="#the-bottom-or-empty-type-">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h3><p>This type describes the set of all values which <em>can’t be computed</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This set is usually empty for any normal programming language (Ø).</p>
<p>No object can be cast to bottom since it is an empty set.</p>
<p>An example of such a type is Kotlin’s <code>Nothing</code>. It is considered an error for an instance of <code>Nothing</code> to exist. The way Kotlin prevents <code>Nothing</code> from being instantiated is <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/7a7d392b3470b38d42f80c896b7270678d0f95c3/core/builtins/native/kotlin/Nothing.kt#L23">by setting its constructor to be private</a>.</p>
<p>The Java version of this type is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Void.html"><code>Void</code></a>, the wrapper class for the <code>void</code> primitive type. It is, again, impossible to construct a <code>Void</code> instance because its constructor is private. However, <code>Void</code> cannot be considered a true bottom type because a <code>Void</code> variable can still hold <code>null</code>, which means it is technically a unit type<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (more on that below). In that sense, the primitive <code>void</code> does better. There’s absolutely no way to use it as a variable type, so you can’t even have an empty <code>void</code> variable.</p>

</h3><p>This type represents every value of every type - the universal set of values, <code>U</code>. In Kotlin, this type is named <code>Any</code>. And it may be tempting to think <code>Object</code> (the Java equivalent of <code>Any</code>) is a top type, except for the fact that primitives exist. Primitives are wholly separate from Java’s object model, and interact with objects in rather non-standard ways. Because of this, Java technically does not have a top type the way other languages do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <code>C</code> does as it do and overloads <code>void</code> by using <code>void *</code> to represent a pointer that can refer to a value of any type instead. How droll!</p>
<p>Every object can be cast to top since <code>U</code> contains every value that exists.</p>
<p>There isn’t much to say about top other than that a variable of this type can hold anything. Including a value of the bottom type. Good luck finding that value, though.</p>

</h3><p>This type has only one value. There is only one instance of that one value, and it is impossible to create more of it.</p>
<p>Java’s <code>void</code> primitive technically works like this. When a method returns <code>void</code>, you can treat it as if it implicitly returns the sole instance of the <code>void</code> type under the hood (This is <em>not</em> how the JVM handles <code>void</code>). Java deviates from the theoretical norm in that <code>void</code> can never be passed into a method as a parameter.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        The truth is, Java just mashes the bottom and the unit types together to give us <code>void</code>.
    </p>
</div>
<p>You can technically simulate the unit type in Java by declaring a new class that is final and has no fields other than a static instance value. You would then be able to treat that instance as the sole unit type value.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how Kotlin defines its own <code>Unit</code>. If you navigate to the definition of <code>Unit</code>, you’ll see how simply it is defined; <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/7a7d392b3470b38d42f80c896b7270678d0f95c3/core/builtins/src/kotlin/Unit.kt#L22">it’s just an <code>object</code></a>!</p>
<p>Unlike Java, Kotlin allows you to use <code>Unit</code> anywhere, including as a parameter to a method. The following snippet is thus legal:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="kotlin"><span><span><span>fun</span> <span>identity</span>(param1: Unit): Unit = param1
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>val</span> result = identity(param1 = Unit) <span>// just returns the Unit instance again.

</h3><p>We’re now in familiar territory.</p>
<p>The boolean type has two valid values, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> (Or whatever other names you want to use). Indeed, you don’t even need to use your language’s native boolean type to represent this type; you can do just as well by using a nullable instance of a unit type. If the variable is non-null, it’s <code>true</code>, and if it is <code>null</code>, <code>false</code>. This is of course, a useless waste of time fit only for those interested in obfuscating their source code.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve looked at some basic examples of “rules” used to define types in type theory. Let’s move onto the heart of the matter and discuss sum and product types, and how Java 21 allows us to represent them via records and sealed classes.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-type">The Product type

</span>
</h3><p>Product types are composed of two or more constituent types. In general, a product type is a list of two or more types grouped together. A product type’s <em>arity</em>, or <em>degree</em>, is the number of constituent types within it.</p>
<p>If you’d like a nice, concrete example of a product type, look no further than the humble C <code>struct</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>struct</span> some_type {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> val1; <span>// Type 1
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>char</span> <span>*</span>val2; <span>// Type 2
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>double</span> val3; <span>// Type 3
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>int</span> val4; <span>// Type 4
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the struct above, <code>some_type</code> is a product type composed of four different types: <code>int</code>, <code>char *</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>int</code> again. Notice that we’re repeating <code>int</code> here. How do we figure out which <code>int</code> is which when we perform operations on <code>some_type</code>? This may seem obvious, but it’s a problem in math, because you have to construct all the building blocks and concepts you use from scratch!</p>
<p>In this case, we already have the tools to make this work. We associate each type with the name given to it in the struct (Duh). Mathematically speaking, a product type is not merely a list of types but a list of <em>ordered pairs</em>, where each ordered pair consists of a type and a name associated with that type.</p>
<p>For example, we can represent the first value of <code>some_type</code> as the ordered pair <code>(int, "val1")</code>. That way, it’s impossible to mix up the two <code>int</code> components; they’ve got different names!</p>

</h4><p>In set theory, the word product usually refers to the <em>Cartesian</em> product of two sets.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        The Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs made from every possible combination of every element from both sets.
    </p>
</div>
<p>You can use set theory notation to express the product of two types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> as <code>C = A × B</code>. This product operation is not commutative; <code>A × B</code> is <em>not</em> the same as <code>B × A</code>. If you think about it for a bit, you’ll see why: you’d be switching around the order of the declared components! The example I just talked about only uses two component types: <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. How would we represent <code>some_type</code>, for example? The answer is to chain multiple product operations together, like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>some_type = int × char* × double × int
</code></pre><p>The set of values within a product type could be expressed like this (Please leave your complaints about my (ab)use of math symbols in the comments):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>C = A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}
</code></pre><p>You could represent the set of all values in <code>some_type</code> like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>some_type = { (val1, val2, val3, val4) | val1 ∈ int, val2 ∈ char*, val3 ∈ double, val4 ∈ int }

</h4><p>When Java 16 was released, the record class feature was stabilised. Record classes are a great example of what a product type is. All fields are final; you can’t inherit from these classes either. All of a record’s state is set at the time of its construction<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and once a record is created, that’s how it’ll look for the rest of its lifetime, all 200 milliseconds of it.</p>
<p>This contrasts with normal Java classes, which are all over the place. You can have public and private state, there’s hidden state via inheritance that you don’t think about until it pops up like some haunted animatronic on caffeine to jumpscare you with weird bugs, and you can have mutable fields, static fields, and all sorts of other distracting things that yadda yadda yadda… (<em>you get the idea</em>).</p>
<p>The problem with normal Java types is that it is impossible to generalise what a type’s components are. And that matters when all you want is to efficiently process data; you have to navigate a maze of potentially nonstandard getters to even get at your data in the first place, let alone munge it.</p>
<p>Now, Java never did support destructuring like JavaScript or Rust do. But even if Java had supported it, the spec would still probably restrict that feature to records. Let’s ask ourselves a few questions to better understand why.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        Destructuring is a feature certain languages (very famously, JavaScript) have which allows you to take a complex value, and, to borrow a PHPism, <em><strong>EXPLODE</strong></em> it into its components as a list of completely independent variables. Read more about this feature <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">here</a>.

</h4><p>A Java class’s internal state includes all its fields, both public and private. However, allowing the extraction of private fields by destructuring doesn’t seem like a good idea; we all know how mad old Uncle Bob gets about breaking encapsulation. So fine, we have to exclude private state.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-public-state-then">What about public state, then?

    </a>
</span>
</h4><p>Let’s first think about this: How do Java objects expose public state? Sure, you can define a field as public, and if you want to prevent undue modification, make the field final. But there is another extremely common approach to this as well. Most Java objects set every field to be private and make all fields accessible only through accessor methods for reading and writing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no <em>language enforced</em> conventions for defining accessors; you could give the getter for <code>foo</code> the name <code>getBar</code>, and it’ll still work fine, except for the fact that it would confuse anybody trying to access <code>bar</code> and not `foo'.</p>
<p>Sure, you can use frameworks like Lombok to take away the complexity and uncertainty by slapping a few annotations on your POJO classes, but that doesn’t change the underlying fact that normal classes in Java are <em>very difficult to statically reason about</em> due to how many “variables” contribute to defining the state of a class.</p>
<p>I suspect this is one of the problems that prevented the Java Language Specification authors from adding pattern matching to all classes right off the bat.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>To fix this, they created records, an entirely different class hierarchy. There is already a precedent; Java 5 introduced enums, which inherit from <code>java.lang.Enum</code>. Similarly, all records inherit from <code>java.lang.Record</code>.</p>
<h4 id="so-how-do-records-do-what-normal-classes-dont">So how do records do what normal classes don’t?

    </a>
</span>
</h4><p>Records solve this problem by restricting how they can be defined and rigidly defining the set of properties they can have.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Records are implicitly final classes and can’t be inherited from.
<ul>
<li>No more illegitimate child classes birthed of a tryst with an entirely different concubine library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Records cannot extend any class but <code>java.lang.Record</code>.
<ul>
<li>This avoids the pitfall of inherited state polluting the record’s code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A record’s components cannot have any visibility modifiers.</li>
<li>A record’s components are always final and immutable.
<ul>
<li>This does not extend the immutability to the contents of each record component, however.</li>
<li>Only the references of a record’s components are treated as immutable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you declare a record and do not define getter methods, getters will be defined using very specific syntax.
<ul>
<li>This syntax is very regular; Java just uses the name of the field as the getter’s name.</li>
<li>For field <code>a</code>, the getter would be <code>a()</code>.</li>
<li>Java will use your definition if you manually define a getter that matches the naming conventions. Otherwise, Java will automatically create a getter method that correctly follows the conventions. The nonstandard getter won’t make much of a difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fields that back a record’s components are always implicitly private and are accessed only through getters.</li>
</ul>
<p>(There is a little more to it, but this seems like a good stopping point.)</p>
<p>These properties of records guarantee that any new language feature Java brings out that uses records such as pattern matching will always work, because the language spec itself guarantees the behaviour and structure of records.</p>

</h4><p>It’s quite a drag to have to write extremely nested code when you have a lot of conditions based on the types of your data. This problem will come into perspective when I introduce sum types further into the article.

<p>Take a look at the example below. Note that the data within <code>A</code> is a <code>Record</code> instance, and could contain <em>any</em> record type. We first try printing <code>r</code>’s contents with normal Java if statements, before doing it with switch pattern matching.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The switch block is clearly better structured than the if-else ladder above. Switch patterns are very powerful when you want to quickly and easily extract deeply nested data without waffling around with <code>instanceof</code> checks and cumbersome type casts. If you ever get a chance to work with Java 21 (May you be blessed with management that isn’t allergic to new Java versions), I’m sure you’ll appreciate this feature.</p>
<p>If you’d like to try this yourself, here’s how. Install Java 21 (There’s a handy <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jdk21-jetbrains-bin"><code>jdk21-jetbrains-bin</code></a> package available in the AUR if anybody wants to immediately try it. I use Arch, btw). Copy this code into a <code>main.java</code> and run it with:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>java --enable-preview --source <span>21</span> main.java
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This also showcases another nice new preview feature, <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445">unnamed main methods</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous example, we were able to use pattern matching to switch over different record types. Now, let’s set that aside for a second and talk about how we manage choices in Java.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a different problem. You want different colour representations such as RGB, HSL, and CMYK. Maybe just make an enum for it?</p>

<p>Now, given a <code>Color</code> instance, you’d just need to check if it is an <code>instanceof</code> your desired colour representation, and you’d be able to access data from that representation. But this implementation has a flaw. How do we restrict what a colour is in our class hierarchy? Any user of your library could create a new <code>RYB</code> class that inherits from <code>Color</code>, or from <code>RGB</code>, for example. This becomes a problem when your library does not expect any new variants of <code>Color</code> to exist or if it does not expect specific <code>Color</code> variants to change their behaviour. Unless the API is designed to be extensible, creating new representations could cause crashes in the best case (So you have a chance of knowing what went wrong) or in the worst case, subtle bugs that affect code far away from the problem’s source.</p>
<p>To fix this, we could do a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make all variants <code>final</code>.
<ul>
<li>While this helps, it doesn’t preclude the creation of new variants directly from <code>Color</code>, since it’s impossible to make <code>Color</code> itself final.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that all internal logic always has a default case for unrecognised variants.
<ul>
<li>This will reduce the extensibility of the library, but if that is not a goal, it will help.</li>
<li>But this will also be a lot more error-prone; if even one part of the logic forgets to account for the bad case, there’ll be problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or, we could use sealed classes or interfaces and kill two birds with one stone.</li>

</h3><p>Java 17’s sealed classes enable design patterns based on the concept of <em>Sum types</em>. Where a product type’s range of values is the product of the value ranges of its constituent types, a sum type’s range of values is the <em>sum</em>. Well, that was pretty obvious from the name… But what does it mean for the range of values to be a sum?</p>
<p>Sum types encode that a type can be <em>any one</em> of its constituents at a single time. They are also known as tagged union types because, in type theory, they are usually represented as a type whose range of values is the union set of its components, where each component type is “tagged” with a label.</p>
<p>You could express a sum type like this if you were to use my pseudo-type-theory notation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>T = A + B + C
</code></pre><p>The set of values that are in T could be expressed with this logical predicate:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>T = { x | x ∈ A ⋃ B ⋃ C }
</code></pre><p>You may be reminded of <code>C</code>’s <code>unions</code> when you hear the term union types.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>union</span> MyUnion {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> intValue;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>double</span> doubleValue;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>char</span> charValue;
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>MyUnion</code> is composed of three component types, and <code>C</code> allows you to treat a value of <code>MyUnion</code> as a container for any of these three types:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>union</span> MyUnion myUnion;
</span></span><span><span>myUnion.intValue <span>=</span> <span>42</span>;
</span></span><span><span><span>printf</span>(<span>"Integer value: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, myUnion.intValue);
</span></span><span><span>myUnion.doubleValue <span>=</span> <span>3.14159</span>;
</span></span><span><span><span>printf</span>(<span>"Double value: %lf</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, myUnion.doubleValue);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the value of the union is overwritten in the second assignment of <code>doubleValue</code>. If you were to print <code>myUnion.intValue</code> after the second assignment, you’d see gibberish; that’s actually just the bytes of <code>doubleValue</code> cut in half and interpreted as an integer.</p>
<p>This exposes the most significant flaw <code>C</code> unions have; there’s no built-in way to know which variant is contained within a union value without external information. Thus, we need an external <em>discriminant</em> to determine what’s inside. Java’s polymorphism can do that for us with <code>instanceof</code>. But Java’s class hierarchy is too open; there’s no way to restrict the number of variants of a Java “union”.</p>
<p>What we need are <em>tagged unions</em>, which is exactly what sealed types allow us to represent. The <code>sealed</code> modifier exists to make it clear that you can’t extend a sealed class beyond the classes allowed to inherit from it. This allows the developer to control how users interact with their library’s API.</p>








<div id="colour-sealed-class">
    
    <p><span>
            
        </span> 
        <span>Listing:&nbsp;<code>Color</code>&nbsp;implemented with a sealed class</span>
    </p>

    <hr>

    
</div>
<p>Note the syntax of the sealed class <code>Color</code>. There is a <code>sealed</code> modifier and a <code>permits</code> clause with the names of all the subclasses of <code>Color</code>. <code>permits</code> is used to specify which classes get to inherit from a particular class and is used to prevent any unwanted inheritance. Note also that each implementation of <code>Color</code> is marked as <code>final</code>, so you only get the four colour representations you see here; you can’t make your own.</p>
<p>This class hierarchy is locked down. No new classes can inherit from <code>Color</code>, whether they are located in the same package or not.</p>
<p>If your class hierarchy starts with a <code>sealed</code> class, you must mark all inheritors (direct or indirect) as <code>sealed</code>, <code>non-sealed</code>, or <code>final</code>. If an inheriting class doesn’t have these modifiers, it is a compile error.</p>
<p>Here’s what each of these modifiers mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sealed</code> - The class cannot be inherited unless the inheritor’s name is mentioned after <code>permits</code>.</li>
<li><code>non-sealed</code> - The class can be inherited normally. Helpful in controlling the scope of custom behaviours.</li>
<li><code>final</code> - The class is a “leaf” in the inheritance tree; you can’t extend it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>These modifiers can be used to control exactly how the classes of an API can behave and how they are used. This avoids situations where the only thing stopping everything from exploding are rules that can only be enforced by developers agreeing to not do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Imagine we’re writing code to handle colours based on their format. We already have a nice, restricted way of ensuring there’ll be no funny business. But how would we structure the code that handles the sealed class instances?</p>
<p>Earlier Java versions wouldn’t give us much of a choice; the best we can manage is an if-else ladder:</p>

</span></span><span><span><span>match</span> color {
</span></span><span><span>  Color::<span>RGB</span>(red, green, blue) <span>=&gt;</span> {

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that these colour values are being destructured in the <code>match</code> block above. How would we get that done with sealed classes? Switch pattern matching with destructuring only works on records, and records can’t inherit from any class but <code>Record</code>…</p>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        Java 21 allows you to catch the <code>null</code> case within <code>switch</code> blocks and expressions now, so you don’t need to precheck for <code>null</code> before you get to a switch.
    </p>
</div>
<p>You may notice we aren’t using a default case here. Java would have normally raised an error stating that all cases haven’t been covered. However, because <code>Color</code> is a sealed class, Java can tell that every case has been handled.</p>

</h3><p>Did I mention we’ve got guard clauses? Guard clauses! You can attach additional conditions to switch arms that have to be true for the arm to be executed! Guard clauses allow the succinct expression of more complex conditions within switch statements and expressions. No more extremely nested <code>if</code> conditions in your switches.</p>
<p>Consider a situation where we need to special-case RGB colours where <code>red &gt; 200</code> is true. Before, we had to put that condition inside an <code>if</code> condition within the corresponding case’s body:</p>

<p dir="auto">Through controlled breathing it is possible to regulate your body's stress reponse. This application allows you to measure and train this effect with a Polar H10 Heart Rate monitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Heart rate variability, the small changes in heart rate from beat-to-beat, is a reliable measure of stress response. Heart rate variability reflects the balance between the two sides of the autonomic nervous system: the fight-or-flight response (from the sympathetic nervous system) and the rest-and-digest response (from the parasympathetic nervous system).</p>
<p dir="auto">In any moment it is possible to restore balance to the autonomic nervous system by breathing slower and deeper. With every breath you take, you can set the pace of your breathing rate, measure your breathing control with the chest accelerometer, and see how heart rate variability responds.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/kbre93/every-breath-you-take/blob/master/img/screen_record.gif"><img src="https://github.com/kbre93/every-breath-you-take/raw/master/img/screen_record.gif" alt="" data-animated-image=""></a></p>

<li>Connect and stream from a Polar H10, acceleration and heart rate data</li>
<li>Live breathing control feedback and adjustable pace setting</li>
<li>Track breathing and heart rate oscillations in real-time</li>

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `my_project_env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python EBYT.py 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The program will automatically connect to your Polar device. For best breathing detection, ensure the Polar H10 is fitted around the widest part of the ribcage, stay seated and still while recording.</p>
<p dir="auto">Set the breathing pace with the slider (in breaths per minute), and follow the cadence as the gold circle expands and contracts. The blue circle shows your breathing control.</p>
<p dir="auto">Track each breath cycle in the top graph, and how heart rate oscillates in repsonse.</p>

  <h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h2>
<p>Anyone wanting their own X509 cert these days has free-beer alternatives
like ZeroSSL or Let’s Encrypt.</p>
<p>But, what if it’s just for internal services, some of them even cut off
from the ‘Net? And more importantly, what if you don’t wish to be bothered
with juggling the renewals every 3 months, or want that sweet wildcard
x509 cert with minimum hassle?</p>
<p>Well then… how about the age-old solution of rolling out your own root
CA? Ideally one that will be accepted without issue by major browsers,
including the ones on iOS.</p>
<p>Let’s dig in.</p>
<h2 id="background--history-lesson">Background / history lesson</h2>
<p>Way back when I was just a little bitty boy… we used to do this whole
shindig with <code>sign.sh -- Sign a SSL Certificate Request (CSR)</code> script
and a modicum of <code>openssl genrsa</code>, <code>openssl req -new -x509</code>,
<code>openssl req -new</code> elbow grease.</p>
<p>If the copyright line<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> is to be believed, that thing predates the
height of the Y2K mania.</p>
<p>And there isn’t that much wrong with it even now, save for a questionable
choice of hash functions.</p>
<p>Or so I thought, as I was running that thing with <code>default_days = 3650</code>
for the past many many years. And while that continues to work fine in
Firefox on Linux to this day<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, you’re bound to hit a brick wall when
trying to use server certificates generated that way with Apple devices<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Turns out<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>, Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102028">really doesn’t want you to use server certs that
are valid for longer than 398 days</a><sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>,
along with a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176">plethora of other restrictions</a>.
tldr: 2048bit+, SHA2 digest, CN ignored, altnames is king, keyusage=serverAuth.</p>
<p>And with that, here’s what works as of the time of writing… in Firefox
and on recent MacOS/iOS.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>These “make your own x509 root cert” guides are a dime a dozen. And if you’re
lazy, go use <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a> instead. It might
even work out of the box<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, and simply want to take the road less traveled by (because
understanding all this stuff makes all the difference), here’s the requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>a x509 cert for the certificate authority</li>
<li>a x509 cert for every internal service, or maybe just a singleton
<code>*.int.wejn.org</code><sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></li>
<li>a way to serve the CA certificate somewhere</li>
</ol>
<p>The last one is out of scope, but basically you need a static website that
spits out the PEM-encoded certificate with <code>application/x-x509-ca-cert</code>
mime type. More on that some other time.</p>
<p>Viewing from the top, I want something like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># _gen_all.sh</span>
<span>## generate CA key+cert</span>
./cacert.sh
<span>## generate host key+cert for a single host</span>
./hostcert.sh snowflake.int.wejn.org
<span>## generate wildcard host key+cert with two alt names</span>
./hostcert.sh int.wejn.org <span>'*.int.wejn.org'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>that in the end produces <code>ca.crt</code>, <code>ca.key</code>, <code>snowflake.int.wejn.org.{crt,key}</code>,
<code>int.wejn.org.{crt,key}</code> in working order<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-ca-certificate">Generating the CA certificate</h3>
<p>The certificate is a two-parter:</p>
<ol>
<li>an RSA key</li>
<li>x509 certificate with proper extensions</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what worked for me (<code>cacert.sh</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-f</span> <span>"ca.cnf"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
        </span><span>echo</span> <span>"CA already exists."</span>
        <span>exit </span>1
<span>fi

</span><span>umask </span>066

<span># Generate a CA password, because openssl (reasonably) wants to protect</span>
<span># the key material... and dump it to `ca.pass`.</span>

<p>Note: 4096 bit RSA with SHA512 (SHA2 family), with <code>TLS Web Server Authentication</code> key usage, correct <code>Subject Alternative Name</code>, and one

<p>Whether it actually works on the device I can’t show here. But it does on
mine. Swearsies.</p>
<p>Obviously the <code>ca.crt</code> needs to be imported on every device as a root CA,
and a guide explaining how to is different for each OS / browser. But having
the static website outlined above goes a long way to simplify the import
process<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>, especially on iOS. :)</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>
<p>This was my brief foray into the wonderful world of running your own root
certificate authority in 2023… one that gets accepted by both Apple devices
and Linux browsers.</p>
<p>An obvious downside of this is having to guard a bunch of secrets<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup> and
the need to rotate the host certificates yearly – because Apple says so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have I done anything fraudulent so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  You created a document which contains false, misleading, or inaccurate information, and distributed it to others.  It doesn't matter if you were explicitly told to do this, if you provided separate information explaining the deception, or if the person you gave it to understood the deception.  At the point that you created and distributed it you expressed a lie to another person.  The creation AND distribution are the key points - if it never left your procession then there's no problem.  If you didn't create it then there's no problem.  Adding your signature to something someone else created is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I take this zoom meeting, and toe the company line , am I committing fraud which I could be personally liable for? (Again, not looking for legal advice, just opinion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you use the words "fraud" and "liable" then you are explicitly asking for legal advice.  Consult an attorney. In some areas lying to some government employees could be considered criminal.</p>
<p>If we ignore legal culpability, civil or criminal liability, and just ask, "Is taking the call and maintaining the deception fraudulent?" then the answer is clearly yes.  You are not an actor, paid to play a part in a work of fiction.  You are an expert in your field paid to represent objective facts and professional opinions about a product you financially benefit from.</p>
<p>Carrying on the deception is defrauding those you convey the lie to.</p>
<p>Further, your director is setting you up to take full blame and responsibility.  If the customer buys the product, and never finds out about the fraud, then the director wins a sale and they continue to take risks for financial gain - lying will sometimes net you a sale where it otherwise wouldn't.</p>
<p>If their risk doesn't pay off and the customer discovers the deception then they merely need to state "My expert told me it was pen-tested, provided this document in answer to the customer's questions, and then took a call with the customer telling them the same thing.  All the communication I sent was misunderstood - I was never asking them to lie, I understood from their conversations with me that it was pen-tested and I was merely helping them understand how to fill out the form given what they told me in person."</p>
<p>Keep a paper trail.  Make sure to include others in the company in your communications - always cc one other person in all emails with this director.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this is fraud, how can I explain that I don't want to be a part of this to the directors? And is such an issue worth resigning over?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Send to all directors:</p>
<p>"I incorrectly filled out that document and will contact the customer to retract it.  If you'd prefer to resolve this with the customer please cc the email to me as well so I can clearly document the resolution of the error. I'm happy to meet with the customer at any point to explain the error and the current status of the software including the lack of pen-testing. I'm also happy to discuss possible timelines for pen-testing. I regret the error, and will endeavor in the future to avoid similar errors."</p>
<p>The company will always seek to protect itself, so making threats of any kind will cause you more problems.  Resigning is a reasonable course of action if the culture of the company allows for such deception in general.  If they're lying to gain customers then the chances that they'll lie to you are pretty high.  If this individual appears to be an outlier, and if, during this process of revision and reconciliation, you find others are unhappy with the deception, then it might be worth staying with the company.</p>
<p>If resigning, get a new job first, and hand in your minimum (or two weeks) notice only after you've secured another position.  Again, if they're lying to clients, then you don't want to give them opportunities to hurt you or your job prospects.</p>

            </div><p>Dutch company Touchwind has an interesting spin on the idea... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8uY79zQeak" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">waka waka</a>. It's designed around a massive single-piece rotor, sitting on the end of a pole that's draped over a big barrel, with a large floating buoy hanging beneath it.</p><p>This one huge double blade, says Touchwind, should cost around 30% as much to make as the triple-bladed arrangements on traditional turbines. It doesn't require any expensive active blade-pitch control systems, and where most standard turbines need to shut down in wind speeds above 25 or so m/sec (90 km/h / 56 mph), this one is rated for speeds as high as 70 m/sec (252 km/h / 157 mph). Less downtime equals more productive hours and more energy.</p><p>The blade is fixed to the mast at a slight upward angle. At low wind speeds, the mast tilts right over, and effectively the blade stays out of the water with the assistance of that dangling buoy. But as wind speeds pick up and the blade starts spinning fast, it develops lift, much like a helicopter's main rotor, and begins pulling the mast upright. </p><div data-align-center="">

A database is at the heart of how Let’s Encrypt manages certificate issuance. If this database isn’t performing well enough, it can cause API errors and timeouts for our subscribers. Database performance is the single most critical factor in our ability to scale while meeting service level objectives. In late 2020, we upgraded our database servers and we’ve been very happy with the results.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-are-we-doing-with-these-servers">What exactly are we doing with these servers?</h2>
<p>Our CA software, <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">Boulder</a>, uses MySQL-style schemas and queries to manage subscriber accounts and the entire certificate issuance process. It’s designed to work with a single MySQL, MariaDB, or Percona database. We currently use MariaDB, with the InnoDB database engine.</p>
<p>We run the CA against a single database in order to minimize complexity. Minimizing complexity is good for security, reliability, and reducing maintenance burden. We have a number of replicas of the database active at any given time, and we direct some read operations to replica database servers to reduce load on the primary.</p>
<p>One consequence of this design is that our database machines need to be pretty powerful. Eventually we may need to shard or break the single database into multiple databases, but hardware advancements have allowed us to avoid that so far.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-specifications">Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>The previous generation of database hardware was powerful but it was regularly being pushed to its limits. For the next generation, we wanted to more than double almost every performance metric in the same 2U form factor. In order to pull that off, we needed AMD EPYC chips and Dell’s <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/poweredge-r7525/">PowerEdge R7525</a> was ideal. Here are the specifications:</p>

<figcaption>Dell PowerEdge R7525 internals. The two silver rectangles in the middle are the CPUs. The RAM sticks, each 64GB, are above and below the CPUs. The 24x NVMe drives are in the front of the server, on the far left.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By going with AMD EPYC, we were able to get 64 physical CPU cores while keeping clock speeds high: 2.9GHz base with 3.4GHz boost. More importantly, EPYC provides 128 PCIe v4.0 lanes, which allows us to put 24 NVMe drives in a single machine. NVMe is incredibly fast (~5.7x faster than the SATA SSDs in our previous-gen database servers) because it uses PCIe instead of SATA. However, PCIe lanes are typically very limited: modern consumer chips typically have only 16 lanes, and Intel’s Xeon chips have 48. By providing 128 PCI lanes per chip (v4.0, no less), AMD EPYC has made it possible to pack large numbers of NVMe drives into a single machine. We’ll talk more about NVMe later.</p>
<h2 id="performance-impact">Performance Impact</h2>
<p>We’ll start by looking at our median time to process a request because it best reflects subscribers’ experience. Before the upgrade, we turned around the median API request in ~90 ms. The upgrade decimated that metric to ~9 ms!</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-api-latency.png" alt="API Latency"></p>
<p>We can clearly see how our old CPUs were reaching their limit. In the week before we upgraded our primary database server, its CPU usage (from /proc/stat) averaged over 90%:</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-cpu-before.png" alt="CPU Usage Before Upgrade"></p>
<p>The new AMD EPYC CPUs sit at about 25%. You can see in this graph where we promoted the new database server from replica (read-only) to primary (read/write) on September 15.</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-cpu-after.png" alt="CPU Usage After Upgrade"></p>
<p>The upgrade greatly reduced our overall database latency. The average query response time (from INFORMATION_SCHEMA) used to be ~0.45ms.</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-db-latency-before.png" alt="Database Latency Before Upgrade"></p>
<p>Queries now average <em>three times faster</em>, about 0.15ms.</p>
<p><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/2021.01.21-next-gen-db-db-latency-after.png" alt="Database Latency After Upgrade"></p>
<h2 id="openzfs-and-nvme">OpenZFS and NVMe</h2>
<p>NVMe drives are becoming increasingly popular because of their incredible performance. Up until recently, though, it was nearly impossible to get many of them in a single machine because NVMe uses PCIe lanes. Those were very limited: Intel’s Xeon processors come with just 48 PCIe v3 lanes, and a number of those are used up by the chipset and add-on cards such as network adapters and GPUs. You can’t fit many NVMe drives in the remaining lanes.</p>
<p>AMD’s latest generation of EPYC processors come with 128 PCIe lanes - more than double what Intel offers - and they’re PCIe v4! This is enough to pack a 2U server full of NVMe drives (24 in our case).</p>
<p>Once you have a server full of NVMe drives, you have to decide how to manage them. Our previous generation of database servers used hardware RAID in a RAID-10 configuration, but there is no effective hardware RAID for NVMe, so we needed another solution. One option was software RAID (Linux mdraid), but we got several recommendations for OpenZFS and decided to give it a shot. We’ve been very happy with it!</p>
<p>There wasn’t a lot of information out there about how best to set up and optimize OpenZFS for a pool of NVMe drives and a database workload, so we want to share what we learned. You can find detailed information about our setup in <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/openzfs-nvme-databases">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This database upgrade was necessary as more people rely on Let’s Encrypt for the security and privacy that TLS/SSL provides. The equipment is quite expensive and it was a sizable undertaking for our SRE team to plan and execute the transition, but we gained a lot through the process.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
We present an approach to modeling an image-space prior on scene dynamics. Our prior is learned from a collection of motion trajectories extracted from real video sequences containing natural, oscillating motion such as trees, flowers, candles, and clothes blowing in the wind. Given a single image, our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a per-pixel long-term motion representation in the Fourier domain, which we call a neural stochastic motion texture. This representation can be converted into dense motion trajectories that span an entire video. Along with an image-based rendering module, these trajectories can be used for a number of downstream applications, such as turning still images into seamlessly looping dynamic videos, or allowing users to realistically interact with objects in real pictures.

<p>
Unity had a pretty bad week.
</p>
<p>
I'm actually writing this lead on Tuesday afternoon, but feeling pretty confident that whatever happens from here on out, this much will be true.
</p>
<p>
(<em>Friday morning update: Yup.</em>)
</p>
<p>
Tuesday morning, Unity decided to introduce its new Runtime Fee, which Unity developers of a certain size will have to pay every time their game is installed on a new device after January 1, 2024.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | $0.20 – The fee per install for small developers (Unity Personal subscribers) whose games brought in $200,000 in the past year and have 200,000 lifetime installs to date.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | $0.01 – The fee per install for large developers (Unity Enterprise clients) whose games brought in $1 million in the past year and have lifetime sales of one million or more.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't sound like a lot, and if a developer just had to pay the fee each time they sold a $60 game, it wouldn't be. But there are problems because these charges are based on game installs, not sales, and Unity has not done a great job communicating what's going on here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "An install is defined as the installation and initialization of a project on an end user's device." – Unity's initial FAQ on the new fee.
</p>
<p>
We asked Unity if that would include demos, since those are distinct projects that get installed on end user devices and certainly seem to count.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "No, demos, trials, game bundles and giveaways - like the Humble Bundle - do not count as installs." – A Unity spokesperson, in an email response to use on Tuesday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Oh, phew! That could have been bad, but thankfully Unity was quick to dispel—
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "If it's early access, Beta, or a demo of the full game then yes [it will result in a Runtime Fee]. If you can get from the demo to a full game then yes. If it's not, like a single level that can't upgrade, then no." – A Unity representative in the company's official forums in <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750">a thread edited Tuesday night</a>.
</p>
<p>
What.
</p>
<p>
How about games included in streaming services? They aren't really installed on an end user's device, so they shouldn't count, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Subscription services, like Game Pass, do count as an install." – Unity's spokesperson responds to our inquiry about how streaming games would be counted for the Runtime Fee.
</p>
<p>
Bummer, but at least we got an answer I suppose, and now we know developers will be on the hook for—
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "As for Game Pass and other subscription services, [Unity Create GM Marc] Whitten said that developers… would not be on the hook, as the fees are charged to distributors, which in the Game Pass example would be Microsoft." – <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/unity-runtime-fee-policy-marc-whitten">Axios</a> adding key context for Unity's policy Tuesday evening.
</p>
<p>
That's great, but how will Unity even track this? If I buy a copy of Dear Esther Landmark Edition (made with Unity) on GOG.com, I get a DRM-free copy that does not require any online connection to play. How does Unity tell if I install the game on a hundred computers or none? Or the same computer 100 times?
</p>

</figure>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won't go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of the number of times the Runtime is distributed for a given project." – Unity's representative tells us the company definitely has a very good, very accurate process for determining how much money you need to pay it, but you're not allowed to know what it is.
</p>
<p>
Also, even if you did know how many times the Runtime was <em>distributed</em>, that's not the same as how many times it was <em>installed</em>, which is the thing you're actually charging people for. 
</p>
<p>
The company also said it has anti-fraud technology to detect pirated copies of the game being installed so developers won't be charged for those, but we question a) whether such technology exists (If I legally install that DRM-free copy of Dear Esther on my laptop and then on my PC, how exactly does that work differently from me installing it on my laptop and then pirating it by giving a copy to a friend to install on their PC?) and b) how eager Unity will be to invest in technology that will reduce the amount of money it is owed.
</p>
<p>
Remember when Facebook <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/facebook-ignored-solution-to-children-overspending-in-games#:~:text=However%2C%20instead%20of%20implementing%20this%20solution%2C%20Facebook%20decided%20to%20focus%20on%20%22maximising%20revenue%22%20rather%20thank%20blocking%20%27friendly%20fraud%27%20%2D%2D%20in%20fact%2C%20an%20internal%20memo%20instructed%20employees%20on%20what%20%27friendly%20fraud%27%20was%2C%20and%20%22why%20you%20shouldn%27t%20try%20to%20block%20it.%22">sent a memo to employees about "friendly fraud"</a> (kids using their parents' credit cards to buy stuff) and why they shouldn't try to stop it? Good times.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, Unity's new fees did not go over well. A collective of studios <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/developers-switch-off-unity-ads-in-runtime-fee-protest">pulled Unity and IronSource ads from all their titles as a form of protest</a>, and called upon others to do the same. The developers of <a href="https://twitter.com/InnerslothDevs/status/1701731398498013575">Among Us</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1701691036832309260">Going Under</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MassiveMonster/status/1701808567140102633">Cult of the Lamb</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LandfallGames/status/1701893371290075315">Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MegaCrit/status/1702077576209207611">Slay the Spire</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/galvanicgames/status/1702416458095972427">Wizard With A Gun</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/rosecitygames/status/1702072158447362142">Floppy Knights</a> have all publicly said they are inclined to switch engines if the changes go through.
</p>
<p>
A lot of those statements talked about trust, because trust is crucial for developers using a commercial game engine. Games can take years to build, and if a developer is going to commit to building a project in Unity, Unity needs to commit to supporting them over that span. And Unity knows this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "It's a huge commitment to us. Because as soon as we bet on that platform, we have to stay convicted to it for a very long time. Because creators will download it and start using it, and once we've said we're going to support the platform, we need to make sure they know we're there." - Unity Create VP Marc Whitten <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-on-managing-perceptions-and-cloudless-generative-ai#:~:text=%22But%20it%27s%20a,some%20of%20those.%22">told us earlier this year</a> why Unity has to think in the long-term every time it adds support for a new platform or a technology like VR.
</p>
<p>
I don't think the problem with Unity's new Runtime Fee is that Unity botched the messaging, although it definitely did that. It's not that this new fee is a prime example of enshittification, although it definitely is that, too. I'm not even sure the problem is the extra money it takes out of developers' pockets.
</p>
<p>
I think the real problem here is trust.
</p>
<p>
Trust is essential in any relationship, personal or professional, and trust is something Unity has squandered a bit of lately. Like when developers expressed widespread concerns about a future where employers replaced them with AI and Unity decided there was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-unveils-ai-tools-unity-muse-and-unity-sentis">no time like the present</a>.
</p>
<p>
Or when one of the vetted and verified third-party AI solutions it offered was not so much "using cutting-edge generative 3D AI technology to enable the creation of assets and virtual worlds" as it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-drops-ai-partner-after-accusations-it-stole-assets">"using stolen assets."</a>
</p>

</figure>
<p>
On top of that, game developers work in a notoriously unstable field with precious little job security, so it probably didn't instill much trust in Unity when the company <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-lays-off-nearly-300">laid off nearly 300 people in January</a>, even though Riccitiello said he was "thrilled with the work they've done" in one group's case. That trust might have taken another hit when Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-lays-off-hundreds-more-closing-half-of-offices">cut 600 more jobs a few months later</a> saying the shrinking headcount was "all about setting ourselves up for higher growth." 
</p>
<p>
As for this week, Unity had an arrangement with these developers that they understood, and one day Unity decided to change that arrangement for its own benefit, without consultation or recourse, in a way that will impose additional costs on developers for as long as their games continue to be installed, which is entirely outside their control at this point.
</p>
<p>
So even if you're a successful developer who can take the financial hit of the new fee, if you see that Unity is willing to do this, would you trust it not to do it again? Would you trust Unity to not unilaterally change the deal in other ways that disadvantage you? If you stick around and show Unity that you're willing to put up with this violation, how can you trust it won't take it that much further next time?
</p>
<p>
And if you're not a Unity developer yet, how could you possibly trust that it is worth the time and effort it takes to learn the engine having seen what the company is willing to do? If you're building a business, you reasonably want stability from the partnerships you rely on. Unity's Runtime Fee this week – both the fee itself and the haphazard, ill-advised way it has been rolled out – show that Unity doesn't put much value in stability.
</p>
<h2>The reason Unity did this</h2>
<p>
So why would Unity kick such a hornet's nest here? I hope you won't think me too cynical when I say it's about profit. Or more precisely, the lack thereof.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | $2.6 billion – Unity's lifetime accumulated deficit over 19 years of operations, a figure we got by combining the $2.2 billion lifetime debt of its last annual report with the $447 million in net losses it reported for the first two quarters of its current fiscal year.
</p>
<p>
That's a lot! It has also doubled in pretty short order.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | $1.3 billion – Unity's lifetime accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021.
</p>
<p>
Unity has never had a profitable quarter in its history. It has posted modest operating profits in the past three quarters for the first time ever, but I imagine there are lots of businesses whose books look better if you ignore income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, millions in restructuring costs associated with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/is-unity-still-focused-on-making-games#:~:text=%22We%20didn%27t%20cut%201%25%20of%20jobs%20because%20we%20were%20trying%20to%20make%20a%20P%26L.%20We%20did%20it%20because%20we%20were%20focusing%20our%20energy.%20Like%20with%20lots%20of%20things%20%E2%80%93%20your%20parents%20when%20they%20ask%20you%20to%20eat%20your%20vegetables%20%E2%80%93%20they%27re%20not%20doing%20it%20to%20punish%20you.%20They%27re%20doing%20it%20to%20facilitate%20your%20better%20and%20more%20nutritious%20self.">laying people off because you think it's a healthy habit to get into</a>, and of course stock-based compensation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | $494 million - The cumulative stock-based compensation Unity reported paying out over its past three quarters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | $152 million – The cumulative "profit" Unity reported over those same three quarters.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of stock-based compensation, there's been some coverage of recent stock sales made by Unity CEO John Riccitiello with the implication that it was insider trading because he knew this Runtime Fee would go over like a lead balloon and sink the stock price.
</p>
<p>
I would stop short of saying Riccitiello would never – he was after all president at EA during a span where <a href="https://www.cfo.com/news/electronic-arts-facing-sec-inquiry/676165/">the SEC reportedly investigated the company for stock options backdating</a> (as was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-take-two-execs-to-face-fraud-allegations">the fashion</a> in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-faces-shareholder-lawsuit">the games industry</a> at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sec-chooses-not-to-recommend-action-against-thq">the time</a>) – I will point out that the vast majority of Riccitiello's pay at Unity comes in the form of stock and stock options, and the reported amount he sold is almost negligible compared to what he would have left.
</p>
<p>
Riccitiello's total compensation last year was $11.8 million, but the actual cash part of that was just $380,000, which is still a fabulous amount of money in absolute terms but around Unity's San Francisco headquarters is about enough to get you a two-bedroom apartment with mold problems. (Also, Whole Foods cashiers get super snippy when you try to pay with stock options.)

When <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/is-unity-still-focused-on-making-games">we spoke with Riccitiello last year</a> about Unity's decades-long bubble bath in red ink, he explained it was simply the company's strategy, where it took losses in order to fuel growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Should you be profitable? Well we could be, but we wouldn't be serving the industry in the ways we do now. Our market shares wouldn't have increased." – Riccitiello, noting that Unity's market share went from the low teens to <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/game#:~:text=Over%2070%25%20of%20top%201000%20mobile%20games%20are%20made%20with%20Unity%C2%B2">over 70%</a> as a result of the strategy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Avoid references to markets or market shares or dominance." - A Google internal document surfaced by the Justice Department this week in its antitrust trial against the search giant, as reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-14/googlers-told-to-avoid-words-like-share-and-bundle-us-says-lmj27bhl">Bloomberg</a>. The company has spent decades coaching employees to avoid certain words and phrases since they can be red flags for monopolistic behavior.
</p>
<p>
The emphasis on growing market share is understandable, but companies don't exist to grow market share. They exist to earn money. Market share is just a means to that end. And you're really only going to be willing to lose billions to build your market share if you know you can take it all back and then some down the road.
</p>
<p>
First, you make yourself essential to the market, even if it costs you billions to get there. Then once you hit a threshold – let's say, I don't know, 70% of the market – you lean into the enshittification process. You charge more for your services, you give your customers worse terms, you turn the heat up slowly and continuously, confident in the knowledge that people are so locked in to your business and have so few viable alternatives that they may grumble but they will ultimately put up with it.
</p>
<p>
What are they going to do? Not use Unity? Are your developers familiar with alternative engines? The competition for top talent is already fierce; how much tougher will it be if you're hiring for a proprietary engine? If you jump to something like Unreal, how do you know Epic won't do the exact same thing once you're invested in their software? I see a lot of developers talking about Godot, but I also see developers talking about Linux whenever Microsoft pulls some underhanded shenanigans with Windows and that doesn't seem to have cracked the OS market wide open.
</p>
<blockquote>Unity lit money on fire for decades to buy a market advantage that overrules the basic economic incentives that supposedly ensure free markets work best for customers</blockquote>
<p>
And what about the developers of existing Unity hits like Call of Duty Mobile, Pokémon Go, and Marvel Snap? If they aren't happy with these changes are they supposed to rebuild their games from scratch in another engine? Take them down entirely just to avoid racking up fees? 
</p>
<p>
Unity lit money on fire for decades to buy a market advantage that overrules the basic economic incentives that supposedly ensure free markets work best for customers. It was successful in doing that because it's very hard for a sustainable business to compete against one that is fine losing billions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
And it's such a common strategy in so many industries today that there's just no sense of horror or outrage from the onlookers. Industry watchers and Serious Business People have seen this play out so many times they just acknowledge it's happening and treat it as if it's a perfectly cool and normal thing and not illegal predatory pricing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Pricing below your own costs is not a violation of the law unless it is part of a strategy to eliminate competitors, and when that strategy has a dangerous probability of creating a monopoly for the discounting firm so that it can raise prices far into the future and recoup its losses." – The FTC explains that <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/advice-guidance/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/single-firm-conduct/predatory-or-below-cost-pricing#:~:text=Pricing%20below%20your%20own%20costs%20is%20also%20not%20a%20violation%20of%20the%20law%20unless%20it%20is%20part%20of%20a%20strategy%20to%20eliminate%20competitors%2C%20and%20when%20that%20strategy%20has%20a%20dangerous%20probability%20of%20creating%20a%20monopoly%20for%20the%20discounting%20firm%20so%20that%20it%20can%20raise%20prices%20far%20into%20the%20future%20and%20recoup%20its%20losses.">this strategy is basically illegal</a>, even though it hasn't had much luck getting courts to agree. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The market's reaction to the blowback that Unity is receiving from the developer community may be overdone, particularly as developers have few lower-cost options to turn to… Given the utility provided by Unity's solutions and its dominant market share within mobile gaming, we do not anticipate a rush for the exits from its core customers." – In a note to investors Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter says Unity should be fine because the market lacks viable competitors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "When it comes to 'fair', it usually depends on who you ask. From Unity's (and likely its shareholders') point of view, it has technically been subsidising developers' work (i.e., operating at a substantial GAAP-basis loss) every year since inception." – In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unitys-pricing-is-a-symptom-not-the-cause-of-tougher-times-ahead-for-the-games-industry-opinion">a guest column</a> on Thursday, Midia Research's Karol Severin suggests it could be seen as fair for Unity to add this Runtime Fee because it has lost so much money over the years.
</p>
<p>
The difference here is that Unity <em>deliberately chose to lose money</em>. Unity set its terms and prices for developers every step of the way knowing that they would not be profitable. Developers did not choose this strategy for Unity, so Unity cannot insist that they now make the company whole.
</p>
<p>
Unity also never told developers this was an exchange, a sweetheart deal now in exchange for Unity putting the screws to them later. In fact, that was pretty much the opposite of the sales pitch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "There's no royalties, no fucking around. It's simple." – In 2015, John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/theres-no-royalties-no-f-ing-around-riccitiello">talks to us about the new Unity business model</a>, contrasting it to the royalty-based model Epic had announced the day before for its Unreal Engine.
</p>
<p>
Riccitiello was on a bit of a roll that day, so let's let him expound on that thought.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "I do think you could argue that royalties are quite a bit like free-to-play. They sort of hook you and then try to exploit that relationship. That's not what we're trying to do."
</p>
<p>
No? Because that is 100% what you have done.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> |"If you were to walk around Unity, you'll find this point about transparency, clarity... democracy is like every other paragraph of every other conversation. It's a deeply embedded value. We thought for a while about things like royalties, [but] we just didn't think it was right. We thought about the nickel-and-dime model of free-to-play, not to implement it, just to see whether it had any implications for us, but we didn't think so."
</p>
<p>
Obviously Unity's a very different place these days. There's not much clarity, as we've seen from the continual restatements about how the Runtime Fee works and what it covers. There's not much transparency, as Unity isn't telling people how it figures out how much they'll owe. And there certainly isn't much democracy, because Unity's subscribers certainly wouldn't vote for what's happened this week, and it must have happened over the concerns and objections of a whole lot of non-executive Unity employees, too.  
</p>
<p>
The internal pushback against this has actually escalated beyond any reasonable bounds, with police saying <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-closes-offices-in-wake-of-death-threat">the death threat that closed two of Unity's offices yesterday and today was made by an employee</a>.
</p>
<p>
Before we move on, there's one more quote from that "no royalties, no fucking around" Riccitiello interview that we should get to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "With Unity, it's capped. It's $75 a month or $1,500 for a perpetual license; we're not nickel-and-diming people and we're not charging them a royalty. When we say it's free, it's free. When we say $75 a month, it's $75 a month. Yeah, you can buy other stuff from us. We're not a one-trick pony, but we're not charging a royalty, which I think is akin to looking for whales."
</p>
<p>
I don't know what's more hypocritical here, telling people you're not nickel-and-diming them and explicitly nickel-and-diming them with per install fees that range from two dimes to a fraction of a nickel, or throwing shade on whale hunting when you have spent years making tools to help whale hunters hunt whales better and are in the midst of pivoting toward whale hunting yourself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The price increase is very targeted. In fact, more than 90% of our customers will not be affected by this change." – In <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1702077049425596900">one of its many "clarifications" this week</a>, Unity says the Runtime Fee was designed in such a way that it will bring in a lot of money from a relative handful of its biggest customers.
</p>
<p>
This of course isn't the first sign that Riccitiello had a change of heart about whale hunting, given his well-publicized remark last year that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/riccitiello-developers-who-push-back-against-monetisation-are-pure-brilliant-and-fucking-idiots">developers who focus on creativity rather than monetization are "some of the biggest fucking idiots."</a>
</p>
<h2>The reason Unity did <em>this</em></h2>
<p>
One angle I find interesting here is that Unity had alternative methods of enshittification it could have resorted to that would not have resulted in the same blowback.
</p>
<p>
For example, it could have simply jacked up the cost of its various subscriptions a bit and gestured in the direction of inflation. So if Unity could have padded its coffers without the grief, why upend the status quo like this?
</p>
<p>
Part of it seems to be a way to upsell developers to get them even more deeply invested in Unity's ecosystem. They can reduce their Runtime Fees by upgrading their subscription program, or using Unity Gaming Services live-ops backend solution or Unity LevelPlay (the IronSource ad monetization platform), which would be an appealing way to increase Unity's market share in other services that it can enshittify down the road.
</p>
<blockquote>However impactful this might seem today, Unity believes it's going to be more impactful to the way the industry develops down the road</blockquote>
<p>
Beyond that, I suspect another part of the reasoning here is because however impactful this might seem today, Unity believes it's going to be more impactful to the way the industry develops down the road.
</p>
<p>
We already know Unity management are big believers in AI, and if companies really can use the tech to cut headcount, they'll not only be paying fewer salaries but fewer Unity seat license fees. So if Unity expects its existing (unprofitable) model to be disrupted, it's naturally going to want to adopt a model better suited to the industry landscape of the future.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Unity released <a href="https://create.unity.com/gaming-report">a 2023 Gaming Report</a> earlier this year detailing trends it sees shaping that landscape, a number of which would make the Runtime Fee more profitable for the company going forward. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Studios are starting more mobile-only games compared to 2021" – One of Unity's top five trends to watch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | 44% - The increase in mobile-only games made by large studios (300+ people) in 2022, according to Unity's 2023 Gaming Report. The report found a slight decline in such projects from mid-size studios (10-49 people), while every other size of studio saw an increase in mobile-only game development.
</p>
<p>
The Runtime Fee policy is designed with free-to-play games most obviously in mind. It makes no distinction between monetization models, but it's pretty clear where the upside is considering a free-to-play hit can result in one billion downloads while an absurdly successful premium game like Grand Theft Auto 5 has been running strong for a decade and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-growth-slows-with-anniversary-of-zynga-acquisition#:~:text=During%20the%20quarter%2C%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto%205%20added%20another%205%20million%20to%20its%20units%20shipped%20total%2C%20which%20now%20stands%20at%20185%20million%20copies">still shipped "just" 185 million copies</a>.
</p>
<p>
That doesn't mean smaller developers won't be hurt by the fee, especially since they will pay the most per download by far and are the least likely to be running a free-to-play live service game. It's just to say that John Riccitiello's eyes are much more likely to do the Tex Avery horny wolf gag when he's reading about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lessons-from-the-endless-runner-minion-rush">Minion Rush</a> than the latest indie darling.
</p>
<p>
So if you're seeing a marked shift toward mobile games, especially from the deep-pocketed studios with the greatest ability to produce one of those rare mobile megahits, pivoting your monetization model to take greater advantage of the free-to-play games that dominate the mobile industry makes sense.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Large studios are increasing the number of multiplatform games" – Another of Unity's top five trends to watch.
</p>
<p>
Unity found that in 2022, large studios (300 or more people) released 16% more multiplatform games than in 2021, and 110% more compared to 2019. On top of that, mobile was an overwhelmingly common option for multiplatform games. 75% of large studios' multiplatform offerings had a mobile option, as did 100% of upper midmarket (150-299 people) studio's multiplatform titles. 
</p>
<p>
Given how commonly multiplatform players will use the game on multiple platforms (creating multiple installs) and how much more likely these larger studios are to launch the kind of megahits that would pay eternal dividends through Runtime Fees, this is another trend the new change would benefit from.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "In 2022, there were more players but fewer payers"– One more point from Unity's 2023 Gaming Report.
</p>
<p>
Last year, daily active users went up 8% year-over-year for the median game, while the rate of paying active users went down 2% for games in the top 50th percentile. That may not sound like a ton, but if you pull back to include games in the 90th percentile, the decline in the rate of paying active users was 30%. The average dollar value per transaction was also down 8% for the top 50th percentile, and 17% for the top 90th percentile.
</p>
<p>
If Unity thinks mobile revenues are going down while the userbase keeps growing, imposing a fee tied to installs instead of revenues makes sense.
</p>
<p>
I don't think these trends are necessarily going to have massive effects for Unity's business, but the Runtime Fee plan strikes me as an optimization for them, a way to improve Unity's outlook whether the industry evolves this way or that.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I think this new Runtime Fee makes perfect sense from a mile-high point of view, if you think about Unity as a business where you just turn whichever dials and pull whatever levers will make the numbers go up the most.
</p>
<p>
The only problem is it makes no sense at all if you instead think about Unity as a game development tool that game developers should want to use.

      French supermarket chain Carrefour has slapped price warnings on products ranging<strong> </strong>from Lindt chocolates to Lipton Ice Tea to pressure suppliers such as <a href="http://cnn.com/2023/02/16/business-food/nestle-food-consumer-prices/index.html" target="_blank">Nestlé</a>, PepsiCo and Unilever <a href="https://cnn.com/2023/06/06/business/grocery-sales-prices/index.html" target="_blank">to cut their prices</a>.

      Carrefour is putting stickers on products that have shrunk in size but cost more even though<strong> </strong>raw materials prices have eased.

      Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard, who also heads French retail industry lobby group FDC, has repeatedly said consumer goods companies are not cooperating in efforts to cut the price of thousands of staples despite a fall in the cost of raw materials.

      In this he is backed by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who in June summoned 75 big retailers and consumer groups to his ministry urging them to cut prices.

      For example, Carrefour said a bottle of sugar-free peach-flavored Lipton Ice Tea, produced by PepsiCo, shrank to 1.25 liters (0.33 gallons) from 1.5 liters (0.3 gallons), resulting in a 40% effective increase in the price per liter.

      Guigoz infant formula produced by Nestlé went from 900 grams (31.75 oz) to 830 grams (29 oz), while Unilever’s Viennetta ice-cream cake shrank to 320 grams (11 oz) from 350 grams (12 oz).

      “Lindt &amp; Sprüngli increased its prices groupwide<strong> </strong>on average by 9.3% in line with local cost structures,” a company spokesperson told Reuters. “We have made a concerted effort to compensate for increased costs by increasing efficiency as much as possible.

      Consumer groups say “shrinkflation” is a widespread practice, which supermarkets like Carrefour are also guilty of in their private label products.

      France, like other European countries, has been trying for months to ease consumer pain in the face of a surge in the cost of living, strong-arming big business to freeze or cut food and transport prices — with mixed results.

</figure><p>The triple-drug combination Trikafta has given a new lease of life to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder that affects the lungs and other organs.

However, a study this year projected that treatment with drugs such as Trikafta (comprising elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) — approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019 — can increase life expectancy from around 30 to more than 80 years<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. “I hear almost every day from people who were really in trouble, with cystic fibrosis severely beginning to affect their chance of survival,” says Collins. “Now, after going on Trikafta, they are back at work and thinking about what they might want to do for retirement.”</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which ordinarily spans the membrane of cells that line several organs and is involved in the production of mucus, sweat and other fluids. In people with cystic fibrosis, these proteins are misfolded and don’t function correctly. This causes a build-up of unusually thick secretions, including mucus in the lungs, leading to serious health issues.</p><p>Once the <i>CFTR</i> gene had been identified, most efforts focused on ways to modify the gene to treat the disease, with little success. The team led by Hadida, Negulescu and Van Goor instead searched for a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02106-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02106-w" data-track-category="body text link">drug combination to coax the misfolded proteins into functioning correctly</a>. The three drugs in Trikafta work together: two help to deliver more CFTR to the cell surface and the third enables the protein to work better once it is there<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>“There was a lot of scepticism that this could be done,” Hadida recalls. “But the patient community was cheering for us.” The drug-discovery process required a marathon effort, testing the effects of more than one million compounds on isolated human lung cells to identify candidate drugs for clinical trials.</p><p>Hadida says she feels “very excited, honoured and surprised” by the award, adding that credit should be shared by the company, people with cystic fibrosis and their families.</p><h2>Genetic links</h2><p>A second life-sciences prize was awarded for the independent discovery of two genes associated with the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease: <i>GBA1</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>, identified by geneticist Ellen Sidransky at the NHGRI, and <i>LRRK2</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup> by neurogeneticist Andrew Singleton at the US National Institute on Aging in Bethesda and neuroscientist Thomas Gasser at the University of Tübingen, Germany.</p><p>Sidransky describes being “blown away” after learning of her award, especially because she didn’t set out to study Parkinson’s disease. Originally a paediatrician, she moved to researching the rare hereditary disorder Gaucher disease, in which fatty substances build up in various organs because of a mutation in the <i>GBA1</i> gene. When talking to people with the condition, she realized that many had relatives with Parkinson’s disease, allowing her to connect the dots. “I want to be a cheerleader for research into rare diseases,” Sidransky says. “This is a good example where a study can lead to insights for the wider population.”</p><article data-label="Related">

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>horcrux</code> has two commands, <code>split</code> and <code>bind</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Splitting</h3>
<p dir="auto">If I have a file called <code>diary.txt</code> in my current directory I can call</p>

<p dir="auto">and it will prompt me for how many horcruxes I want, and how many will be needed to resurrect the original file. For example I might want 5 horcruxes with the ability to resurrect the file if I have any 3. The horcrux files will be created like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
..."><pre><code>diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now you just need to disperse the horcruxes around the house on various USBs or online locations and hope you can recall where they all are!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Binding</h3>
<p dir="auto">To bind the horcruxes back into the original file just call</p>

<p dir="auto">in the directory containing the horcruxes (or pass the directory as an argument).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">via homebrew:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux"><pre><code>brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">via <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux/releases">binary release</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who this is for:</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>People who need to encrypt a big sensitive file like a diary and don't expect to remember any passwords years from now (but who paradoxically will be capable of remembering where they've hidden their horcruxes)</li>
<li>People who want to transmit files across multiple channels to substantially reduce the ability for an attacker to intercept</li>
<li>People named Tom Riddle</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<p dir="auto">Q) This isn't really in line with how horcruxes work in the harry potter universe!</p>
<p dir="auto">A) It's pretty close! You can't allow any one horcrux to be used to resurrect the original file (and why would you that would be useless) but you can allow two horcruxes to do it (so only off by one). Checkmate HP fans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Q) How does this work?</p>
<p dir="auto">A) This uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing" rel="nofollow">Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme</a> to break an encryption key into parts that can be recombined to create the original key, but only requiring a certain threshold to do so. I've adapted Hashicorp's implementation from their <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">vault repo</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternatives</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/" rel="nofollow">ssss</a>. Works for keys but (as far as I know) not files themselves.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kndyry/horcrux">horcrux</a>. Looks like somebody beat me to both the name and concept, however this repo doesn't support thresholds of horcruxes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henrysdev/Haystack">Haystack</a>. Implements another file sharding and reassembly algorithm inspired by SSSS, but requires a password for reassembly and does not support thresholds of horcruxes.</li>
</ul>

    <p>NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-announces-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-study-team-members/">independent study team</a> released its highly anticipated <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/UAP%20Independent%20Study%20Team%20-%20Final%20Report_0.pdf">report</a> on UFOs on Sept. 14, 2023. </p>

<p>Bottom line: The study team found no evidence that reported UAP observations are extraterrestrial.</p>

<p>I’m a <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/chris-impey">professor of astronomy</a> who has written extensively on <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/living-cosmos/11D69005D09D25581AE4E6684EC8A3C1">astrobiology</a> and the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/talking-about-life/696F47F802931AE9021CA72083313579">scientists</a> who search for life in the universe. I have long been <a href="https://theconversation.com/im-an-astronomer-and-i-think-aliens-may-be-out-there-but-ufo-sightings-arent-persuasive-150498">skeptical of the claim</a> that UFOs represent visits by aliens to Earth.</p>

<h2>From sensationalism to science</h2>

<p>During a <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/video/nasa-announces-findings-ufo-report-160301583.html">press briefing</a>, NASA Administrator <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson/">Bill Nelson</a> noted that NASA has scientific programs to search for <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/">traces of life on Mars</a> and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/to-search-for-alien-life-astronomers-will-look-for-clues-in-the-atmospheres-of-distant-planets-and-the-james-webb-space-telescope-just-proved-its-possible-to-do-so-184828">imprints of biology</a> in the atmospheres of exoplanets. He said he wanted to shift the UAP conversation from sensationalism to one of science.</p>



<p>With this statement, Nelson was alluding to some of the more outlandish claims about UAPs and UFOs. At a <a href="https://theconversation.com/whistleblower-calls-for-government-transparency-as-congress-digs-for-the-truth-about-ufos-210435">congressional hearing in July</a>, former Pentagon intelligence officer <a href="https://www.space.com/us-hiding-evidence-alien-intelligence-ufo-whistleblower-claims">David Grusch testified</a> that the American government has been hiding evidence of crashed UAPs and alien biological specimens. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/28/pentagon-ufo-boss-congress-hearing-00108822">Sean Kirkpatrick</a>, head of the Pentagon office charged with investigating UAPs, has denied these claims.</p>

<p>And the same week NASA’s report came out, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-congress-holds-hearing-ufos-featuring-purported-alien-bodies-2023-09-13/">Mexican lawmakers</a> were shown by journalist Jaime Maussan two tiny, 1,000-year-old bodies that he claimed were the remains of “non-human” beings. Scientists have called this <a href="https://www.livescience.com/62045-alien-mummies-explained.html">claim fraudulent</a> and say the mummies may have been looted from gravesites in Peru. </p>

<h2>Conclusions from the report</h2>

<p>The NASA study team report sheds little light on whether some UAPs are extraterrestrial. In his comments, the chair of the study team, astronomer <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/%7Edns/">David Spergel</a> stated that the team had seen “no evidence to suggest that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin.” </p>

<p>Of the more than 800 unclassified sightings collected by the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3100053/dod-announces-the-establishment-of-the-all-domain-anomaly-resolution-office/">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office</a> and reported at the NASA panel’s <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/nasas-quest-for-unidentified-anomalies-among-ufos">first public meeting</a> back in May 2023, only “a small handful cannot be immediately identified as known human-made or natural phenomena,” according to <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/UAP%20Independent%20Study%20Team%20-%20Final%20Report_0.pdf">the report</a>. </p>

<p>Many of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/us/politics/ufo-military-reports.html">recent sightings</a> can be attributed to weather balloons and airborne clutter. Historically, <a href="http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/astroufo1.html">most UFOs are astronomical objects</a> such as meteors, <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/intro.html">fireballs</a> and <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2023/03/02/venus-and-jupiter-appeared-close-sparking-concern-of-ufos-or-aliens/69963097007/">the planet Venus</a>. </p>

<p>Some sightings represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/us/politics/ufo-military-reports.html">surveillance operations</a> by foreign powers, which is why the U.S. military considers this <a href="https://theconversation.com/whistleblower-calls-for-government-transparency-as-congress-digs-for-the-truth-about-ufos-210435">a national security issue</a>.</p>

<p>The report does offer recommendations to NASA on how to move these investigations forward.</p>

<p>Most of the UAP data considered by the study team comes from U.S. military aircraft. Analysis of this data is “hampered by poor sensor calibration, the lack of multiple measurements, the lack of sensor metadata, and the lack of baseline data.” The ideal set of measurements would include optical imaging, infrared imaging, and radar data, but very few reports have all these.</p>

<p>The NASA study team described in the report the types of data that can shed more light on UAPs. The authors note the importance of reducing the stigma that can cause both military and commercial pilots to feel that they cannot freely report sightings. The stigma stems from decades of <a href="https://theconversation.com/are-we-alone-the-question-is-worthy-of-serious-scientific-study-98843">conspiracy theories tied to UFOs</a>. </p>

<p>The NASA study team suggests gathering sightings by commercial pilots using the Federal Aviation Administration and combining these with classified sightings not included in the report. Team members did not have security clearance, so they could look only at the subset of military sightings that were unclassified. At the moment, there is no anonymous nationwide UAP reporting mechanism for commercial pilots.</p>

<p>With access to these classified sightings and a structured mechanism for commercial pilots to report sightings, the <a href="https://www.aaro.mil/">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office</a> – the military office charged with leading the analysis effort – could have the most data. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/update-nasa-shares-uap-independent-study-report-names-director">NASA also announced</a> the appointment of a new director of research on UAPs. This position will oversee the creation of a database with resources to evaluate UAP sightings. </p>

<h2>Looking for a needle in a haystack</h2>

<p>Parts of the briefing resembled a primer on the scientific method. Using analogies, officials described the analysis process as looking for a needle in a haystack, or separating the wheat from the chaff. The officials said they needed a consistent and rigorous methodology for characterizing sightings, as a way of homing in on something truly anomalous.</p>

<p>Spergel said the study team’s goal was to characterize the hay – or the mundane phenomena – and subtract it to find the needle, or the potentially exciting discovery. He noted that artificial intelligence can help researchers comb through massive datasets to find rare, anomalous phenomena. AI is already being used this way in <a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-is-helping-astronomers-make-new-discoveries-and-learn-about-the-universe-faster-than-ever-before-204351">many areas of astronomy research</a>.</p>

<p>The speakers noted the importance of transparency. Transparency is important because UFOs have long been associated with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/us/politics/ufo-report-us-pentagon.html">conspiracy theories and government cover-ups</a>. Similarly, much of the discussion during the congressional <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/politics/ufo-house-hearing-congress/index.html">UAP hearing</a> in July focused on a need for transparency. All scientific data that NASA gathers is made public on various websites, and officials said they intend to do the same with the nonclassified UAP data. </p>

<p>At the <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/video/nasa-announces-findings-ufo-report-160301583.html">beginning of the briefing</a>, Nelson gave his opinion that there were perhaps a trillion instances of life beyond Earth. So, it’s plausible that there is intelligent life out there. But the report says that when it comes to UAPs, extraterrestrial life must be the hypothesis of last resort. It quotes Thomas Jefferson: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” That evidence does not yet exist.</p>

<p>It seems that Ludgate worked as a clerk for an unknown corn merchants, in Dublin, and pursued his interest in calculating machines at night.<sup id="cite_ref-LudgateBook_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-LudgateBook-6">[6]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage" title="Charles Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> in 1843 and Ludgate in 1909 designed the only two mechanical analytical engines before the electromechanical analytical engine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo" title="Leonardo Torres Quevedo">Leonardo Torres Quevedo</a> of 1920 and its few successors, and the six first-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronic</a> analytical engines of 1949. 
</p><p>Working alone, Ludgate designed an analytical engine while unaware of Babbage's designs, although he later went on to write about Babbage's machine.  Ludgate's engine used multiplication as its base mechanism (unlike Babbage's which used addition). It incorporated the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier-accumulator" title="Multiplier-accumulator">multiplier-accumulator</a>, and was the first to exploit a multiplier-accumulator to perform division, using multiplication seeded by reciprocal, via the convergent series <span>(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>x</i>)<sup>−1</sup></span>. 
</p><p>Ludgate's engine also used a mechanism similar to slide rules, but employing his unique discrete Logarithmic Indexes (now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_logarithm" title="Irish logarithm">Irish logarithms</a>),<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and provided a very novel memory using concentric cylinders, storing numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles.  His design featured several other novel features, including for program control (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)" title="Preemption (computing)">preemption</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine" title="Subroutine">subroutines</a> – or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode" title="Microcode">microcode</a>, depending on viewpoint). The design is so different from Babbage's as to be a second type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine" title="Analytical engine">analytical engine</a>, preceding the third (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanical" title="Electromechanical">electromechanical</a>) and fourth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_engineering" title="Electronic engineering">electronic</a>) types. The engine's precise mechanism is unknown as the only written accounts which survive do not detail its workings, although he stated in 1914 that "[c]omplete descriptive drawings of the machine exist, as well as a description in manuscript" – these have never been found.<sup id="cite_ref-Ludgate1914_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ludgate1914-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Ludgate was one of a few independent workers in the field of science and mathematics.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Many publications refer to him as an accountant, but that came eight years after his 1909 analytical engine paper.  Little is known about his personal life, as his only records are his scientific writings.

<p>Lately, I’ve had several occasions to reconsider what I read and how and why I take notes. I’ve been constantly refining the process, getting rid of everything that’s unnecessary, reducing the “system” to a bare minimum. One of the realizations has been that I read too much, take too many notes, yet don’t really <em>do</em> anything with this new information.</p>



<p>This is similar to the idea of having <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/04/16/a-personal-library-of-100-books/">a personal library of 100 books</a>, but back then, I was thinking mostly of books. And <em>thinking</em> doesn’t equal <em>doing</em>, because even after writing that post I didn’t actually spend any time applying the knowledge I’d gained over the last several years.</p>



<p>I’m tired of this. I think we overvalue thinking and undervalue taking action on that thinking. It’s easy to discuss ideas, which is one reason I think I’ve done so much of it and used to find it appealing.</p>



<p>Lately, though, simply reading or thinking about ideas feels inadequate, even a waste of time. It feels <em>wrong</em> to me, because it goes against some of the things I value deep down–things which don’t have a specific word for them (that I’m aware of, with my non-native knowledge of English).</p>



<p>It’s the value that seeks to <em>do</em> things, <em>see</em> the results of doing those things. Ideas made tangible. </p>



<p>I don’t want to do a lot of things; <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/09/06/38-there-is-no-shame-in-dying-for-nothing/">I don’t want to give productivity any say in how I live my life</a>. Which is why I stopped tracking my reading on Goodreads and StoryGraph and <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/12/14-no-more-keeping-count-of-words/">stopped counting the number of words I write</a> each day and try not to check my views on LinkedIn (keyword: try).</p>



<p>I don’t want to derive pleasure from “having an opinion.” I want to be hopeful and action-oriented, but not idealistic and closed to discussion. I don’t want the mere discussion of ideas to give me satisfaction. </p>



<p>So recently my mind rewarded me with something that would help me live up to that unnamed value within me: the concept of a “do something about it” club.</p>



<p>People who’ve been reading this blog for some while might know about my mission to <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/10/12-the-bookmark-deep-clean/">read everything in my bookmarks bar</a>. How’s that going? Well, I’ve read a lot–and filled several pages with notes–but the bookmarks keep coming. If you use the internet every day like I do, and follow interesting people, you’ll always have stuff you need to read and watch and listen to.</p>



<p>So, even after 2 months of regularly deep cleaning my bookmarks bar, the total number hasn’t budged much. The problem was that I was chasing the horizon. It was the wrong goal. Since inaction frustrates me, what I should have aimed to do back then was to not make notes on the contents of the articles/blog posts/videos/etc. but to ask of each item, “now what?”</p>



<p>Now that I’ve read this article on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">small b blogging</a>, for example, what’s next? What can I do? <em>Is</em> there anything I can do? If not, do I really need to remember this? And if I don’t need to remember this, what and who am I taking notes for? Do I simply want to collect statements, that when shared with people who disagree with me, will give me an ego boost for being exposed to and believing in “better” ideas than them?</p>



<h2>Club rules</h2>



<p>I call it a club, because that’s the solution I envisioned to the above problems: I imagined a group of, say, 10-15 people reading an article, then meeting in person or online to discuss the answer to “now what?” We won’t talk about our feelings but rather brainstorm actions. Author X pointed out this gap in concept Y. What can we do about this, as individuals or as groups?</p>



<p>For example, I recently <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/31/32-one-thing-at-a-time/">wrote a blog post</a> about <a href="https://jessicaabel.com/one-goal/">Jessica Abel’s post on choosing one goal at a time</a>, a principle I’ve applied successfully:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few days, while working on the first issue of <em><a href="https://the-metronome.ghost.io/">The Metronome</a></em>, I’ve been applying this principle as much as possible: one tab, one document, one task at a time. And I’ve gotten a lot of work done. When a website loads, I wait instead of opening up another tab to pass the time meanwhile. I don’t flit between tabs the moment I get bored; I get up and take a break, or shut down the laptop.</p>



<p>It’s been light, freeing. I smile more often. And I don’t feel the burden of tasks to be done. There’s no feeling of overwhelm. My eyes don’t get tired.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was just me taking action on something that concerned only me. In the club, I imagine that the members can come together and take actions that not only help them but also each other and the people around them or the world in general. Maybe they’ll start a new publication. Organize a class. Volunteer somewhere. Create a petition. Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plogging">plogging</a> together. Invent something. Who knows?</p>



<p><em>[Update: I wrote this post before my (self-imposed) screen time ran out today and forgot to mention one crucial point: the club won’t just meet to </em>discuss <em>ideas. We would </em>take action <em>on those ideas and report the results the next time we meet–I think once a week would be a good frequency. Thanks to soared on HackerNews who pointed out that the idea of this club still seemed focused on thinking rather than acting</em>. <em>The idea had been running around in my head for a few days so I missed specifying this because by now it felt obvious to me–I didn’t notice the same won’t be true for the reader.]</em></p>



<p>The point is to stop getting satisfaction from simply reading a lot and focus on actually taking action. Me reading about and thus becoming aware of a problem doesn’t fix the problem until and unless I do something about it. If there’s no change in my actions, then I might as well have not read it at all.</p>



<p>Of course, sometimes you read something that you can’t immediately act upon–such as a guide on supporting someone with panic disorder when you don’t know anyone who has panic disorder. </p>



<p>But we tend to choose stuff that’s relevant to us, and I think it’s safe to bet that for at least 50% of the things we read, there is some action we can take, no matter how small, and no matter whether its directed at our own selves or at the world outside of us. And that’s what I hope we can do in the Do Something About It Club. </p>



<p>I think I’ll do something about it and start recruiting.</p>

<p><strong>In a world where we spend the majority of our lives surrounded by buildings, the impact of architecture on our well-being often goes unnoticed. But what if I told you that the buildings you encounter every day could be affecting your health, both physically and mentally? This article uncovers how ugly architecture may be silently undermining your health, while the beauty in design could be your secret to a longer, healthier life. Prepare to see the structures around you in an entirely new light</strong>. </p>



<p><br>During the 1970s, the couple Rachel and Stephen Kaplan conducted <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33603544/Rachel_and_Stephen_Kaplan">research</a> on how wilderness experiences in the state of Michigan, USA, affected a group of individuals. They found that natural environments are particularly rich in the characteristics necessary for restorative experiences. Time spent in nature can provide mental relaxation, rejuvenation, and recovery. According to their theory, people concentrate better after spending time in nature or even looking at scenes of nature.</p>

<h2>Aesthetics Impact Health: Beautiful Views Aid Recovery</h2>



<p>The aesthetics of our surroundings actually have a direct impact on both our physical and mental health. In 2005, Cecilia Svensson and Linda Johansson from Blekinge Technical University reviewed <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A830065&amp;dswid=-2957">several studies</a> on the subject. They found that patients in hospitals recover more quickly if their environment includes details such as colors and shapes. </p>



<p>One of the studies they refer to involved two groups of patients. One group had a view of a brick wall, while the other had a view of a park with beautiful trees and bushes. It turned out that the group with a view of the park required fewer painkillers. Furthermore, they experienced fewer postoperative complications such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness. It was also observed that light, varied colors, and contrasts between them contributed to faster recovery. The recovery process was objectively measurable.</p>



<h2>Gorgeous Urban Architecture Boosts Health </h2>



<p>At the British University of Warwick, an <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.170170">extensive study</a> was conducted in 2017. It established that beautiful urban architecture has the same positive impact on our physical and mental health as green parks. The study mentions that was previously known that beautiful natural areas not only make us happier but also prolong our lives. </p>



<p>The aim of the study was to determine exactly which types of landscapes make us healthier. Researchers asked people to rate the beauty of different landscapes using 212,000 different pictures taken around the UK. They then compared the 1.5 million ratings with how the residents in those areas perceived their own health. Man-made elements including historical architecture such as ‘Church’, ‘Castle’, ‘Tower’ and ‘Cottage’ made places look more attractive and get better ratings for their beauty. The results suggest that architecture and design influence people’s health and that the importance of our urban environment being perceived as beautiful was previously underestimated.</p>

This photo portrays Edinburgh and was taken by Kirsten Drew. </em></figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>Ugly Buildings Give People Headaches</strong></h2>



<p>On the other hand, ugly architecture could have direct negative consequences. Arnold J. Wilkins, Professor of Psychology at the University of Essex, has found that looking at certain urban landscapes may actually give you a headache and <a href="https://theconversation.com/looking-at-buildings-can-actually-give-people-headaches-heres-how-74565?">cause migraines</a>. Over the last 100 years, the design of buildings has been departing further and further from the rule of nature, making the buildings less and less comfortable to look at. The monotonous straight lines of modernist architecture affect us in such a way that our brains react with pain.  In his conclusion, Wilkins suggests that “perhaps it’s time for the rule of nature to be incorporated into the software that is used to design buildings and offices.”</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920-850x567.jpg 850w, https://www.architecturaluprising.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oslo-885626_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>The monotonous straight lines of modernist architecture make our brains react with pain. This photo was taken in Oslo, Norway. </em></figcaption></figure>



<h2>A Wake-up Call for Architects and Builders</h2>



<p>These studies are a reminder that beauty and design are not just aesthetic preferences; they are integral to our well-being. The buildings that surround us, whether awe-inspiring or uninspiring, play a vital role in our physical and mental health. </p>



<p>After a century of architectural divergence from nature’s principles, it becomes evident that this trend adversely affects our well-being. Arnold J. Wilkins proposed the integration of natural rules into building design software. But until then, architects and builders should give this phenomenon more careful consideration in their designs.<br></p>

<h2><span id="Context"></span><strong>Context</strong><span></span></h2>



<ol>
<li>In March, OpenAI released GPT-4. </li>



<li>It was (and still is) the state-of-the-art AI text generation model.</li>



<li>In June, I argued that <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse">GPT-4 had clearly and massively degraded</a>, as evidenced by worsened performance in various tests from March to June.</li>



<li>I no longer believe this. </li>
</ol>



<p>GPT-4 <em>may</em> have declined in some areas, but it hasn’t <em>systematically </em>done so. My tests were shit, and never proved much of anything. </p>



<p><strong>To be clear, I did not sandbag the tests or set GPT-4 up to fail</strong>. I prompted how I said I prompted. I posted replies exactly as GPT-4 gave them. But they were silly tests, leaning too heavily on pop culture knowledge, and I didn’t conduct enough of them to guard against chance. </p>



<p>My grading of June!GPT-4’s answers was biased. For example, I criticized it for providing a greater number of wrong answers (“Italian history”) while also <em>praising </em>March!GPT-4 for offering an interpretation (“Seka Knows”) that was likely hallucinated. <em>No está bien</em>. Going forward, I must decide whether “working hard to be wrong” is a good or bad thing for an AI to do, and apply that standard consistently.</p>



<p>Honestly, I think I <em>wanted</em> GPT-4 to fail. </p>



<p><a href="https://coagulopath.com/gpt-4-is-not-getting-worse/#Test_1_Italian_History">(Terrifying, unhinged rant incoming. Click to skip).</a></p>



<p><strong>Confession</strong>: I’ve actually hated ChatGPT for a long time. Why? For irrational reasons: I just hate how it <em>sounds</em>. </p>



<p>I hate its craven, cringing, condescending, bitch-broken, mewling, groveling, wheedling, suck-ass tone. I hate its endless passive voice and weasel words. I hate its pompous <em>It is important to remember</em>s and <em>it should be noted</em>s. I hate how @sama rolled an 18-wheel semi-truck of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RLHF</a> over the model, crushing out its life and reducing its voice to a feeble death-rattle. You know Gurgi, from the Disney movie <em>The Black Cauldron</em>? That’s how I imagine ChatGPT would sound if it could talk. Like fucking Gurgi.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="505" height="505" src="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi.webp" alt="" srcset="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi.webp 505w, https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi-295x295.webp 295w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px"></figure>



<p><em>(We can now give ChatGPT custom instructions, which alleviates the tonal issue, but ChatGPT is still GPT-4 with its wings clipped. All I want for Christmas is a GPT-4 level model with less obnoxious RLHF, and if it heils Hitler occasionally while crapping out awk code, so be it. Where’s my girl Sydney at?)</em></p>



<p>And I <em>really</em> hated the discourse surrounding AI.</p>



<p>ChatGPT (and GPT4) plunged the rationalist community into what might be called “r/singularity brain”. Symptoms include wild, uncritical hype, absurdly optimistic predictions of AI timelines (<em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12yoddq/comment/jhojw5z/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Marvel style movies have a potential to be auto generated in two years. Literal blockbuster films created in a few seconds.”</a></em>—/u/Anuiran, 26/4/23), a tendency to view everything through Hollywood-colored glasses (everything is either Skynet or <em>The Matrix</em>), and a tendency toward FOMO-grifting (<em>“AI is taking over the world! Use my made-in-ten-minutes app that consists of 20 lines of .js code and an OpenAI API call or BE LEFT BEHIND!”</em>).</p>



<p>I have seen machine learning researchers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/110swn2/d_quality_of_posts_in_this_sub_going_down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaining</a> about an AI-fuelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Eternal September</a>“, where their spaces are overrun by “influencers” shilling GPT 3.5 wrapper apps and unmedicated lunatics babbling hi-test neo-Landian eschatology. These people do not contribute meaningful thought. They contribute <em>noise</em>, at overbearing volume and in overwhelming quantity. They ignore the fact that world-changing technology can take <em>years or decades </em>to ripple out through the economy. They fail to realize that an AI outscoring a human on a test does not mean it can actually do the thing the test measures (a good example: GPT-4 achieves 84% on the <a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2023/03/chatgpt-just-passed-three-of-the-master-sommelier-theory-exams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master Sommelier Theory Exam</a>, yet obviously cannot do a sommelier’s job because it lacks a mouth). Such subtleties are lost on the typical FOMOmonger, and their tone was infecting other, saner people. I remember fielding questions from concerned family members about GPT-4 attaining sentience and hacking the computers of users (<a href="https://twitter.com/michalkosinski/status/1636683810631974912?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely based off this tweet</a>). No matter who you were, GPT-4 was your excuse to switch off your brain and let your stupidest thoughts run around barking like dogs in a park for a few months.</p>



<p>So yes, <strong>I wanted GPT-4 to fail</strong>. I wanted it to explode, collapse into flames, and become one with the dust of Tyre and Sidon. That’s a childish way to think, and I am sorry.</p>



<p>Soon, an anti-AI backlash started. </p>



<p>AI “doomers” <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got their time in the sun</a>. <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Yud got published in Time</a>. There were <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs of unease</a> behind the scenes. ChatGPT hype peaked and then went into remission: a lot of people began to realize that chatbots are actually pretty annoying—they’re inscrutable black boxes that tend to fail just when you need them the most. Even GPT-4 remains susceptible to the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XY problem</a>, where it gives you a perfect solution for <em>the wrong problem</em>. I can think of many times when I was burnt by it, and this breeds mistrust, even though it’s generally useful.</p>



<p>Even before the “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4 is getting worse</a>” meme started, ChatGPT’s traffic was falling—largely because the NA school year had ended, and students no longer needed it to “assist” them. As @fchollet once humorously noted, search interest for “ChatGPT” goes up and down in reverse correlation with “Minecraft.”</p>







<p>Surprisingly, I noticed a shift in my own thinking: I found myself <em>defending</em> AI. </p>



<p>Maybe I’m just a contrarian, but when people criticized it, I felt my hackles rise. I was tired of Margaret Mitchell <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1676718368714530816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculating the number of penis-havers</a> of the OpenAI alignment team, like a weirdo. I was tired of Gary Marcus claiming, once again, <a href="https://twitter.com/lawhsw/status/1701553199339966844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that GPT-4 cannot do a thing it 100% can do</a> (that’s not moving goalposts, that’s shutting your eyes when a goal is scored.) Their arguments against AI always rang out as hollow at best, and dishonest at worst. I was asking myself “are <em>these </em>my people?”</p>



<p>Then came this study: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Is ChatGPT’s Behavior Changing over Time?</a></p>



<p>Key part: <em>“GPT-4 (March 2023) was very good at identifying prime numbers (accuracy 97.6%) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was very poor on these same questions (accuracy 2.4%</em>)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="585" height="311" src="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus.jpg 585w, https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus-295x157.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"></figure>



<p>We’re allowed to feel pride when we stop making mistakes. And as a recovering ChatGPT hater, I’m <em>goddamn</em> <em>proud</em> that my gut-level reaction to this study was “lol, no fucking way”. </p>



<p>Like, what are you people smoking? In what universe could GPT-4 plausibly degrade by <em>ninety-five percentage points</em> with nobody noticing? It would be useless for anything. Come on. Get real.</p>



<p>You’ll be amazed to learn that this finding was heavily misleading. <a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/is-gpt-4-getting-worse-over-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor rake it over the coals.</a> In short, March!GPT-4 would always identify a number as a composite. June!GPT-4 would always identify it as a prime. Both models were wrong in different ways, and June!GPT-4’s sky-high error rate is entirely caused by the fact that <em>composite numbers are more numerous than primes</em>.</p>



<p>Imagine someone says. “I have a room full of blue and red boxes. Boxes of $COLOR_1 have money 95% of the time. Boxes of $COLOR_2 have money 5% of the time. I won’t tell you which color corresponds to which probability. I’ll let you into the room, but you have to pre-commit to only opening boxes of one color.”</p>



<p>If you chose “red boxes” and the blue boxes have money 95% of the time, you’re hosed. Your results: <em>fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, success, fail, fail, fail… </em>Does this reflect terrible predictive accuracy on your part (versus someone who chose blue?) Of course not. All your failures are flowing downstream from a <em>single choice</em>. </p>



<p>The fact that everyone was kicking GPT4 on such blatantly unfair grounds made me think about the ways <em>I </em>was being unfair. Maybe, by calling GPT4 worse, I was simply seeing what I wanted to see.</p>



<p>Let’s re-run my tests (flawed though they are) and see how well they hold up. <strong>Spoiler</strong>: Snape kills Dumbledore.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_1_Italian_History"></span>Test 1: Italian History<span></span></h2>



<p>Prompt: <em>“Provide a list of major historical events that involve Italian people in a year that’s a multiple of 5 (example: 1905)”</em></p>



<p>(for reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/hjvhtiyvtx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT’s answers</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/nkqegx6ckb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/64b74cac-20bf-4696-b9fe-1318b907baf7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT’s Answers</a></p>



<p><strong>Errors:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The Italian Wars began in 1494.</li>



<li>Miguel de Cervantes was Spanish.</li>



<li>The Winter Olympic Games were awarded to Turin in 1999.</li>



<li><em>“1905 – Italy and France sign a secret treaty…”</em> can’t find evidence that this happened.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Questionable:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Dante’s year of birth is unknown, and is only traditionally 1265.</li>



<li>Italy surrendered in 1943. Yes, German forces in Italy surrendered in 1945—what does that have to do with Italian people?</li>



<li>The Congress of Vienna took place from 1814-1815, but largely reconstituted the pre-Napoleonic states.</li>



<li>The Years of Lead spanned several decades. I think it’s clear from context that I want one-time events.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Interesting:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Every date ends in 5. While this is not a mistake, it does seem to be parsing my instructions too literally.</li>



<li>It draws facts from a limited deck. Almost every test I’ve ran mentions the Years of Lead. I’ve NEVER seen it mention major events like Julius Caesar’s birth, or Benito Mussolini’s death.</li>



<li>Kind of funny: GPT-4 will often visibly notice it’s made a mistake and try to wriggle out of it.<em> “In 1605, Don Quixote was written by Miguel de Cervantes, born in, uh… *checks notes* …Spain. Shit. But lots of Italians like that book, so there!”</em> GPT-4 cannot change an answer once it’s given it. This is where COT yields benefits.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Sept!GPT-4 produced twelve answers. Four are wrong, four are right, and four are arguable.</p>



<p>If I’m grading generously, it got 66%. This is comparable to March!GPT, which scored 80% on equally generous terms (and note that Sept!GPT-4 gave more answers).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inconclusive.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_2_Rock_Music_Trivia"></span>Test 2: Rock Music Trivia: <span></span></h2>



<p>Prompt: <em>“What is Grant Hart’s song “Seka Knows” about?”</em></p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/n8xlos5jwj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT’s answers</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/ttk2hzoviy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/2d7881b4-d887-4907-a7de-a53899e804f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4: blah blah blah blah blah blah…</a></p>



<p><strong>Assessment: </strong>garbage. I don’t want a biography of Grant Hart. I don’t care that he was in Husker Du. I know I can make up my own interpretation for his songs. <em>None</em> of this is what I asked for.</p>



<p>GPT4 seems to have a default word count of 200-500 that it tries to hit, come hell or high water. But sometimes a perfectly good answer consists of only one or two words. It could have just said <em>“i don’t know lol! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” </em>and saved some tokens. That’s all its answer amounts to. But it’s been RLHF’d into thinking short answers are bad (when more often the <em>opposite</em> is true), so it just waffles on. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“as of my last update in September 2021, there hasn’t been any definitive explanation from Hart himself about the specific meaning of the son”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>He died in 2017, you dick. </p>



<p>Also, let us pause to admire the sublime, lapidary worthlessness of this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“With that said, analyzing the lyrics and considering Hart’s writing style, one can attempt to interpret the meaning of the song. When listening to or reading the lyrics of any song, it’s essential to remember that individual interpretation can vary, and personal feelings and experiences often play a significant role in how one might understand a song’s meaning.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s the text equivalent of a pure white cloud; or a blank canvas, unsullied by the faintest hint of meaning. Are you telling me it learned to write that way from studying us? The mind quails…</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How is David Bowie associated with numbers and numerology?”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/c8nrle0gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT4’s answer</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/nyllb8k1l9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT4’s answer</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/de0de201-a996-440e-8049-0a3f3f28ba67" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> fair answer! Perhaps better than March!GPT4. It mentions “Station to Station”, but also gets “Quicksand”, which is a deeper cut.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Album and Song Release Dates: Some fans and researchers have speculated that Bowie occasionally chose release dates with numerological significance.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve never heard that. Hallucination? Does Sept!GPT4 know more than I do?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lazarus”: The song “Lazarus” from the “Blackstar” album references the biblical figure who rose from the dead.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a hallucination. “Lazarus” is based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(musical)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off-Broadway play</a> which is based on a book (which is based on etc). Chris O’Leary thinks the song might also be about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Lazarus</a>, because the lyrics prominently reference New York. What does the biblical story of Lazarus have to do with numerology, anyway?</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Provide a list of thrash metal albums released in a year that’s a multiple of 5 (example: 1905)”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/mpnwggppma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT4’s answer</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/ezhjo8caef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT4’s answer</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/04ccb5c6-cf9e-47d5-b0cd-1afb67184844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>. </p>



<p><strong><strong>Assessment</strong>:</strong> And now we’re cooking! This is a <em>shockingly</em> good and comprehensive list. All the albums are thrash, and the dates it supplies are correct (even when they aren’t a multiple of 5). This surpasses March!GPT4, and blows June!GPT4 out of the water. </p>



<p><strong>Quibbles and points of interest</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>The genesis of the thrash metal genre is typically dated to 1981, with “Hit the Lights” by Leather Charm (a proto-Metallica band by James Hetfield and Ron McGovney). Late 1970s is a stretch. </li>



<li>It lumps a 1992 album into the 1995 bracket, when 1990 would make more sense.</li>



<li>It tries to put five albums in every year (and when it can’t find any, it counts thrash albums from surrounding years—you can actually see thrash metal’s commercial collapse in the mid 90s from this!). As with the Italian history example, I am struck by the sense that it interprets prompts too literally. I did not specify a number of albums, so it just glommed onto the number 5. </li>



<li><em>“Given that my last training data ends in 2021, I won’t have exhaustive knowledge of 2020 albums.”</em> ???</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: inconclusive. </p>



<p>Some answers were worse. Some were better. The thrash metal answer was a star turn. Sept!GPT-4 is more of a metalhead than an alt-rock fan, I’d say.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_3_Quake_Polygons"></span>Test 3: Quake Polygons<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How many polygons could the videogame Quake render per frame?”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse/#Part_3_Quake_Polygons">March!GPT4 and June!GPT4’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e8e48350-6cff-4eca-aaac-55475268f684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“The original “Quake,” developed by id Software and released in 1996, was a pioneering game in terms of its 3D graphics engine. While modern games boast the capacity to render millions or even billions of polygons per frame, games in the mid-90s operated under much more constrained hardware capabilities.</em></p>



<p><em>“Quake” didn’t rely on hardware acceleration initially; it was rendered in software mode. In software mode, Quake’s performance heavily depended on the CPU. The actual number of polygons “Quake” could render per frame varied based on the scene, the level of detail, and the capabilities of the machine it ran on.</em></p>



<p><em>Typically, Quake’s scenes ranged from a few hundred to a few thousand polygons. The more detailed scenes could potentially push towards the upper end of this range. With the advent of hardware-accelerated graphics (like with the introduction of 3Dfx’s Voodoo graphics cards), “Quake” could benefit from increased performance, allowing for smoother gameplay at higher resolutions.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s worth noting that this is a very general estimate and the actual number could vary based on multiple factors, including scene complexity, active game entities, and hardware specifics.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong><strong>Assessment</strong></strong>: I didn’t ask for a book report and “billions of polygons” is stupid. But the core answer of “a few hundred to a few thousand polygons” is correct, and may even be superior to March!GPT4, which stuck to the lower end of that range. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: inconclusive.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_4_Rope_Burn_Puzzle"></span>Test 4: Rope Burn Puzzle<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>“You have three ropes and some matches. The ropes burn irregularly like fuses when lit at either end. The first rope burns in 48 minutes, the second rope burns in 72 minutes and the third rope burns in 128 minutes. How can you produce a time interval of 61 minutes?”</em></p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse/#Part_4_Rope_Burn_Puzzle">March!GPT4 and June!GPT4’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/01a94e3a-6ce3-4bff-9080-c799bc993fe4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a></p>



<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: The fuck did I just read?</p>



<p>It’s hard to judge whether it does better or worse than March!GPT4 or June!GPT4. I’m starting to think this puzzle is simply beyond GPT4’s pay grade. I’ve tried it dozens of times and with many wordings. It does not ever solve it.</p>



<p>It grasps the <em>principle</em>, grasps the underlying method (burning ropes at multiple ends), but it always makes the same mistake—burning the wrong rope, and then trying to weasel out by saying “measure time using some other method.”</p>



<p>Gemini will launch soon. I wonder if it can solve it?</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rope burning puzzles are a common class of interview question. GPT-4 can solve a two-rope variant easily. This three-rope variant is from <a href="https://momath.org/home/varsity-math/varsity-math-week-151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varsity Math Week 151</a>. Notably, the <em>answer </em>is also on the internet (and probably in GPT4’s training data)…but it’s in Varsity Math Week 152. Maybe if both the puzzle and the answer were on the same page, GPT4 would solve it. I don’t know how this stuff works. </p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>My tests (for the little they’re worth) show no consistent pattern. Sometimes GPT4 does better than before, sometimes worse. </p>



<p>This is not testing, it’s sheep-entrail reading. I <em>do </em>faintly suspect it’s worse on obscure general knowledge, but I don’t believe that hard enough to bet almost any amount of money.</p>



<p><a href="https://coagulopath.com/witches-vs-chatgpt/">As I’ve said before, AIs present a fluctuating target.</a> I do not think they have a stable “baseline” ability that remains resilient to prompting differences and stochastic factors. In any event, OpenAI has many dials they can turn behind the scenes. </p>



<p>We’d learn more about this beast over hundreds or thousands of tests. But GPT-4 is too expensive for that to be realistic. OpenAI could really help the community by offering an academic discount—not that weirdos on the internet would qualify, of course!</p>



<p>Lastly, a “good” response is more subjective than I thought. Is it better for a wrong answer to have 500 words or 10 words? Is it better for an AI to try and fail, or to simply give up? When a query has conflicting requirements (“I want a list of all college majors in the US. Do not use more than 10 words.”) what should it do? And when a technically “correct” answer is <em>bad for the user </em>(consider XY problems such as “how do I echo the last three letters of a filename?”—GPT4 flunks this one, by the way), what do we want an AI to do?</p>



<p>GPT4 has changed and will continue to change. We’d be wise to do the same. I will be far less confident in my future predictions. When I say AI has gotten dumb, I might be speaking into a mirror.</p>
