            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/hacker-news-now-runs-on-top-of-common-lisp/">https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/hacker-news-now-runs-on-top-of-common-lisp/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44099006">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> was written in the
<a href="http://arclanguage.org/">Arc</a> lisp dialect, a dialect created by Paul
Graham. Arc was implemented on top of Racket, but that has now
changed. HN runs on top of SBCL since a few months.</p>

<p>But why? For performance reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently noticed that Hacker News no longer uses paging for long
threads. In the past, when a discussion grew large, we had to click
“More” to load the next page of comments, and dang would
occasionally post helpful tips to remind us about this feature.
Was there an announcement regarding this change? Has anyone else still seen paging recently? I’d love to know more details—especially the technical aspects or considerations that went into the decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s because Clarc is finally out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41679215">dang, Sept. 2024</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Clarc] is much faster and also will easily let HN run on multiple cores. It’s been in the works for years, mainly because I rarely find time to work on it, but it’s all pretty close to done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32597291">dang, 2022</a></p>

<p>How it’s done:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there’s now an Arc-to-JS called Lilt, and an Arc-to-Common Lisp called Clarc. In order to make those easier to develop, we reworked the lower depths of the existing Arc implementation to build Arc up in stages. The bottom one is called arc0, then arc1 is written in arc0, and arc2 in arc1. The one at the top (arc2, I think) is full Arc. This isn’t novel, but it makes reimplementation easier since you pack as much as possible in the later stages, and only arc0 needs to be written in the underlying system (Racket, JS, or CL).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21550123">dang, 2019</a></p>

<p>But Clarc’s code isn’t released:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of the HN codebase consists of anti-abuse measures that would stop working if people knew about them. Unfortunately.
separating out the secret parts would by now be a lot of work. The time to do it will be if and when we eventually release the alternative Arc implementations we’ve been working on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21546438">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21546438</a></p>

<p>Congrats for the successful “splash-free” transition though.</p>

LaLiga’s 2024/2025 season is officially over. FC Barcelona were actually crowned champions on Thursday after it became mathematically impossible for Real Madrid to conjure up seven points or more from the six points available.</p>
<p>The final matches of the season were played on Sunday but with the championship settled, would LaLiga show restraint and taper down its blocking activity? Or perhaps it would continue under the authority of judge, despite the widespread collateral damage inflicted on innocent internet users since February, a scandal now known as #laligagate.</p>
<h2>In For a Penny?</h2>
<p>The early signs did little to inspire confidence. Protest website LaLigaGate.com was hit by a total blockade but whether the site was targeted deliberately or succumbed to collateral damage is unknown.</p>
<center><em>Intentional and Unintentional Blocking Look Identical</em><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">

<p>As the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/constitutional-court-urged-to-end-piracy-blockades-now-hurting-millions-250519/">latest data</a> suggests that mass blocking of Cloudflare in pursuit of 150 piracy platforms has negatively affected millions of innocent websites, use of the term ‘collateral damage’ may be running out of scope. </p>
<p>Unintentional overblocking became inevitable overblocking some time ago, a point certainly not lost on Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince.</p>
<p>Posting to X last week, Prince asked if anyone wanted any general feedback, declaring that he felt “in an especially truthful mood.” The first <a href="https://x.com/cisne_bayswater/status/1924962395010584847">response</a> contained direct questions about the LaLiga controversy, the blame for which LaLiga places squarely on the shoulders of Cloudflare. </p>
<p>For the first time since Cloudflare legal action <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/judge-confirms-laligas-right-to-block-cloudflare-in-pursuit-of-iptv-pirates-250328/">failed to end LaLiga’s blocking campaign</a>, Prince weighed in with his assessment of the current situation and where he believes it’s inevitably heading.</p>
<h2>“Bonkers” Blocking Strategy</h2>
<p>“A huge percentage of the Internet sits behind us, including small businesses and emergency resources in Spain,” Prince explained. </p>
<p>“The strategy of blocking broadly through ISPs based on IPs is bonkers because so much content, including emergency services content, can be behind any IP. <a href="https://x.com/eastdakota/status/1924969551478804543">The collateral damage is vast</a> and is hurting Spanish citizens from accessing critical resources,” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, various comments and statements by LaLiga suggested that its relationship with Cloudflare had reached rock bottom. It transpired that LaLiga had <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-asks-court-to-end-laligas-illegal-blocking-response-to-encrypted-client-hello-250220/">obtained an injunction</a> which allowed it to tackle Cloudflare and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/">Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</a>, but had done so without Cloudflare’s knowledge, effectively denying the company a right to respond.</p>
<p>Alongside other attacks delivered via the media, LaLiga slammed Cloudflare for refusing to cooperate. What action LaLiga had demanded still isn’t clear, but the league said that if there was any overblocking as a result, Cloudflare would have to shoulder the blame.</p>
<h2>The Potential for Deadly Consequences</h2>
<p>The scale of overblocking reported in Spain is unprecedented but since LaLiga has a court order that effectively gives Cloudflare blocking a green light, it has been doing so in bulk, every single week since February.</p>
<p>Depending on who addresses the overblocking issue, with whom and when, the league claims that collateral damage a) doesn’t exist or is minimal and/or b) is Cloudflare’s responsibility. Prince appears to have grave concerns over the scale and type of blocking taking place, warning that a worst-case scenario is inevitable.</p>
<h2>Football Piracy Blocks Will Claim Lives</h2>
<p>Despite LaLiga’s unshakable claims to the contrary, Prince believes that it’s not a case of ‘if’ disaster strikes, it’s ‘when’.</p>
<p>“It’s only a matter of time before a Spanish citizen can’t access a life-saving emergency resource because the rights holder in a football match refuses to send a limited request to block one resource versus a broad request to block a whole swath of the Internet,” Prince warned.</p>
<p>“When that unfortunately and inevitably happens and harms lives, I’m confident policy makers and courts in Spain and elsewhere will make the right policy decision. Until then, it’ll be up to users to make politicians clear on the risk. I pray no one dies.”</p>
<p>The suggestion that LaLiga’s demands were too broad, doesn’t mean that Cloudflare is refusing to help, Prince suggested. On the contrary, there’s a process available, LaLiga just needs to use it.</p>
<p>“We’ve always been happy and willing to work with rights holders in conjunction with judicial bodies to protect their content. We have a clear process that works around the world to do that, Prince explained.</p>
<h2>LaLiga Targeted Cloudflare and Others During the Weekend</h2>
<p>Live blocking data provided by <a href="https://hayahora.futbol/">hayahora.futbol</a> has proven invaluable to those documenting #laligagate in recent months and this past weekend was no different. </p>
<p>As the small sample of Cloudflare IP addresses blocked on Sunday seems to show, concerns that every IP address blocked would inevitably result in collateral damage, seem to have been trumped by the authority of the now-famous court order.</p>

<p>The importance of strict adherence to the law was underlined by LaLiga’s Global Content Protection Manager in a recent interview.</p>
<p>José Ignacio Carrillo de Albornoz told <a href="https://www.elconfidencial.com/deportes/2025-05-19/pirateria-iptv-ilegal-futbol-carrillo-albornoz-laliga-bra_4130314/">El Confidencial</a> that without the collaboration of intermediaries, piracy will be impossible to beat. Carrillo de Albornoz concluded with a “statement of responsibility” which notes that real progress will require all parties to work together and go beyond compliance with the law.</p>
<p>“It is necessary that all links in the digital chain act legally and ethically,” he said.</p>

        <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16skyv003l3b75xennbqe3@published" data-word-count="132">By now, there’s a good chance you’ve encountered <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-if-googles-biggest-problem-isnt-ai.html">Google</a>’s <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-ai-search-blew-up-in-googles-face.html">AI Overviews</a>, possibly thousands of times. Appearing as blurbs at the top of search results, they attempt to settle your queries before you scroll —&nbsp;to offer answers, or relevant information, gleaned from websites that you no longer need to click on. The feature was officially rolled out at Google’s developer conference last year and had been in testing for quite some time before that; on the occasion of this year’s conference, the company characterized it as “one of the most successful launches in Search in the past decade,” a strangely narrow claim that is almost certainly true: Google put AI summaries on top of everything else, <em>for everyone,</em> as if to say, “Before you use our main product, see if this works instead.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smj6003u3b752xzbw234@published" data-word-count="166">This year’s conference included another change to search, this one more profound but less aggressively deployed. “AI Mode,” which has similarly been in beta testing for a while, will appear as an option for all users. It’s not like AI Overviews; that is, it’s not an extra module taking up space on a familiar search-results page but rather a complete replacement for conventional search. It’s Google’s “most powerful AI search, with more advanced reasoning and multimodality, and the ability to go deeper through follow-up questions and helpful links to the web,” the company says, “breaking down your question into subtopics and issuing a multitude of queries simultaneously on your behalf.” It’s available to everyone. It’s a lot like using AI-first chatbots that have search functions, like those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, and Google says it’s destined for greater things than a small tab. “As we get feedback, we’ll graduate many features and capabilities from AI Mode right into the core Search experience,” the company says.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smj8003v3b75lnhxrn6u@published" data-word-count="95">I’ve been testing AI Mode for a few months now, and in some ways it’s less radical than it sounds and (at first) feels. It resembles the initial demos of AI search tools, including those by Google, meaning it responds to many questions with clean, ad-free answers. Sometimes it answers in extended plain language, but it also makes a lot of lists and pulls in familiar little gridded modules — especially when you ask about things you can buy —&nbsp;resulting in a product that, despite its chatty interface, feels an awful lot like … search.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smj9003w3b75yjto7g9i@published" data-word-count="45">Again, now you can try it yourself, and your mileage may vary; it hasn’t drawn me away from Google proper for a lot of thoughtless rote tasks, but it’s competitive with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">ChatGPT</a> for the expanding range of searchish tasks you might attempt with a chatbot.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smj9003x3b75nlrj12el@published" data-word-count="60">From the very first use, however, AI Mode crystallized something about Google’s priorities and in particular its relationship to the web from which the company has drawn, and returned, many hundreds of billions of dollars of value. AI Overviews demoted links, quite literally pushing content from the web <em>down </em>on the page, and summarizing its contents for digestion without clicking:</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smj9003y3b75lx2t35qn@published" data-word-count="55">Meanwhile, AI Mode all but <em>buries</em> them, not just summarizing their content for reading within Google’s product but inviting you to explore and expand on those summaries by asking more questions, rather than clicking out. In many cases, links are retained merely to provide backup and sourcing, included as footnotes and appendices rather than destinations:</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smj9003z3b758uul90hq@published" data-word-count="117">This is typical with AI search tools and all but inevitable now that such things are possible. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-ai-search-blew-up-in-googles-face.html">In terms of automation</a>, this means companies like OpenAI and Google are mechanizing some of the “work” that goes into using tools like Google search, removing, when possible, the step where users leave their platforms and reducing, in theory, the time and effort it takes to navigate to somewhere else when necessary. In even broader terms —&nbsp;contra Google’s effort to brand this as “going beyond information to intelligence” —&nbsp;this is an example of how LLMs offer <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/for-big-tech-the-future-is-agi-what-about-the-rest-of-us.html">different ways to interact with much of the same information</a>: summarization rather than retrieval, regeneration rather than fact-finding, and vibe-y reconstruction over deterministic reproduction.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smja00403b750cs445ua@published" data-word-count="60">This is interesting to think about and often compelling to use but leaves unresolved one of the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/google-and-bing-are-a-mess-will-ai-solve-their-problems.html">first questions</a> posed by chatbots-as-search: Where will they get all the data they need to <em>continue</em> to work well? When Microsoft and Google showed off their first neo-search mockups in 2023, which are pretty close to today’s AI mode, it revealed <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/google-and-bing-are-a-mess-will-ai-solve-their-problems.html">a dilemma</a>:</p>

  <blockquote data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/blockquote/instances/cmb17xx2u005m3b75pbw04d4t@published" data-editable="text" data-word-count="66"><p>Search engines still provide the de facto gateway to the broader web, and have a deeply codependent relationship with the people and companies whose content they crawl, index, and rank; a Google that instantly but sometimes unreliably summarizes the websites to which it used to send people would destroy that relationship, and probably a lot of websites, including the ones on which its models were trained.</p></blockquote>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smjb00423b7540uam6rd@published" data-word-count="195">And, well, yep! Now, both AI Overviews and AI Mode, when they aren’t occasionally hallucinating, produce relatively clean answers that benefit in contrast to increasingly degraded regular search results on Google, which are full of hyperoptimized and duplicative spamlike content designed <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-product-recommendations-broke-google.html">first and foremost</a> with the demands of Google’s ranking algorithms and advertising in mind. AI Mode feels one step further removed from that ecosystem and once again looks good in contrast, a placid textual escape from Google’s own mountain of links that look like ads and ads that look like links (of course, Google is already working on ads for both Overviews and AI Mode). In its drive to embrace AI, Google is further concealing the raw material that fuels it, demoting links as it continues to ingest them for abstraction. Google may still retain plenty of <em>attention </em>to monetize and perhaps keep even more of it for itself, now that it doesn’t need to send people elsewhere; in the process, however, it really <em>is</em> starving the web that supplies it with data on which to train and<em> </em>from which to draw up-to-date details. (Or, one might say, putting it out of its misery.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smjb00433b754e1zh54e@published" data-word-count="84">Two years later, Google has become more explicit about the extent to which it’s moving on from the “you provide us results to rank, and we send you visitors to monetize” bargain, with the head of search telling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-io/670439/google-ai-mode-search-io-2025">The Verge</a>, “I think the search results page was a construct.” Which is true, as far as it goes, but also a remarkable thing to hear from a company that’s communicated carefully and voluminously to website operators about small updates to its search algorithms for years.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smjb00443b75nurt0wq2@published" data-word-count="152">I don’t doubt that Google has been thinking about this stuff for a while and that there are people at the company who deem it strategically irrelevant or at least of secondary importance to winning the AI race —&nbsp;the <em>fate of the web</em> might not sound terribly important when your bosses are talking nonstop about cashing out its accumulated data and expertise for <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/for-big-tech-the-future-is-agi-what-about-the-rest-of-us.html">AGI</a>. I also don’t want to be precious about the web as it actually exists in 2025, nor do I suggest that websites working with or near companies like Meta and Google should have expected anything but <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/how-buzzfeed-news-went-bust.html">temporary, incidental alignment</a> with their businesses. If I had to guess, the future of Google search looks more like AI Overviews than AI mode —&nbsp;a jumble of widgets and modules including and united by AI-generated content, rather than a clean break — if only for purposes of sustaining Google’s multi-hundred-billion-dollar advertising business.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb16smjb00453b75vrxcg0bj@published" data-word-count="197">But I also don’t want to assume Google knows exactly how this stuff will play out for<em> Google</em>, much less what it will actually mean for millions of websites, and their visitors, if Google stops sending as many people beyond its results pages. Google’s push into productizing generative AI is substantially fear-driven, faith-based, and informed by the actions of competitors that are far less invested in and dependent on the vast collection of behaviors —&nbsp;websites full of content authentic and inauthentic, volunteer and commercial, social and antisocial, archival and up-to-date —&nbsp;that make up what’s left of the web and have far less to lose. Maybe, in a few years, a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/the-agentic-web-and-original-sin/">fresh economy</a> will grow around the new behaviors produced by searchlike AI tools; perhaps companies like OpenAI and Google will sign a bunch more <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/what-do-ai-companies-want-with-the-media.html">licensing</a> deals; conceivably, this style of search automation simply collapses the marketplace supported by search, leveraging training based on years of scraped data to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-ate-the-web-now-its-coming-back-for-seconds.html">do more with less</a>. In any case, the signals from Google —&nbsp;despite its <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-search-clicks-fell-report-455498">unconvincing suggestions</a> to the contrary — are clear: It’ll do anything to win the AI race. If that means burying the web, then so be it.</p>

		<p><span>A serendipitous observation in a Chemical Engineering lab at Penn Engineering has led to a surprising discovery: a new class of nanostructured materials that can pull water from the air, collect it in pores and release it onto surfaces without the need for any external energy. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu8349">The research</a>, published in </span><i><span>Science Advances</span></i><span>, was conducted by an interdisciplinary team, including </span><a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/daeyeon-lee/"><span>Daeyeon Lee</span></a><span>, Russell Pearce and Elizabeth Crimian Heuer Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE), </span><a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/amish-j-patel/"><span>Amish Patel</span></a><span>, Professor in CBE, Baekmin Kim, a postdoctoral scholar in Lee’s lab and first author, and </span><a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/guldin-stefan"><span>Stefan Guldin</span></a><span>, Professor in Complex Soft Matter at the Technical University of Munich. Their work describes a material</span> <span>that</span> <span>could open the door to new ways to collect water from the air in arid regions and devices that cool electronics or buildings using the power of evaporation.</span></p>

<p><span>“We weren’t even trying to collect water,” says Lee. “We were working on another project testing the combination of hydrophilic nanopores and hydrophobic polymers when R Bharath Venkatesh, a former Ph.D. student in our lab, noticed water droplets appearing on a material we were testing. It didn’t make sense. That’s when we started asking questions.”</span></p>
<p><span>Those questions led to an in-depth study of a new type of amphiphilic nanoporous material: one that blends water-loving (hydrophilic) and water-repelling (hydrophobic) components in a unique nanoscale structure. The result is a material that both captures moisture from air and simultaneously pushes that moisture out as droplets.</span></p>
<p><b>Water-Collecting Nanopores</b></p>
<p><span>When water condenses on surfaces, it usually requires either a drop in temperature or very high humidity levels. Conventional water harvesting methods rely on these principles, often requiring energy input to chill surfaces or a dense fog to form to collect water passively from humid environments. But Lee and Patel’s system works differently.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of cooling, their material relies on capillary condensation, a process where water vapor condenses inside tiny pores even at lower humidity. This is not new. What </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> new is that in their system, the water doesn’t just stay trapped inside the pores, as it usually does in these types of materials.</span></p>
<p><span>“In typical nanoporous materials, once the water enters the pores, it stays there,” explains Patel. “But in our material, the water moves, first condensing inside the pores, then emerging onto the surface as droplets. That’s never been seen before in a system like this, and at first we doubted our observations.”</span></p>
<p><b>A Material That Defies Physics&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Before they understood what was happening, the researchers first thought that water was simply condensing onto the surface of the material due to</span> <span>an artifact of their experimental setup, such as a temperature gradient in the lab. To rule that out, they increased the thickness of the material to see if the amount of water collected on the surface would change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“If what we were observing was due to surface condensation alone, the thickness of the material wouldn’t change the amount of water present,” explains Lee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, the total amount of water collected increased as the film’s thickness increased, proving that the water droplets forming on the surface came from inside the material.</span></p>
<p><span>Even more surprising: the droplets didn’t evaporate quickly, as thermodynamics would predict.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“According to the curvature and size of the droplets, they should have been evaporating,” says Patel. “But they were not; they remained stable for extended periods.”</span></p>
<p><span>With a material that could potentially defy the laws of physics on their hands, Lee and Patel sent their design off to a collaborator to see if their results were replicable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We study porous films under a wide range of conditions, using subtle changes in light polarization to probe complex nanoscale phenomena,” says Guldin. “But we’ve never seen anything like this. It’s absolutely fascinating and will clearly spark new and exciting research.”</span></p>

<p><b>A Stabilized Cycle of Condensation and Release</b></p>
<p><span>It turns out that they had created a material with just the right balance of water-attracting nanoparticles and water-repelling plastic — polyethylene — to create a nanoparticle film with this special property.</span></p>
<p><span>“We accidentally hit the sweet spot,” says Lee. “The droplets are connected to hidden reservoirs in the pores below.

<p><span>Beyond the physics-defying behavior, the materials’ simplicity is part of what makes them so promising.

<p><span>“We’re still uncovering the mechanisms at play,” says Patel. “But the potential is exciting. We’re learning from biology — how cells and proteins manage water in complex environments — and applying that to design better materials.”</span></p>
<p><span>“This is exactly what Penn does best, bringing together expertise in chemical engineering, materials science, chemistry and biology to solve big problems,” adds Lee.</span></p>
<p><span>The next steps include studying how to optimize the balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, scale the material for real-world use and investigating how to make the collected droplets roll off surfaces efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, the researchers hope this discovery will lead to technologies that offer clean water in dry climates or more sustainable cooling methods using only the water vapor already in the air.</span></p>

            <p><i>If you don't care about the explanation and want a direct link to the simulation, <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/webgpu/particle-life.html">here you go</a>.</i></p>

            <p>You might know that I'm a <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/soft-body-physics.html">sucker</a> for <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/structural-mechanics-2.html">physics</a> <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/simulating-water-over-terrain.html">simulations</a>, and <a href="https://lisyarus.itch.io/particle-simulator">particle simulations</a> in particular. Usually I implement something based on conventional physics, but recently I've stumbled upon a funny non-physical model that can display...well, let's call it <i>life-like</i> behavior.</p>

            <p>I've made a prototype in C++ using my pet engine, but then I decided it would be fun to try making it run in browser, using the WebGPU API. It works surprisingly well, and can produce fun simulations like this:</p>

            <center><video muted="" loop="" controls=""><source src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/simulation-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

            <p>In this post I'll describe how it works under the hood.</p>

            <h2>Contents</h2>
            <ul id="contents"></ul>

            <h2 id="section-the-particle-life-model">The Particle Life Model</h2>

            <p>There are quite a number of resources (primarily, videos) online that talk about this model, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vk7YvBYpOs">this</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YirERTVF0">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_zmZ23grXE">this</a>, and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scvuli-zcRc&amp;t=396s">this one</a> talks about the exact formulas used in the simulation. Due to a rather pretentious name composed of two overused words, googling "particle life" doesn't bring stuff of any relevance (apart from the YouTube videos), so I wasn't able to trace the origins of this model. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiUpAeos168">One video</a> claims that this model was inspired by some microbiology studies, which seems believable given how organic and mobile the resulting simulations look.</p>

            <p>This model isn't in any way related to Conway's Game of Life (despite the name). It's more like <a href="https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/particle-lenia">Particle Lenia</a>, if anything, though the rules are much simpler.</p>

            <p>The core idea goes like this: we run a typical physics simulation with point particles, but the forces between particles can be <i>asymmetric</i>: particle A can <i>attract</i> particle B, but particle B can <i>repel</i> particle A (or attract it with a larger/smaller force, etc). This immediately violates Newton's third law, thus it violates almost all conservation laws (specifically, energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation).</p>

            <p>This might sound strange and unphysical, but</p>

            <ol>
                <li>We're not bound by physical laws when coding simulations,</li>
                <li>This brings an extra source of energy, which is kinda what living organisms do.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Living creatures consume food and oxygen (and sometimes other chemicals) and turn them into energy, which they can use to move and find more consumable stuff. The asymmetric forces of Particle Life emulate that by skipping the chemicals-to-energy cycle and just adds extra energy to the system.</p>

            <p>It also allows particles to chase each other, e.g. in the scenario above particle B will constantly chase after particle A, which will in turn run away from particle B, which also kinda emulates predator-prey stuff from biology. However, in this model particles aren't created or destroyed, so particle B will never actually "eat" particle A.</p>

            <p>For simplicity and to add some coherence to the simulation, particles are usually split into several <i>types</i>, with a table specifying the interaction for each pair of particle types. Specifically, I used the model suggested by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiUpAeos168">this video</a>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For any two particle types A and B, the force experienced by A from B consists of two parts: the <i>interaction force</i>, and the <i>collision force</i>.</li>
                <li>Interaction force can be either attractive or repulsive.</li>
                <li>Collision force is always repulsive.</li>
                <li>Both forces are specified by a radius and a strength factor. Positive strength means attraction, negative strength means repulsion. (For collision force it is always repulsion).</li>
                <li>Collision force radius is always smaller than interaction force radius (i.e. collision is close-range, interaction is far-range).</li>
                <li>Collision force strength is always larger than interaction force strength.</li>
                <li>Both forces decrease linearly with distance, upon reaching the radius value, at which they are zero.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In formulas, the linear dependence of force on distance can be written as</p><p>

            \[ F(r) = A\cdot \max\left(0, \frac{|r-R|}{R}\right) \]

            </p><p>where \(A\) is the force strength (negative for repulsion), \(R\) is the force radius, and \(r\) is the distance between the two particles.</p>

            <p>Here's a plot of force as a function of distance, with \(A=5\) and \(R=10\):</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/plot-force.png"></center>

            <p>And here's the corresponding potential energy, if you're into some physics:</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/plot-energy.png"></center>

            <p>Here's the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ram14bkp1r">Desmos link</a> where you can play with these values.</p>

            <p>If we add the collision force and, say, an attraction force, we get this plot of force vs distance:</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/plot-force-combined.png"></center>

            <p>And the potential energy:</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/plot-energy-combined.png"></center>

            <p>Again, here's the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nebtb6ltme">Desmos link</a> for these.</p>

            <p>As you can see, for the collision + attraction case, there's a local minimum at some distance, where the force is equal to zero. This would be the "sweet spot" for particles, i.e. they'll tend to maintain this distance if possible.</p>

            <p>Notice that the force (and thus also the energy) doesn't go to infinity when distance is close to zero, like it does in a typical \(\frac{1}{r}\) potential from gravity or electromagnetism. This means that our collision force has finite strength, and can be overcome by sufficiently strong other forces, or if the collision radius is small enough. E.g. on this screenshot multiple particles merged into one:</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/merged.png"></center>

            <p>This is fine, though, since it produces interesting behaviours, and it prevents our forces from escalating too much (which typically happens with a \(\frac{1}{r}\) potential simulations).</p>

            <p>I also have a global constant friction parameter which simply decreases all velocities with time. This is to keep the simulation somewhat stable, because otherwise it constantly gains energy, and everything just accelerates to infinity.</p>

            <h2 id="section-why-webgpu">Why WebGPU?</h2>

            <p>It should be clear why I decided to move the simulation to the GPU — after all, that's a typical massively parallel task, and GPUs shine at those. But why specifically WebGPU?</p>

            <p>If you've been following me for a while, you might know that I'm in awe with WebGPU. I've been using OpenGL for more than a decade and I'm sick of it. It's a very old, stupidly inconsistent API full of legacy decisions, which stopped evolving some 8 years ago. However, Vulkan, which is the supposed alternative modern API, takes 1000 lines of setup work <i>just to show a triangle on screen</i>, without even any vertex buffers &amp; attributes. Don't get me wrong, Vulkan is pretty cool, but I just don't have <i>that</i> much spare time to use it in my pet projects.</p>

            <p>Now, WebGPU fills this niche for me. It is a modern &amp; clean API that at the same time is reasonably non-verbose. It feels just like what real-time graphics should be about, — or at least that's what I feel while using it. I already used it in a few desktop projects (via <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native">wgpu-native</a>), including a <a href="https://github.com/lisyarus/webgpu-raytracer">full Monte-Carlo raytracer</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/lisyarus/webgpu-shallow-water">shallow water simulator</a>, and I'm using it in my current main project, which is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSGI94QoFYJwGaieAkqw5_qfoupdppxHN">medieval village building game</a>, and I'm really happy with this API.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, being a modern API, it supports stuff like compute shaders and atomics, which are crucial for this simulation, as we'll see later. As far as I know, WebGL doesn't support these features.</p>

            <p>And, as a nice bonus, it actually runs in browser! Or, at least in some experimental versions of some browsers, under some flags, but the situation should get better with time.</p>

            <h2 id="section-simulation-loop">Simulation loop</h2>

            <p>So, how do we simulate particles with WebGPU? The simulation loop itself is rather straightforward:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If not paused,</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>For each particle, compute the forces acting on this particle by other particles, and add the resulting acceleration to the particle's velocity</li>
                    <li>For each particle, move its position using the newly-computed velocity</li>
                    <li>Apply boundary conditions</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Render the particles</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method">semi-implicit Euler integrator</a>, which is easy to code and has some nice theoretical properties.</p>

            <p>I store the particles in a single large GPU buffer. A particle is just a simple struct like this:</p>

            <pre><code>struct Particle
{
    // Position
    x : f32,
    y : f32,

    // Velocity
    vx : f32,
    vy : f32,

    // Type
    species : f32,
}</code></pre>

            <p><i>I'm not storing position and velocity as <code>vec2f</code> just for alignment requirements, and I'm storing the particle type as an <code>f32</code> just to be able to load particles from JavaScript as a single large <code>Float32Array</code>.</i></p>

            <p>So, a particle is just 5 floats, i.e. 20 bytes. In theory, we could just run a single compute shader per particle, which loops over all particles, computes all the forces, and updates velocity and position. However, computing forces quickly becomes the bottleneck: it's a \(O(N^2)\) operation in total, because we need to compute all pairwise forces between all particles. This severely limits the number of particles we can process. My earlier CPU implementation only got to 4096 particles, even with multithreading.</p>

            <p>We need to be clever about computing forces, which is why this is a separate compute pass. After that, things are pretty straightforward: a single compute shader invocation for each particle moves it forward using the computed velocity, then handles collisions with simulation borders:</p>

            <pre><code>@group(0) @binding(0) var&lt;storage, read_write&gt; particles : array&lt;Particle&gt;;

@group(1) @binding(0) var&lt;uniform&gt; simulationOptions : SimulationOptions;

@compute @workgroup_size(64)
fn particleAdvance(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id : vec3u)
{
    // Protect against reading &amp; writing past array end
    if (id.x &gt;= arrayLength(&amp;particles)) {
        return;
    }

    let width = simulationOptions.right - simulationOptions.left;
    let height = simulationOptions.top - simulationOptions.bottom;

    var particle = particles[id.x];

    // Apply friction
    particle.vx *= simulationOptions.friction;
    particle.vy *= simulationOptions.friction;

    // Move particle using velocity
    particle.x += particle.vx * simulationOptions.dt;
    particle.y += particle.vy * simulationOptions.dt;

    // Collide with borders
    if (particle.x &lt; simulationOptions.left) {
        particle.x = simulationOptions.left;
        particle.vx *= -1.0;
    }

    if (particle.x &gt; simulationOptions.right) {
        particle.x = simulationOptions.right;
        particle.vx *= -1.0;
    }

    if (particle.y &lt; simulationOptions.bottom) {
        particle.y = simulationOptions.bottom;
        particle.vy *= -1.0;
    }

    if (particle.y &gt; simulationOptions.top) {
        particle.y = simulationOptions.top;
        particle.vy *= -1.0;
    }

    // Write the new state of the particle
    particles[id.x] = particle;
}</code></pre>

            <p><i>(My actual code also handles mouse interaction &amp; looping borders, but the idea is the same.)</i></p>

            <p>The <code>simulationOptions.friction</code> is actually something like \(\exp(-\text{friction}\cdot\Delta t)\), for reasons explained in <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/exponential-smoothing.html">my other article</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="section-computing-interactions">Computing interactions</h2>

            <p>Before advancing the particles, though, we need to compute the inter-particle forces. The main trick is to use the fact that all forces have finite radius, and after a certain distance all forces are zero. In my implementation, I only allow forces with radius up to 32. Thus, I know that any pair of particles further than 32 units of distance apart cannot interact at all.</p>

            <p>To utilize this, we use the typical approach of spatial hashing/binning: make a square grid with cells/bins of size \(32\times 32\), sort the particles into these bins, then compute interactions only between neighbouring bins. This sounds easy, and is actually almost trivial to implement on the CPU (e.g. in C++ just make a 2D array, each storing <code>std::vector&lt;particle&gt;</code>, and you're good to go). However, building such data structures on the GPU takes a lot of effort — we can't, for example, allocate GPU memory directly from a shader!.</p>

            <p>Instead, we'll use a linearized structure to store the bins. Here's how it works: we'll have an array of particles, where particles that reside in the same bin occupy a contiguous section of this array. Then, we'll also have an array which stores the start of this section (i.e. the offset) for each bin. We don't need to store the end of it, because the end of a bin is exactly the start of the next bin! We could also store the particle IDs instead of particles themselves, but that's another indirection which could hurt memory access performance later, when we compute the forces.</p>

            <p>To do this, we use a typical three-phase approach:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Phase 1: compute the number of particles in each bin</li>
                <li>Phase 2: run parallel prefix sum to compute the offset for each bin</li>
                <li>Phase 3: place each particle into the corresponding bin</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Phases 1 and 3 make heavy use of shader atomics. Phase 1 is fairly simple — run a compute shader for each particle, compute the (linearized) bin index for this particle, and increment the size of this bin:</p>

            <pre><code>@group(0) @binding(0) var&lt;storage, read&gt; particles : array&lt;Particle&gt;;

@group(1) @binding(0) var&lt;uniform&gt; simulationOptions : SimulationOptions;

@group(2) @binding(0) var&lt;storage, read_write&gt; binSize : array&lt;atomic&lt;u32&gt;&gt;;

@compute @workgroup_size(64)
fn fillBinSize(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id : vec3u)
{
    if (id.x &gt;= arrayLength(&amp;particles)) {
        return;
    }

    // Read the particle data
    let particle = particles[id.x];

    // Compute the linearized bin index
    let binIndex = getBinInfo(vec2f(particle.x, particle.y),
        simulationOptions).binIndex;

    // Increment the size of the bin
    atomicAdd(&amp;binSize[binIndex + 1], 1u);
}</code></pre>

            <p>Since this is done in parallel by many shader invocations, we need to use atomics here. I'm actually incrementing array at index <code>binIndex + 1</code>, and leaving the 0-th element at the value of 0, because this way <code>binOffset[i + 1] - binOffset[i]</code> always gives you the size of the i-th bin. Note that in this case the <code>binSize</code> array size is 1 plus the actual number of bins.</p>

            <p>Here, <code>getBinInfo</code> is just some helper function that computes the linearized bin index from the particle position and the size of the whole grid of bins:</p>

            <pre><code>fn getBinInfo(position : vec2f, simulationOptions : SimulationOptions) -&gt; BinInfo
{
    let binSize = simulationOptions.binSize;
    let gridSize = simulationOptions.gridSize;

    let binId = vec2i(
        clamp(i32(floor((position.x - simulationOptions.left) / binSize)), 0, gridSize.x - 1),
        clamp(i32(floor((position.y - simulationOptions.bottom) / binSize)), 0, gridSize.y - 1)
    );

    let binIndex = binId.y * gridSize.x + binId.x;

    return BinInfo(binId, binIndex);
}</code></pre>

            <p><i>(N.B.: in my actual code, <code>gridSize</code> is not passed as a uniform, but computed in-place, because I did it this way first and then never changed that.)</i></p>

            <p>In Phase 2, we need to convert the array of bin sizes into an array of bin offsets. Since the particles from the same bin go continuously in memory, a bin with some index starts when we've already put all the particles from bins with smaller indices into the array. This means that the offset \(O[i]\) of the i-th bin is simply the sum of the sizes \(S[j]\) of all preceding bins: \(O[i] = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{i-1} S[j]\). In pseudocode:</p>

            <pre><code>offset[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i &lt; binCount; ++i)
    binOffset[i] = binOffset[i - 1] + binSize[i];</code></pre>

            <p>This is known as computing <i>prefix sums</i>. This is, of course, not a parallel algorithm. To harness the power of the GPU, we'd want to run a parallel algorithm that does that. This is known, of course, as the <i>parallel prefix sum</i> problem, and we'll talk about it in the next section.</p>

            <p>For now, let's assume we've computed these offsets somehow. In Phase 3, we need to place ("sort") the particles into a new array, based on which bin this particle belongs to. We do this by running a per-particle compute shader once again. Because we want to put different particles into different indices in the new array, we need to use atomics again:</p>

            <pre><code>@group(0) @binding(0) var&lt;storage, read&gt; source : array&lt;Particle&gt;;
@group(0) @binding(1) var&lt;storage, read_write&gt; destination : array&lt;Particle&gt;;
@group(0) @binding(2) var&lt;storage, read&gt; binOffset : array&lt;u32&gt;;
@group(0) @binding(3) var&lt;storage, read_write&gt; binSize : array&lt;atomic&lt;u32&gt;&gt;;

@group(1) @binding(0) var&lt;uniform&gt; simulationOptions : SimulationOptions;

@compute @workgroup_size(64)
fn sortParticles(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id : vec3u)
{
    if (id.x &gt;= arrayLength(&amp;source)) {
        return;
    }

    // Read the particle data
    let particle = particles[id.x];

    // Compute the linearized bin index
    let binIndex = getBinInfo(vec2f(particle.x, particle.y),
        simulationOptions).binIndex;

    // Atomically compute the index of this particle
    // within the corresponding bin
    let indexInBin = atomicAdd(&amp;binSize[binIndex], 1);

    // Write the particle into the sorted array
    let newParticleIndex = binOffset[binIndex] + indexInBin;
    destination[newParticleIndex] = particle;
}</code></pre>

            <p>Here, we need to zero out the <code>binSize</code> array before running this shader. Again, since multiple shaders run in parallel, we use atomics to compute the index of a particle within its bin.</p>

            <p>Once we've done that, we can easily iterate over particles of a specific bin, which allows us to run the actual shader that computes per-particle forces, by only iterating over the neighbouring bins. Once again, a single shader invocation per each particle:</p>

            <p><i>(My actual code also includes a central force &amp; handling looping boundaries. I also read particles from one buffer and write them to another buffer, but the idea is the same.)</i></p>

            <p><code>forces</code> is a \(M^2\)-sized array (where \(M\) is the number of particle types) which stores the inter-particle force parameters.</p>

            <h2 id="section-parallel-prefix-sum">Parallel prefix sum</h2>

            <p>Computing prefix sums in parallel is a well-known problem. I'm using the simplest solution, outlined as the <i>Algorithm 1</i> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum#Algorithm_1:_Shorter_span,_more_parallel">wikipedia article</a>, and also called the <i>naive parallel scan</i> in this <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda">GPU Gems 3 article</a>.</p>

            <p>The image from wikipedia explains everything rather nicely:</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/prefix-sum.png"></center>

            <p>The main idea is to run several sweeps over the whole array \(\log_2(N)\) times (where \(N\) is the array size), each time adding <code>x[i-step]</code> to <code>x[i]</code>, where <code>step</code> is a power of 2. In pseudocode, at iteration <code>k</code> we do</p>

            <pre><code>step = (1 &lt;&lt; k);
parallel for (int i = step; i &lt; array.size; ++i)
    array[i] += array[i - step];
</code></pre>

            <p>We start iteration from <code>i = step</code> because otherwise at <code>array[i - step]</code> we'd try reading at an address before the array starts. This code won't actually work because overwriting <code>array[i]</code> affects what other invocations (with different values of <code>i</code>) will read, so we have to use 2 arrays: one for reading, and one for writing. Something like this:</p>

            <pre><code>parallel for (int i = 0; i &lt; input.size; ++i) {
    if (i &lt; step)
        output[i] = input[i];
    else
        output[i] = input[i] + input[i - step];
}</code></pre>

            <p>Then, to compute the actual prefix sum, we create a temporary array, and we ping-pong the input &amp; temporary arrays \(\log_2(N)\) times with <code>step</code> taking the values of increasing powers of 2. On the first iteration (<code>k = 0, step = 1</code>), our <code>binSize</code> array is the input, and the temporary array is the output. On the next iteration (<code>k = 1, step = 2</code>), the temporary array is the input, and the <code>binSize</code> array is the output, and so on. In terms of WebGPU, this requires creating two bind groups with the same layout, one that reads from <code>binSize</code> array and writes to temporary array, and the other does the opposite.</p>

            <p>Now, with this method, the resulting prefix sum will be in the first or the second array, depending on the parity of the number of steps performed, i.e. the parity of \(\log_2(N)\). That's rather inconvenient, so I always round it up to the closest even number: this way, the result is always in the same <code>binSize</code> array, while an extra prefix sum iteration would simply copy one buffer into the other automatically (look what happens with the code when <code>step &gt;= array.size</code>).</p>

            <p>That's a lot of talking, but the implementation is rather simple:</p>

            <pre><code>@group(0) @binding(0) var&lt;storage, read&gt; input : array&lt;u32&gt;;
@group(0) @binding(1) var&lt;storage, read_write&gt; output : array&lt;u32&gt;;
@group(0) @binding(2) var&lt;uniform&gt; stepSize : u32;

@compute @workgroup_size(64)
fn prefixSumStep(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id : vec3u)
{
    if (id.x &gt;= arrayLength(&amp;input)) {
        return;
    }

    if (id.x &lt; stepSize) {
        output[id.x] = input[id.x];
    } else {
        output[id.x] = input[id.x - stepSize] + input[id.x];
    }
}</code></pre>

            <p>In order to supply different <code>stepSize</code> values while still keeping the whole thing as a single compute pass, I have a buffer with all <code>stepSize</code> values I need, and use it as the source for the uniform <code>stepSize</code> value with proper dynamic offsets in the <code>GPUComputePassEncoder.setBindGroup</code> call.</p>

            <p>So, with \(\log_2(N)\) iterations (rounded up to an even number), we run this compute shader (one invocation per bin, — or, in my case, <code>binCount + 1</code> invocations for reasons I outlined earlier), while ping-ponging two buffers. Here's what it looks like in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>prefixSumIterations = Math.ceil(Math.ceil(Math.log2(binCount + 1)) / 2) * 2;

...

binningComputePass.setPipeline(binPrefixSumPipeline);
for (var i = 0; i &lt; prefixSumIterations; ++i) {
    binningComputePass.setBindGroup(0, binPrefixSumBindGroup[i % 2], [i * 256]);
    binningComputePass.dispatchWorkgroups(Math.ceil((binCount + 1) / 64));
}</code></pre>

            <p><i>(The <code>i * 256</code> dynamic offset is due to requirements that dynamic offsets must be a multiple of 256 bytes. The <code>Math.ceil((binCount + 1) / 64)</code> workgroup count is because the shader uses a workgroup size of 64, and I run it on an array of size <code>binCount + 1</code>.)</i></p>

            <p>I could use a more sophisticated prefix sum algorithm, but there was no need to: even with e.g. 10000 bins, this whole particle sorting &amp; prefix sum computation takes about 0.1ms on my GeForce GTX 1060. The whole performance is <i>always</i> dominated by inter-particle forces computation, so optimizing the binning step gives little profit.</p>

            <h2 id="section-rendering">Rendering</h2>

            <p>I render particles as squares which are transformed into perfect circles in the fragment shader. For each particle, I have 2 triangles, thus 6 or 4 vertices (with or without vertex duplication), all sharing the data of the same particle. That's rather inconvenient: I'd rather not duplicate the particle data and not use instancing for that. So, instead my vertices don't have any attributes, and instead read the particles array directly as a read-only storage buffer, based on the vertex ID:</p>

            <pre><code>@group(0) @binding(0) var&lt;storage, read&gt; particles : array&lt;Particle&gt;;
@group(0) @binding(1) var&lt;storage, read&gt; species : array&lt;Species&gt;;
@group(1) @binding(0) var&lt;uniform&gt; camera : Camera;

struct VertexOut
{
    @builtin(position) position : vec4f,
    @location(0) offset : vec2f,
    @location(1) color : vec4f,
}

const offsets = array&lt;vec2f, 6&gt;(
    vec2f(-1.0, -1.0),
    vec2f( 1.0, -1.0),
    vec2f(-1.0,  1.0),
    vec2f(-1.0,  1.0),
    vec2f( 1.0, -1.0),
    vec2f( 1.0,  1.0),
);

@vertex
fn vertexCircle(@builtin(vertex_index) id : u32) -&gt; VertexOut
{
    let particle = particles[id / 6u];
    let offset = offsets[id % 6u] * 1.5;
    let position = vec2f(particle.x, particle.y) + offset;
    return VertexOut(
        vec4f((position - camera.center) / camera.extent, 0.0, 1.0),
        offset,
        species[u32(particle.species)].color
    );
}</code></pre>

            <p>Executed with a vertex count of <code>6 * particleCount</code>, this produces a square per each particle. The fragment shader computes the distance in pixels from the fragment to the center of the particle, and turns it into the alpha value to produce a perfectly anti-aliased circle:</p>

            <pre><code>@fragment
fn fragmentCircle(in : VertexOut) -&gt; @location(0) vec4f
{
    let alpha = clamp(camera.pixelsPerUnit * (1.0 - length(in.offset)) + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);
    return in.color * vec4f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, alpha);
}</code></pre>

            <p>And this is what it looks like:</p>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/anti-aliasing.png"></center>

            <p>I also add some glowing effect to the particles, which is rendered in a separate pass before the particles themselves. It works in pretty much the same way, but the squares are larger, and the alpha value is a gaussian:</p>

            <pre><code>@vertex
fn vertexGlow(@builtin(vertex_index) id : u32) -&gt; VertexOut
{
    let particle = particles[id / 6u];
    let offset = offsets[id % 6u];
    let position = vec2f(particle.x, particle.y) + 12.0 * offset;
    return CircleVertexOut(
        vec4f((position - camera.center) / camera.extent, 0.0, 1.0),
        offset,
        species[u32(particle.species)].color
    );
}

@fragment
fn fragmentGlow(in : VertexOut) -&gt; @location(0) vec4f
{
    let l = length(in.offset);
    let alpha = exp(- 6.0 * l * l) / 64.0;
    return in.color * vec4f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, alpha);
}</code></pre>

            <center><img src="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/media/particle-life/glow.png"></center>
            <center><i>Glowing effect, exaggerated for the sake of demonstration.</i></center>

            <p>All this is rendered using basic additive blending (<i>not</i> the usual over blending!) into an HDR <code>rgba16float</code> texture, then composited onto the screen (actually, onto an HTML canvas) using ACES tone-mapping and some blue-noise dithering to hide banding resulting from dark colors on the edge of the glow. I experimented with different blending methods &amp; tone-mapping curves, and this combination produced the best visuals for my taste.</p>

            <p>However, rendering perfect circles stops working when particles get too small, e.g. less than 1 pixel: the circle gets severely undersampled, the computed alpha values are pretty much random, and the whole image is just a big flickering mess. To counter that, I have a separate shader which replaces the circles when particle radius gets smaller than 1 pixel. It also renders squares, but the vertex shader makes sure the squares are exactly 2x2 pixels in size:</p>

            <pre><code>@vertex
fn vertexPoint(@builtin(vertex_index) id : u32) -&gt; VertexOut
{
    let particle = particles[id / 6u];
    let offset = 2.0 * offsets[id % 6u] / camera.pixelsPerUnit;
    let position = vec2f(particle.x, particle.y) + offset;
    return CircleVertexOut(
        vec4f((position - camera.center) / camera.extent, 0.0, 1.0),
        offset,
        species[u32(particle.species)].color
    );
}</code></pre>

            <p>Then, the fragment shader computes the area of the intersection of the circle and the current pixel. Because computing circle-square intersections is a bit non-trivial, I approximate the circle with a square, compute the intersections (which boil down to min/max along each coordinate), and multiply by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) to compensate for the square area vs circle area:</p>

            <pre><code>@fragment
fn fragmentPoint(in : CircleVertexOut) -&gt; @location(0) vec4f
{
    let s = vec2f(camera.pixelsPerUnit);
    let d = max(vec2f(0.0), min(in.offset * s + 0.5, s) - max(in.offset * s - 0.5, - s));
    let alpha = (PI / 4.0) * d.x * d.y;
    return vec4f(in.color.rgb, in.color.a * alpha);
}</code></pre>

            <p>This feels hacky, but it works: the image almost doesn't flicker, and the transition between the two rendering modes is pretty much unnoticeable.</p>

            <h2 id="section-gallery">Gallery</h2>

            <p>I already posted the link in the beginning of the article, but if you don't feel like scolling back, <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/webgpu/particle-life.html">here is the link to the simulation</a>. Each page reload gives a new random system, though you can also just click "Randomize". You can save the current rules as a JSON file, or upload custom rules. You can share a randomly-generated rule set by clicking "Copy link".</p>

            <p>I've noticed that less particle types leads to more large-scale coherent structures, while more particle types leads to more local &amp; busy systems. Sometimes it is a good idea to do some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing"><i>simulated annealing</i></a> and slowly increase or decrease the friction value, which works kind of like the inverse temperature here.</p>

            <p>But, honestly, pretty much any random system made with this simulator looks interesting in some way. Here are some of the cool-looking systems I've been able to find in about 15 minutes. Each image is a link to this particular system:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The other day at work we had a Bash script that would set up a web server and
wait for it to be up before proceeding to the next things. The script worked
fine and we had no issues, until we had an infinite loop.</p>
<center>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/heitorpb/30622866477/" title="Airplane Tracks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1908/30622866477_d147a6f3fc_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="Airplane Tracks"></a>
</center>
<p>We were using the Bash built-in <code>until</code> to check if the web server was up:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>until </span><span>curl --silent --fail-with-body</span><span> 10.0.0.1:8080/health; </span><span>do
</span><span>	</span><span>sleep</span><span> 1
</span><span>done
</span></code></pre>
<p>This works fine. Unless our web server crashes during startup and we <code>sleep 1</code>
forever.</p>
<p>Here comes a handy utility: <code>timeout</code>. As the name suggests, this command adds
a timeout to other commands. You specify the time limit you want to wait for a
command and if that time passes, <code>timeout</code> sends a signal to terminate it and
exits with non-zero. By default, <code>timeout</code> sends <code>SIGTERM</code>, but you can change
it with the <code>--signal</code> flag, e.g. <code>timeout --signal=SIGKILL 1s foo</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>timeout 1s sleep 5</code> will send the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to <code>sleep</code>
after 1 second:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>$</span><span> time timeout 1s sleep 4
</span><span>
</span><span>real</span><span>    0m1,004s
</span><span>user</span><span>    0m0,000s
</span><span>sys</span><span>     0m0,005s
</span><span>
</span><span>$</span><span> echo $</span><span>?
</span><span>124
</span></code></pre>
<p>The natural thing to do then is to combine <code>timeout</code> and <code>until</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>timeout</span><span> 1m until curl</span><span> --silent --fail-with-body</span><span> 10.0.0.1:8080/health; </span><span>do
</span><span>	</span><span>sleep</span><span> 1
</span><span>done
</span></code></pre>
<p>The only issue is that this doesn’t work. <code>timeout</code> expects a killable command
and <code>until</code> is a shell keyword: you can’t <code>SIGTERM</code> <code>until</code>. We can’t use
<code>timeout</code> with any shell built-in.</p>
<p>The way forward is to wrap that <code>until</code> in a Bash process:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>timeout</span><span> 1m bash</span><span> -c </span><span>"</span><span>until curl --silent --fail-with-body 10.0.0.1:8080/health; do
</span><span>	sleep 1
</span><span>done</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Another approach is to move the <code>until</code> to a separate Bash script and <code>timeout</code>
it:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>timeout</span><span> 1m ./until.sh
</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a shame we can’t use <code>timeout</code> with <code>until</code> directly, that would be
amazing. But wrapping it in a Bash process/script gets the job done.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mondaybits.com/lieferando-captured-6-percent-of-restaurant-related-domain-names/">https://mondaybits.com/lieferando-captured-6-percent-of-restaurant-related-domain-names/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44095250">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>I recently decided to compile a <strong>very large list of domain names </strong>for the German country code top-level domain <strong><em>.de</em></strong>. I did this with the help of the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/?ref=mondaybits.com" rel="noreferrer">Common Crawl project</a> which provides a free, open repository of web crawl data and web graphs for the last years.</p><p>A few command line commands and a small <em>bash shell script</em> was all it took to compile a nice list of <strong>roughly 9 million .de domain names.</strong></p><div><p>💡</p><p>If you want to know more about how exactly I compiled the domain name list, just let me know and I might write about it in another blog post.</p></div><p>The resulting list is by no means complete and also not up-to-date, but it can be a nice starting point for further analysis and investigations. One of which I am going to write about in this post.</p><h2 id="enter-the-restaurant-world">Enter the restaurant world</h2><p>I was interested in domain names that belonged to restaurants and eating places in general. A simple but quite effective way to achieve this was to filter the domain names by German words that indicate such eating places:</p><ul>
<li>Restaurant</li>
<li>Gasthaus</li>
<li>Gasthof</li>
<li>Gaststätte</li>
<li>Wirtshaus</li>
<li>Gastwirtschaft</li>
<li>Schänke</li>
<li>Speisewirtschaft</li>
<li>Speiselokal</li>
<li>Speisehaus</li>
<li>Speiserestaurant</li>
<li>Speisegaststätte</li>
<li>Gastlokal</li>
<li>Kneipe</li>
<li>Pizzaria</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I was running this analysis on my windows desktop, <em>grep </em>was not directly available. So I used the <em>findstr PowerScript command</em><strong> </strong>instead to do this filtering:</p><pre><code>findstr /I "Restaurant Gasthaus Gasthof Gaststaette Wirtshaus ..." huge-domain-list.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This yielded a still impressive list of about <strong>31.000 domain names related to German restaurants</strong>.</p><h2 id="whos-still-alive">Who's still alive?</h2><p>Since I knew that the original list is outdated by definition, I had to check which domain names were still active. My first attempt to do this was also with a PowerShell script. This worked in principle and I was somewhat impressed by the capabilities that PowerShell provided, but at the same time the unfamiliar syntax turned me off and most importantly the speed was not great. So I created a small <em>Golang </em>program to get this job done, which worked great due Golang's <em>concurrency </em>features.</p><ul>
<li><strong>63% of the domain names were still active</strong> (roughly 20.000 domains)</li>
<li><strong>49% of the domains had redirects</strong> (mostly from http:// to https://)</li>
<li><strong>14% of the domains still serve http://</strong></li>
<li><strong>37% of the domains did not exist anymore</strong> or returned other errors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-do-some-manual-spot-checks">Let's do some manual spot checks...</h2><p>I was happy to have a list of <strong>20.000 restaurant domain names</strong> to work with and started some manual spot checks. After looking at 20 randomly selected websites from the list, I made two observations:</p><ol>
<li><em><strong>Domain Parking</strong></em> <strong>was another group of domain names to filter out</strong></li>
<li><em><strong>Lieferando.de</strong></em> <strong>had captured a significant number of domain names</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I was not surprised about the first observation, because I had noticed already quite often that many good domain names are "parked". But <strong>that lieferando.de thing caught my attention</strong>. The domains that were captured by lieferando.de did not redirect to lieferando.de, but instead showed their logo and a link to their website.</p><h2 id="how-many-of-them">How many of them?</h2><p>With just a small extension to my <em>Golang </em>program I could find all the domain names form the initial list, that were captured by lieferando.de:</p><p><strong>5.7% of the active domains from the restaurant domain list belong to lieferando.de</strong></p><p>That is 1101 domain names. Here are some random examples:</p><ul>
<li>elba-restaurant-knigstein-im-taunus.de</li>
<li>gasthauskaiser.de</li>
<li>grill-restaurantnaxos.de</li>
<li>henne-alt-berlinerwirtshaus.de</li>
<li>kulturkneipe-brotfabrik-bonn.de</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers are of course only estimates, since the initial domain list is not complete, but it provides some impression for the size of the topic.</p><h2 id="when-did-it-start">When did it start?</h2><p>I have not yet done a systematic analysis, but it seems (based on <em>WHOIS</em> entries for some domain names) that this "capturing" of restaurant domain names has started already before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and continued at least until 2022 and potentially still continues.</p><h2 id="preliminary-conclusions">(Preliminary) Conclusions</h2><ol>
<li>The number of "lost" domain names provides evidence that German restaurants have been struggling in the 2019-2023 time frame. It would be interesting to revisit this analysis in one or two years to see who many more domain names have become inactive or taken over by lieferando.</li>
<li>Lieferando is using aggressive tactics to drive traffic to their site. Maybe this can be described as <em>growth hacking</em> or a way of <em>SEO</em>. It is apparently not even new.</li>
<li>The extend to which lieferando is using this method suggest that it is at least somewhat effective and probably quite cheap to implement.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>GitHub issues is <em>almost</em> the best notebook in the world.</p>
<p>Free and unlimited, for both public and private notes.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Markdown support, including syntax highlighting for almost any language. Plus you can drag and drop images or videos directly onto a note.</p>
<p>It has fantastic inter-linking abilities. You can paste in URLs to other issues (in any other repository on GitHub) in a markdown list <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1059#issuecomment-2907515045">like this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1078
- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1080
</code></pre>
<p>Your issue will pull in the title of the other issue, plus that other issue will get back a link to yours - taking issue visibility rules into account.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an issue showing user &quot;simonw&quot; posted yesterday containing text &quot;Current logs could do with a bit of a redesign around tools already, see:&quot; followed by two bullet points with green checkmark icons: &quot;Tools in LLM logs output should only show definition first time #1078&quot; and &quot;New design for logs involving tool calls (and maybe tool classes) #1080&quot;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/issue-notes.jpg"></p>
<p>It has excellent search, both within a repo, across all of your repos or even across the whole of GitHub if you've completely forgotten where you put something.</p>
<p>It has a comprehensive API, both for exporting notes and creating and editing new ones. Add GitHub Actions, triggered by issue events, and you can automate it to do almost anything.</p>
<p>The one missing feature? Synchronized offline support. I still mostly default to Apple Notes on my phone purely because it works with or without the internet and syncs up with my laptop later on.</p>

              Earlier this month, I received a phone call from a user of <a title="Three Rings CIC" href="https://www.threerings.org.uk/"><em>Three Rings</em></a>, the volunteer/rota management
              software system I founded<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26608-1" name="footnote-ref-26608-1" href="#footnote-26608-1" title="Way back in 2002! We’re very nearly at the point where the Three Rings system is older than the youngest member of the Three Rings team.

            <p>
              We don’t strictly <em>offer</em> telephone-based tech support – our distributed team of volunteers doesn’t keep any particular “core hours” so we can’t say who’s available at any given
              time – but instead we answer email/Web based queries pretty promptly at any time of the day or week.
            </p>
            <p>
              But because I’ve called-back enough users over the years, it’s pretty much inevitable that a few probably have my personal mobile number saved. And because <a title="Venn-Euler digram comparing relationship breakups to tech layoffs, based on my recent experience" href="https://danq.me/2025/04/22/breakups-vs-layoffs/">I’ve been applying for a couple of

              After the first three such calls this month, I was really starting to wonder what had changed. Had we accidentally published my phone number, somewhere? So when the fourth tech support

              must be a wrong number), I had to ask: <em>where did you find this number?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>“When I Google ‘Three Rings login’, it’s right there!”</em> he said.

              He was right. A Google search that surfaced Three Rings CIC’s “Google Business Profile” now featured… my personal mobile number. And a convenient “Call” button that connects you
              directly to it.

              Some <em>years</em> ago, I provided my phone number to Google as part of an identity verification process, but didn’t consent to it being shared publicly. And, indeed, they
              <em>didn’t</em> share it publicly, until – seemingly at random – they started doing so, presumably within the last few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concerned by this change, I logged into Google Business Profile to see if I could edit it back.

              I deleted my phone number from the business listing again, and within a few minutes it seemed to have stopped being served to random strangers on the Internet. Unfortunately deleting
              the phone number also made the “Your phone number was updated by Google” message disappear, so I never got to click the “Learn more” link to maybe get a clue as to how and why this
              change happened.

									<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://self-issued.info/images/ietf-logo.png" alt="IETF logo"></span>Ten years ago this week, in May 2015, the JSON Web Token (JWT) became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">RFC 7519</a>.  This was the culmination of a <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1387">4.5 year journey</a> to create a simple JSON-based security token format and underlying JSON-based cryptographic standards.  The full set of RFCs published together was:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">RFC 7515</a>:  JSON Web Signature (JWS)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html">RFC 7516</a>:  JSON Web Encryption (JWE)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517.html">RFC 7517</a>:  JSON Web Key (JWK)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html">RFC 7518</a>:  JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">RFC 7519</a>:  JSON Web Token (JWT)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7520.html">RFC 7520</a>:  Examples of Protecting Content Using JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7521.html">RFC 7521</a>:  Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7522.html">RFC 7522</a>:  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html">RFC 7523</a>:  JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s certainly the case that we co-designed JWT and its underpinnings with <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a>, while also attempting to create general-purpose, widely useful standards.  Given the adoption that’s ensued, it seems that we succeeded.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my post <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2045">JWTs helping combat fraudulent and unwanted telephone calls</a>, “<i><b>It’s often said that one sign of a standard having succeeded is that it’s used for things that the inventors never imagined.</b></i>”  I’m gratified that this applies to JWT and the related specifications.  As was written in the post <a href="https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20250520-essential-moments-in-the-oauth-and-openid-connect-timeline/">Essential Moments in the OAuth and OpenID Connect Timeline</a>, it’s now hard to imagine an online security world without these standards.</p>
<p>That said, there’s work underway to keep JWTs and the use of them secure for the next decade.  Five years ago, the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html">JSON Web Token Best Current Practices</a> specification was created.  As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2052">I wrote then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This Best Current Practices specification contains a compendium of lessons learned from real JWT deployments and implementations over that period. It describes pitfalls and how to avoid them as well as new recommended practices that enable proactively avoiding problems that could otherwise arise.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaronf/">Yaron Sheffer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dickhardt/">Dick Hardt</a> and I are now updating the JWT BCP to describe additional threats and mitigations that have become known in the last five years.  See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-sheffer-oauth-rfc8725bis-01.html">updated JSON Web Token Best Current Practices</a> specification.</p>
<p>Similarly, my coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcampbell/">Brian Campbell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmort/">Chuck Mortimore</a> of the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html">JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</a> are updating it and related specifications to address vulnerabilities caused by <a href="https://openid.net/notice-of-a-security-vulnerability/">ambiguities in the audience values</a> of tokens sent to the authorization server.  See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-rfc7523bis-01.html">RFC7523bis</a> specification.</p>
<p>I’m truly grateful that my coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">Nat Sakimura</a> and I created something useful and widely used ten years ago, of course with substantial contributions from the OAuth, JOSE, and OpenID Connect working groups.  I look forward to what the next decade will bring!</p>

Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery.</p></div></td></tr>

I had the idea last year, but the cost of sending images to an LLM made it too expensive (to run over about 1500 videos), but now it's fairly reasonable.</p><p>In the app you pick a folder with videos in it and it stores the path, metadata, extracts frames as images, uses a local whisper model to transcribe the audio into subtitles, then sends a selection of the snapshots and the subtitles to an LLM to be summarised. The LLM sends back an XML document with a bunch of details about the video, including a title, detailed summary and information on objects, text, people, animals, locations, distinct moments etc. Some of these are also timestamped and most have relationships (i.e this object belongs to this location, this text was on this object etc). I store all that in a local SQLLite database and then do another LLM call with this summary asking for categories and tags, then store them in the DB against each video. The App UI is essentially tags you can click to narrow down returned videos.</p><p>I plan on adding a natural language search (Maybe RAG -- need to look into the latest best way), have half added Projects so I can group videos after finding the ones I want, and have a bunch of other ideas for this too. I've been programming this with some early help from Aider and Claude Sonnet. It's getting a bit complex now, so I do the majority of code changes, though the AI has done a fair bit. It's been heaps of fun, and I'm using it now in "production" (haha - on my PC)</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I got tired of using Markdown and Org mode for writing web pages last year.  They're so limited, and so full of odd gotchas and limitations.  Instead, I started writing raw HTML, but with a post-processing step to add titles, headers, footers, and CSS, and to do macro-like things, e.g. insert pull quotes and YouTube viewers.  But raw HTML is not great, either.  I'm now working on an editor that lets me use Emacs-style commands and key bindings (e.g. character, paragraph, sentence, and word motion, deletion, and transposition; Emacs-style undo/redo; incremental search; and case conversions) to edit HTML in a WYSIWYG view.  The new editor does it all in a Webkit-based HTML view built with Tauri.  Editing this way is so much more pleasant and more powerful.  I plan to publish it under an MIT license once it's good enough.</p>

The code is also pretty short.</p><p>So those numbers are from an older version of the benchmark.</p><p>Coherence is done by:</p><p>- Translating English, to the target language, to English</p><p>- repeating three times</p><p>- Having 3 LLMs score how close the original English is to the new English</p><p>I like it because it's robust against LLM bias, but it obviously isn't exact, and I found that after a certain point it's actually negatively correlated with quality, because it incentivises literal, word by word translations.</p><p>Accuracy and Idiomaticity are based on asking the judge LLMs to rate by how accurate / idiomatic the translations are. I mostly focused on idiomaticity, as it was the differentiator at the upper end.</p><p>The new benchmark has gone through a few iterations, and I'm still not super happy with it. Now it's just based on LLM scoring (this time 0-100), but with better stats, prompting, etc. I've still done some small scale tests on coherence, and I did some more today that I haven't published yet, and again they have DeepL and Lingvanex doing well because they tend towards quite rigid translations over idiomatic ones.

I nagged and reminded them a lot about about 15-20 of them predicted all 63 games, by picking the winner of each match and what their percentage confidence was. I had a leaderboard and live-blogged and gave silly awards.</p><p>I later added support for multiple "tournaments" and currently have tournaments going for NBA Playoffs and NHL Playoffs, but interest is waning. Of my friends, only 2-3 others are still regularly predicting.</p><p>Maybe it'll be more fun for the NFL season but I might also let it go a bit dormant.</p><p>Biggest challenge is that there isn't really a bulletproof way to rank people if people only predict <i>some</i> games in a tournament. I've tried all sorts of things, minimum # of games, bayesian kernel smoothing, but it's ultimately arbitrary when choosing how to penalize someone for not participating.</p><p>If I were to continue I'd be looking at things like automatically integrating with sports apis and odds/bookmaking apis, allowing users to create their own tournaments, etc. But ultimately, the UX of the site isn't much more than making a prediction, and then checking back later when the game is over to see your score. Not much more reason to hang around on the site than that.</p></div></td></tr>

They operate in a super well-known, documented environment.</p><p>If we can replicate the same thing on business systems… that’s when the magic happens - just very hard to do without deep knowledge of those platforms and agentic AI because everyone does stuff differently in each org. The overlap of people with skills in both AI and specific business ops areas is absolutely tiny.</p><p>An example of where we’re using this is in a fully AI native CRM (part of SynthGrid - see <a href="https://mindfront.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://mindfront.ai</a>). We don’t even have any way to interface with it outside of AI, but we’d also never want to do so again anyway because the efficiency gains are so huge for us.</p><p>The Pareto frontier will continue to inexorably advance forward, dragging even the complex or non-standardized domains in with it. For those tightly integrated business systems, we’ll probably see huge gain in utility, if not function, from the improved underlying models combined with the excellent tools.

This is a big difference from ML because you're not having to worry too much about doing complex data engineering - or at least it solves the annoying ingestion problem in many cases.</p><p>Another observation is that most businesses don't have any ML engineering capabilities in-house - they're pretty much willing to pay a premium, because unlike the bespoke ML solutions, you can just do it with an off-the-shelf system (provided it's designed with the right validation loops).</p><p>The agent is in some ways an abstraction that just enables use and adoption - even if it would be orders of magnitude worse than normal ML solutions - it's competing against no solution, not ML-based ones.</p><p>Last thing is just around what level of autonomy people expect from these things. You can go pretty far, but like flipping N coins, the more you flip the greater the chance that something goes awry. Agents still need a lot of guidance and it's up to the system builders to bring that to them, either by connecting humans or very tightly integrated, well-designed tools.</p></div></td></tr>

The facts of the program are constrained to a predefined “model schema” of sorts and a predefined set of rules that encode specialized domain knowledge of how new facts can be derived from known facts.</p><p>We generate proof trees / attack graphs from the knowledge base and queries posed to it. The attack graph uses big-step semantics to plan and guide the execution flow, and the system dispatches to agents with tool use to fill in the details and implement the small-step semantics, so to speak. This may include API calls to a Metasploit Framework server or RAG over vulnerability and exploit databases.</p><p>We use Pydantic AI to constrain the  LLM output to predefined schemas at each step, with a dash of fuzzy string matching and processing to enforce canonicalization of, e.g., software names and other entities.</p><p>Tl;dr: neurosymbolic AI research tool for cybersecurity analysis and pentesting.</p></div></td></tr>

Here are my ideas about my product:</p><p>- Manages the entire range of personal (and maybe business) information/content: Documents, Media, Messages (email, instant, etc.), Contacts, Bookmarks, Calendar, etc.</p><p>- Is tag based, so that where to put and find content is easy to answer. Think of a set of flat folders, on one or more devices, within which the files are stored with tags attached. Since people often find navigating/browsing files more natural than searching, virtual folders will be dynamically generated to guide navigation. Also, entire folders can be treated as atomic, and tagged/managed as one object (useful for repositories &amp; projects). And, heuristics (and maybe AI) will be used to automatically tag files when they are imported into the tool, greatly reducing the tedium of adding tags.</p><p>- Is file based, so that all information is physically stored as individual files. This allows information to be more easily managed on a physical level: moved around, backed up, exported/imported, searched, navigated, etc. So in addition to docs, each email/instant message, contact, scheduled task/event, bookmark, etc. would ultimately be stored as a file, unlocking all the things you can do with files.</p><p>- Has a local web-based UI launched from a local agent, so actual file content does not usually need to move across the network and stays local, and the tool is also easily multi-platform, with consistent UI irrespective of platform.</p><p>- Provides a cloud web UI as well, that communicates with content devices through the local agent, so that content stored across multiple devices can be managed in one central location, even without direct access to those devices, team/org features can be provided. However, file content still stays local, except when shared.</p><p>- Provides tools for exporting data as file from the data islands of various apps and service, and backing up as files to cloud storage services.</p><p>My vision is a situation where I am in charge of my own data irrespective of whatever device, app, or service I use, can ensure that it is always available and will not be lost, and that I can easily navigate and search through it all to find whatever I want, no matter how scattered and massive it is.</p><p>[1] Here are some of my issues with personal information management affordances of current tech, which is driving me to work on a solution:</p><p>- Our data is too bound to device and vendor islands. Can't easily move my information across Apple/Google/Whatsapp, etc accounts. Can't easily merge and de-duplicate either. I almost always somehow lose data whenever I have to move to a new phone, etc.</p><p>- Hard to own your data on many services: Discord, Slack, etc. Can't easily export, search.</p><p>- Hard to have a 360 overview and handle on all your data assets and query them in a consistent manner.</p><p>- Files as a unit of information storage and management is very ergonomic; we shouldn't allow that concept to be buried by vendors for their own gain.</p></div></td></tr>
