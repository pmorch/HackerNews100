<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the first act of the wittiest Irish play of the nineteenth century, Oscar Wilde’s “Importance of Being Earnest,” there is much ado about a shortage of food. The fearsome Aunt Augusta is coming to tea, but we have watched the feckless Algernon eat all the cucumber sandwiches prepared for her by his manservant, Lane. The servant saves the day when the aunt arrives, expecting her sandwiches, by lying: “There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I went down twice.” Algy responds with high emotion: “I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.”</p><p>The play, first performed in 1895, is subtitled “A Trivial Comedy for Serious People,” and this scene is an exquisite exercise in trivialization. Wilde is imagining what a food crisis might look like if it were happening among the English upper classes rather than in his home country. The panic and dread of searching for nourishment and finding none is transformed into an airy nothing: a fake story about the nonexistent dearth of a plant that has relatively little nutritional value, and a charade of great distress. The comedy is so wonderfully weightless as to seem entirely free from the gravitational pull of the history that had preoccupied Wilde’s family, and of a place called Ireland, where the unfortunately unavailable food was not the cucumber but the potato.</p><p>In 1854, when Oscar was born, his father was also engaged in the sublimation of horror. William Wilde, a pioneering surgeon and medical statistician, was the assistant commissioner for the census of Ireland that was conducted in 1851—the one that recorded the disappearance from what was then the richest, most powerful, and most technologically advanced country in the world, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, of some one and a half million people. They had died in, or fled from, what the Irish poor called in their native language An Gorta Mór, the Great Hunger, a catastrophe that was then continuing into its sixth year.</p><p>The year Oscar turned two, William published the results of his immersion in the minutiae of the famine as an official report of the British Parliament. The two-volume work is called the “Tables of Deaths.” Because the census relied on the information given by survivors, and thus did not count many victims whose entire families had been wiped out or had left Ireland as desperate refugees, it actually underestimated the number of lives lost in the Great Hunger.</p><p>William and his assistants were nonetheless able to build solid pillars of data, mass death broken down into discrete numerals to represent sexes, ages, locations, seasons, years, and causes of mortality, which included starvation, scurvy, dysentery, cholera, typhus, and relapsing fever. The tables of deaths occupy hundreds of double-page spreads, laid out with exemplary clarity and precision. They speak of order, regularity, the capacity of Victorian governance for infinite comprehension. The staggering rise in mortality may have demanded extraordinary efforts from the statisticians, but they were equal to their task. They tabulated calamity, confined it safely within vertical and horizontal lines on the pages of sturdily bound official tomes. There are no names of human beings.</p><p>This dutiful, sober, and rigorously unemotional work might also have been titled “The Importance of Being Earnest,” albeit without a hint of Oscar’s playful irony. William’s safely anonymized figures are, in their way, just as weightless as Oscar’s sharply amusing figments. In the introduction to his volume, he uses the remote and clinical language of officialdom: “The labours of the Commissioners in this particular portion of their work greatly exceed those connected with the Tables of Deaths published in the Census of 1841, chiefly owing to the extraordinary increase in the numbers of deaths.” It almost seems as though the reader’s sympathy is being evoked not for the people behind the statistics but for the commissioners who had to work so hard to categorize the circumstances in which those people expired.</p><p>There was also a third kind of language used to cloak the horrors of the famine: an accusatory rage against the British authorities who had failed to prevent it. As it happens, it was another Wilde, Oscar’s mother and William’s wife, Jane, writing as a passionate and incendiary Irish nationalist under the pen name Speranza, who helped to invent that language. In 1847, she published a poem about the famine whose voice is that of the “wretches, famished, scorned,” who warn their oppressors that their deaths will be avenged: “But our whitening bones against ye will rise as witnesses,&nbsp;/&nbsp;From the cabins and the ditches, in their charred, uncoffin’d masses,&nbsp;//&nbsp;A ghastly, spectral army, before the great God we’ll stand,&nbsp;/&nbsp;And arraign ye as our murderers, the spoilers of our land.”</p><p>Jane’s fiercely unforgiving tone was adopted by militant Irish nationalists for whom the famine stood as the ultimate proof of English perfidy. But in her poem, too, the victims appear as an undifferentiated mass. Her avenging army of the undead is in its own way just as distanced as the numbers in her husband’s tables.</p><p>One difficulty in writing about the Great Hunger is scale. There have been, in absolute terms, many deadlier famines, but as Amartya Sen, the eminent Indian scholar of the subject, concluded, in “no other famine in the world [was] the proportion of people killed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as large as in the Irish famines in the 1840s.” The pathogen that caused it was a fungus-like water mold called <em>Phytophthora infestans</em>. Its effect on the potato gives “Rot,” a vigorous and engaging new study of the Irish famine by the historian Padraic&nbsp;X. Scanlan, its title. The blight began to infect the crop across much of western and northern Europe in the summer of 1845. In the Netherlands, about sixty thousand people died in the consequent famine—a terrible loss, but a fraction of the mortality rate in Ireland. It is, oddly, easier to form a mental picture of what it might have been like to witness the Dutch tragedy than to truly convey the magnitude of the suffering in Ireland.</p><p>Another difficulty is that the Great Hunger was not just an Irish event. It bled far beyond its own borders, seeping into the national narratives of the rest of the Anglophone world. Only about one in three people born in Ireland in the early eighteen-thirties would die at home of old age. The other two either were consumed by the famine or joined the exodus in which, between 1845 and 1855, almost 1.5 million sailed to North America and hundreds of thousands to Britain and Australia, making the Irish famine a central episode in the history of those countries, too.</p><p>There has long been something inarticulable about this vast human disaster. In a preface to the monumental “Atlas of the Great Irish Famine,” published in 2012, the former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, observed that “for many years the event was cloaked in silence, its memory for the most part buried or neglected.” The editors of the “Atlas” noted that, until recently, “there was a strange reluctance on the part of historians, historical geographers and others to address” the vast archival records. Right up to the nineteen-nineties, the annual rate of publication of scholarly papers on the subject of the famine never rose above a half-dozen.</p><p>The novelist Colm Tóibín suggested, in 1998, that the problem “may lie in the relationship between catastrophe and analytic narrative. How do you write about the Famine? What tone do you use?” He speculated, moreover, that the Great Hunger had created a great divide even in Irish consciousness. If, he said, he were to write a novel about his home town, Enniscorthy, that took place after the famine years, “I would not have to do much research”—because the place would resemble the one he grew up in. But he would find the years before and during the event itself “difficult to imagine.”</p><p>It is easy to sympathize with this difficulty. The famine set in motion a process of depopulation—even now, after many decades of growth, the island has a million fewer inhabitants than it had in 1841. It disproportionately affected those who spoke the Irish language, creating an Anglophone Ireland. It led ultimately to a radical reform of land ownership, which passed to a new class of Catholic farmers. The profoundly uncomfortable truth is that Ireland started to become modern when its poorest people were wiped out or sent into exile—a reality that is too painful to be faced without deep unease.</p><p>Even before the potato blight, there was a degree of hunger among the Irish rural underclass that seemed like an ugly remnant of a receding past. In 1837, two years after Alexis de Tocqueville published the first volume of “Democracy in America,” his lifelong collaborator, Gustave de Beaumont, went to Ireland, a country the two men had previously visited together. The book de Beaumont produced in 1839, “L’Irlande: Sociale, Politique et Religieuse,” was a grim companion piece to his friend’s largely optimistic vision of the future that was taking shape on the far side of the Atlantic. De Beaumont, a grandson by marriage of the Marquis de Lafayette, understood that, while the United States his ancestor had helped to create was a vigorous outgrowth of the British political traditions he and de Tocqueville so admired, Ireland was their poisoned fruit. America, he wrote, was “the land where destitution is the exception,” Ireland “the country where misery is the common rule.”</p><p>The problem was not that the land was barren: Scanlan records that, “in 1846, 3.3 million acres were planted with grain, and Irish farms raised more than 2.5 million cattle, 2.2 million sheep and 600,000 pigs.” But almost none of this food was available for consumption by the people who produced it. It was intended primarily for export to the burgeoning industrial cities of England. Thus, even Irish farmers who held ten or more acres and who would therefore have been regarded as well off, ate meat only at Christmas. “If an Irish family slaughtered their own pig, they would sell even the intestines and other offal,” Scanlan writes. He quotes the testimony of a farmer to a parliamentary commission, in 1836, that “he knew other leaseholders who had not eaten even an egg in six months. ‘We sell them now,’ he explained.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Scanlan notes, fewer than four thousand people owned nearly eighty per cent of Irish land. Most of them were Protestant descendants of the English and Scottish settlers who benefitted from the wholesale expropriation of land from Catholic owners in the seventeenth century. Many lived part or all of the year in England. They rented their lands to farmers, a large majority of whom were Catholics. Scanlan points out that, whereas in England a tenant farmer might pay between a sixth and a quarter of the value of his crops in rent, in Ireland “rent often equalled the entire value of a farm’s saleable produce.”</p><p>Landlords could extract these high rents because their tenants, in turn, made money by subletting little parcels of land, often as small as a quarter of an acre, to laborers who had none of their own. The whole system was possible only because of the potato. Most years, those micro farms could produce enough of this wonder crop to keep a family alive. It provided enough calories to sustain hardworking people and also delivered the necessary minerals and vitamins. By the eighteen-forties, as many as 2.7 million people (more than a quarter of the entire population) were surviving on potatoes they grew in tiny fields that encroached on ever more marginal land, clinging to bogs and the sides of stony mountains.</p><p>De Beaumont, noting that these laboring families had to endure a “life of fasting” when their store of potatoes ran out in the summer or when the crop was scanty, grasped the precarity of this situation. One of his most striking insights was that the exceptionally cruel nature of Irish poverty made it seem incredible to outsiders: “The word <em>famine</em>, employed to describe the misery of Ireland, appeared to them a metaphorical expression for great distress, and not the exact term to express the state of human beings <em>really</em> famishing and perishing from sheer want of food.” It was, he suggested, particularly in England that “persons were pleased to keep themselves in this state of doubt.”</p><p>Yet de Beaumont himself felt he could not describe what he saw on his travels. Words were not adequate to the task. Adopting a disembodied third-person voice, he asked, “Shall he relate what he saw?—No. There are misfortunes so far beyond the pale of humanity, that human language has no words to represent them.” If he were to “recall the sinister impressions produced” by the contrasts between the wealth of the Irish landowning aristocracy and the destitution of the rural poor, “he feels that the pen would fall from his hands, and that he would not have the courage to complete the task which he has undertaken to accomplish.”</p><p>This feeling that Irish reality was at once incredible and indescribable became almost a standard response to the Great Hunger. In one of the first widely circulated eyewitness accounts, an open letter written to the Duke of Wellington by Nicholas Cummins, a magistrate in Cork, Cummins struggled to articulate what he saw when he entered a settlement outside Skibbereen, in December, 1846. “I was surprised to find the wretched hamlet apparently deserted,” he wrote. “I entered some of the hovels to ascertain the cause, and the scenes which presented themselves were such as no pen or tongue can convey the slightest idea of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is impossible to go through the details.”</p><p>Asenath Nicholson, a woman from Vermont who began a one-person relief operation in Ireland, in 1847, recorded a moment when a man invited her to inspect a cabin where a mother, a father, and their two children lay dead: “The man called, begging me to look in. I did not, and could not endure, as the famine progressed, such sights&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were too real, and these realities became a dread.”</p><p>The Great Hunger was excessively real to many European and North American observers because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was happening not in India or China but in what was supposed to be the Empire’s heartland. Its victims were white, Christian, and (notionally, at least) subjects of the United Kingdom with the same rights as the inhabitants of Hampstead Heath or Tunbridge Wells.</p><p>It was also an affront to the liberal Victorian certainty that progress was linear and inevitable. The British Prime Minister Lord John Russell told the House of Commons, in January, 1847, that “the famine is such as has not been known in modern times; indeed, I should say it is like a famine of the thirteenth century acting upon the population of the nineteenth.” What the British ruling class could not grasp was that the Irish famine was a phenomenon of “modern times,” the product, as Scanlan convincingly argues, of a particularly virulent form of exploitative capitalism that left millions of people utterly exposed to the instability of short-term rental of land, to fluctuating food markets, and to wages driven downward by the pressure of too many laborers looking for too little work.</p><p>Militant Irish nationalism would follow Jane Wilde in seeing the famine as mass murder and thus as what would later be categorized as a genocide. Under pressure from Irish Americans, this even became an official doctrine in New York, where a state law signed in 1996 by then governor George Pataki required schools to portray the famine “as a human rights violation akin to genocide, slavery and the Holocaust.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Pataki announced that “history teaches us the Great Irish Hunger was not the result of a massive failure of the Irish potato crop but rather was the result of a deliberate campaign by the British to deny the Irish people the food they needed to survive.” But this is not what history teaches us. A much more accurate conclusion is the one drawn by the Irish historian Peter Gray, who wrote that there was “not a policy of deliberate genocide” on the part of the British. Instead, Gray argued, the great failure of the British government was ideological—“a dogmatic refusal to recognise that measures intended to ‘encourage industry, [and] to do battle with sloth’&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were based on false premises.” The British did not cause the potatoes to rot in the ground. They did launch, by the standards of the mid-nineteenth century, very large-scale efforts to keep people alive, importing grain from America, setting up soup kitchens, and establishing programs of public works to employ those who were starving. But they were blinded by prejudice, ignorance, and a fanatical devotion to two orthodoxies that are very much alive in our own time: their belief that poverty arises from the moral failings of the poor and their faith in the so-called free market. The famine was so devastating because, while the mold was rotting the potatoes, mainstream British opinion was infected with a cognitive blight.</p><p>It was obvious to outsiders that the root of Ireland’s misery was what de Beaumont characterized as a “bad aristocracy”—the monopolization of land by a small élite that had no cultural or religious affinity with its tenantry and little sense of obligation to develop sustainable agriculture. But an English ruling class in which many leading politicians were themselves owners of vast estates in Ireland was unable to acknowledge this inconvenient truth. Who, if not the landlord system, could be to blame? It must be the Irish poor themselves. As Scanlan puts it, “Intensive monoculture made Irish potatoes vulnerable to blight. The solutions proposed to mitigate famine were themselves the product of a kind of intellectual and political monoculture. Solutions were unimaginable outside the market that fuelled the crisis to begin with.”</p><p>In a neatly circular argument, the conditions that had been forced on the laboring class became proof of its moral backwardness. It was relatively easy to plant and harvest potatoes—therefore, those who did so had clearly chosen the easy life. “Ireland, through this lens,” Scanlan writes, “was a kind of living fossil within the United Kingdom, a country where the majority of the poor were inert and indolent, unwilling and unable to exert themselves for wages and content to rely on potatoes for subsistence.” Or, as William Carleton, the first major writer in the English language to have sprung from the Irish Catholic peasantry, put it with withering sarcasm, the Irish poor had not learned “to starve in an enlightened manner”: “Political economy had not then taught the people how to be poor upon the most scientific principles.”</p><p>Civilized people ate meat—England’s unofficial national anthem was “The Roast Beef of Old England.” The desire to consume animal flesh stimulated effort and enterprise. Thus, the destruction of the potato crop, however terrible and regrettable its short-term effects, would teach the Irish to crave meat instead and become proper capitalist wage earners so that they could afford to buy it. “When the Celts once cease to be potatophagi,” wrote the editors of the London <em>Times</em>, “they must become carnivorous.” Let them, as Marie Antoinette did not say, eat steak.</p><p>This arrant nonsense obscured the reality that the Irish had no particular love of potatoes. Their historically varied diet, based on oats, milk, and butter, had been reduced by economic oppression to one tuber. Nor were they reluctant to work for wages. Many travelled long distances to earn money as seasonal migrant laborers on farms in England and Scotland, and Irish immigrants were integrating themselves into the capitalist money economy in the mills of Massachusetts and the factories of New York.</p><p>Yet, as stupid as this bigotry undoubtedly was, it was also deadly. The idea of Irish indolence fused with a quasi-religious faith in the laws of the market to shape the British response to the famine. In its first full year, 1846, Robert Peel’s Conservative government imported huge quantities of corn, known in Europe as maize, from America to feed the starving. The government insisted that the corn be sold rather than given away (free food would merely reinforce Irish indolence), and those who received it had little idea at first how to cook it. Nonetheless, the plan was reasonably effective in keeping people alive.</p><p>The general assumption, however, was that the blight of 1845 was a one-off event. At the end of July, 1846, it became crushingly obvious that the blight had spread even wider, wiping out more than ninety per cent of the new crop. By then, most of the poor tenants had sold whatever goods they had, leaving nothing with which to stave off starvation. Fishermen on the coasts had pawned their nets for money to buy maize. The terrible year that followed is still remembered in Ireland as Black ’47, though the famine would, in fact, last until 1852.</p><p>In London, the realization that this was not a temporary crisis coincided with the coming to power of a party with a deep ideological commitment to free trade. The Liberals, under Lord John Russell, were determined that what they saw as an illegitimate intervention in the free market should not be repeated. They moved away from importing corn and created instead an immense program of public works to employ starving people—for them, as for the Conservatives, it was axiomatic that the moral fibre of the Irish could not be improved by giving them something for nothing. Wages were designed to be lower than the already meagre earnings of manual workers so that the labor market would not be upset.</p><p>The result was the grotesque spectacle of people increasingly debilitated by starvation and disease doing hard physical labor for wages that were not sufficient to keep their families alive. Meanwhile, many of the same people were evicted from their houses as landowners used the crisis to clear off these human encumbrances and free their fields for more profitable pasturage. Exposure joined hunger and sickness to complete the task of mass killing.</p><p>“Rot” provides a convincing answer to Tóibín’s question of what tone you should use in writing about the famine. Scanlan’s voice is cool but never cold. The book is richly underpinned by research in contemporary sources and firmly rooted in historical scholarship, and it does not fall into the trap of oversimplifying the famine as deliberate genocide. But a proper sense of outrage runs between the lines and carries a consistently high voltage.</p><p>Above all, “Rot” reminds us that the Great Hunger was a very modern event, and one shaped by a mind-set that is now again in the ascendant. The poor are the authors of their own misery. The warning signs of impending environmental disaster can be ignored. Gross inequalities are natural, and God-given. The market must be obeyed at all costs. There is only one thing about the Irish famine that now seems truly anachronistic—millions of refugees were saved because other countries took them in. That, at least, would not happen now.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A British tourist on a four-month backpacking trip around North America has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the US for 10 days after trying to enter the country via the Canadian border.</p><p>Rebecca Burke, 28, a graphic artist from Monmouthshire, was trying to cross into the state of Washington when she was refused entry.</p><p>She was planning to stay with a host family where she would carry out domestic chores in exchange for accommodation and was told she should have applied for a working visa, instead of a tourist visa.</p><p>She had previously been staying with a host family in Portland, Oregon, under a similar arrangement after spending some time sightseeing in New York City, where she first arrived from the UK at the start of the year.</p><p>“She’s basically living with a family, doing a little bit of housework, taking the dog for a walk, whatever it is. She’s been a part of a family,” her father, Paul Burke, a consultant in the steel industry, said.</p><p>Canadian authorities told her to go back to the US and fill in new paperwork before returning to cross into Canada.</p><p>However, when she tried to re-enter the US she was handcuffed and put in a cell before being taken to Tacoma Northwest detention facility in Washington state.</p><p>“She’s been there for over 10 days now,” Paul Burke said. “We haven’t got any clear timeline for her release. I really can’t understand why someone, a tourist, would be incarcerated and locked up.”</p><p>“It’s like we’re living in a nightmare we can’t wake up from,” he added. “It’s like we’re having an out-of-body experience. We’re watching ourselves go through the motions of life, but we’re not really doing it, we’re not really there.”</p><p>His daughter wants to leave the country and fly back to the UK, he said, but he feared the immigration crackdown in the US meant there could be a long delay before her case was dealt with.</p><p>“She’s in this orange prison outfit,” he said. “She just feels so isolated and desperate, you can imagine, she’s saying, ‘I want to come home’.”</p><p>She is safe, he said, but living “in horrendous conditions” and had not had access to legal representation. He was taking comfort from the fact that the other women at the facility, many of whom have been incarcerated for months or even years while fighting deportation, had “all been really nice to Becky,” Burke said.</p><p>Burke said he and his wife, Andrea, had naturally had some worries about their daughter travelling, but thought the US and Canada would be one of the safest places for her to go as a solo traveller, and her plan to stay with host families provided further reassurance.</p><p>“The only thing really we were concerned with, in general, was our little girl was going off for four months as a solo traveller,” he said.</p><p>“We knew for a long time in advance of Trump being inaugurated what his plans were for immigration, but that didn’t enter our minds with respect to Becky,” he added. “She was going on a four-month backpacking tourist trip. We wouldn’t even think of her as an immigrant.</p><p>“We were horrified about what was planned for immigrants and illegal aliens in the US, just like many people around the world were,” he added. “But why would we put that together with Becky making this trip? We now know better, because we believe it’s had a direct impact.”</p><p>Burke said he wanted to warn other families who may have children travelling to the US. “The key thing is check and double-check and triple-check the visa requirements, especially if it’s an extended visit like Becky’s was, rather than just a couple of weeks’ holiday,” he said. “I really don’t want anyone else to go through this.”</p><p>The family’s local MP Catherine Fookes, the Labour MP for Monmouthshire, said: “I am deeply concerned about my constituent’s welfare and the distress this situation is causing her and her family.</p><div><p>“Her family is desperate to bring her home, and I share their urgency in seeking a resolution.<strong></strong>“Since being made aware of the case, my team have been in regular contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and other relevant authorities to press for urgent action. We have relayed the family’s request for voluntary departure and continue to push for clear answers on the next steps to get her home as soon as possible.</p><p>
 “My team and I will continue doing everything in our power to secure a swift resolution and will not stop working until my constituent is safely reunited with her family.”</p></div><p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting a British national detained in the USA and are in contact with the local authorities.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why a new book on reinforcement learning?</h2><a id="user-content-why-a-new-book-on-reinforcement-learning" aria-label="Permalink: Why a new book on reinforcement learning?" href="#why-a-new-book-on-reinforcement-learning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This book aims to provide a <strong>mathematical but friendly</strong> introduction to the fundamental concepts, basic problems, and classic algorithms in reinforcement learning. Some essential features of this book are highlighted as follows.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The book introduces reinforcement learning from a mathematical point of view. Hopefully, readers will not only know the procedure of an algorithm but also understand why it was designed in the first place and why it works effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The depth of the mathematics is carefully controlled to an adequate level. The mathematics is also presented in a carefully designed manner to ensure that the book is friendly to read. Readers can selectively read the materials presented in gray boxes according to their interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Many illustrative examples are given to help readers better understand the topics. All the examples in this book are based on a grid world task, which is easy to understand and helpful for illustrating concepts and algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When introducing an algorithm, the book aims to separate its core idea from complications that may be distracting. In this way, readers can better grasp the core idea of an algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The contents of the book are coherently organized. Each chapter is built based on the preceding chapter and lays a necessary foundation for the subsequent one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9789819739431" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning/raw/main/springerBookCover.png" alt="Book cover"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contents</h2><a id="user-content-contents" aria-label="Permalink: Contents" href="#contents"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The topics addressed in the book are shown in the figure below. This book contains ten chapters, which can be classified into two parts: the first part is about basic tools, and the second part is about algorithms. The ten chapters are highly correlated. In general, it is necessary to study the earlier chapters first before the later ones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Figure_chapterMap.png"><img src="https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning/raw/main/Figure_chapterMap.png" alt="The map of this book"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Readership</h2><a id="user-content-readership" aria-label="Permalink: Readership" href="#readership"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This book is designed for senior undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in reinforcement learning.</p>
<p dir="auto">It does not require readers to have any background in reinforcement learning because it starts by introducing the most basic concepts. If the reader already has some background in reinforcement learning, I believe the book can help them understand some topics more deeply or provide different perspectives.</p>
<p dir="auto">This book, however, requires the reader to have some knowledge of probability theory and linear algebra. Some basics of the required mathematics are also included in the appendix of this book.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lecture videos</h2><a id="user-content-lecture-videos" aria-label="Permalink: Lecture videos" href="#lecture-videos"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By combining the book with my lecture videos, I believe you can study better.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>(Dec 2024) 4,000+ stars</strong>
This textbook has received 4,000+ stars! Glad that it is helpful to many readers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Oct 2024) Book cover</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The design of the book cover is finished. The book will be officially published by Springer early next year. It has been published by Tsinghua University Press.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Sep 2024) Minor update before printing by Springer</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I revised some very minor places that readers may hardly notice. It is supposed to be the final version before printing by Springer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Aug 2024) 3000 Stars and more code</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The book has received 3000+ stars, which is a great achievement to me. Thanks to everyone. Hope it really helped you.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also received more code implementation from enthusiastic readers. For example, this <a href="https://github.com/SupermanCaozh/The_Coding_Foundation_in_Reinforcement_Learning">GitHub page</a> provided Python implementation of almost all examples in my book. On the one hand, I am very glad to see that. On the other hand, I am a little worried that my students in my offline class may use the code to do their homework:-). Overall, I am happy because it indicates that the book and open course are really helpful to the readers; Otherwise, they would not bother to develop the code by themselves:-)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Jun 2024) Minor update before printing</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This is the fourth version of the book draft. It is supposed to be the final one before the book is officially published. Specifically, when proofreading the book manuscript, I detected some very minor issues. Together with some reported by enthusiastic readers, they have been revised in this version.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Apr 2024) Code for the Grid-World Environment</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">We added the code for the grid-world environment in my book. Interested readers can develop and test their own algorithms in this environment. Both Python and MATLAB versions are provided.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that we do not provide the code of all the algorithms involved in the book. That is because they are the homework for the students in offline teaching: the students need to develop their own algorithms using the provided environment. Nevertheless, there are third-party implementations of some algorithms. Interested readers can check the links on the home page of the book.</p>
<p dir="auto">I need to thank my PhD students, Yize Mi and Jianan Li, who are also the Teaching Assistants of my offline teaching. They contributed greatly to the code.</p>
<p dir="auto">You are welcome to provide any feedback about the code such as bugs if detected.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Mar 2024) 2K stars</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The book has received 2K stars. I also received many positive evaluations of the book from many readers. Very glad that it can be helpful.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Mar 2024) Minor update</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The third version of the draft of the book is online now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compared to the second version, the third version is improved in the sense that some minor typos have been corrected. Here, I would like to thank the readers who sent me their feedback.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Sep 2023) 1000+ stars</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The book received 1000+ stars! Thank everybody!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Aug 2023) Major update - second version</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>The second version of the draft of the book is online now!!</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Compared to the first version, which was online one year ago, the second version has been improved in various ways. For example, we replotted most of the figures, reorganized some contents to make them clearer, corrected some typos, and added Chapter 10, which was not included in the first version.</p>
<p dir="auto">I put the first draft of this book online in August 2022. Up to now, I have received valuable feedback from many readers worldwide. I want to express my gratitude to these readers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Nov 2022) Will be jointly published</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This book will be published <em>jointly by Springer Nature and Tsinghua University Press</em>. It will probably be printed in the second half of 2023.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have received some comments and suggestions about this book from some readers. Thanks a lot, and I appreciate it. I am still collecting feedback and will probably revise the draft in several months. Your feedback can make this book more helpful for other readers!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>(Oct 2022) Lecture notes and vidoes</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>lecture slides</em> have been uploaded in the folder "Lecture slides."</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>lecture videos</em> (in Chinese) are online.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>HP, along with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">other printer brands</a>, is infamous for issuing firmware updates that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/">brick already-purchased printers</a> that have tried to use third-party ink. In a new form of frustration, HP is now being accused of issuing a firmware update that broke customers’ laser printers—even though the devices are loaded with HP-brand toner.</p>
<p>The firmware update in question is version 20250209, which HP issued on March 4 for its LaserJet MFP M232-M237&nbsp;models. Per HP, the update includes “security updates,” a “regulatory requirement update,” “general improvements and bug fixes,” and fixes for <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/everywhere.html">IPP Everywhere</a>. Looking back to older updates’ fixes and changes, which the new update includes, doesn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary. The older updates mention things like “fixed print quality to ensure borders are not cropped for certain document types,” and “improved firmware update and cartridge rejection experiences.” But there’s no mention of changes to how the printers use or read toner.</p>
<p>However, users have been <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/Error-Code-11/td-p/9333546">reporting</a> sudden problems using HP-brand toner in their M232–M237 series printers since their devices updated to 20250209. Users on HP’s support forum say they see Error Code 11 and the hardware’s toner light flashing when trying to print. Some said they’ve cleaned the contacts and reinstalled their toner but still can't print.</p>
<p>“Insanely frustrating because it's my small business printer and just stopped working out of nowhere[,] and I even replaced the tone[r,] which was a $60 expense,” a forum user <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/Laserjet-m234DW-Error-11/td-p/9332462">wrote</a> on March 8.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/03/10/people-are-just-as-bad-as-my-llms/">https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/03/10/people-are-just-as-bad-as-my-llms/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43323755">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-amp-original-style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--60);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--60)">
<p>Last year I created a fun little experiment where I asked a bunch of LLMs to rank 97 hackernews users using their comment history based on whether they would be good candidates for the role of “software engineer at google”. (yes yes, seems silly I know, you can read <a href="https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/10/18/are-llms-any-good-at-ranking-people/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/12/19/how-confident-are-llms-ranking-people-part-ii/">part 2</a> but they are long).</p>



<p>In it, I had a persistent problem of bias. I had arranged the comments in an interleaved fashion like this: </p>



<blockquote>
<pre>Person one: What makes you think that?<br>Person two: When I was a lad I remember stories of when...<br>Person one: Great post! I particularly like the things and stuff<br>...</pre>
</blockquote>



<p>The users aren’t responding to each other, that’s just how I arranged the comments in the prompt. I didn’t give the model the users names for obvious reasons. Then the model says who it prefers, and using many pairwise comparisons we can come up with a ranking (similar to the way chess rankings work). However, I noticed an odd bias. Even though which user was named “Person one” in the prompt was random, the model still preferred whoever got the name “Person one” slightly more often than not (or for some models, preferred “Person Two”). This is dumb. There is no reason to prefer them for being called “Person One”. It should be considering things like, would they be a good colleague etc. In the end, I evaluated all my models across all 8000 games each played, including some dummy models like one that always chooses “Person One” and one that alphabetically ranks the users. I then compared the ratio of “Person One” as it converged across the games played. Here’s what that looks like:</p>



<figure><amp-img width="535" height="683" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png 535w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22-235x300.png 235w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" data-hero="" i-amphtml-ssr="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><i-amphtml-sizer slot="i-amphtml-svc"></i-amphtml-sizer><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" alt="" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22.png 535w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-22-235x300.png 235w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></amp-img></figure>



<p>The models <em>should</em> hover around that white dashed line. But they don’t. This isn’t just bad luck. The two tailed p-value is vanishingly small after 8000 games for this sort of result (except for the alphabetical model, understandably). </p>



<p>This was very frustrating and I tried a number things to reduce the bias (messing around with prompt formulation etc), but couldn’t get it much better. No matter. I pressed on and found interesting results anyways and wrote about them. The bias wasn’t that bad and, since the order was randomized, it becomes random error, diluted by a larger and larger number of games.</p>



<p>That bring us to today and as-yet unfinished work where I’m asking people (real ones, I promise) to rank TTS voices based on attractiveness (you can help collect data for the study <a href="https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/">here</a> yay!). </p>



<p>What better way to do ranking than pairwise comparisons, I thought?</p>



<p>Guess what.</p>



<p>Go on. Guess.</p>



<figure><amp-img width="845" height="552" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 845w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-300x196.png 300w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img decoding="async" width="845" height="552" src="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 845w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-300x196.png 300w, https://wilsoniumite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9IjU1MiIgd2lkdGg9Ijg0NSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="></amp-img></figure>



<p>Surprising? Ok, maybe not in retrospect. <em>So what</em> if humans who can’t distinguish two TTS voices have a bias toward the sample presented to them on the right hand side of the screen. Indeed, “preferring stuff on the right hand side” has even been studied [1]. </p>



<p>And, I’ll admit, the TTS voices do sometimes sound pretty similar.</p>



<p>Still, to me, this is a little bit cathartic because a) I was quite frustrated by the LLM bias and b) some commentators also said this invalidates the results, which <em>hurt </em>a little. Of course, this bias is still <em>bad</em>, and highlights the need to have things like large sample sizes and randomization. I won’t go much further and get too abstract here, but if there’s another, broader takeaway you could have, it’s that a lot of the safeguards and policy we have to manage humans own unreliability may serve us well in managing the unreliability of AI systems too. Maybe. We’ll have to see.</p>



<p>Oh, and if you think I’m <em>wrong</em>, humans can’t be worse than AI, go ahead and submit your completely objective, unbiased assessments of TTS voices here: <a href="https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/">https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus resigned Monday after accusing the paper's CEO and publisher of killing her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos' latest editorial edict.</p><p>Marcus, an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/ruth-marcus/" target="_blank">associate editor and columnist</a> with The Post's opinion section, is leaving the paper where she's been employed since 1984.</p><p>"We’re grateful for Ruth’s significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years," a spokesperson for The Washington Post said in a statement to NBC News.

<p>Google has gotten its first taste of remedies that Donald Trump’s Department of Justice plans to pursue to break up the tech giant’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">monopoly in search</a>. In the first filing since Trump allies took over the department, government lawyers backed off a key proposal submitted by the Biden DOJ. The government won't ask the court to force Google to sell off its AI investments, and the way it intends to handle Android is changing. However, the most serious penalty is intact—Google's popular Chrome browser is still on the chopping block.</p>
<p>"Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins," the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1184.0_1.pdf">DOJ filing</a> says. To that end, the government maintains that Chrome must go if the playing field is to be made level again.</p>
<p>The DOJ is asking the court to force Google to promptly and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/report-doj-wants-to-force-google-chrome-sale-android-de-bundling/">fully divest itself of Chrome</a>, along with any data or other assets required for its continued operation. It is essentially aiming to take the Chrome user base—consisting of some 3.4 billion people—away from Google and hand it to a competitor. The government will vet any potential buyers to ensure the sale does not pose a national security threat. During the term of the judgment, Google would not be allowed to release any new browsers. However, it may continue to contribute to the open source Chromium project.</p>

<p>This filing includes some changes from the initial remedy filings of 2024, but more changes could be coming. The case is currently under the purview of Omeed Assefi, who is leading the DOJ's Antitrust Division until Trump nominee Gail Slater gets Senate confirmation. Slater expressed support for increased scrutiny of Big Tech in her confirmation hearings, suggesting she could seek to turn the screws on Google after taking charge.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Google's remedy position is light-years away from the Justice Department's. "DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court’s decision and would harm America’s consumers, economy, and national security," said a Google spokesperson.</p>
<p>As expected, Google did not change its <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/">suggested remedies</a> in the case, handing the court a proposal identical to the one it filed months ago. Google says it's open to changing the way search placement deals work for browsers and Android devices, plus it would accept some additional regulatory oversight to ensure compliance. However, staffing changes at the DOJ and Google's recent meetings have not done much to change the government's desire to carve up the company.</p>

<h2>Government to monitor AI and Android</h2>
<p>There are two notable changes in the government's position regarding Android and AI investment. Neither area will completely escape the government's grasp under the proposed remedies, but Google won't have to sell anything immediately.</p>
<p>This case centered on search and did not initially hinge on artificial intelligence. However, things have changed in the years since this case began. Last year, Judge Mehta allowed the government to seek limits on Google's AI investments on the basis that AI was going to be a core part of web search going forward. Google has unintentionally proven that point just recently when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">debuted its new AI Mode in search</a>, which replaces the list of 10 blue links with an AI-derived answer. However, the DOJ is no longer making this request.</p>
<p>This is a small but important win for Google, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/google-increases-investment-in-anthropic-by-another-1-billion/">pumping billions into firms like Anthropic</a> as the AI market takes shape. The company claimed that limiting its activities in this area would weaken US leadership in AI. It <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-cites-national-security-as-it-urges-doj-to-drop-demand-for-breakup/">made this case</a> to the newly restaffed DOJ in recent weeks, and it apparently had an impact. The DOJ no longer seeks to force Google to divest from competing AI firms. Instead, Google would have to notify the government before making new AI investments.</p>

<p>Previously, the government offered Google the option to sell Android in lieu of making any changes to how the platform operates. However, the divestment option is no longer on the table, not that Google was anxious to rid itself of such a key piece of its business. Now, the Justice Department wants the court to impose a raft of restrictions on how Google can promote its products on Android.</p>
<p>The government proposes that Google should be prohibited from making any of its search or generative AI products mandatory on Android, for example, by limiting access to AI Core or other APIs. Similarly, Google would be prevented from pressuring its partners to use Google search or AI services over the competition. If none of this is effective at breaking up Google's monopoly, or if Google attempts to ignore the remedies, the government could force Google to sell Android. In this instance, the government would have the final say on who buys the operating system.</p>
<p>With this round of filings in the rearview mirror, the next phase of the case is expected to get underway in the coming weeks. After the final ruling, Google will most likely seek to have the remedies delayed while it appeals, as it did in the Play Store trial versus Epic last year. While Google may be relieved that the DOJ is relaxing its stance on AI investments, the company is still not happy with the way the case has gone. It still hopes to have the ruling overturned on appeal, thus rendering the discussion of remedies moot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>But David Seubert, who manages sound collections at the University of California, Santa Barbara library, told Ars that he frequently used the project as an archive and not just to listen to the recordings.</p>
<p>For Seubert, the videos that IA records of the 78 RPM albums capture more than audio of a certain era. Researchers like him want to look at the label, check out the copyright information, and note the catalogue numbers, he said.</p>
<p>"It has all this information there," Seubert said. "I don't even necessarily need to hear it," he continued, adding, "just seeing the physicality of it, it's like, 'Okay, now I know more about this record.'"</p>
<p>Music publishers suing IA argue that all the songs included in their dispute—and likely many more, since the Great 78 Project spans 400,000 recordings—"are already available for streaming or downloading from numerous services."</p>
<p>"These recordings face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed," their filing claimed.</p>
<p>But Nathan Georgitis, the executive director of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC), told Ars that you just don't see 78 RPM records out in the world anymore. Even in record stores selling used vinyl, these recordings will be hidden "in a few boxes under the table behind the tablecloth," Georgitis suggested. And in "many" cases, "the problem for libraries and archives is that those recordings aren't necessarily commercially available for re-release."</p>
<p>That "means that those recordings, those artists, the repertoire, the recorded sound history in itself—meaning the labels, the producers, the printings—all of that history kind of gets obscured from view," Georgitis said.</p>
<p>Currently, libraries trying to preserve this history must control access to audio collections, Georgitis said. He sees IA's work with the Great 78 Project as a legitimate archive in that, unlike a streaming service, where content may be inconsistently available, IA's "mission is to preserve and provide access to content over time."</p>

which was only released a few weeks ago!
Early adopters to integrate Kuzu-Wasm include <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope">Alibaba Graphscope</a>, see: <a href="https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/discussions/4946">1</a>
and <a href="https://gsp.vercel.app/#/explore?graph_id=">2</a>, and <a href="https://www.kineviz.com/">Kineviz</a>, whose project will be launched soon.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll showcase the potential of Kuzu-Wasm by building a fully in-browser chatbot
that answers questions over LinkedIn data using an advanced retrieval technique: Graph
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG). This is achieved using Kuzu-Wasm
alongside <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm">WebLLM</a>, a popular in-browser LLM inference engine that can
run LLMs inside the browser.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-introduction-to-webassembly">A quick introduction to WebAssembly</h2>
<p>WebAssembly (Wasm) has transformed browsers into general-purpose computing platforms.
Many fundamental software components, such as full-fledged databases, machine learning
libraries, data visualization tools, and encryption/decryption libraries, now have Wasm versions.
This enables developers to build advanced applications that run entirely in users’
browsers—without requiring backend servers. There are several benefits for building fully
in-browser applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privac</strong>y: Users’ data never leaves their devices, ensuring complete privacy and confidentiality.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Deployment</strong>: An in-browser application that uses Wasm-based components
can run in any browser in a completely serverless manner.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Eliminating frontend-server communication can lead to a significantly faster and
more interactive user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, let’s now demonstrate how to develop a relatively complex AI application completely in
the browser! We’ll build a <strong>fully in-browser</strong> chatbot that uses graph retrieval- augmented
generation (Graph RAG) to answer natural language questions. We demonstrate this using
<a href="https://docs.kuzudb.com/client-apis/wasm/#installation">Kuzu-Wasm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm">WebLLM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The high-level architecture of the application looks as follows:
<img src="https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/graph-rag.png" width="400"></p>
<p>The term “Graph RAG” is used to refer to several techniques but in its simplest form the term
refers to a 3-step retrieval approach. The goal is to retrieve useful context from a graph DBMS (GDBMS)
to help an LLM answer natural language questions.
In our application, the additional data is information about
a user’s LinkedIn data consisting of their contacts, messages, companies the user or their contacts worked for. Yes, you can download
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364/downloading-your-account-data">your own LinkedIn data</a> (and you should, if
for nothing else, to see how much of your data they have!).
The schema of the graph database we use to model this data will be shown below momentarily. First, let’s go over the 3 steps of
Graph RAG:</p>
<ol>
<li>Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{NL}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{Cypher}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>: A user asks a natural language question Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{NL}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, such as “<em>Which of my contacts work at Google?</em>“.
Then, using an LLM, this question is converted to a Cypher query, e.g., <code>MATCH (a:Company)&lt;-[:WorksAt]-(b:Contact) WHERE a.name = "Google" RETURN b</code>,
that aims to retrieve relevant data stored in the GDBMS to answer this question.</li>
<li>Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{Cypher}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Context: Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{Cypher}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is executed in the GBMS and a set of records is retrieved, e.g., “Karen” and “Alice”. Let’s call these retrieved records “Context”.</li>
<li>(Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{NL}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> + Context) <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> A<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{NL}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>: Finally, the original Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{NL}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is given to the LLM along with the retrieved context and the LLM produces a natural language answer A<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{NL}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
e.g., “<em>Karen and Alice work at Google.</em>”</li>

<p>The schema for our personal LinkedIn data’s graph is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/schema.png" width="400"></p><p>We ingest the data into Kuzu-Wasm in several steps using custom JavaScript code (see the <a href="https://github.com/kuzudb/wasm-linkedin-example/blob/main/src/utils/LinkedInDataConverter.js"><code>src/utils/LinkedInDataConverter.js</code></a> file in our Github repo):</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload CSV Files: Users drag and drop their LinkedIn CSV files, which are stored in Kuzu-Wasm’s virtual file system.</li>
<li>Initial Processing: Using Kuzu’s <code>LOAD FROM</code> feature, the raw CSVs are converted into JavaScript objects.</li>
<li>Normalization: In JavaScript, we clean and standardize the data by fixing timestamps, formatting dates, and resolving inconsistent URIs.</li>
<li>Data Insertion: The cleaned data is inserted back into Kuzu-Wasm as a set of nodes and relationships.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="webllm-prompting">WebLLM Prompting</h3>
<p>Our code follows the exact 3 steps above. Specifically, we prompt WebLLM twice, once to create a Cypher query Q<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_{Cypher}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
which is sent to Kuzu-Wasm.
We adapted the prompts from our <a href="https://github.com/kuzudb/langchain-kuzu/">LangChain-Kuzu integration</a>,
with a few modifications. Importantly, we make sure to include the schema information of the LinkedIn database from Kuzu in the prompt, which helps the LLM better understand
the structure and relationships (including the directionality of the relationships) in the dataset.</p>
<p>In this example, we represented the schema as YAML instead of raw, stringified JSON in the LLM prompt.
In our anecdotal experience, for Text-to-Cypher tasks that require reasoning over the schema, we find that LLMs tend do better
with YAML syntax than they do with stringified JSON. More experiments on such Text-to-Cypher tasks will be shown in future blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
<p>It’s indeed impressive to see such a graph-based pipeline with LLMs being done entirely in the browser! There are, however, some caveats.
Most importantly, in the browser, resources are restricted, which limits the sizes of different components of your application.
For example, the size of the LLM you can use is limited. We tested our implementation on a MacBook Pro 2023 and a Chrome browser.
We had to choose the <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC</code> model (see <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC">here</a> for the model card),
which is an instruction-tuned model in MLC format. The <code>q4f32_1</code> format is the smallest of the Llama 3.1 models that has 8B parameters
(the largest has 450B parameters, which is of course too large to run in the browser).
For simple queries, the model performed quite well. It correctly generated Cypher queries for the LinkedIn data, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many companies did I follow?</li>
<li>Which contacts work at Kùzu, Inc?</li>
<li>Which skills do I have?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/successful-generations.png"></p><p>However, we saw that for more complex queries requiring joins, filtering, and aggregation, the model struggled to return a valid Cypher query.
It often produced incorrect or incomplete Cypher queries for questions like: “Who endorsed me the most times?“.
Token generation is also far slower than what you may be used to in state-of-the art interfaces,
such as ChatGPT. In our experiments, we observed a speed of 15-20 tokens/sec, so generating answers took on average, around 10s.</p>
<h2 id="live-demo">Live demo</h2>
<p>We have deployed this demo so you can test it in your browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wasm-linkedin-example.kuzudb.com/">Live Demo</a>: Drag and drop your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364/downloading-your-account-data">LinkedIn data dump</a> into
the app and start querying your personal graph. The demo also visualizes your data in a node-link graph view using <code>vis.js</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kuzudb/wasm-linkedin-example">GitHub Repository</a>: The source code is openly available so you can experiment with it further. If you see better results with different models/prompts, we’d love to hear it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the data is loaded, you can see a visualization that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/landing-page.png"></p><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>The key takeaway from this post is that such advanced pipelines that utilize graph databases and LLMs are now possible <em>entirely in the browser</em>.
We expect that many of the performance limitations of today will improve over time, with the wider adoption of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/">WebGPU</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64">Wasm64</a>, and other <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals?tab=readme-ov-file">proposals</a>
to improve Wasm. LLMs are also rapidly getting smaller &amp; better, and before we know it, it will be possible to use very advanced LLMs
in the browser. The next release of Kuzu will include a native vector index (it’s already available
in our nightly build; see <a href="https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/4578">this PR</a> for how to use it!).
As a result, you can also store the embeddings of documents
along with actual node and relationship records to enhance your graph retrievals, entirely within Kuzu.
Using our upcoming vector index,
you’ll be able to try all sorts of interesting RAG techniques, coupled with Kuzu-Wasm, all within the browser while keeping your data private.
The sky is the limit!</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

        <p>The introduction of automatically focusing lenses has changed photography in numerous ways. Autofocus systems have significantly improved the reliability and accuracy with which fast moving objects can be shot. Round four decades ago, the new level of convenience offered by autofocus lenses has made photography more accessible to the masses. Since their first release of an autofocus lens in 1981, Canon has constantly developed their lens technology using different approaches. Over time, Canon has introduced seven different autofocus motor technologies that will be presented here.</p>

        <h2>Canon Autofocus Systems</h2>
        <p>In optics, focus describes the point at which incoming light rays converge and it is used synonymously as a concept of sharpness. Autofocus, by contrast, is a technology to automatically focus the lens at a desired subject. The <a href="https://exclusivearchitecture.com/03-technical-articles-DSLR-03-autofocus-systems.html">autofocus detection system</a> inside the camera determines the ideal focusing lens position and instructs the lenses autofocus drive accordingly. In 1987, Canon has introduced the both the EOS camera system and EF lenses which have been designed with autofocus as standard features. There have been some Canon autofocus lenses available before that date, but these have been discontinued with the introduction of EF lenses. For this reason, this chapter focuses on all autofocus motor types that are used in EF, EF-S, RF, and RF-S lenses that are marketed still today.</p>
        </div>

        
        <div>
        <p>
            <h2>Types of Autofocus Actuators</h2>
        </p>    
            
            
        <div>
            <p>The autofocus group of lens elements always shifts along the optical axis in a linear way. While focusing automatically, the movement is generated by some type of actuator. Autofocus actuators can basically be divided into two categories:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li><b>Rotary Drive Systems:</b> These generate a rotation that is translated into a linear sliding motion via precision mechanics. One common transmission type uses a focusing barrel with helical slots. The focusing group of lens elements is engaged with these slots and slides forwards or backwards axially when the helical slot barrel is turned. Another possible transmission type uses a lead screw with a lead nut that connects to the focusing group of lens elements.</li>
            <li><b>Linear Drive Systems:</b> Also called direct-drive systems. These perform a sliding movement that does not have to be translated. The focusing group of lens elements is directly connected to the linear actuator.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The first types of autofocus drive systems used rotary movement and these include the Arc-Form Drive, Ring-Type USM, DC Micro Motor, Micro USM, Micro USM II, and Stepper Motor. Later, the switch was made to linear drives which include the Nano USM and the Voice Coil Motor.</p>
        </div> 
            
        
        <p>
            <h2>Canon AF Comparison</h2>
        </p>     
            
            
        <div>
        <p>The following comparison chart shows all of the autofocus drive types that have ever been used in Canon's EF, EF-S, RF, and RF-S lenses. Note how the indication on lens barrels is often just USM but the exact type of built-in motor can be different. This is because Canon's USM autofocus drive system comprises several different mechanism families, the ring-type USM, the Micro USM (I and II), and the linear Nano USM. All USM drives use piezoelectric technology but with some variations. If an autofocus Canon lens has no indication on its barrel about the autofocus technology used, the lens either has an AFD or DC Micro Motor installed. The date indicates when a particular type of motor was first used in a lens. While some of the early types like the Arc-Form Drive have been discontinued, most other types are still in use today. One key differentiator between these technologies is the capability of a lens to allow full-time manual (FTM) focus override. The ring-type ultrasonic Motor was the first autofocus system that allowed FTM focus override. Until 2012, most other lenses did not offer this type of manual focusing while autofocus is activated. The latest types of autofocus drives, including the Stepper Motor, Nano USM, and Voice Coil Motor, offer focus-by-wire. This is a concept where the manual focusing ring on the lens barrel is not mechanically coupled with the focusing group of lens elements but electronically controls the autofocus drive. Lenses that use focus-by-wire always offer full-time manual focus override.</p>

        <h2>Arc-Form Drive (AFD)<br>1987 - 1990</h2>
        <p>Originally, the designation AFD stood for autofocus drive. Later, when other autofocus drive systems were introduced, the term was changed into Arc-Form Drive.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The Shape</h2>
            <p>The Arc-Form Drive was the first autofocus motor that was used in EF lenses. The assembly included the motor unit, the gear drive, and a transmission that allowed the user to switch between manual focusing and autofocusing. The AFD assembly was shaped like an arc so that it could easily be installed inside a cylindrical lens barrel.</p>

            <h2>Construction</h2>
            <p>The illustration shows an Arc-Form Drive inside a Canon EF 50mm F2.5 Compact Macro lens. The unit is driven by a 2-phase bipolar asymmetric stepper motor that consists of a stator core, two electromagnetic coils (each coil is also referred to as a phase), and a permanent magnet rotor. The bipolar construction of the motor allows current to flow through each coil in both directions. The term asymmetric refers to the shape of the stator that is not rotationally symmetric as in conventional stepper motors (but it is axially symmetrical though).</p>   
            <p>The motor drives a reduction gear train that has the purpose of reducing the output gear's speed but at the same time increase the torque of that gear. A lever is used to shift the output gear in one of two possible positions where it either engages with the gear train or with the manual input gear that is connected to the manual focusing ring of the barrel.</p>
            
            <p>Two feedback systems are used to monitor the drive unit during operation. One system is used to confirm proper rotation of the rotor and another system is used to measure the number of turns the unit has performed:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Two hall effect sensors are placed very closely at the rotor. These can detect changes in magnetic fields and are therefore used to confirm rotor movement.</li>
            <li>An optical encoder wheel with alternating black and reflective zones is attached to one of the gears. An infrared reflective sensor is placed so that it can read the number of steps that the encoder wheel turns (each transition between two zones is a step). This provides crucial feedback to the lens controller as autofocus instructions typically include a predefined number of steps an autofocus motor has to move into a certain direction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Front View</h2>
            <p>The illustration is a front view of the stepper motor with the cover removed. The rotor has two magnetic polarities opposite to each other, north and south. The stator consists of two phases that are colored in cyan and green for reasons of better explainability. The stator cores run through the phase coils to conduct the electromagnetic flux towards the rotor.</p>

            <h2>Stepper Motor Operation</h2>
            <p>During autofocus operation, the wire coils are excited via electrical impulses, which in turn magnetizes the stator core. The polarity of the voltage applied to the two coils is changed in a pre-defined sequence. The rotor performs a complete rotation in four steps:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Phase B coil is turned off. Phase A coil is energized so that the left part of the stator core is magnetized, attracting the rotor to perform a rotation. (This is a 90 degree clockwise rotation if the previous step of the motor was step 4.)</li>
            <li>Phase A coil is turned off. Phase B coil is energized so that the right part of the stator core is magnetized. This attracts the rotor so that it performs a 90 degree clockwise rotation. </li>
            <li>Phase B coil is turned off. Phase A coil is energized with opposite polarity. This magnetizes the left part of the stator core again, but this time with opposite magnetic polarity. The rotor is attracted again so that it performs another 90 degree clockwise rotation.</li>
            <li>Phase A coil is turned off. Phase B coil is energized with opposite polarity. This magnetizes the right part of the stator core again, but this time with opposite magnetic polarity. This induces the rotor to perform another 90 degree clockwise rotation.</li>
            </ol>
                
            <p>The sequence of steps is repeated as long as the rotor is required to turn. If the sequence is run in reverse from step 4 to step 1, the rotor turns counter-clockwise. The diagram summarizes these four steps.</p>

            <h2>AFD Transmission</h2>
            <p>The AFD motor was designed with a transmission element that is also the output gear, the one that actually drives the helical focusing barrel. Note how the focusing barrel has a wide gear rim along its perimeter that allows the transmission element to shift a certain amount while always remaining engaged with the focusing barrel. The metal lever is connected to the MF/AF switch on the lens barrel and it shifts the transmission element so that it connects the output gear either with the motorized gear train or with the manual input gear. If the output gear is connected to one option, it is disengaged from the other option. For that reason, the Arc-Form Drive does not have full-time manual focus override available.</p>    

            <p>In terms of overall performance and usability, the Arc-Form Drive is considered to be noisy during operation and slower than other autofocus drives. When following moving subjects, the system shows a noticeable reaction time. Lenses with an Arc-Form Drive have to sequentially focus and then stop down the aperture diaphragm. All other lenses with different autofocus motors are able to operate the autofocus motor and aperture diaphragm at the same time. Despite these weaknesses, AFD lenses still offer reliable autofocusing performance.</p>

        <h2>Ring-Type Ultrasonic Motor (USM)<br>1987 - Present</h2>
        <p>Canon's ultrasonic motors are very exceptional types of actuators. They neither have electromagnetic coils or magnetic rotors, so their motion is not generated by magnetism like in traditional motors. Instead, they use an ingenious combination of piezoelectric effects and friction. Introduced in November 1987 with the Canon EF 300mm F2.8L USM lens, the ring-type USM was the first implementation of this piezoelectric technology in photographic lenses, and in the years that followed, some different types of USM drives would appear.</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div>
        <div>
        <p>Canon's ring-type ultrasonic motor – as the name suggests – is shaped like a ring and, for that reason, fits perfectly inside the lens barrel. The optical system of the lens runs through the opening of that construction. At the time of its advent, this new technology was groundbreaking in its design and functionality, being ultra-fast and silent. They provide a high level of torque powerful enough to move even heavy groups of focusing lens elements inside super-telephoto lenses. Due to their high torque, no speed-reducing gear train is required when connecting the motor to the focusing mechanism. The ring-type USM has high holding torque maintained at zero input power and offers low inertia from its rotor providing rapid start and stop characteristics. In addition, this type of drive technology is unaffected by electromagnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Ring-Type USM Main Parts</h2>
            <p>The ring-type USM can be divided into the rotor, the piezoelectric stator, and various support rings.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>The rotor is the only part of this motor that actually rotates around the optical axis while the USM is in operation. The rotor itself is a compound of metal and plastic parts bonded together. The rotor has a sliding rail on the side facing the stator.</li>
            <li>The stator is an elastic metal body. In this context, elastic refers to the ability of the stator to oscillate to a certain extent, similar to a tuning fork. The stator has a ring of piezoelectric ceramic elements welded to its back (away from the rotor). Once this layer is electrically excited, it sets the stator into vibration. The vibrational energy is then transferred into the rotor via friction. Apart from its vibration, the stator does not move.</li>
            <li>A felt ring is used to protect the sensitive piezoelectric layer from the metal support rings that are pressed against the stator, and to dampen the vibrations from being transmitted into the lens barrel.</li>
            <li>The ring-type USM motor only works when the stator is firmly pressed against the rotor. The compression spring is what exerts this pressure on both the stator and rotor. This spring is an important part that ensures proper functionality of the ring-type USM.</li>
            <li>the lock ring is an interface part that holds all parts of the unit tightly together. Three indents on the inner circumference of the lock ring slide into slots of an inner lens barrel, securing the ring in place.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </div>
                
        
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ring-Type USM Details</h2>
            <p>The following illustration is a cross-sectional view of the ring-type USM when it is fully assembled. The piezoelectric layer is what generates vibrations. A flex cable connects the piezoelectric elements with the lens circuit board, and therefore provides power to this element. Once the unit is installed inside a lens barrel, a dedicated contact surface on the rotor pushes against wheels on an output ring (not shown in this illustration) that ultimately drives the focusing mechanism.</p>
            
            <p>The compression spring creates a tension that is also referred to as preload force. Flat surface finishes of the sliding rail and the stator teeth ensure a good friction coefficient between rotor and stator. The preload force and the friction between the rotor and the stator determine the passive holding torque of the motor at zero power input.</p>

            <h2>The Piezoelectric Ceramic Ring</h2>
            <p>The operation of the motor requires the stator to vibrate in a very precise way. This vibration is generated by a segmented piezoelectric ceramic ring that is welded to the back of the elastic stator body. The illustration of the piezoelectric array shows the distribution and configuration of piezo elements on the ring.</p>
            
            <p>The individual piezo elements are grouped together into groups A and B. Each group can be energized individually, and set the ring into vibration to form a standing wave with wavelength λ. Two piezo elements cover one full wavelength λ, and therefore each single piezo element has a length of λ/2. One of the key factors to ensure proper wave excitation in the stator is that both piezo groups are offset by λ/4 as shown in the illustration. This is also referred to as a <b>spatial phase shift of λ/4</b>.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
        
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Piezo Elements</h2>
            
            <p>Piezoelectric ceramic elements are sandwiched between two electrodes. Electrode 1 is in direct contact with the metal stator ring and serves as ground (GND). In the following illustration, the lower electrodes of all piezo elements are covered by a layer of silver conductive adhesive so these elements are electrically connected to one group.</p>
            
            <p>The piezoelectric ceramic elements have the property to deform when an electrical field is applied, an effect also described as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The direction in which piezo elements deform is defined by their piezoelectric polarization, expressed via positive and negative signs in this slightly simplified diagram. Depending on the polarity of the voltage applied across the electrodes, the individual piezo elements bend upwards or downwards. As piezo elements are arranged with alternating piezoelectric polarities, energizing the piezoceramic layer shapes the stator into a waveform. When the electrodes are subject to an alternating voltage of high frequency, the stator ring begins to oscillate. The amplitude of these oscillations is as small as 1-2&nbsp;µm.</p>

            <h2>Piezo Group A is Energized</h2>
            <p>For the sake of better understanding, the two piezoelectric groups are viewed from the top, and energized separately. Piezo group A is fed by a distinct sinusoidal voltage (phase A) while piezo group B remains de-energized. This not only generates a standing wave across group A but the wave unfolds across the entire stator ring. Looking at a snapshot in time, hollow circles indicate valleys in the stator, whereas solid black circles indicate peaks in the stator. Note how the peaks and valleys are exactly at the center of each piezo element of group A, whereas on the opposite side of the ring, peaks and valleys are exactly between the piezo elements. Over the course of one sine oscillation, peaks will turn into valleys and back into peaks. At the same time valleys turn into peaks and back into valleys. A clear standing wave is formed only if the excitation frequency is equal to the natural flexural vibration resonant frequency of the stator. The resonant frequency of Canon's ring-type USM is approximately 27,000&nbsp;Hz (oscillations per second). This frequency is in the ultrasonic range, which is why this type of autofocus technology is called ultrasonic. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of phase A generating a standing wave.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Piezo Group B is Energized</h2>
            <p>Now piezo group B is fed by a distinct sinusoidal voltage (phase B) while piezo group A remains de-energized. Again, a standing wave is generated and unfolds across the entire stator ring. This time, peaks (hollow circles) and valleys (solid black circles) are at the center of each piezo element of group B, whereas on the opposite side of the ring, peaks and valleys are exactly between the piezo elements. This shows that the two standing waves generated by group A and B are not congruent. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of phase B generating a standing wave.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Both Groups are Energized</h2>
            <p>When both piezo groups are energized at the same time, their vibration-induced standing waves are combined and form a new wave. When phase A and phase B are shifted by a quarter of a sine wavelength λ – called a <b>temporal phase shift of λ/4</b> – the resulting wavelength is a traveling wave. This temporal phase shift can be achieved, for example, by using a sine wave for phase A and a cosine wave for phase B. Unlike a standing wave, the peaks and valleys of a traveling wave move around the circumference of the stator ring similar to waves on the surface of water. This traveling wave is the source of the motor’s rotational energy. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of both phases generating a traveling wave.</p>
            
            <p> The sign of the temporal phase shift determines the propagating direction of the traveling wave, and  consequently also the rotating direction of the rotor. The stator has teeth cut into the material, and these are designed to amplify the movement of the ring.</p>

        </div>
            
        
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Feedback Control System</h2>
            <p>Not all piezo elements on the stator ring are used to generate waves. One small piezo element is located between the wave-generating piezo groups A and B and it serves as a sensor to measure the intensity of stator oscillations. Like all other piezo elements, the sensor element is sandwiched between two electrodes 1 and 2 (not shown in the illustration). Electrode 1 is directly connected to the metal stator body and serves as ground, whereas electrode 2 is on the opposite side and connects to the sensor line.</p>
            
            <p>It was described earlier that applying a voltage to a piezo element generates a deformation of that element, referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The actual (non-inverted) piezoelectric effect, however, is that pressure or deformation (such as bending) of the piezo element will generate an electric voltage. Consequently, the piezo's electrical output reflects the wave amplitude of the stator at its location. This signal is picked up by the control circuitry and can be used to adjust the frequencies of phases A and B accordingly.</p>
            
            <p>This feedback control system is required to monitor the proper excitation of the stator ring, and to achieve maximum amplitude of the traveling wave. The maximum amplitude can only be attained when the wave-generating phases precisely hit the natural resonance frequency of the stator body. That natural resonance frequency may vary from unit to unit due to small production related variations in dimensions, and for a given unit the natural resonance will vary with the temperature of the stator.</p>

            <p>The illustration of the stator ring's electric connections shows a piece of flex cable (copper wire traces laminated onto a thin film) attached to the back of the stator ring.
                
            All piezo elements – both wave generating elements and the sensor element – have electrodes that are in direct contact with the conductive stator ring. The GND wire is directly connected to the metal stator body, and therefore all piezo elements share the metal body as a common ground connection. The phase A wire is connected to the exposed electrode of the first piezo element of group A, and a thin film of silver conductive adhesive electrically connects all other elements of phase A with the first element. The phase B wire is connected to phase B in a similar way. The sensor wire is connected to the exposed electrode of the sensor element.</p>

            <p>The following illustration shows 3D models of the ring-type USM stator. On the inactive stator ring, all teeth are in the same plane, allowing the stator to rest flat on the rotor. Once the stator is excited, it forms a traveling wave, here greatly exaggerated for the sake of clarification. The number of waves per cycle depends on the configuration of piezo elements. In this example, there are nine waves per cycle, but Canon also uses stators that form seven waves. The number n of waves formed on the stator means that one particular wave peak requires n excitation periods to completely travel around the stator one time.</p>

            <h2>Traveling Wave of the USM Stator</h2>
            <p>The animation shows nine waves traveling across the stator ring in a very slowed-down form. It is clearly visible that the stator itself does not turn around its axis but only the peaks and valleys move as it performs this undulating vibration.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
        
        
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Moving the Rotor</h2>
            <p>The generation of a traveling wave can be considered as the first step in a two-step energy conversion process. The second step is the stator teeth transmitting their vibrational energy into a unidirectional continuous movement of the rotor via friction. Looking very closely at the stator teeth, the traveling wave induces elliptical motions at the tips of each tooth. In the animation, only one elliptical path of one tooth is shown, but all the other teeth carry out identical elliptical motions. Where the traveling wave forms peaks, the teeth are pressed against the rotor and push it in the direction of the elliptical motion. As a result, the rotor moves in the opposite direction of the traveling wave.</p>
                
            <p>It can be calculated how fast the traveling wave propagates. It is assumed in this example that 27,000 Hz  is exactly the natural resonance frequency of the stator ring. With nine peaks formed across the stator, it requires nine excitation periods for one peak to completely run around the stator ring one time. Thus, if the excitation frequency is at 27,000 Hz, one peak will travel a full revolution around the stator ring 3,000 times per second. Although the peaks travel at an extremely fast speed, the speed of the rotor is comparatively low. The rotor typically turns at a rate of 70-90 revolutions per minute, if excited continuously. The speed can be lowered by exciting the stator via pulse-width modulation. The microscopic oscillations of the tooth tips are the reason why the ratio between rotor speed and traveling wave speed is very low. This low ratio is actually an advantage as no speed-reducing gearbox is required, and the rotor can be directly coupled to the focusing mechanism of the lens barrel.</p>

            <h2>The Working Principle Summarized</h2>
            
            <p>The ring-type ultrasonic motor operates a two-stage energy conversion process: In a first stage, electrical energy is converted into an undulating motion by the piezoelectric elements of the stator. In a second stage, these ultrasonic vibrations at around 27 kHz are converted into a continuous unidirectional rotating movement of the rotor by friction on the stator.</p>
            
            <p>The traveling wave is generated by two main factors: Two groups of piezoceramic elements must be arranged with a spatial phase shift of λ/4, and these two groups must be energized with a temporal phase shift of λ/4. The elliptical motion of the stator teeth is transferred into the rotor due to friction between the stator and rotor, caused by the pressure contact (preload force) between stator and rotor.
            Friction between stator and rotor.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
            <p>Although being extremely well suited for photographic camera lenses, these motors show some drawbacks:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>This type of motor is not designed for continuous operation. Due to the friction involved, its life expectancy is lower than that of conventional electric motors.</li>
            <li>Although the ultrasonic noise cannot be perceived by the human ear, it can be picked up by sensitive microphones which can be problematic during video shootings.</li>
            <li>Ring-type USM motors are comparatively expensive to produce: The stator ring including all of its teeth are precisely cut by CNC milling machines. The production and application of piezoceramics is another difficult process. In addition, this type of autofocus motor requires complex power supply and driving circuits including high frequency generation and feedback control system.</li>

            <p>It was described in the beginning of this chapter that the ring-type ultrasonic motor was the first autofocus system that allowed full-time manual focus override. This is not a function of the ultrasonic drive unit itself, but rather of the cleverly designed differential mechanism.</p>
            
            <p>The challenge with the implementation of full-time manual focusing in general is that the user must be able to manually override the autofocus system (by turning the focusing ring on the barrel) without forcing the motor or grinding the gears. The ring-type USM prevents this from happening via an additional output ring that connects to the focusing group of lenses via a link bracket. Once this output wheel is turned, the focusing group adjusts the focusing distance of the lens. They key feature of this output ring is that it has three small wheels installed along its outer periphery. These wheels are sandwiched between the two input options – the manual input ring and the motor input ring (the USM stator). This is a rotary differential mechanism, and it allows either one of these input options to turn the output ring without exerting a force on the other input option. For that reason, the manual focusing ring can be turned without forcing the rotor into any direction. Due to this rotary differential, full-time manual focusing has become a standard feature on all lenses with a ring-type ultrasonic motor.</p>

        <p>The following illustration shows the output wheel with its small carrier wheels. The top right shows a schematic of both input options (manual input and motor input) and how they are arranged in the lens barrel. Note that due to the differential construction the output wheel does not turn at the same speed as the input wheels, but at a speed defined by the formula: v<sub>OUT</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span><sup>v<sub>IN1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;v<sub>IN2</sub></sup><span>⁄</span><sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp; where v<sub>IN1</sub> refers to the speed of the manual input ring and v<sub>IN2</sub> refers to the speed of the motor input ring. If one of the input rings is not moving (which is normally the case), the output speed v<sub>OUT</sub> is half of the input speed.</p>

        <p>This diagram is a front view of the rotary differential mechanism. It is clearly visible how the mechanical link is established between the output ring and the focusing lens cell. As the differential mechanism turns around the lens axis, the focusing lens cell is shifted forward or backward, while still remaining engaged with the link bracket via the connecting handle. To ensure smooth movements, Canon uses some lubrification on the sliding elements.</p>

            <p>The DC Micro Motor – sometimes abbreviated MM – looks quite similar to the AFD motor. It has almost an identical shape. In addition, the DC Micro Motor also uses a reduction gear train to transmit the motor's power to the focusing lens barrel. However, the type of motor itself is different. Instead of a stepper motor as used in the AFD, this type of autofocus drive uses an ultra-compact direct current (DC) motor. This is an extremely common type of motor, and it is considered to be the least advanced autofocus motor used in Canon lenses along with the AFD. Canon primarily uses the DC Micro Motor in entry-level autofocus lenses. Here are some examples of lenses that use this type of drive system:</p>

            <h2>The Gear Train</h2>
            <p>Once power is supplied to a direct current motor, the rotor starts to turn very fast. For that reason, the gear train attached to the motor uses a high reduction ratio to lower the speed of rotation. At the same time, rotational torque is increased towards the output gear.</p>
            
            <p>The DC Micro Motor has a lever to shift one gear between two positions. One position closes the gear train so that the motor's rotation is forwarded to the output gear, and the other position interrupts the transmission of rotational force. A tiny metal spring holds this switching gear under slight pressure so that it remains in its default position engaged with the other gears. Only when the AF/MF switch on the barrel is moved to the MF position, the lever shifts the switching gear so that it disconnects from its adjacent gears, disconnecting the motor from the output gear. This type of transmission shows that the DC Micro Motor does not support full-time manual focus override.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
            
        <div>
        <p>An exploded view of the DC Micro Motor shows some more details of the unit. The rotor shaft is connected to a small pulley which drives another pulley via a rubber belt. This belt drive helps reduce vibrations that might be induced by the motor's operation. The larger pulley is connected to the first gear of the reduction gearbox. An encoder wheel with numerous tiny openings alongside its perimeter is attached to the first gear. Each transition between an opening and solid material is one step of the encoder wheel. A sensor runs an infrared beam through one of these openings, and records the signal on the other side. Once the wheel is turned, the signal is interrupted until the next opening where the signal is recorded again. This setup allows the lens electronics to count the number of steps the encoder wheel has turned and thus how far the focusing lens group has been moved.</p>

            <h2>The Brushed DC Motor</h2>
            <p>The exact type of motor is a 2-pole 3-coil brushed DC motor. The description 2-pole refers to the two connection terminals at the back of the motor. These connections directly lead to the two metal brushes that touch the rotor's commutator from opposite sides. This is how electrical power is supplied to the rotor. The description 3-coil indicates that the rotor has three coil windings attached to its metal core. Each of these coils is an electromagnet that can change its polarity.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Configuration</h2>
            <p>The following schematic shows the electrical configuration of the rotor. The commutator has three separate contact surfaces, and these are connected to the windings as depicted. As the brushes are 180 degrees apart, they only form electrical connections with two of the contact areas at a given time. This design is the key requirement for the coils to form correctly oriented magnetic fields.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The DC Motor in Operation</h2>
            <p>The two power terminals of the DC motor are energized with an operating DC voltage between 4 and 6 volts. The metal brushes pass on this voltage to the commutator, which in turn applies that voltage to the coils. The magnetic fields produced at each coil are either repelled or attracted by the stator's permanent magnets. Due to the commutator's design and the wiring configuration, each coil changes its electrical (and therefore magnetic) polarity as soon as it has reached maximum proximity to a permanent magnet. This switches the coils from being attracted to being repelled, ensuring a continuous rotation. This principle allows a small DC motor to run at speeds up to 6.000 rpm. When the voltage polarity of the brushes is reversed, the rotor turns in the opposite direction.</p>
            
            <p>The advantage of the DC Micro Motor is that it runs on a DC voltage, and therefore does not require any complex driver electronics such as a stepper motor. Nevertheless, the control circuitry must be capable of handling comparatively large currents. Due to its limited torque, the DC Micro Motor is almost always used in compact lenses with smaller and lighter focusing lens groups. Another disadvantage of this autofocus drive is its relatively noisy operation. Nevertheless, it is a reliable autofocus system that is embedded in numerous Canon lenses.</p>

        <h2>Micro USM and Micro USM II<br>1992 - 2016</h2>
        <p>The Micro USM and Micro USM II are different members of Canon's ultrasonic motor family. The first generation Micro USM was introduced in 1992. Ten years later in 2002, the second generation Micro USM II followed with an ultra-compact design half the size of the original version.</p>

            <h2>Construction</h2>
            <p>Canon's Micro USM actuators are small-diameter (11&nbsp;mm) cylindrical ultrasonic motors using piezoelectric ceramic elements to generate oscillations. Compared to the <a href="#QJ_POS_02">ring-type USM</a>, the Micro USM uses an ultra-compact design. The original Micro USM version has an overall length of 26.7&nbsp;mm whereas the Micro USM II is just 13.4&nbsp;mm long. Both versions of the Micro USM have an output gear that engages with a speed-reducing and torque-increasing gearbox that is connected to the focusing cam barrel.</p>
            
            <p>The Micro USM motor in general is a stack of different parts pressed together via a metal shaft. The motor can be divided into the rotor, the stator, and some auxiliary parts and support structures. The attachment flange is usually described as the top of the unit.</p>

            <h2>Micro USM Main Parts</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>A flexible metal shaft has threads cut into both ends so that retaining nuts and discs can be screwed on to hold the entire stack of parts together. An attachment flange is used on the top of the motor to allow the Micro USM to be installed in the gearbox of the autofocus mechanism.</li>
            <li>The metal rotor has two slots on one side where it engages with two protrusions on the surface of the output gear wheel. Therefore, every movement of the rotor is transmitted directly to the output gear wheel. On the opposite side, the rotor has a tiny lip (seen on the cross-sectional view) where it forms a pressure contact with one of the stator's oscillators. The pressure is formed by a small spring that is directly pushing onto the rotor from the top side.</li>
            <li>The stator consists of a laminated piezoelectric element (LPE) that is sandwiched between two oscillators. These oscillators are cylindrical metal bodies that are pressed flat against the adjacent parts. The stator's oscillator 2 is held in place by a threaded disc. This threaded disc is omitted on the Micro USM II, as in this version the oscillator 2 is designed with an own thread.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>The Principle of Operation</h2>
            <p>Both versions of Micro USM autofocus drives use piezoelectric elements to generate ultrasonic vibrations in the stator. While this principle is similar to the ring-type USM, the Micro USM type of motors use an entirely different stator design. 
                
            </p><h2>The Laminated Piezoelectric Element (LPE)</h2>    
            
            <p>The Micro USM uses piezoceramic discs to generate ultrasonic vibrations in the stator. As the vibrations of each individual disc are extremely small in amplitude, a stack of round 25 discs is laminated to a solid piezoceramic part. The resulting multi-layer cylindrical unit is called the laminated piezoelectric element (LPE). The illustration is a schematic view of one piezoceramic disc.</p>
            
            <p>The two halves of these discs have been polarized in opposite directions. Each disc has four electrodes attached to either side, two on each half. This allows the discs to be energized in two phases A and B. If an electric voltage is applied to one phase, the electric field that forms across the electrodes causes one quarter of the disc to expand and one quarter to contract. This electrically induced deformation of piezoceramic material is referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The reaction of piezoceramic material is roughly 10 times higher in the expanding way rather than in the contracting way. In the illustration, the level of deformation is hugely exaggerated to illustrate the principles involved.</p>

        <p>The illustration shows the arrangement of discs inside the laminated piezoelectric element, and how electrical power is supplied to each disc. Layers with even numbers have their A+/- and B+/- electrodes on their top, while layers with uneven numbers (except for the first one) have AG and BG electrodes on their top. Each disc has a number of through-holes, tiny conductive paths that establish electrical connections between the different layers. Note how some electrodes are shaped with recesses so that there is enough space for through-holes into deeper layers of the stack. The discs and through-holes are arranged so that energizing the A-phase (applying a voltage between the A and AG contacts) will energize all the A-phase portions of all discs at the same time. The same applies for the B-phase. This synchronized activation of all discs causes a uniform deformation of the entire LPE. Electrical power is provided via a thin sheet of printed circuit board that is pressed against the top surface of the LPE, establishing a connection to all of the through-holes of that first disc. The individual layers are not visible to the naked eye.</p>

            <h2>Flexural Vibration</h2>
            <p>With the LPE sandwiched between the two oscillator bodies, energizing the LPE with a sinusoidal voltage causes the oscillators to vibrate. Vibration is amplified by exciting the stator with the natural resonance frequency of the oscillators which is in the ultrasonic range. The illustration shows how the stator vibration even causes a lateral displacement of the stator body.</p>

            <h2>Both Phases are Energized</h2>
            <p>The two phases of the LPE are energized with high-frequency voltages that are shifted by λ/4 (temporal phase shift). The resulting vibrations from each phase combine and generate a nutation motion of the stator around its axis. This nutation forms a peak at the top surface of the larger oscillator that moves around the circumference similar to a traveling wave. The amplitude of that oscillation movement is as small as two micrometers, and therefore not visible to the naked eye. The oscillator has a small lip on its surface that is in pressure contact with the rotor.</p>

            <p>The animation shows the nutation movement of the stator. The rotor and output gear, among other parts, are not shown here to most clearly illustrate the movement. The nutation is slowed down and greatly exaggerated in amplitude. Note that the stator itself does not rotate around its axis but only the peak on the top surface of the larger oscillator travels in a circular way. This traveling wave (one peak and one valley) is the source of rotational energy that is transferred into the rotor via friction.</p>

        <p>This animation shows the complete Micro USM unit in operation. The principle of transferring the stator's energy into the rotor is similar to the frictional coupling used by the ring-type USM motor. The Micro USM rotor is in pressure contact with the top surface of the elastic body. Proper operation is achieved only when the stator is excited at the exact resonance frequency of the elastic metal bodies, which amplifies vibrations and thus energy transfer into the rotor. Although the Micro USM stator has no teeth cut into the oscillator body, the traveling wave exerts frictional force in the opposite direction of the nutation motion. This principle of frictional coupling is very similar to the ring-type USM. The animation shows that the rotor and output gear perform actual rotations around their axis, and their direction of rotation is opposite from the direction of the stator's traveling wave.</p>

            <h2>The Working Principle Summarized</h2>
            
            <p>The cylindrical ultrasonic motor operates a two-stage energy conversion process: In a first stage, electrical energy is converted into a nutation motion of the stator. In a second stage, these ultrasonic vibrations are converted into a continuous unidirectional rotating movement of the rotor by friction on the stator. The stator vibrations are generated by a multi-layer laminated piezoelectric element that is excited via two separate phases that are excited with a λ/4 phase-shifted sinusoidal voltage, generating the nutation mode. The stator's energy is transferred to the rotor due to friction between the stator and rotor, caused by the pressure contact (preload force) between stator and rotor.</p>
            
            <p>This summary is similar in many respects to the summary of the ring-type USM motor. While the Micro USM and ring-type USM share the same general principles, they are still different types of motors. Here is a comparison of the similarities and the differences between the Micro USM and the ring-type USM:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Similarities</h2>

            <p>Both types of motors use piezoelectric elements to generate flexural vibrations in the stator, as well as ultrasonic excitation to maximize vibrations in the oscillators. A traveling wave is generated at the surface of the stator, and friction is used to turn the rotor in the opposite way than the traveling wave. Both types are inaudible by the naked ear, but their noise can be picked up by sensitive microphones during video recordings. Neither of them is intended for long-term operation.</p>
            
            <h2>Differences</h2>
            
            <p>Ring-type USM and Micro USM types of autofocus drives use completely different stator geometries. Also, their piezoceramic elements are arranged in different ways. The stator of a ring-type USM forms seven to nine traveling waves whereas the stator of a Micro USM performs a nutation motion that is similar to a single traveling wave (one peak and one valley). The overall size of the Micro USM is considerably smaller than the ring-shaped USM. Output speed is relatively high on the Micro USM, and therefore a gearbox is used to lower the speed of the output gear. Overall production cost is comparatively low for the Micro USM and Micro USM II, which is why these types of motors have been used for the low- and mid-level lenses.</p>

        <p>In June 2012, Canon announced the EF 40mm F2.8 STM and the EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS STM lenses. These were the first lenses that carried the designation STM in their name, an abbreviation that stands for stepper motor. Although the technology had already been used in the Arc-Form Drive, the stepper motor inside STM lenses has a clearly different design including a greatly reduced size.</p>

            <h2>Two Gear Types</h2>
            <p>Stepper motors are rotary drives that convert electrical energy into rotational energy of the motor shaft. Canon uses two different transmission types to convert the rotary motion into linear motion of the focusing lens groups:</p>
                
            <ul>
            <li><b>Lead-Screw-Type STM:</b> This type of transmission uses a worm drive to side the focusing lens unit axially along two guide rails.</li>
            <li><b>Gear-Type STM:</b> This type of transmission uses gear wheels and is ultimately connected to a focusing barrel with helical slots. Once that internal barrel is turned, the focusing lens unit is shifted along the lens axis.</li>
            </ul>   
                
            <p>While these are different types of transmissions, the actual stepper motors used are identical. Canon STM lenses offer very quiet and smooth autofocus operation. For that reason, the STM autofocus system is considered a good choice for both photography and video shooting. The STM system has become widely used not only in Canon's EF and EF-S series of lenses but also in their latest RF and RF-S lenses. Here is a short list of lenses that use the STM autofocus system:</p>

        <div>
            
            <p>The type of stepper motor used in STM lenses is a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor with permanent magnet rotor. Unlike the AFD stepper motor, the STM version uses a rotationally symmetrical stator. First, the general principle of stepper motor operation is shown, and then the actual design of Canon's stepper motors is examined.</p>
                
            <h2>Stepper Motor in General</h2>
                        
            <p>The following illustration shows the general principle of a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor. The term 2-phase refers to the use of two separate coils. The description bipolar indicates that each of these coils can be energized with current flowing in two different directions, allowing each coil to generate two opposite magnetic field polarities. The ferromagnetic metal parts of the stator pointing towards the rotor are called field poles. The coil windings of both phases are split into two portions and are wound around opposite field poles to ensure simultaneous magnetization during operation. Each phase is labeled with two letters, one of them overlined to indicate the polarity in which the magnetic field is generated. Once phase A is energized, the magnetic polarity of field pole A and field pole Ā (Inverse-A) is always opposite from each other. The same applies for the second phase. In the illustration, the letters are also used to describe the polarities at which the voltage is applied to the coils.</p>
            
            <p>In this simplified example, the stator consists of four field poles, two per phase, which results in a rather large step angle of 90 degrees. During operation, the two phases are energized as shown in the timing diagram below. Note how due to inverted polarities, the two coils are capable of generating four different magnetic field orientations, and the stator strictly follows these orientations. This mode of operation is called full-step mode. Four full steps are required to complete one turn of the rotor. The stepper motor can also be driven in half-step mode where between full-steps both phases are turned on at the same time, turning the rotor by 45 degrees. Eight half-steps are required to complete one turn of the rotor. In the context of autofocus systems, however, speed is more important than increasing the step precision, and therefore the half-step mode is not discussed further.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Stepper Motor with Can-Stack Design</h2>
            <p>The type of stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses has 20 field poles, 10 per phase. This quantity of field poles makes it unpractical to apply coil windings directly at each field pole. For that reason, a very clever stator design is used:</p>
            
            <p>The two phase windings are stacked on top of each other as shown in the cutaway diagram. Each phase winding is surrounded by a steel shell, and triangular teeth (field poles) are brought to the center. These teeth are arranged in an alternating fashion, five coming from the bottom of each coil pointing upwards, and five coming from the top of each coil pointing downwards. Once a coil is energized, the steel shell carries the magnetic flux into the teeth, one polarity to the teeth pointing up and the opposite polarity to the teeth pointing down. As a result, the teeth form an alternating ring of north and south magnetic poles and will attract the permanent magnet rotor accordingly.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks to this design, one coil winding has a total of 10 field poles. Phase B is located below and has an equal number of 10 field poles. One key requirement of this design is that both rings of phase A and phase B stator teeth are offset by 18 degrees from each other. This is half the pitch between two teeth of one stator. This stepper motor construction is also referred to as can-stack design because it looks like a small stack of two steel cans. Another commonly used term is tin-can design.</p>
                

        </div>
        </div>
            
                
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Principle of Operation</h2>
            <p>Once all teeth of phases A and B are combined, the stator consists of 20 field poles. The rotor is a ferrite ceramic cylinder that is magnetized in the 10-pole pattern shown (five north and five south poles). The stepper motor is operated via four repetitive steps:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Phase B is de-energized. Phase A is energized so that field poles labeled A are magnetized as south poles (and Inverse-A as north poles). The rotor turns so that its five north poles align with the stator's A poles (and the rotor's five south poles align with the stator's Inverse-A poles).</li>
            <li>Step 2: Phase A is de-energized. Phase B is energized so that field poles labeled B are magnetized as south poles (and Inverse-B as north poles). The rotor turns so that its five north poles align with the stator's B poles (and the rotor's five south poles align with the stator's Inverse-B poles).</li>
            <li>Step 3: Phase B is de-energized. Phase A is energized in reverse so that field poles labeled A are magnetized as north poles (and Inverse-A as south poles). The rotor turns so that its five south poles align with the stator's A poles (and the rotor's five north poles align with the stator's Inverse-A poles).</li>
            <li>Step 4: Phase A is de-energized. Phase B is energized in reverse so that field poles labeled B are magnetized as north poles (and Inverse-B as south poles). The rotor turns so that its five south poles align with the stator's B poles (and the rotor's five north poles align with the stator's Inverse-B poles).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>After four steps, the rotor has completed a 72 degree turn, and thus it requires 20 steps to complete one full rotation. The direction of rotation can be reversed by performing the sequence of steps backwards. The rotor follows the magnetic fields so precisely that no separate feedback control system is required. The autofocus control system of the lens sends an instruction to the stepper motor driver to perform a certain number of steps. After the same number of electrical pulses to the phase coils, the rotor will have performed an equal number of steps into the desired direction.</p>

The illustration is an enlarged cutaway diagram of a stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses. This is an extremely small unit of just eight millimeters diameter (this is smaller than the DC micro motor). Due to this size, the STM drive is more suitable for smaller focusing lens elements. It is therefore unlikely to ever be used in heavy super-telephoto lenses.</p>

        <p>The Nano USM uses piezoceramic elements to generate vibrations that are translated into movement. The drive system does not generate rotational output, and therefore doesn't require a helical barrel or lead screw to translate rotation into linear movement. Instead, the Nano USM generates a linear movement that is directly forwarded to slide the focusing lens cell axially along guide rails. A position encoder with alternating dark and reflective stripes is attached to the focusing lens unit, allowing an infrared sensor to count the steps that the focusing mechanism has moved.</p>

The piezoceramic layer has three electrodes on the lower surface. Two small elevations on the top surface are in pressure contact with a stationary slide rail. The illustration summarizes this construction of the Nano USM actuator.</p>
            
            <p>Although being extremely small, the Nano USM actuator generates comparatively high levels of output torque. In addition, it offers very rapid start and stop characteristics and fast, well controllable output speed.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Two Vibration Modes</h2>
            <p>During operation of the Nano USM drive, the USM actuator goes into two flexural vibration modes. Mode&nbsp;1 is an out-of-plane bending mode that turns the actuator into a saddle-shape. Mode&nbsp;2 is another out-of-plane bending mode that shapes the actuator into a waveform.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
            
        <div>
        <div>
            <p>Both modes are excited with high-frequency voltages in the range of the natural resonance frequency of the elastic metal body. The result is that both vibrational modes combine and generate an elliptical motion of the contact points. Due to the pressure contact between the Nano USM actuator and the stationary slide rail, the elliptical motion exerts a frictional force on the surface. It is the counterforce on the actuator that ultimately generates the linear movement of the Nano USM frame.</p>
            
            <p>The amplitudes of both bending modes are greatly exaggerated in the illustrations. In reality, the amplitudes are so small that no deformation can be seen during operation. Similarly, the ultrasonic frequencies involved in the excitation of the actuator are inaudible to the human ear, and unlikely to be picked up by microphones. Due to its slightly lower output power, the Nano USM is preferred when smaller groups of lens elements need to be moved.</p>

            <h2>Full-Time Manual Focus Override</h2>
                
            <p>Canon's lenses with Nano USM autofocus drives allow full-time manual focus override via focus-by-wire. There is no mechanical connection between the manual focusing ring on the lens barrel and the focusing lens group inside a Nano USM lens. This is similar to lenses with <a href="#QJ_POS_05">STM</a> or <a href="#QJ_POS_07">VCM</a> autofocus drives.</p>

            <h2>Dual Nano USM</h2>
            <p>Released in 2019, the Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM was the first lens to feature Dual Nano USM technology. The innovation with Dual Nano USM is that two of these compact ultrasonic drive systems are installed in the lens barrel. Each AF drive moves one of two internal focusing groups – one focusing group and one floating group. The image shows the Dual Nano USM system that is integrated inside the Canon RF 100-300mm F2.8 L IS USM lens, a high-end telephoto zoom lens.</p>

        <h2>Voice Coil Motor (VCM)<br>2024 - Present</h2>
        <p>The voice coil technology has a long history that is tied to the history of telecommunication. The first voice coil was patented at the end of the 19th century, but it was in the 1920s when the first voice coils were actually installed in telephone speakers. A wire coil was attached to a paper diaphragm, and a magnet was placed inside the coil. The resulting device was a transducer that converted electronic signals into the voice of the caller. This type of use gave voice coils their names. Over the last decades, voice coils kept their name but got increasingly used for other applications including hard disc drives, robotics, precision instrumentation, as well as camera systems.</p>
            
        <p>Canon is already using voice coil motors for a long time to drive the <a href="https://exclusivearchitecture.com/03-technical-articles-CLT-18-image-stabilization.html">image stabilization unit</a>. Voice coil motors have also been used for decades as autofocus drives in cine lenses. This is ideal for video shootings because they are completely silent even in the ultrasonic range. Then, in 2024, Canon first used voice coil motors as the autofocus drives in their photographic lenses. The Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM was the first lens with a voice coil motor.</p>
        </div>

        
        <div>
        
            
        <div>
        <p>Voice coil motors combine a range of advantages:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Voice coil motors are very compact and lightweight in their design. This makes them suitable for applications where space is limited or weight constraints are critical.</li>
            <li>Fast response times: Unlike traditional motor technologies, such as DC or stepper motors, voice coil motors provide near-instantaneous response due to their direct electromagnetic actuation. In addition, their lightweight nature contributes to rapid acceleration and deceleration. This makes them an excellent choice for autofocus drives.</li>
            <li>Due to their high acceleration, the coil can reach a high speed very fast.</li>
            <li>High level of precision and accuracy: The design of voice coil motors allows for precise control and positioning, enabling the coil to be moved in sub-micrometer steps.</li>
            <li>Voice coils generate a high force output to move even very large focusing lens groups.</li>
            <li>Low power consumption: There are very low frictional losses due to the direct electromagnetic actuation. Therefore, voice coil motors have a very low power consumption which leads to extended battery life.</li>
            <li>Due to its linear design, no helical barrel or lead screw is required to translate rotation into linear movement. The voice coil is therefore directly connected to the focusing lens group.</li>
            <li>Voice coil motors are virtually silent even when recorded by sensitive microphones. This makes Canon's RF lenses with VCM autofocus drives perfect choices not only for photography but also for videography.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Principle of Operation</h2>
        <p>The image shows the VCM unit inside the Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM lens. There are two identical voice coil motors attached to the focusing lens cell. This symmetrical construction prevents one-sided stress on the mechanism and therefore ensures a smooth sliding operation. Each voice coil is supported by a sliding rail that passes through its center and which defines the range of axial movement. On either side there are two strong permanent magnets placed above and below the voice coils so that their magnetic field runs through the coil.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
                
        <div>
        <div>
            <p>The following illustration is a cross-sectional view of the VCM unit. The voice coil is exposed to the stationary magnetic field of the permanent magnets at any time. Once a current runs through the wire coil, a force (called Lorentz force) is exerted on the coil so that it moves axially along the sliding rail. The force generated is proportional to the flux density of the magnetic field and the intensity of the electric current. The direction in which the Lorentz force acts is depending on the direction of the current. By applying ultra-short voltage pulses to the voice coil, the unit can be driven into the desired direction with an extreme level of precision.</p>
            
            <p>A slight drawback of the technology is that even when the focusing lens is not moved, the position control must be active in order to retain the coil's position.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid AF Lenses</h2>
            <p>The use of voice coils in Canon's RF lenses made it possible to enter a new field. The smooth and silent operation of the VCM system not only convinces photographers but for the first time also satisfies the requirements of videographers. For that reason, Canon has introduced a new series of specially designed RF lenses, called hybrid lenses. These are L-lenses of the RF mount system that are specially designed to combine the benefits of photo and video technologies (such as a manual aperture ring normally found only on cine lenses). Some examples of these hybrid RF lenses include:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Canon RF 24mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)</li>
            <li>Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)</li>
            <li>Canon RF 50mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The illustration is a transparent view of the Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM hybrid RF lens. It can be seen that this lens is equipped with two autofocus drive systems. The pair of voice coil motors drives the main focusing lens group while a Nano USM unit drives the floating lens element.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
            
        <div>
        <p>The following illustration is a block diagram of the same lens. Note that the main focusing lens group consists of four lens elements, a considerable weight that requires a powerful autofocus system. The two symmetrically arranged coils of the voice coil motor actually generate a significant force to even allow rapid movements of these focusing lenses. The floating lens is a single element only, and therefore the smaller Nano USM is a sufficiently powerful drive system.</p>

Right now they seem centered on silencing both bad policies and the authoritarian turn in government.</p><p>Our government is simply less accountable when qualified and credible people are afraid to ask questions, or share information. It is also more poorly run. Many in DOGE don’t know the basics of government — how its systems work, and what laws mean — and they won’t know until they are made to hear about it. </p><p>Meanwhile Congress flatly refuses to provide any oversight of DOGE.

We are living through a moment where in some policy domains, </span><a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/musks-fraudulent-fraud-squad?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">right wing social media posters</a><span> exert more influence on decisions than people who actually know how those policies work. </span></p><p><span>It is hard to recall such conformity within a party. Republicans are canceling town hall meetings rather than criticize Musk publicly, after Musk has made clear he will not just attack them, but also fund opponents. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of Congress </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-democracy.html" rel="">said</a><span> of his Republican peers: </span></p><blockquote><p>I’m friends with a lot of these guys, and I had wrongly assumed that what was holding them back from speaking out against Trump was they were afraid of losing their jobs. But what they’re afraid of is their own personal security. They tell me that their wives tell them, ‘Don’t contribute to us getting harassed at church or at the grocery store or at the club.’</p></blockquote><p><span>For the past decade or so, you were told that America faced a crisis of free speech, characterized by wokeness.

Now, as we move into a period where the government is crushing the speech of those it disagrees with, or purging ideas (or the people who represent those ideas) it dislikes, those claims look not just naive, but reckless, since they were used to justify the real chilling effects exist.

They have redefined free speech to be the speech they support, and other speech to be subject to government control. </p><p><span>For example, Niall Ferguson was recently featured on </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uatx-launches-touting-ideological-openness-debate-60-minutes-transcript/" rel="">60 Minutes</a><span> touting the need for his private  university, University of Austin, to serve as a counterpart to cancel culture. Ferguson, a former critic of Trump, is now supporter. He has visited him at Mar-A-Lago. He sees little risk that Trump will undermine our freedoms: “I’m convinced that whatever impulses he has or has had in the past, the system can contain them as it was designed to.”</span></p><p>Chris Rufo is no longer pretending that concern about cancel culture needs to be even-handed. He says the rules of cancel culture simply need to be rewritten: </p><blockquote><p>to determine how the Right can protect its own members from unjust cancellation attempts and how it can enforce just consequences on political opponents who violate the new terms.</p></blockquote><p><span>Others still cling to the idea that it was wokeness that is causing the current censorship, since it fueled </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanbchait.bsky.social/post/3licuj52cms2t" rel="">the reactionary forces</a><span> of Trumpism. Or relabel the right to be “</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/woke-right/681716/" rel="">the woke right</a><span>” to try to maintain the relevance of the trope. If you spent the last decade being fundamentally wrong about the gravest threats to speech in America, these are  clever ways to rewrite history to give the impression that you were right all along.  </span></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/real-chilling-effects?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Can We Still Govern?

People who had happily talked with us at the start were now afraid to return our calls. “Now I have this fear all the time,” one told us at the time. There is a similar chill now in Washington. Every day someone who used to feel free to speak publicly against Mr. Trump says they will no longer let journalists quote them by name for fear of repercussions, both Democrats and Republicans…in decades of reporting in Washington, under Republicans and Democrats, it has never felt quite like this </p></blockquote><p>This is a grim comparison, but one that forces us to acknowledge the scale of the change. It is all the more astonishing since Baker is known for being famously (and even infuriatingly) non-partisan. </p><p>There is reason for hope. America has a more independent judiciary, media and civil society than Russia. But all of those institutions are themselves under attack. Their willingness to act, not their mere existence, is what gives them power. The norms do not defend themselves. As more institutions go quiet, or offer their co-operation with the new regime, the erosion of norms still occurs, even if it it occurs more slowly than it did in Russia. </p><p>Defending democracy against a coercive government poses a collective action problem: we are all better off when people are willing to publicly defend basic freedoms, but few want to be the guy standing alone in front of the tank. </p><p>So many institutions and individuals see what is going on and don’t want to say anything. To do so would threaten their livelihood or organization, or employees, or the personal safety of themselves or their families. It is understandable at an individual level, but collectively disastrous. </p><p><span>Courage is contagious. As people offer examples of a willingness to publicly push back, more will stand up. For example, climate scientists and misinformation researchers have fought for years against efforts to silence them. CBS apparently changed its mind about settling a frivolous lawsuit with Trump, and now </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/cbs-files-to-dismiss-trump-lawsuit" rel="">promises to fight back</a><span>. Some politicians are courageous despite the vitriol they have always faced. For example, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:p7gxyfr5vii5ntpwo7f6dhe2/post/3li42lco6b22h?ref_src=embed" rel="">AOC mocked</a><span> threats by homeland security czar Tom Holman to investigate her. </span></p><p>Individual actions and collective organizing help to remind others that the actions of the Trump administration do not have broad support. It can’t all be on individuals, however. Universities, philanthropies, corporations, nonprofits, and professional organizations need to remind each other of the power they have, and the principles they stand for. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Artificial intelligence commonly refers to the science and engineering of artificial systems that can carry out tasks generally associated with requiring aspects of human intelligence, such as playing games, translating languages, and driving cars. In recent years, there have been exciting advances in learning-based, data-driven approaches towards AI, and machine learning and deep learning have enabled computer systems to perceive the world in unprecedented ways. Reinforcement learning has enabled breakthroughs in complex games such as Go and challenging robotics tasks such as quadrupedal locomotion.
<br>A key aspect of intelligence is to not only make predictions, but reason about the uncertainty in these predictions, and to consider this uncertainty when making decisions. This is what this manuscript on "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence" is about. The first part covers probabilistic approaches to machine learning. We discuss the differentiation between "epistemic" uncertainty due to lack of data and "aleatoric" uncertainty, which is irreducible and stems, e.g., from noisy observations and outcomes. We discuss concrete approaches towards probabilistic inference and modern approaches to efficient approximate inference.
<br>The second part of the manuscript is about taking uncertainty into account in sequential decision tasks. We consider active learning and Bayesian optimization -- approaches that collect data by proposing experiments that are informative for reducing the epistemic uncertainty. We then consider reinforcement learning and modern deep RL approaches that use neural network function approximation. We close by discussing modern approaches in model-based RL, which harness epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide exploration, while also reasoning about safety.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When I founded Ecosia a few years ago, I made <strong>two promises</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1iwillneversellecosia">1. I will never sell Ecosia.</h3>
<h3 id="2iwillnevertakeprofitsoutofthecompany">2. I will never take profits out of the company.</h3>
<p>I made these promises because my goal for Ecosia has always been to make the world a greener, better place – not to get rich. I also wanted to prove that there is a more ethical way of doing business.</p>
<p>Since then, Ecosia has grown into something way bigger than myself: we’re not just planting millions of trees every month, we’re also becoming one of the largest environmental movements in the world.</p>
<p>And so I find it important to renew my commitment to my two promises by turning Ecosia into a so-called “steward-owned company”. This model imposes two <em>legally binding and irreversible</em> restrictions on us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shares can’t be sold at a profit or owned by people outside of the company.</li>
<li>No profits can be taken out of the company.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two restrictions sound like a <em>terrible</em> idea to most traditional entrepreneurs. But Ecosia isn’t traditional. We’re not interested in maximizing profits, we’re interested in maximizing the amount of trees we plant.</p>
<p>I hope that many other businesses will follow suit. I truly believe that the world would be a better place if more businesses were driven by a meaningful cause instead of shareholder value maximization.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Christian Kroll</p>
<p>P.S.: Being a “steward-owned company” means that it will be impossible for me – or anyone else – to sell Ecosia at a profit or take money out of the company. This obviously also applies to the former co-owner of Ecosia, <a href="https://www.schumacher.me/">Tim</a>, an experienced entrepreneur I met a few years ago. He invested in Ecosia at a time when no one knew if this crazy project would ever work out. Tim, I cannot overstate how grateful I am that you agree to turn Ecosia into a non-profit company, effectively waiving your right to get any of your investment back.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/">https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43317592">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>About a month ago, the CPython project merged <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call">a new implementation strategy</a> for their bytecode interpreter. The initial headline results <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/128718">were very impressive</a>, showing a 10-15% performance improvement <strong>on average</strong> across <a href="https://pyperformance.readthedocs.io/">a wide range of benchmarks</a> across a variety of platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I will document in this post, these impressive performance gains turned out to be <strong>primarily due to inadvertently working around a regression in LLVM 19.</strong> When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.</p>
<p>When the tail-call interpreter was announced, I was surprised and impressed by the performance improvements, but also confused: I’m not an expert, but I’m passingly-familiar with modern CPU hardware, compilers, and interpreter design, and I couldn’t explain why this change would be so effective. I became curious – and perhaps slightly obsessed – and the reports in this post are the result of a few weeks of off-and-on compiling and benchmarking and disassembly of dozens of different Python binaries, in an attempt to understand what I was seeing.</p>
<p>At the end, I <a href="#reflections">will reflect</a> on this situation as a case study in some of the challenges of benchmarking, performance engineering, and software engineering in general.</p>
<p>I also want to be clear that I still think the tail-calling interpreter is a great piece of work, as well as a genuine speedup (albeit more modest than initially hoped). I am also optimistic it’s a more robust approach than the older interpreter, in ways I’ll explain in this post. I also really don’t want to blame anyone on the Python team for this error. This sort of confusion turns out to be very common – I’ve certainly misunderstood many a benchmark myself – and I’ll have some reflections on that topic at the end.</p>
<p>In addition, the impact of the LLVM regression doesn’t seem to have been known prior to this work (and the bug still isn’t fixed, as of this writing); thus, in that sense, the alternative (without this work) probably really was 10-15% slower, for builds using clang-19 or newer. For instance, Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/python-3140a5/">reproduced the 10% speedup</a> “in the wild,” as compared to Python 3.13, using builds from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone"><code>python-build-standalone</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="performance-results">Performance results&nbsp;<a href="#performance-results"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>Here are my headline results. I benchmarked several builds of the CPython interpreter, using multiple different compilers and different configuration options, on two machines: an Intel server (a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230580/intel-core-i513500-processor-24m-cache-up-to-4-80-ghz/specifications.html">Raptor Lake i5-13500</a> I maintain in Hetzner), and my Apple M1 Macbook Air. You can reproduce these builds <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/">using my <code>nix</code> configuration</a>, which I found essential for managing so many different moving pieces at once.</p>
<p>All builds use LTO and PGO. These configurations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>clang18</code>: Built using Clang 18.1.8, using computed gotos.</li>
<li><code>gcc</code> (Intel only): Built with GCC 14.2.1, using computed gotos.</li>
<li><code>clang19</code>: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using compute gotos.</li>
<li><code>clang19.tc</code>: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using the new tail-call interpreter.</li>
<li><code>clang19.taildup</code>: Built using Clang 19.1.7, computed gotos and some <code>-mllvm</code> tuning flags which work around the regression.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve used <code>clang18</code> as the baseline, and reported the bottom-line “average” reported by <code>pypeformance</code>/<code>pyperf compare_to</code>. You can find the complete output files and reports <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/tree/data/">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Observe that the tail-call interpreter still exhibits a speedup as compared to clang-18, but that it’s far less dramatic than the slowdown from moving to clang-19. The Python team has also observed larger speedups than I have (after accounting for the bug) on some other platforms.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-background">A brief background&nbsp;<a href="#a-brief-background"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>A classic bytecode interpreter consists of a <code>switch</code> statement inside of a <code>while</code> loop, looking something like so:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span><span>while</span> (true) {
</span></span><span><span>  opcode_t this_op <span>=</span> bytecode[pc<span>++</span>];
</span></span><span><span>  <span>switch</span> (this_op) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> OP_IMM: {
</span></span><span><span>      <span>// push an immediate onto the stack
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>      <span>break</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> OP_ADD: {
</span></span><span><span>      <span>// handle the add
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>      <span>break</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// etc
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Most compilers will compile the <code>switch</code> into a jump table – they will emit a table containing the address of each <code>case OP_xxx</code> block, index into it with the opcode, and perform an indirect jump.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44681-8_59.pdf">long been known</a> that you can speed up a bytecode interpreter of this style by replicating the jump table dispatch into the body of each opcode. That is, instead of ending each opcode with a <code>jmp loop_top</code>, each opcode contains a separate instance of the “decode next instruction and index through the jump table” logic.</p>
<p>Modern C compilers support <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html#Labels-as-Values">taking the address of labels</a>, and then using those labels in a “computed goto,” in order to implement this pattern. Thus, many modern bytecode interpreters, including CPython (before the tail-call work), employ an interpreter loop that looks something like:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span>opcode_table[<span>256</span>] <span>=</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    [OP_IMM] <span>=</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>TARGET_IMM,
</span></span><span><span>    [OP_ADD] <span>=</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>TARGET_ADD,
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// etc
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#define DISPATCH() goto *opcode_table[bytecode[pc++]]
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span>DISPATCH();
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>TARGET_IMM: {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// push an immediate onto the stack
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    DISPATCH();
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>TARGET_ADD: {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// handle the add
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    DISPATCH();
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="computed-goto-in-llvm">Computed goto in LLVM&nbsp;<a href="#computed-goto-in-llvm"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>For performance reasons (performance of the compiler, not the generated code), it turns out that Clang and LLVM, internally, actually merges all of the <code>goto</code>s in the latter code into a <strong>single</strong> <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#indirectbr-instruction"><code>indirectbr</code> LLVM instruction</a>, which each opcode will jump to. That is, the compiler takes our hard work, and deliberately rewrites into a control-flow-graph that looks essentially the same as the <code>switch</code>-based interpreter!</p>
<p>Then, during code generation, LLVM performs “tail duplication,” and copies the branch <strong>back</strong> into each location, restoring the original intent. This dance is documented, at a high level, <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/2010/01/address-of-label-and-indirect-branches.html">in an old LLVM blog post</a> introducing the new implementation.</p>
<h2 id="the-llvm-19-regression">The LLVM 19 regression&nbsp;<a href="#the-llvm-19-regression"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>The whole reason for the deduplicate-then-copy dance is that, for technical reasons, creating and manipulating the control-flow-graph containing many <code>indirectbr</code> instructions can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>In order to avoid catastrophic slowdowns (or memory usage) in certain cases, LLVM 19 implemented <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/78582">some limits on tail-duplication pass</a>, causing it to bail out if duplication would blow up the size of the IR past certain limits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on CPython those limits resulted in Clang <strong>leaving all of the dispatch jumps merged</strong>, and entirely undoing the whole purpose of the computed <code>goto</code>-based implementation! This bug was <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/106846">first identified</a> by another language implementation with a similar interpreter loop, but had not been known (as far as I can find) to affect CPython.</p>
<p>In addition to the performance impact, we can observe the bug directly by disassembling the resulting object code and counting the number of distinct indirect jumps:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ objdump -S --disassemble<span>=</span>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault <span>${</span>clang18<span>}</span>/bin/python3.14 | <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  egrep -c <span>'jmp\s+\*'</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>332</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>$ objdump -S --disassemble<span>=</span>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault <span>${</span>clang19<span>}</span>/bin/python3.14 | <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  egrep -c <span>'jmp\s+\*'</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="further-weirdness">Further weirdness&nbsp;<a href="#further-weirdness"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>I am confident that the change to the tail-call duplication logic caused the regression: if <a href="#the-fix">you fix it</a>, performance matches clang-18. However, I can’t fully explain the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the regression.</p>
<p>Historically, the optimization of replicating the bytecode dispatch into each opcode has been cited to speed up interpreters anywhere from <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c718c6be0f82af5eb0e57615ce323242155ff014/Misc/HISTORY#L15252-L15255">20%</a> to <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44681-8_59.pdf">100%</a>. However, on modern processors with improved branch predictors, <a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-01100647/document">more recent work</a> finds a much smaller speedup, on the order of 2-4%.</p>
<p>We can verify this 2-4% number in practice, because Python still supports the “old-style” interpreter, which uses a single <code>switch</code> statement, via a configuration option. Here’s what we see if we benchmark that interpreter (".nocg" for “no computed gotos” in the following table):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Benchmark</th>
<th>clang18</th>
<th>clang18.nocg</th>
<th>clang19.nocg</th>
<th>clang19</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Performance change</td>
<td>(ref)</td>
<td>1.01x faster</td>
<td>1.02x slower</td>
<td>1.09x slower</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that <code>clang19.nocg</code>" is only 2% slower than <code>clang18</code>, even though the base <code>clang19</code> build is 9% slower! I interpret that “2%” as a fairer estimate for the cost/benefit of duplicating opcode dispatch, alone, and I don’t fully understand the other one.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-need-computed-gotos">Do we need computed gotos?&nbsp;<a href="#do-we-need-computed-gotos"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>I haven’t mentioned the <code>clang19.nocg</code> benchmark, which you may notice claims to be <strong>faster</strong> than <code>clang19</code>" It was at this point that I discovered an additional, and very funny, twist to the story.</p>
<p>I explained earlier that Clang and LLVM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compiles the <code>switch</code> into a jump table and an indirect jump, very similar to the one we create by hand using computed gotos</li>
<li>Compiles computed gotos into a control-flow graph that closely resembles the classic <code>switch</code> graph, which a single instance of the opcode dispatch, and</li>
<li>Is able to reverse the transformation during codegen in order to duplicate the dispatch</li>
</ol>
<p>Those facts taken together, might lead you to ask, “Couldn’t we just start with the <code>switch</code>-based interpreter, and have the <strong>compiler</strong> do tail-duplication, and get the same benefits?”</p>
<p>And it turns out: Yes.</p>
<p>clang-18 (or clang-19 with appropriate flags), when presented with the “classic” <code>switch</code>-based interpreter, <strong>goes ahead and that replicates the dispatch logic into each the body of each opcode anyways</strong>. Here’s another table, showing the same builds with the number of indirect jumps, using the <code>objdump | grep</code> test from earlier:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Benchmark</th>
<th>clang18</th>
<th>clang18.nocg</th>
<th>clang19.nocg</th>
<th>clang19</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td># of indirect jumps</td>
<td>332</td>
<td>306</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thus, there’s a case to be made that the entire “computed goto” interpreter turns out to be entirely unnecessary complexity (at least for modern Clang). The compiler is perfectly capable of performing the same transformation itself, and (apparently) the computed gotos don’t even suffice to guarantee it!</p>
<p>That said, I did also test GCC, and GCC (at least as of 14.2.1) does not replicate the <code>switch</code>, but does implement the desired behavior for when using computed goto. So at least in that case we see the expected behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix">The fix&nbsp;<a href="#the-fix"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/114990">LLVM pull request 114990</a> is open and should fix this regression. It has not yet merged as of this writing, but hopefully will soon. I have also benchmarked it and confirmed it restores the expected performance.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/78582">PR that caused the regression</a> added a tunable option to choose the threshold at which tail-duplication will abort. We can restore similar behavior on clang-19 by simply setting that limit to a very large number<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections&nbsp;<a href="#reflections"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>I will freely admit that I got nerdsniped quite effectively by this topic, and have gone far deeper than was really necessary. That said, having done so, I think there are a number of interesting lessons and reflections to be taken away, which generalize to software engineering and performance engineering, and I will attempt to extract and meditate upon some of them.</p>
<h2 id="on-benchmarking">On benchmarking&nbsp;<a href="#on-benchmarking"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>When optimizing a system, we generally construct some set of benchmarks and benchmarking methodology, and then evaluate proposed changes using those benchmarks.</p>
<p>Any set of benchmarks or benchmark procedures embeds (often implicitly) what I like to call a “theory of performance.” Your theory of performance is a set of beliefs and assumptions that answer questions like “which variables (may) effect performance, in what ways?” and “what is the relationship between results on benchmarks and the “true” performance in “production”?”</p>
<p>The benchmarks ran on the tail-call interpreter showed a 10-15% speedup when compared with the old computed-goto interpreter. Those benchmarks were accurate, in that they were accurately measuring (as far as I know) the performance difference between those builds. However, in order to generalize those specific data points into the statement “The tail-call interpreter is 10-15% faster than the computed-goto interpreter, more generally,” or even “The tail-call interpreter will speed up Python by 10-15% for our users,” we need to bring in more assumptions and beliefs about the world. In this case, it turns out the story was more complex, and those broader claims were not true in full generality.</p>
<p>(Once again, I really don’t want to blame the Python developers! This stuff is <strong>hard</strong> and there are a million ways to get confused or to reach somewhat-incorrect conclusions. I had to do ~three weeks of intense benchmarking and experimenting to reach a better understanding. My point is that this is a very general challenge!)</p>
<h3 id="baselines">Baselines&nbsp;<a href="#baselines"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>This example highlights another recurring challenge, not only in software performance, but in many other domains: “What baseline do you compare against?”</p>
<p>Any time you propose a new solution or method for some problem, you typically have a way of running your new method, and producing some relevant performance metrics.</p>
<p>Once you have metrics for <strong>your</strong> system, however, you need to know what to compare them against, in order to decide if they’re any good! Even if you score well on some absolute scale (assuming there <strong>is</strong> a sensible absolute scale to evaluate), if your method is worse than an existing solution, it’s probably not that interesting.</p>
<p>Typically, you want to compare against “the current best-known approach.” But sometimes that can be hard to do! Even if you understand the current approach in theory, you may or may not be an expert in applying it in practice. In the case of software this may mean something like, tuning your operating system or compiler options or other flags. The current-best approach may have published benchmarks, but they’re not always relevant to you; for instance, maybe it was published years ago on older hardware, and so you can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with the public numbers. Or maybe their tests were run at a scale you can’t afford to replicate.</p>
<p>I work in machine learning at Anthropic these days, and we see this all the time in ML papers. When a paper comes out claiming some algorithmic improvement or other advance, I’ve noticed that the first detail our researchers ask is often not “What did they do?” but “What baseline did they compare against?” It’s easy to get impressive-looking results if you’re comparing against a poorly-tuned baseline, and that observation turns out to explain a surprising fraction of supposed improvements.</p>
<h2 id="on-software-engineering">On software engineering&nbsp;<a href="#on-software-engineering"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>One other highlight, for me, is just how complex and interconnected our software systems are, and how rapidly-moving, and how hard it is to keep track of all the pieces.</p>
<p>If you’d asked me, a month ago, to estimate the likelihood that an LLVM release caused a 10% performance regression in CPython and that no one noticed for five months, I’d have thought that a pretty unlikely state of affairs! Those are both widely-used projects, both of which care a fair bit about performance, and “surely” someone would have tested and noticed.</p>
<p>And probably that <strong>particular</strong> situation was quite unlikely! However, with so many different software projects out there, each moving so rapidly and depending on and being used by so many other projects, it becomes practically-inevitable that <strong>some</strong> regressions “like that one” happen, almost constantly.</p>

<p>The saga of the computed-goto interpreter illustrates recurring tensions and unresolved questions around optimizers and optimizing compilers, to which we don’t yet have agreed-upon answers as a field.</p>
<p>We generally expect our compilers to respect the programmer’s intent, and to compile the code that was written in a way that preserves the programmer’s intent.</p>
<p>We also, however, expect our compilers to optimize our code, and to transform it in potentially-complex-and-unintuitive ways in order to make it run faster.</p>
<p>These expectations are in tension, and we have a dearth of patterns and idioms to explain to the compiler “why” we wrote code in various ways, and whether we were <strong>deliberately</strong> trying to trigger a certain output, or make a certain performance-related decision, or not.</p>
<p>Our compilers typically only <strong>promise</strong> to emit code with “the same behavior” as the code we write; performance is something of a best-effort feature on top of that guarantee.</p>
<p>Thus, we end up in this odd world where clang-19 compiles the computed-goto interpreter “correctly” – in the sense that the resulting binary produces all the same value we expect – but at the same time it produces an output completely at odds with the intention of the optimization. Moreover, we also see other versions of the compiler applying optimizations to the “naive” <code>switch()</code>-based interpreter, which implement the exact same optimization we “intended” to perform by rewriting the source code.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it appears that the “computed goto” interpreter, at a source code level, and “replicating the dispatch at a machine-code level” end up being almost-orthogonal notions! We’ve seen examples of every instance of the resulting 2x2 matrix! Because all of those <code>python</code> binaries compute the same values when run, our current tools are essentially unable to talk about the distinctions between them in a coherent way.</p>
<p>This confusion is one way in which I think the tail-calling interpreter (and the compiler features behind it) represent a genuine, and useful, advance in the state of the art. The tail-call interpreter is built on <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#musttail">the <code>musttail</code> attribute</a>, which represents a relatively new kind of compiler feature. <code>musttail</code> does not affect the “observable program behavior,” in the classic sense that compilers think, but is rather a conversation with the <strong>optimizer</strong>; it requires that the compiler be able to make certain optimizations, and requires that compilation fail if those optimizations don’t happen.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful this framework will turn out to be a much more robust style for writing performance-sensitive code, especially over time and as compilers evolve. I look forward to continued experiments with features in that category.</p>
<p>Concretely, I find myself wondering if it would be viable to replace the computed-goto interpreter with something like a (hypothetical) <code>[[clang::musttailduplicate]]</code> attribute on the interpreter <code>while</code> loop. I’m not expert enough in all the relevant IRs and passes to have confidence in this proposal, but perhaps someone with more familiarity can weigh in on the feasibility.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-note-on-nix">One more note: on <code>nix</code>&nbsp;<a href="#one-more-note-on-nix"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>I want to close with a call-out of how helpful <code>nix</code> was for this project. I have been experimenting with nix and NixOS for my personal infrastructure over the last year or so, but they turned out to be a total lifesaver for this investigation.</p>
<p>In the course of these experiments, I have built and benchmarked <strong>dozens</strong> of different Python interpreters, across four different compilers (<code>gcc</code>, <code>clang-18</code>, <code>clang-19</code>, and <code>clang-20</code>) and using numerous combinations of compiler flags. Managing all of that by hand would have strained my sanity, and I’m <strong>certain</strong> I would have made numerous mistakes during which I mixed up which compiler and which flags went into which build, and so on.</p>
<p>Using <code>nix</code>, I was able to keep all of these parallel versions straight, and build them in a reproducible, hermetic style. I was able to write some short abstractions which made them very easy to define, and then know with absolute confidence <strong>where</strong> any given build in my <code>nix</code> store came from, with which compilers and which flags. After a small amount of work to build some helper functions, the core definitions of my build matrix is <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/blob/afd2123bef6ec3fd872d628f2bb519b20684e161/python.nix#L105-L143">shockingly concise</a>; here’s a taste:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="nixos"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    base <span>=</span> callPackage buildPython { python3 <span>=</span> python313; };
</span></span><span><span>    optimized <span>=</span> withOptimizations base;

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    clang19taildup <span>=</span> withTailDup clang19;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I was even able to build a custom version of LLVM (with the bugfix patch), and do Python builds using that compiler. Doing so required <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/blob/afd2123bef6ec3fd872d628f2bb519b20684e161/llvm.nix#L14-L25">all of about 10 lines of code</a>.</p>
<p>That said, not everything was rosy. For one, <code>nix</code> is, by necessity, “weird” in various ways compared to the ways “normal people” use software, and I worry that some of that weirdness may have affected some of my benchmarks or conclusions in ways I didn’t notice. For instance, early on I discovered that nix (by default) builds projects using certain hardening flags that <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130961">disproportionately impact the tail-call interpreter</a>. I’ve handled that one, but are there more?</p>
<p>In addition, Nix is incredibly extensible and customizable, but figuring out how to make a specific customization can be a real uphill battle, and involve a lot of trial and error and source-diving. My patched LLVM build ended up being pretty short and clean, but getting there required me to read a lot of <code>nixpkgs</code> source code, mixing and matching two under-documented extensibility mechanisms (<code>extend</code> and <code>overrideAttrs</code> – not to be confused with <code>override</code>, used elsewhere), and one failed attempt which successfully patched <code>libllvm</code>, but then silently built a new <code>clang</code> against the unpatched version.</p>
<p>Still, <code>nix</code> was clearly enormously helpful here, and on net it definitely made this kind of multi-version exploration and debugging <strong>much</strong> saner than any other approach I can imagine.</p>

<p>In beginning the NVIDIA Blackwell Linux testing with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx5090-linux">the GeForce RTX 5090 compute performance</a>, besides all the CUDA/OpenCL/OptiX benchmarks delivered last week a number of readers asked about AI performance and in particular the Llama.cpp performance with the RTX 5090 flagship graphics card. Here are some initial benchmarks looking at the GeForce RTX 5090 performance in Llama.cpp compared to prior RTX 40 and RTX 30 graphics cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=nvidia-rtx5090-llama-cpp&amp;image=nvidia_rtx5090_llamacpp_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=nvidia-rtx5090-llama-cpp&amp;image=nvidia_rtx5090_llamacpp_med" alt="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090"></a></p>
<p>Over the weekend I carried out some initial tests of Llama.cpp as well as re-testing the higher-end GeForce RTX 30 and RTX 40 graphics cards. All tests were carried out using the NVIDIA 570.86.10 Linux driver on Ubuntu 24.10 with the Linux 6.11 kernel. The graphics cards tested included:</p>
<p>- GeForce RTX 3090<br>
- GeForce RTX 4070<br>
- GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER<br>
- GeForce RTX 4080<br>
- GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER<br>
- GeForce RTX 4090<br>
- GeForce RTX 5090</p>

<p>Llama.cpp with Llama 3.1 and Mistral 7B were used for the initial runs with text generation and prompt processing . More Llama.cpp benchmarks against the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards to come with enough reader interest. For now let's continue on with this initial look.</p>
