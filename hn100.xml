<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study published in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icaf127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrative and Comparative Biology</a></em> suggests that scientists are leaving X (formerly known as Twitter) in significant numbers due to its declining professional value. The survey of over 800 researchers and science communicators indicates that many now find Bluesky to be a more effective platform for networking, outreach, and staying updated on research. The findings suggest a significant shift in how scientists interact online, with Bluesky emerging as a preferred space for professional engagement.</p><p>Twitter, once considered the central gathering place for scientists on social media, has changed dramatically in recent years. The platform, now officially called “X,” was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022. Since then, changes to how the platform is moderated and how content appears in users’ feeds have raised concerns among many users, especially academics.</p><p>Reports have pointed to a rise in misinformation, conspiracy theories, and harassment, particularly directed at minority groups. These shifts appear to have made the platform less welcoming and less useful for professional tasks. As Twitter’s character evolved, so too did the willingness of researchers to remain active on the platform.</p><p>In its place, Bluesky has gained attention as a new space for academic interaction. Although other platforms like Threads and Mastodon have also positioned themselves as alternatives, Bluesky appears to be the primary destination for scientists migrating from X. Against this backdrop, researchers set out to document whether scientists were truly abandoning X and whether Bluesky was filling the gap.</p><p>“I am a scholar of public understanding (and misunderstanding) of science and the environment, and have long been fascinated by where people learn things about nature. Social media has become one of the leading sources of information about the world, but the social media landscape is changing, and I wanted to see how my professional colleagues were adapting,” said study author David Shiffman, a marine biologist and public science engagement specialist based in Washington, D.C, and author of <em><a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12267/why-sharks-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Sharks Matter</a></em>.</p><p>To investigate these questions, researchers distributed a survey to professional scientists, science communicators, and educators who had used both X and Bluesky for work-related purposes. In total, 813 individuals participated. The survey asked when participants joined each platform, how they used them, and how their experiences had changed over time.</p><p>The responses showed that X had once served a wide range of professional purposes. Nearly all respondents had used it to learn about developments in their fields, and most had relied on it for networking and public outreach. Many also used it for job postings, research promotion, and casual professional conversation.</p><p>However, those same users reported a sharp decline in the usefulness of X. Roughly three-quarters said the platform was now “much less useful” for networking and science communication. Two-thirds said it was less helpful for keeping up with developments in their field.</p><p>The vast majority described their experience on Twitter as increasingly unpleasant, citing irrelevant content, ads, spam, extremist posts, and a loss of meaningful engagement. Some described ethical discomfort with continuing to use a platform that appeared to tolerate, or even amplify, harassment and misinformation.</p><p>In terms of actual usage patterns, only 11 percent of respondents said they still actively use X. Nearly 40 percent had deleted their accounts entirely. Almost half said they still had accounts but rarely used them.</p><p>In contrast, users reported that Bluesky was meeting many of their professional needs. Like Twitter in its earlier days, Bluesky offered a space for learning, networking, and public engagement. Over 94 percent said they used Bluesky to stay informed about research in their field, and nearly 88 percent used it for professional networking. A majority said the new platform was more useful than X for these purposes.</p><p>The researchers also explored why people chose to try Bluesky. Nearly half said they were invited by a colleague or saw others in the science community making the shift. Many viewed Bluesky’s features — such as stronger moderation tools, less algorithmic interference, and more control over what appears in their feed — as more aligned with their professional goals.</p><p>Others said they were simply trying to avoid X’s drawbacks. More than a quarter said they moved to Bluesky because of what they perceived as a rise in extremism on X, and many explicitly named Elon Musk as a reason for their departure.</p><p>“The degree to which the scientific community’s experiences mirrored my own was surprising,” Shiffman told PsyPost. “I knew that for me, Twitter had become unusable, but the extent to which hundreds of surveyed experts strongly agreed with me on almost every point was surprising. You rarely see that kind of strong agreement in surveys.”</p><p>These results provide new evidence to support what other studies and media reports have been suggesting for some time: that X’s role as a hub for academic communication is fading. A previous study <a href="https://www.psypost.org/elon-musks-twitter-takeover-triggered-academic-exodus-study-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented a noticeable drop in academic activity on X</a> after Musk’s acquisition. That research tracked over 15,000 academic accounts and found a significant reduction in tweets, especially original posts and quote tweets, starting in November 2022. Verified users — typically more established academics — were especially likely to reduce their engagement.</p><p>Both studies indicate that changes to how X is managed and moderated have had measurable effects on academic use of the platform. The new survey adds further weight to this idea by showing that scientists are not just using X less — they are actively replacing it with another platform.</p><p>What makes the current study distinctive is its focus on Bluesky as the replacement. While earlier data showed general declines in X use, this survey points to a specific alternative that scientists are embracing. And unlike the earlier study, which focused on activity levels, the new survey captures users’ motivations and perceptions, offering a more detailed view of what is driving this migration.</p><p>“For many years, Twitter was the leading platform used by academics for a wide variety of purposes, including public education about science,” Shiffman explained. “I was a Twitter power-user and evangelist for a decade, and I trained thousands of scientists how to use the platform. Changes to the platform made by Elon Musk, including changing the algorithm to promote extremist views and changes to harassment policy, have made Twitter almost unusable for professional purposes, and academics are abandoning Twitter in droves. Fortunately, alternatives exist, and I, along with many other academics, prefer Bluesky of the available alternatives.”</p><p>The authors note that the survey was limited to users who had already made the switch from X to Bluesky, or were using both platforms. This means it does not account for those who may have stopped using social media altogether or migrated to other platforms. Because the survey was shared primarily through one author’s network, it may reflect the perspectives of those within particular academic communities more than others.</p><p>Another open question concerns whether Bluesky can support the same level of diversity that once defined the science community on X. Movements like Black Birders Week and Queer in STEM gained traction through Twitter’s large, visible networks. It remains unclear whether Bluesky can foster similar grassroots engagement. The authors suggest this should be the focus of future research, particularly if scientists want to ensure that new digital spaces remain inclusive.</p><p>There is also the issue of platform longevity. Whether Bluesky can maintain momentum over time — or whether users will need to shift again — is uncertain. But for now, it appears to offer what many researchers were missing from X: a sense of community, professional utility, and control over their online interactions.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icaf127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientists no Longer Find Twitter Professionally Useful, and have Switched to Bluesky</a>,” was authored by David S. Shiffman and Julia Wester.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
<a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> is a program for document
typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material
incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating
figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard,
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, with a simpler markup
system and easier customization, all while compiling documents
more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.
</p>

<h4 id="the-desire-for-a-latex-replacement">Desire for a LaTeX replacement</h4>

<p>
LaTeX is a document typesetting system built on the foundation of Donald
Knuth's <a href="https://tug.org/whatis.html">TeX</a>. LaTeX has become the
standard tool for the preparation of scholarly papers and books in several
fields, such as mathematics and computer science, and widely adopted in
others, such as physics. TeX and LaTeX, which <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2001-CAR-LaTeX-legacy.pdf">predate
Linux</a>, are early free software <a href="https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb24-1/gaudeul.pdf">success
stories</a>. The quality of TeX's (and therefore LaTeX's) output rivals the
work of skilled hand typesetters for both text and mathematics.

</p></blockquote>


<p>
Despite the acclaim earned by LaTeX, its community of users has been
griping about it for years, and wondering aloud whether one day a
replacement might arrive. There are several reasons for this
dissatisfaction: the LaTeX installation is huge, compilation of large
documents is not fast, and its error messages are riddles delivered by an
infuriating oracle. In addition, any nontrivial customization or alteration to the
program's behavior requires expertise in an arcane macro-expansion
language.
</p>

<p>
Along with the griping came resignation: after decades of talk about a
LaTeX replacement with nothing plausible on the horizon, and with the
recognition that LaTeX's collection of specialized packages would take
years to replace, it seemed impossible to dislodge the behemoth from its
exalted position.
</p>

<h4 id="introducing-typst">Introducing Typst</h4>

<p>
In 2019 two German developers, Laurenz
Mädje and Martin Haug, decided to try to write a LaTeX replacement "<a href="https://archive.li/LN3xb">just for fun</a>". In 2022, Mädje wrote his 
computer science <a href="https://laurmaedje.github.io/programmable-markup-language-for-typesetting.pdf">master's
thesis about Typst</a>. In March 2023, its
first pre-release beta version <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2023/beta-oss-launch">was announced</a>; a
month later, semantic versioning was adopted with the <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/releases/tag/v0.1.0">release of
v0.1.0.</a> Typst is now at <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2025/typst-0.13">v.0.13.1</a> and shows
365&nbsp;contributors on its <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#--">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
I had been aware of this project for over a year but had not paid much
attention, assuming it to be yet another attempt to supplant LaTeX that was
doomed to fail. A rising chorus of enthusiasm among early
adopters, and the beginnings of <a href="https://juti.if.its.ac.id/index.php/juti/index">acceptance</a> of
Typst manuscripts by scholarly journals, made me curious enough
to take the young project for a spin.
</p>

<p>
Typst is available as Rust source and as a compiled binary. To install,
visit the <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/releases">releases
page</a> and download the appropriate archive. There are options for Linux,
macOS and Windows; I used the
precompiled Linux version for my testing.
</p>

<p>
The "<tt>typst</tt>" command accepts several subcommands. Entering
"<tt>typst fonts</tt>" lists all of the usable fonts to be found in
standard locations on the machine; nonstandard font directories can be
added manually. In my case, Typst found all of my 476&nbsp;fonts instantly;
the only ones omitted were some ancient PostScript Type&nbsp;1 fonts used
by LaTeX. Users who have LaTeX installed will have a large collection of
OpenType and TrueType math and text fonts on their machines; Typst can
use all of these. But Typst will work fine without them, as the program has
a small collection of fonts built in (try "<tt>typst fonts
--ignore-system-fonts</tt>" to see them).
</p>

<p>
Two other subcommands to explore are
"<tt>compile</tt>", which generates the output (PDF by default, with PDF/A,
SVG, and PNG available, along with HTML under development) from a source file, and
"<tt>watch</tt>" for interactive editing. The <tt>watch</tt> subcommand keeps a Typst process running that
incrementally and automatically compiles the document to PDF in response to
changes in the source. To use "<tt>typst watch</tt>" effectively, the
screen should be divided into three windows: a small terminal window to monitor
the <tt>typst</tt> output for error (or success) messages, the editing
window, and an area for any PDF reader that automatically reloads the
displayed document when it changes (many, such as my favorite, <a href="https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek?tab=readme-ov-file#sioyek">Sioyek</a>, do this). The result is a
responsive live preview, even of large documents, due to Typst's speed and
incremental compilation. For example, Frans Skarman <a href="https://fransskarman.com/phd_thesis_in_typst.html">described</a>
his experience writing his doctoral thesis in Typst, and noted
that he was able to enjoy nearly instant previews of content changes to
the book-length document. 
</p>

<h4 id="how-typst-improves-on-latex">How Typst improves on LaTeX</h4>

<p>
Typst output is quite close to that of LaTeX. It uses the same <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/design/typography/tex/1981-knuth.pdf">line-breaking
algorithm</a> developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass for TeX, so it
creates nicely balanced paragraphs of regular text. Its mathematical
typesetting algorithms are <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update">based closely</a> on the
TeX algorithms, and indeed mathematical rendering is nearly
indistinguishable between the two systems.
</p>

<p>
Getting started with LaTeX can be confusing for newcomers, because it comes
with several alternative "engines" reflecting the long and complex history
of the project. These are the various binaries such as "<tt>pdflatex</tt>",
"<tt>tex</tt>", "<tt>xelatex</tt>", "<tt>luatex</tt>", "<tt>lualatex</tt>",
and more, each with somewhat different capabilities. For Typst there is
only "<tt>typst</tt>".
</p>

<p>
Markup in Typst is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. It
dispenses with the plethora of curly brackets and backslashes littering
LaTeX documents by adopting, for prose, syntax in the style of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">Markdown</a>, and, for
equations, a set of conventions designed for easy input. The
fact that curly brackets and backslashes are awkward to type on German
keyboards may have provided a little extra impetus for the developers to
create an alternative markup system that doesn't require a forest of these
symbols.
</p>

<p>
When users make syntax errors in markup or programming, inevitable
even in Typst, the system presents them with another dramatic improvement
over LaTeX (and TeX): error messages using colored glyphs that
clearly point out exactly where the problem is. I've even discovered that
Typst will save me from trying to run a syntactically correct infinite
loop.
</p>

<p>
Here is a bit of Typst markup for a shopping list, with
the resulting rendering to the right:
</p>

<p><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/typst-list.png" alt="[Rendered list]" title="Rendered list" width="235" height="291"></p><pre>   = Shopping List
   
   == Vegetables
   
   + Broccoli
   + Asparagus (*fresh only*)
   + Plantains (_ripe and green_)
   
   == Booze
   
   + Rum
     - White
     - Dark
   + #underline[Good] gin  
</pre>

<p>
The example gives a flavor of Typst's terse markup syntax. Headings are
indicated with leading <tt>=</tt> signs. Automatically numbered lists are
created by prepending <tt>+</tt> signs to items, and bulleted lists with
<tt>-</tt> signs; lists can be nested. Delimiters are shown for bold text
and italics. These are shortcuts, or markup syntax sugar, for Typst
functions for transforming text. Not every function has a corresponding
shortcut; in those cases one needs to call the function explicitly, as in
the final item.
</p>

<p>
Typst input is always within one of three modes. Markup (text) mode is the
default. The <tt>#</tt> sign preceding the function call in the last line
of the example
places Typst in "code mode". The "<a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/underline/"><tt>underline()</tt></a>" function accepts a number of keyword arguments that affect its behavior, and one trailing argument, in square brackets, containing the text that it modifies. In the example, we've stuck with the default behavior, but if we wanted, for example, a red underline, we could use "<tt>#underline(stroke: red)[Good] gin</tt>". Following the square-bracketed text argument, Typst returns to interpreting input in text mode.
</p>

<p>Other functions produce output directly, rather than modifying a text argument. This bit of Typst input:</p>

<pre>    #let word = "Manhattan"
    There are #str.len(word) letters in #word.
</pre>

<p>produces the output (in typeset form) "There are 9 letters in Manhattan.". The "<a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-len"><tt>len()</tt></a>" function is part of the
"<a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/"><tt>str</tt></a>" module, so it needs the namespace.</p>
 
<p>
Let's take a look at the LaTeX equivalent for the first half of the
shopping list for comparison:
</p>

<pre>   \documentclass[12pt]{article}
   \begin{document}
   \section*{Shopping List}
   
   \subsection*{Vegetables}
   
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Broccoli
   \item Asparagus ({\bfseries fresh only})
   \item Plantains (\emph{ripe and green})
   \end{enumerate}
   \end{document}   
</pre>

<p>
The first two and the last line are boilerplate that is not required in
Typst. The difference in verbosity level and ease of reading the source is
clear.
</p>

<p>
The third Typst mode, in addition to markup and code, is math mode,
delimited by dollar signs. This is also best illustrated by an example:
</p>

<pre>   $ integral_0^1 (arcsin x)^2 (dif x)/(x^2 sqrt(1-x^2)) = π ln 2 $  
</pre>

<p>
When this is compiled by Typst, it produces the result shown below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/typst-series.png" width="800" alt="[Rendered integral]" title="Rendered integral">
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who've used LaTeX will begin to see from this example how math in
Typst source is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. Greek
letters and other Unicode symbols can be used directly, as in modern LaTeX
engines such as <tt>lualatex</tt>, which we <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/731581/">looked at back in 2017</a>, but with no
imports required.
</p>

<p>
The advent of the LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX projects provided users who wanted to
incorporate programming into their documents a more pleasant alternative to
the TeX macro language. As powerful as the embedded Lua system is, however,
it betrays its bolted-on status, requiring users to negotiate the interface
between Lua data structures and LaTeX or TeX internals. In Typst,
programming is thoroughly integrated into the system, with no seams between
the language used for calculation and the constructs that place characters
in the final PDF. Typst programs are invariably <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/TLexamples/">simpler</a> than their LuaLaTeX
equivalents. All authors using Typst will make at least some simple use of
its programming language, as such basic necessities as changing fonts, or
customizations such as changing the style of section headings, are
accomplished by calling Typst functions.
</p>

<p>
The Typst language is somewhat similar to Rust, perhaps
unsurprisingly. Most Typst functions are <em>pure</em>: they have no side effects and
always produce the same result given the same arguments (aside from certain
functions that mutate their arguments, such as <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-push"><tt>array.push()</tt></a>). This
aspect reduces the probability of difficult-to-debug conflicts among
packages that plague LaTeX, and makes it easier to debug Typst documents.
</p>

<p>
Although Typst uses the same line-breaking algorithm as LaTeX, its internal
approach to overall page layout is <a href="https://laurmaedje.github.io/posts/layout-models">distinct</a>. Some
consequences are that Typst does a better job at handling movable elements
such as floating figures, and can, for example, easily split large tables
across page breaks, something that LaTeX struggles with even with
specialized packages.
</p>

<h4 id="typst-drawbacks">Typst drawbacks</h4>

<p>
Typst's page layout algorithm doesn't always permit the refinements that 
LaTeX is capable of.
For example, Typst is not as good
as LaTeX at avoiding <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/widow-and-orphan-control.html">widows
and orphans</a>.
Another salient deficiency is Typst's relative lack of specialized packages,
compared with the vast ecosystem produced by LaTeX's decades of community
involvement. However, the relative ease of programming in Typst (and the
well-organized and extensively commented underlying Rust code) suggests
that this drawback may be remedied before a comparable number of decades
have elapsed. Indeed, there are already <a href="https://typst.app/universe">over 800&nbsp;packages available</a>. Typst still cannot do
everything that LaTeX can, but the breadth of its package collection is
encouraging.
</p>

<p>
Almost no journals that provide LaTeX templates for submissions offer a
Typst option, so physicists and mathematicians adopting Typst will need to
find a way to convert their manuscripts. This is made easier for those who
use <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, as that conversion program
handles Typst.
</p>

<p>
Another drawback is the difficulty of learning Typst. The <a href="https://typst.app/docs">official documentation</a> is confusingly
organized, with information scattered unpredictably among "Tutorial",
"Reference", and "Guides" sections. Concepts are not always clearly
explained, and sometimes not presented in a logical order. The manual is
not keeping up with the rapid development of the program, and contains some
out-of-date information and errors. None of this is surprising considering
how quickly the project is moving, its early stage, and its
small core team. A work-in-progress called the <a href="https://sitandr.github.io/typst-examples-book/book"><em>Typst
Examples Book</em></a> has appeared, which may be a better starting point
than the official documentation.
</p>

<p>
There are other minor deficiencies compared with LaTeX, such as the
inability to include PDF documents. Typst provides no analogue to LaTeX's
<tt>parshape</tt> command, which lets authors mold paragraphs to, for
example, wrap around complex illustrations. The situation is likely to
change, however, as something like <tt>parshape</tt> is <a href="https://forum.typst.app/t/is-there-an-equivalent-to-latex-s-parshape/1006">being
considered</a> for the future.
</p>

<p>
More serious is the possibility of breaking changes as the system evolves,
always a risk of early adoption. I suspect, however, that these will require
only minor edits to documents in most cases. Progress seems to be steady,
rational, and <a href="https://typst.app/docs/roadmap">responsive to
user requests</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>
I'm using Typst in real work right now to write a physics paper. I will
need to submit my manuscript using the journal's LaTeX template, but I'm
taking advantage of Typst to make the entry of the paper's many equations
simpler, and I'll <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/typstfilters/">transform</a> the result to
LaTeX with Pandoc without needing any manual adjustment. The tooling is excellent, as my preferred editor, <a href="http://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, has <a href="https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter?tab=readme-ov-file#nvim-treesitter">support</a>
for the <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter
incremental parser</a>
for Markdown and Typst, which provides syntax-aware highlighting
and navigation of the source files. I use Typst's fast incremental
compilation to get live feedback as I fiddle with my math markup.
</p>

<p>
I was skeptical when I downloaded Typst to try it out, but became
enthusiastic within minutes, as I saw the first (of many) of its lovely
error messages, and remained sanguine as I saw the quality of its output. I
predict that Typst will eventually take the place of LaTeX. But even if
that never comes to pass, it is a useful tool right now.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>The cumulative effect of social advantages across a lifetime&nbsp;– from parental warmth in childhood to friendship, community engagement and religious support in adulthood&nbsp;– may slow the biological processes of aging itself. These social advantages appear to set back “epigenetic clocks” such that a person’s biological age, as measured by analyzing DNA methylation patterns, is younger than their chronological age.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The&nbsp;research, which appeared&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625001541"><span>in the October issue</span></a><span> of the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity - Health, drew on data from more than 2,100 adults in the long-running Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.</span></p><p><span>First author&nbsp;</span><a href="https://psychology.cornell.edu/anthony-ong"><span>Anthony Ong</span></a><span>, psychology professor and director of the Human Health Labs in the College of Human Ecology,&nbsp;and fellow researchers found that people with higher levels of what they called “cumulative social advantage” showed slower epigenetic aging and lower levels of chronic inflammation.</span></p><p><span>"This paper builds on a foundational study we published last year showing how cumulative social advantage relates to positive health outcomes," Ong said. "This new study digs deeper into the same data to understand the biological mechanisms - essentially, how social connections get under our skin to affect aging at the molecular level."</span></p><p><span>The study focused on so-called epigenetic clocks, molecular signatures that estimate the pace of biological aging. Two in particular&nbsp;– GrimAge and DunedinPACE&nbsp;– are considered especially predictive of morbidity and mortality. Adults with stronger, more sustained social networks showed significantly younger profiles on both clocks.</span></p><p><span>"Cumulative social advantage is really about the depth and breadth of your social connections over a lifetime,” Ong said. “We looked at four key areas: the warmth and support you received from your parents growing up, how connected you feel to your community and neighborhood, your involvement in religious or faith-based communities, and the ongoing emotional support from friends and family."</span></p><p><span>The researchers hypothesized that sustained social advantage becomes reflected in core regulatory systems linked to aging, including epigenetic, inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. And indeed, they&nbsp;found that higher social advantage was linked to lower levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory molecule implicated in heart disease, diabetes and neurodegeneration. But interestingly, there were no significant associations with short-term stress markers like cortisol or catecholamines.</span></p><p><span>Unlike many earlier studies that looked at social factors in isolation&nbsp;– whether a person is married, for example, or how many friends they have&nbsp;– this work conceptualized “cumulative social advantage” as a multidimensional construct. And by combining both early and later-life relational resources, the measure reflects the ways advantage clusters and compounds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"What's striking is the cumulative effect - these social resources build on each other over time,” Ong said. “It's not just about having friends today; it's about how your social connections have grown and deepened throughout your life. That accumulation shapes your health trajectory in measurable ways."</span></p><p><span>This perspective draws on cumulative advantage theory, which holds that resources, whether economic or social, tend to accrue, widening disparities across the life course. This underscores a sobering reality: Access to these social resources is not evenly distributed. Race, class and educational attainment shape the likelihood of growing up with supportive parents, finding belonging in community institutions or having friends and partners who provide steady support.</span></p><p><span>That means those already disadvantaged in material ways may also be biologically disadvantaged by a relative lack of sustained social support, potentially accelerating the processes of aging and illness.</span></p><p><span>The findings dovetail with the “weathering hypothesis,” a framework developed by public health scholar Arline Geronimus, which suggests that chronic exposure to adversity and structural inequality leads to earlier health deterioration in marginalized groups. Here, researchers extend that framework to show how accumulated relational advantage, the other side of the coin, may confer resilience at the molecular level.</span></p><p><span>This doesn’t mean a single friendship or volunteer stint can turn back the biological clock. But the authors, including Frank Mann at Stony Brook University and Laura Kubzansky at Harvard University, suggest that the depth and consistency of social connection, built across decades and different spheres of life, matters profoundly. The study adds weight to the growing view that social life is not just a matter of happiness or stress relief but a core determinant of physiological health.</span></p><p><span>"Think of social connections like a retirement account," Ong said. “The earlier you start investing and the more consistently you contribute, the greater your returns. Our study shows those returns aren't just emotional; they're biological. People with richer, more sustained social connections literally age more slowly at the cellular level. Aging well means both staying healthy and staying connected - they're inseparable."</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

Since RL on gpt-oss isn't yet vLLM compatible, we rewrote Transformers inference code to deliver 3x faster inference for gpt-oss at ~21 tokens/s. For BF16, Unsloth also achieves the fastest inference (~30 tokens/s), especially relative<strong> </strong>to VRAM usage, using 50% less VRAM vs. any implementation.</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>With Unsloth, you can train gpt-oss-20b with GRPO on 15GB VRAM and <strong>free</strong> on Colab.

Without Unsloth, only training via bf16 works, making <span>memory use even </span><span><strong>800%+ higher</strong></span>. Most frameworks enable FA3 by default (which reduces VRAM use &amp; increases speed) <strong>but this causes incorrect training loss</strong>.

We found that we had to, not only account for KV Cache prefill during  generations of tokens (this is necessary for efficient inference as we need to know what KVCache corresponds to what token in what layer), but also account for a unique amount of pad tokens in each prompt for batch generations which would change the way we would need to store the block mask. Example of such can be seen below:</p><p><strong>Normal Causal Mask:</strong></p><div><pre><code id=":S1:"><span><span>   k0 k1 k2 k3 k4   &lt;-- keys<!-- -->

If we naïvely apply the causal mask (q_idx ≥ k_idx), it fails as our single query has index 0, while there are n_k key tokens. To fix this, we need an offset in mask creation to decide which tokens to attend. But a naïve approach is slow, since offsets change each step, forcing mask and kernel regeneration. We solved this with cache and compile optimizations.</p><p>The harder part is batch generation. Sequences differ in length, so padding complicates mask creation. Flex Attention had a lot of <a href="https://github.com/meta-pytorch/attention-gym/issues/15#issuecomment-2284148665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges<svg style="mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);-webkit-mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);mask-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-mask-repeat:no-repeat;mask-position:center;-webkit-mask-position:center"></svg></a> and dynamic masks are tricky. Worse, if not compiled, it falls back to eager attention which is slow and memory-heavy (quadratic vs. linear in sequence length). Ultimately, the mask must dynamically handle prefill vs decode with KVCache, batch and padding tokens per sequence, remain torch.compile friendly, and support sliding windows.</p><h3 id="flashattention-investigation"><div>🔍 FlashAttention Investigation</div></h3><p>Another interesting direction we explored was integrating FlashAttention. Its advantages are widely recognized, but one limitation is that it does not support attention sinks during the backward pass for gpt-oss. To work around this, we restructured the attention mechanism so that it operates solely on the attention output and the log-sum-exp values that FlashAttention readily provides. Given these benefits, it seemed like an obvious choice to try.</p><p>However, we soon began noticing issues. While the first few layers behaved as expected, the later layers, particularly layers 18 through 24, produced outputs that diverged significantly from the eager-mode implementation in <i>transformers</i>. Importantly, this discrepancy cannot be attributed to error accumulation, since the inputs to each method are identical at every layer. For further validation, we also compared the results against Unsloth <strong>FlexAttention</strong>.</p><p>This needs further investigation into why only the last few layers show such a drastic difference between flash attention implementation vs. the others.</p><h4 id="flash-attention-3"></h4><p>FA3 is often enabled by default for most training packages (not Unsloth), but this is incorrect for gpt-oss. Using FA3 will make training loss completely wrong as FA3 doesn’t support gpt-oss backward passes for attention sinks. Many people are still unaware of this so please be cautious!</p><h2 id="can-we-counter-reward-hacking"><div>⚠️ Can We Counter Reward Hacking?</div></h2><p>The ultimate goal of RL is to maximize some reward (say speed, revenue, some metric). But RL can <strong>cheat.</strong> When the RL algorithm learns a trick or exploits something to increase the reward, without actually doing the task at end, this is called "Reward Hacking". It's the reason models learn to modify unit tests to pass coding challenges, and these are critical blockers for real world deployment. Some other good examples are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_hacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg style="mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);-webkit-mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);mask-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-mask-repeat:no-repeat;mask-position:center;-webkit-mask-position:center"></svg></a>.</p><p>In our notebook we explore how to counter reward hacking in a code generation setting and showcase tangible solutions to common error modes. We saw the model edit the timing function, outsource to other libraries, cache the results, and outright cheat. After countering, the result is our model generates genuinely optimized matrix multiplication kernels, not clever cheats.</p><h2 id="from-openais-labs-to-your-laptop"><div>💫 From OpenAI's Labs to Your Laptop</div></h2><p>gpt-oss is a legitimate frontier-class architecture from OpenAI that could power breakthrough AI applications.

<p>This site is my attempt to collect <em>every single version</em> of each Infocom game, both source code and compiled game files. I have labelled each package with release and serial number information where possible. (Infocom serial numbers were a timestamp of the compilation date, which is very useful for reconstructing the development sequence.)</p>
<p>IF fans of the modern era have used this source code to recompile the Infocom games. Some have taken the opportunity to fix bugs or modify the games. This collection does <em>not</em> include these modern recompilations and updates. (I have no quarrel with them, but I'm not going to keep track.)</p>
<p>This collection <em>does</em> include a few fan-modified game files that date from the 1980s. (The modifications only extend to the serial and release numbers.) I include these because they were contemporary with Infocom and thus have some historical interest. Also, they were collected in the early 90s and wound up in the game file lists of the nascent Internet IF community.</p>

<p>This was tremendously exciting to fans and scholars of old-school text adventures. This material was known to be out there in private collections, but it had never been publicly available in this form.</p>
<p>Jason's collections are excellent, but they are an edited extract from one source: the so-called "Infocom Drive". They omit some published variations, beta-tests, and so on. I figure it's good to have every Infocom game file variation in one place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, let me be clear: this site would not exist without Jason Scott's efforts. Thank you, Jason! Also thanks to Beaux Hemmer for maintaining the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">patch collection</a>. Thanks to Torbjörn Andersson and Alessandro Giassi for enthusiastic help tracking down more versions and info on them. And, of course, thanks to the Implementors who created these games in the first place.</p>
<p><em>Update, December 2019:</em> Another <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OIZuQ9hJ9PDHX5t-X2onYU4isOC0bvmZ">cleaned-up source collection</a> has been posted by Adam Sommerfield.</p>
<h2>The collection</h2>
<p>You can download a catalog of the whole file collection (JSON format): <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/catalog.json">catalog.json</a>.</p>
<p>(Note that the "updated" field is when I added or last updated the file on this site.)</p>
<p>If you want to download everything in one go, grab <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allgamefiles.zip">allgamefiles.zip</a>, <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allsources.zip">allsources.zip</a>, <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allinterpreters.zip">allinterpreters.zip</a>, and <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allother.zip">allother.zip</a>.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>These are proprietary documents. The copyright rests with Activision. Mind you, Activision certainly doesn't have the development tools or the expertise to compile this source code any more. Quite likely they don't even <em>have</em> the source code any more. If it weren't for private collectors passing it around, this material would be entirely lost.</p>
<p>Like Jason, I believe that the historical value of these documents to the IF community outweighs the rights of the legal owner. As I <a href="http://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/all-of-infocoms-game-source-code.html">wrote in April</a>, copyright is a balance. Activision has not commented on the matter.</p>
<h2>Differences from the GitHub release</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/">GitHub repositories</a> structure the source code as a sequence of commits, showing the development process. This site packages each source directory separately.</p>
<p>This site includes game files collected from original game releases. These have historically been collected as "<a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">patch files</a>". This was a legal figleaf; it allowed a user to transform a legally-owned game file into a different version, without actually distributing copies of each version. I have used those transforms to recreate all known game file versions.</p>
<p>Several of the GitHub repositories contain a common error: an old source file is sometimes not deleted in newer commits. For example, the Zork 2 source contains "crufty.zil" in r22 and r48, but this file has been removed in r63. The GitHub zork2 repo fails to delete it. This site avoids that error.</p>
<p>The GitHub repos omit personal email and individual developers' comments found in the source collection. This site does too; I followed Jason's example in this matter. It is not my intent to expose private communication, even thirty years after the fact.</p>
<p>However, I have included a few files that Jason omitted, primarily "browsie/feelie" manuscripts intended for the game package.</p>
<h2>On Z-code and ZIL</h2>
<p>The game files collected here are <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/">Z-code</a> files, which may be played with any <a href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/List_of_Z-machine_interpreters">Z-code interpreter</a>. The source packages contain <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/ZIL">ZIL</a> source code and associated files.</p>
<p>Z-code files come in various versions. Infocom referred to these as "zip" (version 3), "ezip (version 4), "xzip" (version 5), and "yzip" (version 6). They used the ".zip" file suffix for all of these; the version is distinguished by the first byte of the game file. These days, ".zip" is a compression format, so we tag files as ".z3", ".z4", ".z5", ".z6".</p>
<p>This collection also includes a few ".z1" and ".z2" files recovered from very early releases of Zork 1. These have nonstandard serial numbers.</p>
<p>(In 1995, Graham Nelson proposed ".z7" and ".z8" as simple modifications to support larger game files. The Inform compiler and most modern interpreters support these versions. See the <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/">Z-code specification</a>.)</p>
<p>Extracting the version, release, and serial number from a Z-code file is easy. I use this little Python script: <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/other/zcanalyze.py">zcanalyze.py</a>.</p>
<p>Compiling ZIL source code into a game file requires more effort. Infocom's original ZIL compiler has been recovered, but only in a very early version (circa 1981; see below). However, <a href="http://www.zilf.io/">ZILF</a> is an open-source ZIL compiler which is under active development.</p>
<h2>Canonical versions</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/InfocomClassicTextAdventureMasterpieces1996JewelCaseArt">Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom</a> CD (1996) is the source of most modern releases and downloads. If you want to play the "official" version of a game, the Masterpieces version is usually the right choice.</p>
<p>However, there are some complications. In some cases, the Mac and PC directories on the CD had different versions. Also, Hitchhiker and Shogun were not included on Masterpieces.</p>
<p>The "official" version of Hitchhiker is the one that Douglas Adams posted on his web site in the mid-90s. The BBC later posted an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition">illustrated version</a> based on the same game file.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/lost-treasures-of-infocom">Lost Treasures of Infocom 1 and 2</a> (1992) were earlier Activision collections. These made slightly different game-file choices than Masterpieces, and they <em>did</em> include Hitchhiker and Shogun. To add to the confusion, LTOI1 was released for Amiga as well.</p>
<p>A few of Infocom's earlier games were re-released in "Solid Gold" editions, with built-in Invisiclues. These versions used ".z5" format in order to accomodate the additional text. The Activision collections were quite inconsistent about whether to use the "Solid Gold" versions.</p>
<p>I have noted the Masterpieces version of each game file, and (where different) the LTOI1/2 versions. For more information about game file versions, see Paul David Doherty's invaluable <a href="http://pdd.if-legends.org/infocom/fact-sheet.txt">Infocom Fact Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>Versions marked "final-dev" are unreleased final internal versions (according to the <a href="http://pdd.if-legends.org/infocom/fact-sheet.txt">Fact Sheet</a>). That is, they had changes in progress when development shut down. These may fix bugs, but they never went through QA, so they should not be considered release-quality.</p>
<h2>Some notes on the files</h2>
<p>Despite the title of this page, this is not a <em>complete</em> collection! We have what's been recovered. In particular, there's no guarantee that the "most current" source corresponds to a final release.</p>
<p>All of the source packages contain source (.zil) files. Some also contain temporary files in various stage of compilation (.zap, .zabstr). Some contain compilation reports, design documents, or other related files. It's just a question of what was found in the source archive.</p>
<p>Release numbers are not always sequential. Infocom tended to reset the release number sequence after beta/gamma testing was over, or at other major development milestones. The serial number dates are more reliable, except where they've been obviously zeroed out.</p>
<p>It is perhaps amusing to learn that the "Solid Gold" editions were labelled as the "cheap" releases during development.</p>
<p>Games with sound (Sherlock, Lurking Horror) and graphics (most z6 games) may or may not include the media files in the source directory. The game files never include media. Even if present in the source, these files are probably not in a form that a modern interpreter can understand. See <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/media/">this page</a> for portable versions of these media files.</p>
<p>A few game files are modified for the Macintosh. According to the internal notes, the modifications are "special flags" on certain objects. This apparently refers to setting the fixed-width font for descriptions with ASCII art. Infocom's Mac interpreter required this; it was the only one of its kind that defaulted to variable-width font display. (Most modern interpreters do.)</p>
<p>Source comment on the Mac versions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following is a list of changeds specifically for the Mac version:</p>
<p>SEASTALKER -- Special flags set on Sonarscope, control panel in sub and control panel in Bly's office.</p>
<p>ZORK2 -- Special flags set on magic well etching (top and bottom), Label on candied insects and stone cube in bank vault.</p>
<p>ZORK3 -- Special flags set on Royal puzzle and bronze plaque in cage.</p>
<p>ENCHANTER -- Special flags set on Translucent maze map, sign on path to brook and on fireworks for Filfre scroll.</p>
<p>SUSPENDED -- Special flags set on all three monitors: 1) Weather, 2) Hydroponics 3) Transit.</p>
<p>INFIDEL -- Special flags set for Hieroglyphs: bottom of stairs, scarab, book of dead, page in book of dead, beam, scroll in forward cabin, opening in top of pyramid, stone cube, bricks, recessed panel, west end of passage, north antechamber, south antechamber, room of Nephthys, Isis, Selkis, Neith, narrow hallway, cube room, cube south part, silver room, gold room, skeleton in room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Z-code game files are sometimes found with zeroes or garbage data padded on the end. This does not affect the game behavior. I have generally ignored these variations. I've also ignored variations in byte 1 of the game file; these represent interpreter variations from different platforms, not game differences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">patches archive</a> contains several game files whose serial numbers are blank or nonsensical. These are always minor modifications of other game files, typically with only the serial number (and checksum) altered. We assume these are "crack" versions modified by users. I have included them regardless.</p>
<p>The patches archive also includes a set of game files which have been modified to bypass Infocom's "feelie" copy protection. I have omitted these, as they definitely postdate Infocom (they were released circa 1999). The feelie data is of course <a href="http://infodoc.plover.net/">well-archived</a> in any case.</p>

<h3><a name="zorkmdl">Original Zork, MDL version</a></h3>

<p>The "mainframe" version of Zork/Dungeon, created at MIT between 1977 and 1979. This package, unlike the others on this site, is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)">MDL</a>.</p>
<p>Zork-MDL has been available for some time. (It was posted on <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html">Bob Supnik's web site</a> in 2003, perhaps earlier. Ports to Fortran and C are also <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/games/source/">easily findable</a>.) I include it here because, well, it's Zork.</p>
<p>Four versions of the source, labelled according to the "US NEWS &amp; DUNGEON REPORT" date (see <code>dung.mud</code>; note that the 1979 version shows inconsistent dates). The 1981 version says "no longer being supported" and refers players to the commercial Infocom release.</p>
<p>Several runnable versions have been recovered from MIT tapes. These are available at the <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/its/">ITS project</a>. I have not mirrored the executable files, because they're only executable inside ITS (running on an emulated PDP-10). See <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/its/issues/1940">this post</a> for a list of Zork versions found. Visit the project page for information on setting up ITS; or <code>telnet its.pdp10.se 10003</code> to try it online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can try the ITS environment online! Telnet to its.pdp10.se, port 10003 (<code>telnet its.pdp10.se 10003</code>). When it says "Connected...", hit ctrl-Z. Then type <code>:login yourname</code>. (Any name will work.) Then type <code>:zork</code> to play. <code>:advent</code> is also available; that's the original Crowther version. You can also try <code>:games;adv350</code> and <code>:games;adv448</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that the 1977-78 versions introduce themselves by saying "Welcome to Dungeon"; the 1979-81 versions say "Welcome to Zork". Of course the "Dungeon" versions still mention "Zork" in many places within the game.</p>

<h3><a name="zil">ZIL</a></h3>

<p>An early version of Infocom's ZIL compiler, written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)">MDL</a>. The files are dated no later than early 1981; most are 1979-1980. This version includes both the compiler (ZILCH) and assembler (ZAP) stages.</p>
<p>This source was originally archived at <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/its-vault">https://github.com/PDP-10/its-vault</a> (the <code>twenex/zork</code> directory) by Lars Brinkhoff. See also the standalone repository at <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/zil">https://github.com/PDP-10/zil</a>.</p>
<p>For a guide to using this source, see <a href="https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-to">Roman Bartke's ZILCH How-to</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation has been gathered from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Learning_ZIL_Steven_Eric_Meretzky_1995">Internet Archive</a>, the <a href="https://frobnitz.co.uk/zmachine/infocom/">collection at frobnitz.co.uk</a>, and other sources.

<h3><a name="zap">ZAP</a></h3>

<p>We have two standalone versions of the ZAP assembler, one early and one late.</p>
<p>The first is written in the MIDAS assembly language for the PDP-10. This version is dated Jan 7 1982. It was found within the minizork-r2 source directory (see <a href="#minizork">below</a>).</p>
<p>The second is written in C and dated March 1988. The comments say "Zinn Computer Company, for Infocom", implying that the work was outsourced. The directory includes <code>.o</code> and executable binaries, presumably in Sun architecture (the directory was labelled "sun"). From <a href="https://github.com/AlexProudfoot/The-ZIL-Files/tree/master/interlogic/sun">this historical repo</a>. (A handful of other utilities are included, including <code>zsplit</code>, <code>zglue</code>, <code>zspix</code>, and <code>zsymtest</code>. These appear to have to do with packaging game files onto disk for specific platforms.)</p>
<p>A third, earlier version can be found as part of the <a href="#zil">ZIL</a> source repository above. This is MDL code dated "Jan 18 1980". I'm not sure if it can be run independently of the rest of the ZIL toolset.</p>

<h3><a name="terps">Interpreters</a></h3>

<p>Most of Infocom's original ZIL interpreters were written in assembly for the various platforms of the 1980s. A few later versions were written in C, or (for the Mac) Pascal.</p>
<p>The TRS-80 (Tandy) CoCo interpreter was released in 2018, thanks to <a href="https://retrotinker.blogspot.com/2018/02/z-intepreter-source-for-coco-recovered.html">Brian Moriarty, Carlos Camacho, and John Linville</a>. (First archived <a href="http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Programming/Source/Infocom%20Adventure%20Games%20Interpreter/">here</a>.) The others became available to the public in 2023. (Archived <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps">here</a>.)</p>
<p>These packages are presented by directory, as they were preserved. The contents are not consistently organized. Some of these packages contain more than one interpreter version; some contain additional documentation or serial-port transfer scripts. See <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps">this README</a> for a detailed catalog of the contents.</p>

<h3><a name="infidel">Infidel</a></h3>

<p>We have two game files labelled r22, Mac and non-Mac. Neither of them seems to correspond to the most current source. (E.g.: the source mentions InvisiClues if you type <code>HELP</code>, but none of the game files contain that line.) I've labelled the current source "infidel-rlater" for lack of better information.</p>

<p>It appears that Infocom was still finalizing the V4 spec during AMFV's development. The development (alpha/gamma) versions have inconsistent header length fields, and must be updated to play in modern interpreters.</p>

<h3><a name="sherlock">Sherlock</a></h3>

<p>A conundrum, Watson. Four source directories appear. The base and -sound directories differ in only a few lines of zil. The -nosound directory has nosound.zil in place of gamesound.zil. The -ss directory is substantially different from the others; the header timestamps imply that it is an early development version. For what it's worth, the included version note says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SOUND version is the Release version. The NOSOUND version is currently NOT the release version but contains the Bob Bates updates that are in the SOUND version (without the sound code, of course).</p>

<h3><a name="sampler">Infocom Sampler</a></h3>

<p>The sampler appears to have gone through several combinations of games. r26-r55 contained samples of Zork 1, Planetfall, Infidel, and The Witness. r97 contained Zork, Trinity, and LGOP; but we find a parallel r8 which contains only Zork and Trinity, plus partial work on adding Ballyhoo. Comment from the r8 source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This directory is for NSAMPLER stuff where all references to LGOP have been deleted. The XM4.* files are a stripped down Ballyhoo that could have possibly been inserted into XSAMPLER in place of LGOP, but wasn't. These files stand alone as a separate mini-game and would need to be integrated into XSAMPLER if ever used (when hell freezes over).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a folder sampler-trinity, which appears to be a very partial tear-down (or build-up) of Trinity.</p>
<p>I have used the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>sampler-1z: Tutorial plus Zork</li>
<li>sampler-3zpi: Tutorial plus Zork, Planetfall, Infidel</li>
<li>sampler-4zpiw: Tutorial plus Zork, Planetfall, Infidel, Witness</li>

<h3><a name="hypochondriac">Hypochondriac</a></h3>

<p>An unfinished game by Tomas Bok. Bok worked for Infocom briefly before college (see <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/lost-infocom-game-found-sorta/43604">this forum thread</a>). Hypochondriac was a "fun project" he was working on in his own time.</p>
<p>The source package is Bok's work directory, and contains several fragments of source code unrelated to Hypochondriac. Some of them (<code>boot.zil</code>, <code>circuit.zil</code>, <code>maintenance.zil</code>) are from an incomplete sci-fi game titled "Search 'n Rescue". Others are source files from Infocom games (Zork, LGOP, etc), modified while Bok was experimenting with ZIL.</p>
<p>The game files include both Hypochondriac and various experiments. The experiments aren't necessarily related to Hypochondriac; I've given them a common name simply to group them together.</p>

<h3><a name="zillib">ZilLib</a></h3>

<p>This is the "new parser" that Infocom developed around 1987, late in its history. Their earlier games were based on the ZIL parser developed for Zork 1, and then copied from game to game in an evolutionary sequence.</p>
<p>ZilLib was an attempt at a next-generation parser to go along with the next-generation (z6) Z-machine. See <a href="http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/articles/NZT-parser.txt">this article</a> from Infocom's 1989 newsletter.</p>
<p>The source code for Zork Zero, Arthur, Shogun, Abyss, and Restaurant all refer to the zillib directory. (And the zillib/parser directory contains include files that refer back to them; e.g. "parser.shogun".)</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In the third century BCE, Apollonius of Perga asked how many circles one could draw that would touch three given circles at exactly one point each. It would take 1,800 years to prove the answer: eight.</p>
<p>Such questions, which ask for the number of solutions that satisfy a set of geometric conditions, were a favorite of the ancient Greeks. And they’ve continued to entrance mathematicians for millennia. How many lines lie on a cubic surface? How many quadratic curves lie on a quintic surface? (Twenty-seven and 609,250, respectively.) “These are really hard questions that are only easy to understand,” said <a href="https://katzs.web.illinois.edu/">Sheldon Katz</a>, a mathematician at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>As mathematics advanced, the objects that mathematicians wanted to count got more complicated. It became a field of study in its own right, known as enumerative geometry.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no end to the enumerative geometry problems that mathematicians could come up with. But by the middle of the 20th century, mathematicians had started to lose interest. Geometers moved beyond concrete problems about counting, and focused instead on more general abstractions and deeper truths. With the exception of a brief resurgence in the 1990s, enumerative geometry seemed to have been set aside for good.</p>

<p>That may now be starting to change. A small cadre of mathematicians has figured out how to apply a decades-old theory to enumerative questions. The researchers are providing solutions not just to the original problems, but to versions of those problems in infinitely many exotic number systems. “If you do something once, it’s impressive,” said <a href="https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~vakil/">Ravi Vakil</a>, a mathematician at Stanford University. “If you do it again and again, it’s a theory.”</p>
<p>That theory has helped to revive the field of enumerative geometry and to connect it to several other areas of study, including algebra, topology and number theory — imbuing it with fresh depth and allure. The work has also given mathematicians new insights into all sorts of important number systems, far beyond the ones they’re most familiar with.</p>
<p>At the same time, these results are raising just as many questions as they answer. The theory spits out the numbers that mathematicians are seeking, but it also gives additional information that they’re struggling to interpret.</p>
<p>That mystery has inspired a new generation of talent to get involved. Together, they’re bringing counting into the 21st century.</p>
<h2><strong>Counting Forward</strong></h2>
<p>All enumerative geometry problems essentially come down to counting objects in space. But even the simplest examples can quickly get complicated.</p>
<p>Consider two circles some distance apart on a piece of paper. How many lines can you draw that touch each circle exactly once? The answer is four:</p>

            <p>You can slide these circles further apart, or shrink one to half its size, and the answer won’t change. But move one circle so that it intersects the other like a Venn diagram, and suddenly the answer does change — from four to two. Slide whichever circle is smaller entirely inside the bigger one, and now the answer is zero: You can’t draw any lines that touch each circle only once.</p>

    <p>Such inconsistencies are a real pain. In this example, there were only three different configurations to consider, but often the problem is too complicated for researchers to work through every possible case. You might find the answer for one case, but you’ll have no idea how it will change when you move things around.</p>
<p>In practice, mathematicians try to write the problem’s geometric constraints as a collection of equations, then figure out how many solutions satisfy all those equations simultaneously. But even though they know that the number of solutions won’t always stay consistent, there’s nothing in the nature of the equations they write down that indicates whether they’ve stumbled on a new configuration that will yield a different answer.</p>
<p>There’s one exception — when the problem is defined in terms of complex numbers. A complex number has two parts: a “real” part, which is an ordinary number, and an “imaginary” part, which is an ordinary number multiplied by the square root of −1 (what mathematicians call <em>i</em>).</p>
<p>In the example above with the circles and lines, if you ask for the number of complex solutions to your equations, you always get four as your answer, no matter what arrangement you look at.</p>
<p>By around 1900, mathematicians had developed techniques to solve any enumerative geometry problem in the complex realm. These techniques didn’t have to take different configurations into account: No matter what answer mathematicians got, they knew it had to be true for every configuration.</p>

    <p>But the methods were no longer effective when mathematicians only wanted to find, say, the number of real solutions to the equations in an enumerative geometry problem, or the number of integer solutions. If they asked an enumerative geometry problem in any number system other than the complex one, inconsistencies cropped up again. In these other number systems, mathematicians couldn’t address enumerative questions systematically.</p>
<p>At the same time, the mysterious, shifting answers that mathematicians encountered when they limited themselves to the integers, or to the real numbers, made enumerative questions a great way to probe those other number systems — to better understand the differences between them, and the objects that live inside them. Mathematicians thought that developing methods to deal with these settings would open up new, deeper areas of mathematics.</p>
<p>Among them was the mathematical great David Hilbert. When he penned a list of what he considered the most important open problems of the 20th century, he included one about making the techniques for solving enumerative geometry questions more rigorous.</p>

<p>In the 1960s and ’70s, Alexander Grothendieck and his successors developed novel conceptual tools that helped resolve Hilbert’s problem and set the foundation for the field of modern algebraic geometry. As mathematicians pursued an understanding of those concepts, which are so abstract that they remain impenetrable to nonspecialists, they ended up leaving enumerative geometry behind. Meanwhile, when it came to enumerative geometry problems in other number systems, “our techniques hit a brick wall,” Katz said. Enumerative geometry never became the beacon that Hilbert had imagined; other threads of research illuminated mathematicians’ way instead.</p>
<p>Enumerative geometry no longer felt like a central, lively area of study. Katz recalled that as a young professor in the 1980s, he was warned away from the subject “because it was not going to be good for my career.”</p>
<p>But a few years later, the development of string theory temporarily gave enumerative geometry a second wind. Many problems in string theory could be framed in terms of counting: String theorists wanted to find the number of distinct curves of a certain type, which represented the motion of strings — one-dimensional objects in 10-dimensional space that they believe form the building blocks of the universe. Enumerative geometry “became very much in fashion again,” Katz said.</p>
<p>But it was short-lived. Once physicists answered their questions, they moved on. Mathematicians still lacked a general framework for enumerative geometry problems in other number systems and had little interest in pursuing one. Other fields seemed more approachable.</p>
<p>That was the case until the mathematicians <a href="https://sites.math.duke.edu/~kgw/">Kirsten Wickelgren</a> and <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~jelkass/">Jesse Kass</a> came to a sudden realization: that enumerative geometry might provide the exact kind of deep insights that Hilbert had hoped for.</p>
<h2><strong>A Bird’s-Eye View</strong></h2>
<p>Kass and Wickelgren met in the late 2000s and soon became regular collaborators. In many ways their demeanors couldn’t be more different. Wickelgren is warm, but restrained and deliberate. Whenever I asked her to confirm that I’d understood a given statement correctly, she’d pause for a moment, then answer with a firm “Yes, please” — her way of saying “Exactly, you’ve got it!” Kass, on the other hand, is nervously enthusiastic. He’s easily excited and talks at a rapid-fire pace.</p>

    <p>But Kass and Wickelgren worked well together and shared many interests — including a love for extending geometry’s reach into other fields.</p>
<p>In 2015, Kass was passing through Atlanta, where Wickelgren lived, and decided to approach her with his latest obsession: He wanted to revisit enumerative questions in restricted number systems, that long-abandoned endeavor.</p>
<p>He brought along a bunch of loose ideas and old papers that seemed relevant. “I realized this was a kind of pie-in-the-sky project,” Kass said. “She very politely explained to me that all my answers were nonsense.” Then he mentioned a result from 1977, and suddenly “a light bulb went off.”</p>
<p>In that 1977 paper, the mathematicians Harold Levine and <a href="https://eisenbud.github.io/">David Eisenbud</a> were <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/1977/106-1/p02">working out a proof</a> that involved counting. They ended up with a special type of expression called a quadratic form — a simple polynomial where each term’s exponents always add up to 2, such as <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>, or <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>yz</em>.</p>
<p>Eisenbud and Levine realized that the count they were interested in was hidden in plain sight. The answer lay in the form’s “signature”: the number of positive terms minus the number of negative terms. (For example, the quadratic form <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>yz</em> has two positive terms, <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> and 3<em>yz</em>, and one negative term, <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>, so its signature is 2 − 1, or 1.)</p>
<p>This was Wickelgren’s light bulb. In the decades since Eisenbud and Levine had published their proof, mathematicians had devised a seemingly unrelated framework called motivic homotopy theory. That framework, which treated solutions to equations as special mathematical spaces and studied the relationships between them, was both sophisticated and powerful. Among other things, it gave mathematicians a way to describe those relationships using particular kinds of quadratic forms.</p>

    <p>Listening to Kass, Wickelgren immediately recognized that Eisenbud and Levine had come up with one of these forms. The mathematicians had been doing motivic homotopy theory without realizing it — and it had given them the answer they’d been seeking.</p>
<p>And while Eisenbud and Levine weren’t working on an enumerative geometry problem, it was similar enough in flavor — it involved counting, after all — that it got Kass and Wickelgren thinking. Perhaps they could solve their own counting problems using the framework of motivic homotopy theory, too. And since motivic homotopy theory could be broadly applied to any number system, perhaps it would unlock the enumerative geometry questions in those settings that had eluded mathematicians for so long.</p>
<h2><strong>A Deeper View</strong></h2>
<p>Remember that typically, an enumerative geometry problem involves finding the number of solutions that satisfy a collection of equations. Kass and Wickelgren’s insight was not to try to solve those equations directly — it rarely worked in settings other than the complex numbers. Instead, the pair rewrote a given enumerative geometry question (set in a given number system) in terms of spaces of equations and functions that described the relationship between those spaces.</p>
<p>With the problem reformulated in this way, they could apply motivic homotopy theory to it. This allowed them to compute a quadratic form. Now they had to figure out what information that quadratic form contained about their original problem.</p>
<p>When they were working in the complex numbers, they realized, all they had to do was count up the number of different variables in the quadratic form they’d computed. That number gave them the number of solutions to their enumerative geometry problem. Of course, this wasn’t particularly interesting to them: Mathematicians already had good techniques for getting this answer.</p>

<p>So they moved on to other number systems. For the real numbers, it got a little trickier. Once they computed the quadratic form in this setting, they had to look at its signature instead. And the signature didn’t give the precise answer: It gave a minimum for what the answer could be. That is, for any enumerative geometry problem involving real numbers, they had a way to calculate a lower bound — a good starting place.</p>
<p>But most exciting of all was that when they computed a quadratic form for other, stranger number systems, they could also glean important information. Take a looping system of seven numbers that operates on what’s called clock arithmetic: In such a system, 7 + 1 equals 1 instead of 8. In this system, they rewrote their quadratic form as an array of numbers called a matrix. They then calculated a quantity called the determinant and proved that while it didn’t tell them the total number of solutions, it did tell them something about what proportions of those solutions had certain geometric properties.</p>
<p>In 2017, Kass and Wickelgren showcased this for one of enumerative geometry’s most famous theorems: that a cubic surface can contain at most 27 lines. Using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01175">their new methods</a>, they showed that indeed, the answer is 27 in the complex numbers. They replicated a known lower bound for the real numbers — and provided new numerical information for every finite number system. It all came in one package.</p>

<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>It was one of the first times mathematicians had been able to say anything significant about enumerative geometry problems for systems outside the complex and real numbers. Moreover, while the problem’s answer might change depending on the number system and the configuration of shapes within it, for the first time mathematicians had found one theory that could encompass all those potential different answers.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the real numbers or the complex numbers,” Wickelgren said. “They’re just special cases of a result that holds in any number system.”</p>
<p>And that was only the beginning.</p>
<h2><strong>A New Start</strong></h2>
<p>In the years since, Wickelgren, Kass and others have reframed a host of other enumerative problems using motivic homotopy theory, deriving the relevant quadratic forms in various number systems.</p>
<p>“All the geometric constructions used to give people integer answers,” said <a href="https://www.esaga.uni-due.de/marc.levine/">Marc Levine</a>, a mathematician at the University of Duisburg-Essen who has been independently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03049">exploring the same ideas</a>. “Now you can feed [the problem] in and get something which will give you a quadratic form as an answer.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians have made a lot of progress since Kass and Wickelgren’s original work when it comes to understanding what information a quadratic form can give them in different number systems. Sometimes, though, they’re not sure what to look for in the quadratic form. “We’re still kind of mystified about what exactly it tells you,” Levine said. There’s a lot left to interpret.</p>
<p>“At this point,” said <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/aravind-asok/">Aravind Asok</a> of the University of Southern California, trying to glean information about enumerative geometry problems from quadratic forms “is an entire industry.” It’s also concrete and accessible, which has attracted the attention of young mathematicians, he added. “It’s exciting because students can get into something with meat sort of quickly.”</p>
        
        
<p>Such concreteness is unusual in today’s abstract mathematical landscape. “The math keeps going one level higher in abstraction, and then sometimes I feel like I don’t know what I’m talking about anymore,” said <a href="https://homepage.sabrinapauli.com/">Sabrina Pauli</a>, who was Wickelgren’s first graduate student and is now a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. But this new area of research gives her a way to bring that high level of abstraction back down to earth.</p>
<p>Wickelgren, Kass, Levine and others have recently used their techniques to revisit enumerative questions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01936">related to string theory</a> — but in new number systems and settings.</p>
<p>In all these cases, mathematicians have found a new way to explore how points, lines, circles and far more complicated objects act differently in different numerical contexts. Kass and Wickelgren’s revived version of enumerative geometry provides an unlikely window into the very structure of numbers. “It would be hard for me not to be drawn to the question that asks how many rational curves are there on a sheet of paper,” Wickelgren said. “That’s a fundamental part of the mathematical reality of a sheet of paper.”</p>

<p>Some memories are easy to recall—lush with detail, fresh as the moment itself. Others are more tenuous, like faded sketches. And the most stubborn ones can refuse to resurface at all. Why do our brains enshrine some memories so indelibly, and let others slip away?</p>



<p>A new Boston University study has a potential answer, suggesting that memories of mundane moments are given extra sticking power if they become connected to a significant event—something surprising, rewarding, or carrying an emotional punch. Watch your Powerball numbers cash in, for example, and you’re likely to remember what you were doing in the moments before, however unremarkable and unmemorable those incidents might have been otherwise. The findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady1704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, could potentially lead to improved treatments for people with memory problems or even help students retain tricky concepts.</p>



<p>“Memory isn’t just a passive recording device: our brains decide what matters, and emotional events can reach back in time to stabilize fragile memories,” says <a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/robert-m-g-reinhart-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert M.G. Reinhart</a>, a BU College of Arts &amp; Sciences associate professor of psychological and brain sciences. “Developing strategies to strengthen useful memories, or weaken harmful ones, is a long-standing goal in cognitive neuroscience. Our study suggests that emotional salience could be harnessed in precise ways to achieve those goals.”</p>



<p>In their paper, he and his colleagues give the example of someone hiking through Yellowstone National Park and stumbling across a herd of majestic bison. The wow of that moment, they discovered, would not just cement the one magical experience in the mind, but lots of little, more run-of-the-mill events leading up to and away from it: a rock spotted on the path, a small animal darting into the undergrowth.</p>



<p>“The question is: What are the mechanisms for that?” says Reinhart, who’s also a College of Engineering associate professor of biomedical engineering and a faculty member at the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/csn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BU Center for Systems Neuroscience</a>. “That’s what we tried to uncover, how the brain selectively strengthens those fragile memories.”</p>



<h2>How the Brain Selects Which Memories to Preserve</h2>



<p>While most of us know that special moments get a revered spot in our memory banks, researchers have been divided on concepts known as retroactive and proactive memory enhancement—the prioritization of memories immediately before or after a big, or salient, event. Previous studies have disagreed on whether or not weaker memories are stabilized, or made easier to recall, by attachment to a more prominent one.</p>



<p>Reinhart says the latest project—which included close to 650 participants, 10 individual studies, and the use of artificial intelligence to analyze a broader set of data—is the first to definitively show that memory enhancement does happen. One major difference with past studies: they found the brain uses a sliding scale to decide which memories to preserve. Many of the team’s experiments involved showing participants dozens of images—connected to different levels of rewards—then giving them a surprise memory test the next day.</p>



<p>With things that occurred after an event (proactive memories), the strength of recall seemed to depend on the emotional impact of the big moment itself—the more enduring the salient event, the more likely everything after it was to be remembered. That didn’t apply when reaching back to the things that happened in the run-up to the event (retroactive memories). Those memories were more likely to be cemented if they had similarities—perhaps a visual cue, like a matching color—that connected them to the pivotal moment. According to Reinhart, it’s the first validation in humans of “graded prioritization, a new principle of how the brain consolidates everyday experiences.”</p>

<p>“For the first time, we show clear evidence that the brain rescues weak memories in a graded fashion, guided by their high-level similarity to emotional events,” says Chenyang (Leo) Lin (GRS’30), the paper’s first author and a doctoral student in the <a href="https://reinhartlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reinhart Lab</a>. “It’s not just timing that matters, but also conceptual overlap.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found that if any secondary memories carried emotional weight themselves, the memory enhancement effect was diminished. “The brain seems to prioritize fragile memories that would otherwise slip away,” says Reinhart, who has published a series of <a href="https://reinhartlab.org/papers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly cited papers</a> on how memory functions. Much of his research has also included brain stimulation—using noninvasive techniques to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0371-x" target="_blank">improve working</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01132-3" target="_blank">long-term memory</a> in older adults or to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01173-w" target="_blank">curb obsessive-compulsive behavior</a>.</p>



<h3>Rescuing Memories; Improving Test Scores</h3>



<p>Although the latest study was focused on uncovering a basic mechanism guiding how memories are encoded, Reinhart says the work could lay the foundation for future clinical and other real-world studies and interventions.</p>



<p>“The discovery has broad implications for both theory and practice,” says Reinhart. “In education, pairing emotionally engaging material with fragile concepts could improve retention. In a clinical setting, we could potentially rescue memories that are weak, way back in the recesses of our mind because of normal aging, for example. You can flip it, too, for people with trauma-related disorders—maybe you don’t want to rescue a distressing memory.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/thoughts-on-mechanical-keyboards-zsa-moonlander">https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/thoughts-on-mechanical-keyboards-zsa-moonlander</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45391566">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="primary-article">
<p>I don’t normally review things here, as I find that it’s outside the realm of the blog, but I want to talk about the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">ZSA Moonlander</a> keyboard, a “mechanical” keyboard that I bought a couple of years ago. But, yeah, in case you’re wondering why I am writing a review: I mean, it’s a keyboard? You type on it. It goes clickety-clack — or maybe not, if you’re an obsessive and want your keyboard quiet. Or maybe you want it loud, like the flexor-destroying IBM model Ms from the days of yore, rat-tat-tatting like a Mac-10. People are into that now: they need to sound right, look right (boba tea colored keys are a thing) and type well. If they light up like a cheap vape stick, even better.</p>
<p>To me, it’s a tool; it’s there to minimize strain and injury. I bought the moonlander because it helps me do my job. It’s no different to me than a hammer is to a carpenter, and yet in using it I’ve realized it does expand on what I can do in ways that I feel compelled to talk about. It is a game changer to any keyboard warrior. ZSA’s moonlander is merely one well-crafted incarnation of millions.</p>
<p>Ricing your keyboard is a hobby. It’s nearly a religion to some folk: like crossfit and instant pots.</p>
<p>One major benefit of this movement is the wealth of opportunity afforded to people like me, and you, who care about finger ergonomy but do not find the old-fashioned options that have long existed on the periphery of peripherals.</p>
<p>The specifics of what makes, or doesn’t make, a mechanical keyboard is, I am sure, a tedious conversation that takes place all the time, so I’ll hide behind the phrase <em>I’ll know it when I see it</em> and move swiftly on. (But I’ll argue that quality key switches and firmware are two of the most important ones.)</p>
<p>It’s interesting how it’s a <em>whole thing now</em> for enthusiasts to solder, assemble, or buy ready-made mechanical keyboards made by other enthusiasts. It’s also a sign of how dire traditional, commercial keyboards are in quality and choice. With a mechanical keyboard you can pick the type of key switch you want your keys to have: quiet, loud, firm, soft. Linear or non-linear. You can mix and match so some keys are weightier than others: your thumbs are stronger, so you’ll want a weightier key for them.</p>
<p>I feel like this movement has sprung up out of nowhere in the last ten years, and it’s resulted in a lot of fun and interesting keyboards. There are novel firmware choices beyond the most manifestly basic idea that pressing a key yields exactly one outcome.</p>
<p>Clacky keys and boba tea colored key caps is not why I bought into the mechanical keyboard hype. I have long wanted to ditch the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboards (who came up with <em>that</em> name?)</p>
<p>I had two at all times: one at home and another at work. They’d wear out from use after a couple of years. Total flim-flam. The typing experience was never great, either. But I <em>loved</em> the ergonomic design. I’ve owned around 10 in the last 20 years, as the ergonomics of the keyboard (and lack of serious alternatives) kept me from switching.</p>
<p>You see, mechanical keyboards offer hardware flexibility like switchable key caps and switches (the bit that goes click), true; but most of them also come with fancy, free software firmware that opens up a whole world of amazing possibilities. I’ve worked in some pretty weird work environments, and being able to rebind caps lock to control is one of the most important things I have to do on a traditional keyboard, like the aforementioned Microsoft keyboard. I once had to work at a client’s place that mandated I use a garbage-tier Citrix thin client computer that’d read your keyboard’s scan codes and make up its mind later, somewhere en-route to a data center in Paris, what key it should treat it as. I don’t have to tell you that rebinding caps lock to much of anything did not work at all.</p>
<p>But, with thoroughly customizable firmware, it’s a snap to deign a key to be what ever you choose; or even multiple things, at different times. Your customizations are in the keyboard’s firmware <em>itself</em>, so you take your changes with you. That’s perfect for someone like me that used to crash through the windows of many a client sites, Mary Poppins-style, keyboard in hand, ready to build software.</p>
<p>The value and flexibility of the firmware really is that useful and important. I now recommend that people consider this style of keyboard (or, at the very least, the programmable aspects of a mechanical keyboard) in <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/book">my book</a>, as it’s a good way to personalize your keyboard workflow to suit your style and needs. Forget binding caps lock to control: move your keys around to suit your physical needs. That is infinitely better than crudely remapping caps lock to control.</p>
<p>Back to the Moonlander. The product page did a reasonable (if overly flashy) job of explaining its key benefits over a regular keyboard. The cost? $365. Ouch. It’s not that much money for something that I myself use to make money, but it’s like… it’s just a keyboard. What’s it made out of!? Pressed myrrh and printer ink?</p>
<p>Still, it’s not a bad price if the finish and quality matches the price. So I bought it, and it took about 7-8 days to arrive at my house in London, all the way from Taiwan. Returns are apparently not possible, fair enough, as ZSA’s a small business, and Taiwan is a long way away. They recommend you try and sell it yourself if you dislike it. Spare a thought for the guy on eBay who was selling one with blank key caps, around the time I was buying mine, saying it was ‘barely used’…</p>
<p>The keyboard only has two years of warranty, though they claim it’s ‘built to last’. So fingers crossed as I’m coming up on 4 years of daily use.</p>
<p>What I like about it is that it ticked my main requirement of being touch typist friendly. Sounds dumb, but it has to feel right. Regular keyboards are too packed together. I’m a big guy: I don’t want to squash my shoulders and arms like I do when I type on a laptop keyboard. The keyboard is actually two keyboards. One half of a keyboard for each hand. The right-hand side has a removable cable that plugs into the left-hand side, so you could conceptually get by with just one side, which is a nice touch. The left-hand side has the USB cable, also removable, to connect to your computer. Because it’s in two pieces, I can move each half of the keyboard around to better fit my posture. I like that feature a lot.</p>
<p>It’s also surprisingly small, which is not always a benefit, as I’m wide-shouldered with big hands, but it works for me. The portability was not what I was looking for, but it’s come in handy for traveling, as it comes with a soft case pouch. You can put it in carry-on luggage quite easily and take it with you. That’s proven more useful than I thought it would. I’ve flown with the Microsoft keyboards too many times to count, and they’re bulky by comparison.</p>
<p>Much like so many keyboards of its type, it comes with “thumb clusters”, a set of four keys that are meant to be reachable primarily with your thumbs. I have large hands, so that works for me, but the red buttons they have on there are a stretch, even for me, to press without shifting my wrist. You can pivot the thumb cluster up or down (or lay it flat against your desk) which is finicky as all hell, as you have to lock it in place and somehow try to keep it from wobbling.</p>
<p>One, ah, novelty of the Moonlander is what they call <em>tenting</em>. It’s a pole that you can use to tilt each half of the keyboard to attain – they <em>claim</em> – a more ‘ergonomic’ position for your hands. The problem is, when you’re pitching your ‘tent’ (stop snickering), locking it into position (you’ll need a hex key to fasten the bolts on the thumb clusters and poles) so that your keyboard does not wobble is challenging to say the least. It works much like a table in a restaurant: no matter what, it’s going to wobble a bit. Maybe not today, but perhaps tomorrow; or when you type a bit more forcefully; or when you put more weight on one part of the keyboard because you pressed a button a bit more forcefully.</p>
<p>It’s poorly designed. I don’t want to overtighten the bolts for fear of shearing something, and even if you do want to throw a bit more torque into it, you’re most likely going to push the cluster or tent pole out of position when you try, resulting in a wobbly keyboard. One frustration I ran into is that you cannot pivot the thumb cluster up, so it juts into the air, and also use the tent poles. That leaves the keyboard unbalanced and you cannot type on it.</p>
<p>The keyboard also has two optional hand rests that pivot so you can fold them underneath the keyboard for portability. They’re made of the same flimsy plastic that train station lavatory seats are made of. Worse, they have a few unfinished edges — not at all sharp enough to hurt you, but still sharp enough that you’re reminded of how little attention was lavished on this part of an otherwise really well-made keyboard. The rests are attached to a bar to let them pivot, but unfortunately the manufacturing tolerances aren’t great, so they wobble a bit when I shift the weight of my hands around, which is also not good. I wish it had a nice leatherette foam cushion like the Microsoft keyboards did, as the plastic is hard to the touch.</p>
<p>I got one of those automated emails after a few months asking for feedback, and I asked about the wobbly rests and unfinished edges; and how you can’t tilt the keyboard and also raise the keyboard cluster. I got a polite email back explaining that the wobble had to be there to facilitate movement and give, and that I could buy their tenting kit to fix the keyboard cluster problem. No answers were forthcoming on the unfinished edges. Make of that what you will.</p>
<p>The keyboard is backlit with RGB LEDs, which are a bit frou-frou, though useful if you want to use the firmware’s layering functionality to add multi-modality to keys. Being able to tell layers apart by looking at the keyboard colors work well. The keyboard uses the QMK firmware, a polished and feature rich free software firmware that’s been extended with Moonlander-specific features. Their firmware changes are public and available on Github.</p>
<p>The main advantage of Moonlander (really, the QMK firmware) is the ability to program your keys to do more than just one thing. Yes, you can do keyboard macros, but that is not even the most interesting thing. For instance, you can make a key – say your space key – act as the control modifier if you hold it down and type another key at the same time. You can make it behave like a Space Cadet keyboard: tap left shift and it inserts <code>(</code>; right, and it inserts <code>)</code>. You can designate a key to toggle a new keyboard layer, letting you type accented characters, control your media player with media keys, and more. There are dozens of features and you have complete control over what each key will do.</p>
<p>I ordered the keyboard with the recommended Cherry Brown MX switches – those are the key switches the plastic key caps sit atop of, and you can choose which ones you want when you buy, or even replace them yourself after the fact – and they, much like the key caps and the main body of the keyboard, are of high quality and feel good to type on. I have zero complaints about this part of the build quality, and the main body of the keyboard is well made and sturdy. I can tell they spent a lot of engineering effort on that.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of dubious health advice on ergonomics out there that feels unfounded and speculative. And proponents of mechanical keyboards say you need fewer keys than a regular keyboard, for <em>reasons</em>, and to instead use the fancy firmware features to make up for the things they’ve taken away from you, in effect forcing you to use the layer functionality present in the firmware. By and large the mechanical keyboard community is friendly, but more than a little fad-driven and with that spicy melange of broscience and earnest helpfulness.</p>
<p>This keyboard, like many of its kind, is not a “full-sized” keyboard. There are fewer keys. No F-keys by default, though they’re behind a layered key in the default configuration; the dedicated column of navigation (arrows, page up/down, etc.) keys are missing, though scattered about. There is no dedicated section of numpad keys, either. The keys are all <em>there</em>, but hidden behind several layers that you access from certain trigger keys that activate when you press one of them.</p>
<p>I’m ambivalent about losing out on all the keys, especially as, well, I’m an Emacs user. I’ve adapted, and it’s fine, and I like the current setup I have now, but that part will take some getting used to. It took me a long time to get back up to speed, and there are still key combos that I could tap out with lightning speed on my old keyboard that I still struggle to type as fast: <code>C-M--</code> (negative argument) followed by another key, such as <code>C-M-k</code>, is one such example.</p>
<p>I wish I had more keys, yet ironically I have empty keys I do not use at all on the keyboard. That sounds like a contradictory statement, but it’s hard to fill out all the keys when you’re confined to the keyboard layout that you have, which necessitates the use of layers, which in some ways (and that is the point) renders the need for more keys unnecessary. A vexing paradox for sure.</p>
<p>One thing I think ZSA has done exceptionally well is their custom software stack. They’ve built a wonderful, interactive browser-based keyboard designer that makes it a breeze to not only change and experiment with your keyboard layout, but also view others’ layouts as well. I like their hardware well enough – but it’s <em>just</em> a keyboard to me – but I think they’ve done an outstanding piece of work with the software. When I first got it, I had to download the compiled keyboard ROM and use their easy-to-use tool to flash the keyboard ROM.</p>
<p>No more: their layout builder asks for permission to talk to your keyboard directly using WebUSB in the browser and, if you accept, it’ll flash your keyboard’s firmware for you automatically. Very nice. If you use Chrome that is. If you’re using Firefox like I do, then you have to download the firmware and flash it the normal way because the lumpenproletariat who run the security division at Mozilla have decided that WebUSB is… ‘insecure.’</p>
<p>The layout builder, the web flashing and the ease of use of it all speaks volumes. Someone’s actively working on improving the user experience which is honestly poor, if you just use the QMK firmware directly. Yes, there are interactive keyboard builders for QMK directly, but if you run into trouble, or if you want to do something esoteric, you’re going to have to start reading the C source code and fiddle with it.</p>
<p>So. Is it a <em>good</em> keyboard? Yes. It would be a <em>great</em> keyboard if they’d tweak the issues I have around fit and finish of the hand rests, and make it easier to balance the keyboard. The main reason you should look into <em>a</em> mechanical (QMK-based!) keyboard is that it objectively improves your primary interface with your computer. The QMK firmware’s value-adds – and I have only scratched the surface – is 80% of it. If you have a crappy OEM keyboard or if you’re plinking away on a laptop — get a mechanical keyboard! Your wrists and fingers will thank you in the long run.</p>
<p>The Moonlander keyboard is a safe buy and, aside from the issues I mentioned, it <em>is</em> worth the $365. That’s a dollar a day for a year — small potatoes. And if you’re strapped for cash, try searching AliExpress for mechanical keyboards. The Chinese have taken to it with gusto, and you can buy or build your own for not much money and experiment.</p>
<p>I program in Emacs for a living, so being able to move my modifier keys to the thumbs is a big improvement, for no other reason that they’re <em>there</em> and underused on most regular keyboards. Being able to multi-task keys to do more than one thing is also a massive win, and another reason to consider a programmable keyboard.</p>
<p>Get a mechanical keyboard. Make sure it has QMK firmware. Maybe a Moonlander if you can spare the cash. Go.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://moondream.ai/blog/moondream-3-preview">https://moondream.ai/blog/moondream-3-preview</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45391444">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Model Release</p><p>September 18, 2025</p></div><div><h2>Moondream 3 Preview</h2>
<p>We're excited to announce a preview release of Moondream 3. It's a new architecture of 9B MoE, with 2B active params. Moondream now achieves frontier-level visual reasoning while still retaining blazingly fast and efficient inference.</p>
<p><strong>Why A New Architecture</strong><br>
<!-- -->The impact of AI today has largely been relegated to the digital realm. We have agents that can code, produce digital art, and so on - but very few cases of AI operating in our physical world. No robots to clean our houses, or act as receptionists, or inspect buildings, etc… For Moondream 3, we focused on 4 key areas.</p>
<p><strong>Visual reasoning:</strong> despite our focus on smaller models, we don't want that to come at the cost of capability. We want Moondream to be the most capable VLM at real-world tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Trainable:</strong> Many vision tasks require specialization. It's not enough for VLMs to be as good as humans. Even humans need training when it comes to complex tasks. Accurately interpreting an X-Ray image, or detecting struggling people in crowds. Moondream must be easily trainable.</p>
<p><strong>Fast:</strong> Vision AI applications often need near-realtime performance. Sorting produce, or detecting missing herd animals from a drone, or recognizing security incidents - none of these tasks can be built without fast vision inference.</p>
<p><strong>Inexpensive:</strong> Vision AI apps often deal with huge quantities of images, and cost can often be a blocker to adoption. Moondream must be cheap to run at scale.</p>
<p>Moondream 3 achieves these goals by adopting a 9B MoE model, yet still with 2B active parameters. This enables it to achieve, and in some cases beat, frontier-level models, yet still only require 2B active parameters (keeping it fast and inexpensive). We also improved its training dynamics, making Moondream 3 more efficient at learning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (more on that in subsequent announcements). For more details on the architecture, head to the "Tech Notes" below. One final detail however: we grew the context length from 2k to 32k, making Moondream much better at understanding and producing more complex queries and answers.</p>
<h2>Moondream 3 in action</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of Moondream 3.</p>
<h3>Object Detection</h3>
<p>Moondream 3 is astonishingly good at object detection. It goes beyond simple labels (.e.g., "car") and can understand more complex queries. We show results compared to frontier models alongside. These models don't support grounding skills like object detection and pointing natively, so we used a templated query for those (see footer).</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
<!-- -->Prompt: "Runner with purple socks"
<strong><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/runners.jpg" alt="Comparison of runner object detection"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong><br>
<!-- -->Prompt: "Quantity input"<br>
<strong><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/ui.jpg" alt="Comparison of UI object detection"></strong></p>
<h3>Pointing</h3>
<p>Moondream supports pointing as a native skill.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong><br>
<strong>Prompt:</strong> "Bottle"<br>
<strong><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/sprites.jpg" alt="A bunch or sprite bottles"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong><br>
<!-- -->Prompt: "Best utensil for pasta"<br>
<strong><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/pasta_spoon.jpg" alt="Kitchen utensils"></strong></p>
<h3>Structured output</h3>
<p>With a longer context length, Moondream 3 generates intelligent structured outputs with minimal prompting.</p>
<p><strong>Example 5: Sled dogs</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/sled_dogs.jpg" alt="Sled dogs">
<em>Prompt</em><br>
<!-- -->"A JSON array with keys: dog_id, fur_color, harness_color."</p>
<p><em>Result</em><br>
<!-- -->[<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 1, "fur_color": "light brown", "harness_color": "red" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 2, "fur_color": "dark brown", "harness_color": "red" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 3, "fur_color": "gray", "harness_color": "red" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 4, "fur_color": "white", "harness_color": "red" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 5, "fur_color": "dark brown", "harness_color": "green" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 6, "fur_color": "light brown", "harness_color": "green" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 7, "fur_color": "dark brown", "harness_color": "black" },<br>
<!-- -->{ "dog_id": 8, "fur_color": "white", "harness_color": "black" }<br>
<!-- -->]</p>
<h3>OCR</h3>
<p>Moondream 3 has drastically improved its OCR abilities. Our vision encoder can get tripped up on tiny fonts (working on it), but it's now useful in many real-world cases.</p>
<p><strong>Example 6</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/reactions.jpg" alt="Table of reactions">
<em>Prompt</em><br>
<!-- -->"Convert to markdown""</p>
<p><em>Result</em></p>
<p>| Metal | Reaction | Electrode Potential (V) |<br>
<!-- -->|---|---|---|<br>
<!-- -->| Gold | Au⁺ + e⁻ = Au | +1.692 |<br>
<!-- -->| Silver | Ag⁺ + e⁻ = Ag | +0.7996 |<br>
<!-- -->| Copper | Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Cu | +0.342 |<br>
<!-- -->| Iron | Fe³⁺ + 3e⁻ = Fe | -0.037 |<br>
<!-- -->| Lead | Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Pb | -0.126 |<br>
<!-- -->| Nickel | Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Ni | -0.257 |<br>
<!-- -->| Cadmium | Cd²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Cd | -0.403 |<br>
<!-- -->| Iron | Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Fe | -0.447 |<br>
<!-- -->| Zinc | Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Zn | -0.762 |<br>
<!-- -->| Aluminum | Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ = Al | -1.662 |</p>
<h2>Benchmarks</h2>
<p>Here are some early benchmark results. We show it alongside some top frontier models for comparison. In practice, however, it's probably not a fair comparison for Moondream since, in practical terms, Moondream produces answers in fraction of the time of these bigger models.  We'll publish more complete results later and include inference times to make this clearer.</p>
<p><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/benchmarks.jpg" alt="benchmarks"></p>
<ul>
<li>Scores with a "*" next to them indicate that we used a 100 random question sample rather than evaluate the whole benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MD3 Preview Technical Notes</h2>
<p>Here are some details on our new model architecture. Moondeam 3 is a fine-grained sparse mixture-of-experts model with 64 experts, of which 8 are activated for each token. We initialized it from Moondream 2 (a 2B dense model) using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drop upcycling</a>. We also extended the usable context length to 32K tokens, which is critical for few-shot prompting and agentic workflows with tool-use. We don’t fully leverage this longer context in our post-training yet (part of why it's only a preview release). The full 32k context is available for you if you're interested in fine-tuning the model.</p>
<p><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/reasoning.jpg" alt="">
(<strong>Figure: Long-context perplexity evaluation on GovReport dataset</strong>. Each point shows the average cross-entropy loss (nats per token) for a 128-token sliding window at that position, measured across 100 documents truncated to 32,768 tokens.)</p>
<p>We do not use a separate context-length extension phase during training, instead opting to interleave long-context samples while pretraining with a default context length of 4096 tokens. Many context length extension methods like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YaRN</a> include an attention temperature scaling component. Inspired by this, we adjust the architecture to enable learned temperature scaling as a function of position, and find this helps with long context modeling.</p>
<p>Like our last 2B release, this is a hybrid reasoning model that supports both reasoning and non-reasoning mode. Unlike other reasoning models, however, Moondream focuses on <em>visual</em> reasoning with grounding. Here’s an example of what that means:</p>
<p>Each chunk of underlined text in the reasoning is grounded, meaning the model references a particular part of the image. In our <a href="https://moondream.ai/c/playground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playground</a>, you can see what the model is focusing on by hovering over the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://moondream.ai/images/blog/moondream-3-preview/training_graph.jpg" alt="">
The model starts with only a small set of visual-reasoning examples, and gradually learns to rely on them more during our reinforcement learning (RL) post-training phase. RL proved so effective that, as we refined our training approach, post-training ended up using more compute than the initial pre-training itself.</p>
<p>It was trained with load-balancing and router orthogonality losses to help similar tokens specialize together early on, then had load balancing disabled in post-training to avoid catastrophic forgetting from distribution shift. Finally, attention tweaks like learnable temperature and LSE suppression sharpened focus and cut noise—boosting accuracy and clarity.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This preview release comes with some caveats. We haven't optimized the inference code yet, so inferences are much slower than anticipated (we're working on it!). We're also still actively training this model, and we expect the capabilities and benchmarks scores to improve. We also plan to produce variants of this model (e.g., quantized versions and distilled smaller versions).</p>
<p>The model is now available on the <a href="https://moondream.ai/playground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moondream playground</a>, and you can download it on <a href="https://huggingface.co/moondream/moondream3-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HuggingFace</a> (Moondream Station will be updated soon). Hit us up on our Discord if you have any questions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Insurance risk involves the sale of insurance policies to policyholders, the receipt of premium and the payment of claims. If claims &amp; associated expenses are less than premium received, an <b>Underwriting Profit</b> is made. If claims are greater than premium, an <b>Underwriting Loss</b> occurs. In essence, investing in insurance risk is like partnering with an insurer — you share in the results of the portfolio, keeping a slice of the underwriting profit if claims come in below premiums, or sustaining a loss if they come in above.</p><p><h2>Most Insurance Is Not Fully Collateralized</h2></p><p>This brings us to the concept of <b>collateralization</b>. An everyday example of collateral involves your mortgage. When you take out a loan from the bank to buy a house, you're putting up the house itself as collateral for the loan to secure it - meaning, if you fail to pay back the loan, the bank can foreclose and sell the house to cover the loan.</p><p>The key observation about insurance risk is the <b>possibility for insurers to pay out more money in claims than they take in via policy premiums</b>. When you purchase a policy from an insurance company, you’re implicitly trusting that the insurance company will be able to pay you out in the event of a claim, even if it means they’re operating at a loss. Insurance companies have <b>a balance sheet</b> (basically, an amount of assets or money) which <b>acts as collateral </b> against the chance that they must pay out more than they take in.</p><p>The amount of money held by the insurance company for this purpose is known as insurance <b>capital &amp; surplus</b>. Since this amount of capital is less than the total sum of all policy limits, we can say the policies are <b>partially collateralized</b>.</p><p><h3>Visualizing How Insurance Losses Are Distributed</h3></p><p>The chart below illustrates this concept with a probability distribution. The <span>blue curve</span> shows the likelihood of different loss levels. It peaks around 60-70% of premium but has a long tail extending to extreme scenarios.</p><p>The insurance company in this example <b>holds capital equal to 175% of premium collected</b>, giving them total resources of 275% of premium (100% premium + 175% capital) to pay claims in extreme years.</p><p>The <span>green dashed line</span> shows the <b>return on capital</b> from underwriting activities. When losses are less than premium collected (<span>green zone</span>), the insurer keeps the difference as profit. Once losses exceed the break-even point at 100%, the insurer must use their capital reserves to pay claims (<span>red zone</span>). Think of it like making an "investment" with the premium you collected, but getting such a negative return that <b>you have to reach into your wallet to cover the losses</b> (<span>red line</span>).</p><div><div><h4>Chart Legend:</h4><div><div><div><p><span><strong>Blue Curve:</strong> Probability of different loss levels</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Orange Line:</strong> Premium remaining (profit zone)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Red Line:</strong> Capital required (loss zone)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Green Line:</strong> Return on capital at loss level</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><strong>Green Zone:</strong> Profit (Loss &lt; Premium)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Red Zone:</strong> Loss (Loss &gt; Premium)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Purple Zone:</strong> Insolvency (Loss &gt; Capital)</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h3>Key Insight</h3><p>Notice how potential returns can fall well below -100%, meaning losses can exceed the original premium collected. In the purple <b>insolvency</b> zone beyond 275%, even the capital reserves are exhausted - this is why insurers need substantial capital cushions and why regulators closely monitor capital adequacy.</p></div></div><p><h2>Some Retail Investments Are Partially Collateralized</h2></p><p>Retail brokerages offer <b>margin accounts</b> to those customers that have sufficient assets to support it - much like the insurance company capital - and reserve the right to make a margin call if those trader’s reserves fall below minimum requirements. In extreme cases, it’s even possible for a trader to end up in a position where the brokerage could not sell collateral quickly enough and they’re left with a negative balance which must be filled with assets from elsewhere.</p><p>In the same way, <b>insurers must maintain capital to meet extreme claims</b>. Both systems rely on partial collateralization: enough to cover most outcomes, but not the absolute maximum.</p><p>Therein lies a critical implication: <b>The entire balance sheet of the insurance company is available and backing each individual policy</b>. This is similar to your margin account, as if your account balance (collateral) goes below zero, you'll have to pull from assets outside to cover the debt.</p><p>This is one of the fundamental reasons why regulators restrict retail investors from direct insurance risk investments. A strong knowledge base of how the risk works is needed to understand you're not just exposed to losing your investment, but other assets as well. For history buffs, I recommend reading  Andrew Duguld's <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3JSzzMk">On the Brink: How a Crisis Transformed Lloyd's of London</a><span>1</span>for a fascinating first-hand account of the <b>Names</b> at Lloyd's. These individuals once pledged their entire personal wealth to back insurance syndicates, sometimes with catastrophic consequences.</p><p><h2>Insurance Risk Investments For Retail Are Almost Always Fully Collateralized</h2></p><p>So what have we learned from this comparison? Three points stand out:</p><div><ol><li><span>1</span><span>Insurance risk is exposed to losses exceeding the premium received</span></li><li><span>2</span><span>Collateral needs to be set aside in case of these outsized losses to ensure trust in the insurance product</span></li><li><span>3</span><span>Outside (especially Retail) Investors would be best to limit their exposer to losses beyond their investment</span></li></ol></div><p>The challenge, then, is clear: <b>how can retail investors access insurance risk without facing the danger of unlimited losses</b>? The solution has been to design <b>fully collateralized structures</b> as vehicles that capture underwriting profits while capping potential losses at your invested amount. One of the most intuitive examples comes from adapting <b>reinsurance structures</b> into a format investors can access.</p><p><h2>Case Study: CAT Bonds</h2></p><p><b>Catastrophe Bonds</b>, or "CAT Bonds", are the most widely known form of investable insurance risk. If we ignore the insurance implications of it for a second, CAT Bonds are just like any other corporate bond: they are issued by a firm, pay a coupon, have a maturity date and have an associated risk of default (not being paid back principal).</p><p>The difference here is the risk of default of a <b>CAT bond is tied in someway to insurance losses</b>. If a qualifying insurance event happens, the principal is kept by the insurance company to pay those claims, effectively defaulting the bond. They are referred to as "Catastrophe" bonds simply because they are <b>most often tied to large, catastrophic events</b> such as Hurricanes, Earthquakes, or even Cyber events.</p><p>CAT Bonds can be thought of as <b>an insurance policy bought by the insurance company itself</b>. They are, in fact, usually a compliment to the insurance company's full reinsurance program. Here, however, the insurance company isn't buying a policy from another insurance company, but rather <b>outside capital markets on a fully collateralized basis</b>.</p><p>Let's form our own very basic CAT bond. We're <b>Risksure - a Florida based insurance company </b> - and we write a lot of homeowners policies in the sunshine state. We'd like to take out the following CAT bond:</p><div><ul><h6>CAT Bond: Gator Re Ltd. 🐊</h6><li><span><strong>Sponsor<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Risksure Re</span></li><li><span><strong>Bond Size (Limit)<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->$100M</span></li><li><span><strong>Attachment Point (Deductible)<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->$500M (Risksure covers the first $500M of losses)</span></li><li><span><strong>Issuance Date<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Jan 1, 2026</span></li><li><span><strong>Maturity Date<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Dec 31, 2026</span></li><li><span><strong>Coupon (Premium)<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->9% annually, rate paid quarterly on current collateral balance</span></li><li><span><strong>Terms<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->If a hurricane strikes Florida in 2026 and Risksure’s losses exceed $500M, investors’ principal is used to cover those excess losses, up to $100M. This is known as a <b>per occurrence limit</b>.</span></li></ul></div><p>To issue this Bond, Risksure Re would collect $100M of principal from outside investors, thus <b>fully collateralizing the insurance risk</b>. In return, Risksure Re would pay $9M of premium for the bond, and should no hurricane event occur, pay back the $100M of principal at maturity.</p><p>This type of structure is common in reinsurance and known as an <b>excess of loss structure</b>. The <i>layer</i> of coverage can be visualized as follows:</p><div><h3>How It Works</h3><p>If a Category 3+ hurricane causes Risksure's losses to exceed $500M, the CAT bond investors' $100M principal is used to cover losses between $500M-$600M. Investors receive a 9% coupon ($9M annually) for taking this risk.</p></div><p><h2>Investment Returns for Gator Re Ltd. 🐊</h2></p><p>There are two components of return for the investors in our CAT Bond:</p><div><ul><li><span><strong>Risk Return<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Compensation for taking on the insurance risk, paid for by the 9% coupon</span></li><li><span><strong>Risk Free Return<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Compensation for tying up capital, in the form of interest income on the collateral sitting in the bank, say by investing it in 4% T-bonds.</span></li></ul></div><p>It's clear that we this structure, the investors are taking on insurance risk exposure. However, in this case, the <b>"buyer" of the insurance policy</b> (the insurance company itself) does not need to worry that the <b>insurer</b> (the outside investors) will not be able pay claims if the large event happens, because the <b>entire value of the policy limit</b> ($100M limit) is set aside and can't be touched.</p><p>We can now examine and visualize a few potential outcomes for the buyers of the CAT bond:</p><div><ul><li><span><strong>No Hurricane<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- --> Capital providers get back $9M Risk Income + $4M Risk-free Income = $13M along with their original $100M of investment, <b>a 13% return.</b></span></li><li><span><strong>A Partial Loss<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- --> Risksure suffers $525M of loss from a covered hurricane. Risksure pays the first $500M. They then use $25M of the paid in capital from the CAT bond to pay for the remaining claims. Assuming mid-year trigger, capital providers will receive back the remaining $75M, plus the $7.78M Risk Income (two coupons paid plus two partial coupons), plus reduced RF income due to the used capital, $3.5M, for a total of $86.28M. <b>This is a negative 13.72% return.</b></span></li><li><span><strong>A Full Loss<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->A massive hurricane hits Florida and Risksure pays out $1B in losses, far above the exhaustion point of $600M for this CAT bond. The entirety of the $100M principle and risk free income goes towards paying Risksure's policyholder claims. Investors received $4.5M in coupons before trigger and no principle, <b>for a loss of 95.5%.</b></span></li></ul></div><p>Keen observers will notice that we've <b>successfully transformed the insurance risk</b> into a <b>limited liability product</b> - you can no longer owe additional capital beyond your original investment. However, it's clear that investing in insurance risk in this manner should be treated as a compliment to other investment strategies. Bear markets for equities might return -30% to -50%, but crucially, they retain the potential to recover those losses over time. CAT bonds offer no such recovery potential - once triggered, that capital is permanently lost. That said, the <b>stated probability of default for these bonds is typically 1-3%</b>, meaning the 5-9% excess returns above risk-free rates are designed to compensate for this low-probability but high-severity risk.</p><p><h2>A Final Note: Why Isn't Insurance Fully Collateralized?</h2></p><p>A natural question arises through this analysis: <b>why aren't insurance companies forced to hold enough money to cover all potential loss scenarios</b>? The short answer is <b>efficiency</b>. The less capital you have to hold, the larger your returns on capital will be. This can be illustrated with simple math. Say you hold $10M in capital and expect a profit of $500K on underwriting business. Expected return is $500K/$10M = 5%. But let's say now you only have to hold $5M in capital - your return on capital has now jumped to $500K/$5M = 10%. By holding fully collateralized layers, <b>CAT bonds are trading capital efficiency for payment certainty.</b></p><p>Referring back to the chart at the beginning of the article, those extremely remote loss scenarios have exceedingly low likelihood of happening for a sufficiently large and diverse insurance company. Each insurance company has a team of actuaries and risk modelers dedicated to ensuring the ongoing solvency of the company. Regulators setup frameworks to validate and set guidelines for the amount of capital a company needs to hold. With all that said, <b>insurance companies can and do fail</b>, at which point regulators can swoop in to protect policyholders.</p><p>This is why under collateralized insurance "works" - there are many checks and balances along the way to align incentives. It's also why giving outside investors access to insurance risk is such a challenge; with out those protections in place, guardrails (such as full collateralization) have to be setup such that insurance policies can be sure their claims will be paid.</p></article></div>]]></description>

+1, and let me augment this by (partially) quoting something that I wrote
a few years ago about mail and mailing lists.

Why use mailing lists?
----------------------

Mailing lists, which were sometimes called "reflectors" in their early
days, are one of the older pieces of Internet technology. Despite that,
they're still heavily used [...]

That's not an accident.  It's because mailing lists have enormous technical
advantages over the alternatives.   Here are some of those:

1. Mailing lists require no special software: anyone with a sensible
mail client can participate.   Thus they allow you to use *your* software
with the user interface of *your* choosing rather than being compelled
to learn 687 different web forums with 687 different user interfaces,
all of which range from "merely bad" to "hideously bad".

2. Mailing lists are simple: learn a few basic rules of netiquette and
a couple of Internet-wide conventions, and one's good to go.  Web forums
are complicated because all of them are different.  In other words,
participating in 20 different mailing lists is just about as easy as
participating in one; but participating in 20 different web forums is
really quite onerous.

3. They impose minimal security risk.

4. They impose minimal privacy risk.

Points 3 and 4 stand in stark contrast to the security and privacy risks
imposed on users of web forums and "social" media, especially the latter.

5. Mailing lists are bandwidth-friendly -- an increasing concern for
people on mobile devices and thus on expensive data plans.  Web forums
are bandwidth-hungry.

6. Mailing lists interoperate.  I can easily forward a message from one
list to another one.  Or to a person.  I can send a message to multiple
lists.   I can forward a message from a person to this list.  And so
on.  Try doing this with web forum software A on host B with destinations
web forum software C and D on hosts E and F.  Good luck with that.

7. They're asynchronous: you don't have to interact in real time.  You
can download messages when connected to the Internet, then read them
and compose responses when offline.

8. As a result of 7, They work reasonably well even in the presence
of multiple outages and severe congestion.  Messages may be delayed,
but once everything's up again, they'll go through.  Web-based forums
simply don't work at all.

9. They're push, not pull, so new content just shows up.  Web forums
require that you go fishing for it.

10. They scale beautifully.

11. (When properly run) they're relatively free of abuse vectors.  Mailing
lists are highly resistant to abuse and attacks.  Web forums, because of
their complexity, are highly vulnerable to software security issues as
well as spam/phishing and other attacks.

12. They handle threading well.  And provided users take a few seconds
to edit properly, they handle quoting well.  This is essential for anyone
trying to follow a discussion.

13. They're portable: lists can be rehosted (different domain, different
host) rather easily.

14. They can be freely interconverted -- that is, you can move a list
hosted by A using software B on operating system C to host X using
software Y on operating system Z.  If you can do this at all with web
forums, and you usually can't, it's really, really difficult.

15. They can be written to media and read from it.  This is a VERY
non-trivial task with web forums, and that's putting it mildly.

16. The computing resources require to support them are minimal -- CPU,
memory, disk, bandwidth, etc.

17. Mailing lists can be uni- or bidirectionally gatewayed to Usenet. (The
main Python language mailing list is an example of this.) They can also
be gatewayed to web sites or to RSS feeds.  All of these can be highly
useful, because they provide alternative ways for people to receive the
same content.

18. They're easily archivable in a format (Unix "mbox" format) that is
simple and likely to be readable long into the future.  Mail archives
from 10, 20, even 30 or more years ago are still completely usable.  And
they take up very little space: I have hundreds of millions of mailing
list messages archived, and the entire collection would fit on a USB
stick.  [...]

19. You can archive them locally...

20. ...which means you can search them locally with the software of *your*
choice.  Including when you're offline.  And provided you make backups,
you'll always have an archive -- even if the original goes away.  Web
forums don't facilitate this.  [...]

It has been slightly edited for clarity and to avoid identifying information.</em></p><p><code>I just read your article on lasers and questions people emailed to you, all were very interesting.</code></p><p><code>In reading these it appeared to me most of these questions were based on Directed Energy Weapons - DEW (Microwave) rather than the laser beams per se. (i.e., laser beam in a pilots eyes).</code></p><p><code>I strongly disagree with you on the Cuban episode. First of all, I found your answer very naive, and I'm not trying to be mean, its just that you haven't done your homework on how those hell bent on hurting others obtain these military weapons! It's called Black Market, the Mexican Cartel (Sinanola or El Chapo) drug organization buy these DEW by the truck load from (hate to say this) crooked defense companies.</code></p><p><code>In turn these military weapons are given out like Hershey bars to Stalkers (MS-13) the large white van pulls up and delivers them right in your neighborhood purchased by the Cartel. Its big business. I'm assuming the Cuban government more than likely purchased these DEW weapons to threaten and hurt the Americans working in Cuba. </code></p><p><code>I keep reminding those that don't understand this Mexican Cartel they are extremely organized and extremely rich! They can and do buy anyone and anything! Most people don't even realize they have several submarines. This theory that everyone can get sick if enough people say they're sick, and blah blah blah, is just that, a theory. We're talking about the real world here. Unfortunately, it's the dark side, the hidden side that most don't even realize is out there.</code></p><p><code>So when these Americans complained about being hit and knocked down, believe them! My advice is do some studying on this weapon, yes its covert, silent and does shoot right thru walls,, it can hurt you and even kill you. Think of yourself as a potato, and what does it do if microwaved. My suggestion is get the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bomb-Americas-Directed-Energy-Weapons/dp/B000VY9B1Y">The E-Bomb: How America's New Directed Energy Weapons Will Change the Way Future Wars Will Be Fought</a>. Unfortunately, you will NOT find any book in the library on this cartel, why? They're either stolen or lost.</code></p><p><code>You would not believe how many American citizens are now employed by this Mexican Cartel living right here in the good ole USA, and they ALL have this DEW weapon!</code></p><p><code>I would like to ask you if anything has been made to be able to catch a laser beam in motion and have it returned to the bad guy? I do not mean 'take' it to the bad guy (like a missile) I'm thinking perhaps a 'mirror-like' device.</code></p><p><code>[Name withheld; former employee at a defense contractor working on microwave devices]</code></p><p><strong>Our response:</strong></p><p>Thank you for your letter. </p><p>I haven't done a lot of homework on DEWs since my main interest is in visible lasers. I get calls about once every month or two from people who have experienced heat or light that I cannot explain. That's why my webpage includes links to other directed energy information sources.</p><p>I will say I'm not sure why Mexican cartels or human traffickers would target the people I hear from. They seem like normal people in residential neighborhoods. If the cartels wanted them gone, they certainly have other, much worse ways to do this.</p><p>I just downloaded the E-Bomb book in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bomb-Americas-Directed-Energy-Weapons-ebook/dp/B001VNC9EU/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Kindle format</a>. I will read it soon.</p><p>About your letter... I do want to bring forth other views. Would it be OK if I printed all or parts of it on the "If you are harassed by lasers" webpage at LaserPointerSafety.com? Without your name or identifying information, of course.</p><p>Finally, for visible lasers, you could use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector">retroreflector</a> to return the light to the source. The beam may be degraded enough that if it could cause heat at the retroreflector, the returned beam (having gone twice as far and having bounced off possibly dirty or dusty surfaces) would be weaker and thus not able to harm anyone at the source area.</p><p>At a minimum, you would need a high-quality, industrial or research quality corner cube retroreflector like <a href="https://www.newport.com/c/retroreflectors">these</a>. An inexpensive "cat's eye" bicycle retroreflector or similar would cause a bright glow to be seen at the source, but would not cause a coherent beam to be reflected back.</p><p><strong>The original author's response:</strong></p><p><code>Thanks for getting back to me so quickly, it's appreciated.</code></p><p><code>Yes, you can use what I wrote if it helps the targets. To help you to understand why good people end up targets is because more than likely they have interfered with something the Cartel is doing, like selling drugs, or human trafficking, they might have alerted the police, or see something say something. It could even be someone hired stalkers to hurt you because of some vendetta, or just pure revenge! </code></p><p><code>They could/can kill you. But, in most cases they just want to provoke you or harass you while hurting you with this DEW weapon. It's called a 'slow cooker' for a reason. It's nothing but pure evil.</code></p><p><code>I would like to see this hand held DEW put out of business and the defense companies fined big time for selling it, especially to the Cartels but, I'm reading where Directed Energy is being used even more than ever by other countries within the military sector. Lasers as well. I'm not against high technology but I am against something like this getting into the wrong hands.</code></p></div></div>]]></description>

									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p><span>When Bruce Lee met Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a month after the 1968 national college basketball championship, he was still known as Lew Alcindor, the most hyped young basketball star in history.</span></p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p><span>Lew was seven feet two and, for his whole life, had been unable to hide. He disarmed reporters with a fierce intelligence masked by a laconic intensity. He was just completing his junior year at UCLA, and after indulging in two years of partying, drugs, and women, he wanted something different. “All sophomore and junior years I’d been looking for something to believe in,” he would later write.</span></p>
<p><span>During those two years, he had been in the eye of the storm. In the “Game of the Century,” witnessed by fifty-two thousand in the Houston Astrodome and millions more on television on January 20, 1968, he brought men’s college basketball to new heights. That night he played with blurred vision after having his cornea scratched. UCLA lost by a basket to the University of Houston, breaking their forty-seven- game winning streak, and the team melted down in its aftermath. Lew’s closest friend, a Black man from South Central Los Angeles, quit the team in a dispute with coach John Wooden, and racial tensions simmered in the locker room the rest of the season.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To him, Bruce was as effective a teacher as John Wooden. Both were focused on fundamentals, preparation, and what worked.</span></span></p>
<p><span>By the end of the season, Lew had led UCLA to its second consecutive national championship and was voted Most Outstanding Player for the second year in a row. It was the year that began the “March Madness” era. But after the season, he retreated.</span></p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p><span>Born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor in 1947, the day after Jackie Robinson desegregated pro sports, he had grown up in an integrated housing project in uptown Manhattan. In third grade he stared at a Polaroid of his class: “There I was, freakishly towering over all the other kids, with skin much darker than everyone else’s.” When he was twelve, his white friends abandoned him. His former best friend picked a fight with him one day, calling him a “jungle bunny” and “big jungle n——r.”</span></p>
<p><span>At seventeen, Lew stepped out of the subway in Harlem and was caught in the first hours of six days of rioting that followed the police shooting of a Black teen. As bottles and bullets whizzed by and buildings went up in flames, he ran home. “Right then and there I knew who I was and who I was going to be. I was going to be Black rage personified, Black power in the flesh,” he later wrote. He led his </span><span>team to a 79-2 record and two national high school championships. But once, to motivate him in a game, his coach had called him a “n——r,” and he never forgot it.</span></p>
<p><span>In his sophomore year at UCLA, in 1967, he was traveling with extra security because of death threats. He took comfort in listening to hard bop and reading about African and Asian history and religion. He was particularly captivated by </span><i><span>The Autobiography of Malcolm X </span></i><span>and the late Black leader’s journey into Sunni Islam, and sought out young Black Muslims in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span>That summer he was the only college athlete among a group of prominent Black athletes invited by Jim Brown to meet with Muhammad Ali to try to change the boxer’s mind about his anti-war stance. Ali had asked, “Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?” After declaring, “I don’t have no personal quarrel with those Vietcong,” he saw his heavyweight boxing title revoked, and faced a prison sentence for draft evasion. The men spent hours grilling Ali on his position, then emerged to face the press. Alcindor sat beside Brown, Ali, and Bill Russell as the athletes joined together in a historic show of solidarity for Ali.</span></p>
<p><span>Invited to a Black Youth conference by a young San Jose State College professor named Harry Edwards, who was organizing a Black athletes’ boycott of the 1968 Olympics, Alcindor spoke with conviction:</span></p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p><span>I’m the big basketball star, the weekend hero, everybody’s All American. Well, I was almost killed by a racist cop shooting at a black cat in Harlem. He was shooting on the street—where masses of people were standing around or just taking a walk. But he didn’t care. After all we were just n——rs. I found out that we don’t catch hell because we aren’t basketball stars or because we don’t have money. We catch hell because we are black. Somewhere each of us has got to make a stand against this kind of thing.</span></p>
<p><span>But in the media, an explosion of racist invective followed him and other Black athletes as they were accused by white writers of being ungrateful, unpatriotic, uppity “Black Hitlers.”</span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p><span>Weeks after the 1967 championship, the NCAA banned the dunk—in what became known as the “Alcindor rule”—an effort he believed was racist. Forced to improvise, he contemplated how to deal with triple-team defenses and worked on a new offensive weapon: the skyhook. One night after watching a Zatoichi flick, he was struck by the idea that the blind swordsman’s grace, control, and precision might </span><span>be exactly what he needed. Instead of brute force, he thought, I will slide and roll and slip by them without fouling. In New York City, Alcindor started training in </span><i><span>aikido</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“A victory [in martial arts] is your mind over someone else’s mind, as much as, if not more than, a simple physical mastery,” he later wrote. “The discipline also becomes a means of staying in shape mentally and keeping your entire inner self trained.”</span></p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p><span>That fall Alcindor visited the </span><i><span>Black Belt </span></i><span>offices to meet a fellow </span><i><span>aikido </span></i><span>adept, Mito Uyehara, and ask him if he knew someone with whom he could continue his martial arts training. Alcindor had become especially curious about </span><i><span>tai chi</span></i><span>. “This guy Bruce Lee—he’s really good at it,” Mito told him. “He knows more about those things than I do.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Who’s Bruce Lee?” Alcindor asked. “He was Kato in </span><i><span>The Green Hornet</span></i><span>.”</span></p>
<p><span>Alcindor was skeptical he could learn anything from an actor. “No, no! He’s the real deal.”</span></p>
<p><span>That night Mito drove to see Bruce and said he was sending Lew Alcindor over. “Who’s Lew Alcindor?” Bruce asked.</span></p>
<p><span>Mito explained that he was the tallest and most famous college basketball player in the country.</span></p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p><span>“I don’t watch basketball.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bruce asked Linda to bring a tape measure, stood on a chair, and dropped it down, to visualize Alcindor’s height. Then he thought aloud, “I wonder how fast he is.” Mito assured Bruce he was very fast, one of the best athletes in the world.</span></p>
<p><span>“He would have no chance with me,” Bruce said with a chuckle. “I would break his legs before he could do anything else.”</span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p><span>They met for the first time at Bruce and Linda’s house on a comfortable Los Angeles afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span>“He greeted me with a broad smile and friendly demeanor and right away I knew this was not a scowling teacher from Japanese films demanding bowing obedience,” Alcindor recalled. “We talked UCLA basketball for a while and then got down to business.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bruce first had Lew punch and kick the heavy bag, so he could gauge the big man’s power. Then he called Linda over, asked Lew to hold a pad to his chest, and told Linda to kick it. Linda grinned and got up from the patio seat where she had been watching.</span></p>
<p><span>“Bruce, I don’t think this will work,” Alcindor said. “I’m two feet taller and a hundred pounds heavier than Linda.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Just hold it up to your chest, Lew,” Linda said.</span></p>
<p><span>He lowered the pad so that it would be below her head.</span></p>
<p><span>“Your chest,” Linda said, frowning and pointing at the pad. “Do you want Bruce to show you where that is?”</span></p>
<p><span>He moved the pad up. Bruce nodded at Linda. Kareem would never forget what happened next.</span></p>
<p><span>“Suddenly Linda fired off a kick that not only reached the pad, but the impact rocked me backward a few feet, readjusted my spine, and possibly rearranged the order of my teeth,” he remembered. “They stood there smiling at the shocked expression on my face.”</span></p>
<p><span>Linda—Bruce’s longest-running student except for Taky—had just done what Bill Walton, Happy Hairston, Kent Benson, and Robert Parish never would.</span></p>
<p><span>“Okay,” Alcindor said, still sore where she had kicked him. “Teach me that.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bruce was just as intrigued. Not long afterward, he told Leo Fong, “You know why I’m getting him to train with me? I want to learn how to beat a tall guy!”</span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p><span>“Big Lew,” as Bruce called him, came to his backyard every Tuesday during the off-season, and sometimes Thursdays as well. Bruce taught him Jeet Kune Do footwork, the </span><i><span>mook jong </span></i><span>dummy, and punches and kicks on the bag. At first, Bruce told Mito that Big Lew was slow, his arms were weak, and he wasn’t good at </span><i><span>chi sao</span></i><span>. A reporter who witnessed one of their workouts was more impressed with Bruce than Big Lew. He wrote that Bruce could “leap and kick over Alcindor’s head, and says he can defeat him by taking advantage of his shin and thigh with a kick.”</span></p>
<p><span>But Bruce soon realized all that was irrelevant. Even if he could get inside Big Lew’s reach, it wasn’t easy. And with his front kick, Big Lew could rattle the rim of the basket. Bruce’s Wing Chun skills were all but useless. He joked with Doug Palmer, “Try doing </span><i><span>chi sao </span></i><span>with someone when you’re staring at his belly button.” Bruce called Taky and told him not to focus on </span><i><span>chi sao </span></i><span>in the school anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>“Bruce and I sparred regularly,” Kareem remembered. “But we didn’t compete; I was like a drawing board on which he could work out his theories and he was instructing me how to deal with people and attack him.”</span></p>
<p><span>Kareem came to appreciate Bruce’s approach. “Nothing was for art’s sake. Everything he taught was to achieve an end in doing damage to an opponent,” he recalled. “After studying for a little while, you learn a lot about how easy it is to hurt someone, and how easily you can get hurt. That makes you really respect what you’re involved in. With violence, you learn to respect it and see how easily you can become victimized by it.”</span></p>
<p><span>To him, Bruce was as effective a teacher as John Wooden. Both were focused on fundamentals, preparation, and what worked. “Bruce used to say, ‘I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one </span><span>kick 10,000 times.’ In sports, we call this concept ‘muscle memory,’” he said. “For me, my hook shot was the one kick practiced 10,000 times.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bruce helped the young athlete understand his movements in a way that seemed to decelerate time. “Bruce showed me how to harness some of what was raging inside me and summon it completely at my will. The Chinese call it </span><i><span>chi</span></i><span>; the Japanese, </span><i><span>ki</span></i><span>; the Indians, </span><i><span>prana</span></i><span>—it is the life force,” he said. “I was quite amazed to find, after working with Bruce, that when I really had my presence of mind, when I did control my life force, that’s what I saw, things coming at me in slow motion with plenty of time to get out of the way.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Bruce helped the young athlete understand his movements in a way that seemed to decelerate time.</span></span></p>
<p><span>“It sounded mystical when he first told me, but I was becoming increasingly involved in matters of faith, and besides, Bruce grounded his philosophies in a good fight, which I could relate to.”</span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p><span>These sessions were a refuge from the media, who were painting Lew Alcindor as a coddled, ungrateful, unpatriotic athlete. In July 1968 he had agreed to an interview on the </span><i><span>Today </span></i><span>show to highlight the summer program for Black youths where he was working. But sports announcer Joe Garagiola ambushed him, asking Alcindor why he had declined to play in the Olympics. “You live here,” Garagiola said.</span></p>
<p><span>“Yeah, I live here, but it’s not really my country,” Alcindor answered. “Well then, there’s only one solution: maybe you should move.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Well, you see,” Alcindor responded, heating up, “that would be fine with me, you know, it all depends on where we are going to move?”</span></p>
<p><span>The producers cut away to a commercial.</span></p>
<p><span>“I felt no part of the country and had no desire to help it look good,” he later recalled. “I had better things to do.”</span></p>
<p><span>That summer he joined a mosque, declared </span><i><span>shahada</span></i><span>, became a Sunni Muslim, and received a new name: Abdul-Kareem, later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, “noble, generous servant, powerful spirit.” He kept his name to himself and his closest friends until he asked the media two years later to call him by it. He recalled, “I was still Lew to almost everybody, as if I knew them but they didn’t know me….</span></p>
<p><span>“The heat I’d taken about the Olympics, and the absolute unwillingness I’d found in the press, and by extension the general public, to accept what to me seemed so obvious—that the country was run by white people for white people, and that even the most powerful Black men were still operating at a handicap—made me suspicious of strangers and even more jealous of my privacy.”</span></p>
<p><span>But with Bruce, everything was easy. The two talked philosophy and religion. They went to see </span><i><span>Zatoichi </span></i><span>flicks. Kareem even babysat sometimes, lifting Brandon up to give the five-year-old a view of the roof. They shared an understanding of fame and privacy. From youth, both of them had been under the spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span>In Chinatown they never paid for meals—everyone was a UCLA fan—and they </span><span>often ate in the kitchen. Bruce joked to their companions that it would guarantee they weren’t getting the garbage served to the </span><i><span>gweilo</span></i><span>. But Bruce was also shielding the big man from the rabid autograph seekers.</span></p>
<p><span>“Bruce and I had something else in common,” Kareem recalled. “We both had experienced discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span>Kareem talked about the Black liberation movement and his role in what Harry Edwards had come to call “the revolt of the Black athlete.” Bruce shared his frustrations with Hollywood, saying he sometimes felt like a “valet to the stars.” They swapped books. Bruce gave Kareem Miyamoto Musashi’s </span><i><span>Book of Five Rings</span></i><span>. Kareem gave him books to read on Islam and imperialism. He told a shocked Bruce that Europeans had barred Chinese from parks in their own cities.</span></p>
<p><span>“I recommended certain books about the British occupation of China,” Kareem said. “He didn’t know anything about that, and he’d gone to school in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer">https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45389464">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>A</strong>mong the hundreds of species of bacteria and fungi that live in people’s mouths, 27 have been collectively tied to a 3.5 times greater risk of developing <a href="https://nyulangone.org/conditions/pancreatic-cancer" target="_blank">pancreatic cancer</a>, a study led by NYU Langone Health and its <a href="https://nyulangone.org/locations/perlmutter-cancer-center" target="_blank">Perlmutter Cancer Center</a> shows.</p>

<p>Experts have long observed that those with poor oral health are more vulnerable to pancreatic cancer than those with healthier mouths. More recently, scientists have uncovered a mechanism that could help explain this connection, finding that bacteria can travel through swallowed saliva into the pancreas, an organ that helps with digestion. However, precisely which species may contribute to the condition had until now remained unclear.</p>

<p><a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3377" target="_blank">Published online September 18 in <em>JAMA Oncology</em></a>, the new analysis assessed the genetic makeup of microbes collected from the saliva of 122,000 healthy men and women.</p>

<p>“Our findings provide new insight into the relationship between the oral microbiome and pancreatic cancer,” said study lead author Yixuan Meng, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank">Department of Population Health</a> at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.</p>

<p>The oral microbiome, the diverse community of bacteria and fungi that inhabit the mouth, is increasingly being studied for its potential role in human health.</p>

<p>Last year, the same team of scientists uncovered a link between certain oral bacteria and a heightened risk of developing <a href="https://nyulangone.org/conditions/head-neck-cancer" target="_blank">head and neck squamous cell carcinoma</a>, a group of cancers that arise in the mouth and throat. The researchers had also conducted a small study in 2016 that tied microbes living in the mouth to pancreatic cancer, but could not identify precise bacterial species.</p>

<p>Their latest report is the largest and most detailed analysis of its kind to date, says Dr. Meng. It is also the first to show that oral fungi—namely a type of yeast in the genus <em>Candida </em>that naturally lives on the skin and throughout the body—may play a role in pancreatic cancer. The researchers also identified these oral <em>Candida </em>species in patients’ pancreatic tumors.</p>

<p>For the study, the team assessed data from two ongoing investigations tracking Americans from across the country to better understand how diet, lifestyle, medical history, and many other factors are involved in cancer. The data were gathered for the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.</p>

<p>Shortly after enrolling, participants rinsed with mouthwash, providing saliva samples that preserved the numbers and species of microbes for testing. Researchers then followed up for roughly nine years on average to record any presence of tumors.</p>

<p>In the current study, the investigators analyzed bacterial and fungal DNA from the spit samples. Then, they identified 445 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and compared the DNA of their microbes with that of another 445 randomly selected study subjects who had remained cancer-free. The team made sure to account for factors known to play a role in developing the condition, such as age, race, and how often subjects smoked cigarettes.</p>

<p>The findings identified 24 species of bacteria and fungi that individually either raised or lowered pancreatic cancer risk. Another three kinds of bacteria tied to the cancer were already known to contribute to periodontal disease, a serious gum infection that can eat away at the jawbone and the soft tissues surrounding teeth.</p>

<p>Altogether, the entire group of microbes boosted participants’ chances of developing the cancer by more than threefold.</p>

<p>In addition, by assessing the makeup of each participant’s oral microbiome, the scientists for the first time developed a tool that could estimate their cancer risk.</p>

<p>“By profiling bacterial and fungal populations in the mouth, oncologists may be able to flag those most in need of pancreatic cancer screening,” said study co-senior author <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/jiyoung-ahn" target="_blank">Jiyoung Ahn, PhD</a>, a professor in the Departments of Population Health and <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/medicine/" target="_blank">Medicine </a>at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.</p>

<p>Dr. Ahn, who is also the associate director for population sciences at Perlmutter Cancer Center, notes that there are currently few effective screening methods for the disease, which is among the deadliest forms of cancer.</p>

<p>“It is clearer than ever that brushing and flossing your teeth may not only help prevent periodontal disease but may also protect against cancer,” said study co-senior author <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/richard-b-hayes" target="_blank">Richard Hayes, DDS, MPH, PhD</a>, a professor in the Department of Population Health.</p>

<p>Dr. Hayes, who is also a member of Perlmutter Cancer Center, emphasizes that the study was designed to identify correlations between disease risk and certain microbes in the mouth, but not to establish a direct cause-and-effect link. That will require further investigation.</p>

<p>The research team next plans to explore whether oral viruses could contribute to cancer and how the mouth’s microbiome may affect patients’ chances of survival, adds Hayes.</p>

<p>Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants P30CA016087, P20CA252728, R01LM014085, R01CA159036, and U01CA250186.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Auth.js, formerly known as NextAuth.js, is now being maintained and overseen by Better Auth team</p><article><p>We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://authjs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auth.js</a>, formerly known as NextAuth.js, is now being maintained and overseen by Better Auth team. If you haven't heard of Auth.js, it has long been one of the most widely used open source authentication libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. Chances are, if you’ve used <a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://labs.google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Labs</a>, <a href="https://cal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cal.com</a> or a million other websites, you’ve already interacted with Auth.js.</p>
<h2 id="back-story-about-better-auth-and-authjs"><a data-card="" href="#back-story-about-better-auth-and-authjs">Back Story about Better Auth and Auth.js</a><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-label="Link to section"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></h2>
<p>Before Better Auth, Auth.js gave developers like us the ability to own our auth without spending months wrestling with OAuth integrations or session management. But as applications became more complex and authentication needs evolved, some of its limitations became harder to ignore. We found ourselves rebuilding the same primitives over and over.</p>
<p>The Auth.js team recognized these challenges and had big ideas for the future, but for various reasons couldn’t execute them as fully as they hoped.</p>
<p>That shared frustration and the vision of empowering everyone to truly own their auth started the creation of Better Auth. Since our goals aligned with the Auth.js team, we were excited to help maintain Auth.js and make auth better across the web. As we talked more, we realized that Better Auth was the best home for Auth.js.</p>

<p>We recognize how important this project is for countless applications, companies, and developers. If you’re using Auth.js/NextAuth.js today, you can continue doing so without disruption—we’ll keep addressing security patches and urgent issues as they come up.</p>
<p>But we strongly recommend new projects to start with Better Auth unless there are some very specific feature gaps (most notably stateless session management without a database). Our roadmap includes bringing those capabilities into Better Auth, so the ecosystem can converge rather than fragment.</p>
<div><p>For teams considering migration, we’ve prepared a <a href="https://www.better-auth.com/docs/guides/next-auth-migration-guide">guide</a> and we’ll be adding more guides and documentation soon.</p></div>

<p>We are deeply grateful to the Auth.js community who have carried the project to this point. In particular, the core maintainers-<a href="https://x.com/balazsorban44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balázs</a>, who served as lead maintainer, <a href="https://x.com/thanghvu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thang Vu</a>,<a href="https://ndo.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nico Domino</a>, Lluis Agusti and <a href="https://github.com/falcowinkler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Falco Winkler</a>-pushed through difficult phases, brought in new primitives, and kept the project alive long enough for this transition to even be possible.</p>
<p>Better Auth beginning was inspired by Auth.js, and now, together, the two projects can carry the ecosystem further. The end goal remains unchanged: you should own your auth!</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer layers. SimpleFold does not rely on expensive modules like triangle attention or pair representation biases, and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on more than 8.6M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. To the best of our knowledge, SimpleFold is the largest scale folding model ever developed. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Due to its generative training objective, SimpleFold also demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in folding, highlighting an alternative yet important avenue of progress in protein structure prediction.</p>

<p>When we train large neural networks, we need to keep them healthy. We do not want the tensors in the network—either the weights, activations or gradients—to grow too large or too small. Very small and very large tensors cause a variety of problems not just limited to numerical underflow and overflow. For example, weight matrices changing size during training makes it harder to design training algorithms—since the relative size of updates to weights has a significant impact on the speed of learning.</p>
<p>The gold standard for keeping tensors healthy is to normalize them. Normalization is commonplace for activation vectors, where we use techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450">layer norm</a> to put the activations on a good scale before passing them to the next layer. It is also commonplace to normalize gradient updates, where we can interpret fast training algorithms like the <a href="https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/">Muon optimizer</a> as spectrally normalizing the updates. Normalization provides us with certainty about the sizes of tensors—without needing to check Wandb!—and when training large neural networks with many interacting components, having certainty about the network internals is valuable.</p>
<p>Normalization is less commonly applied to weight matrices, although it is not unheard of. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/edm2">EDM2</a> diffusion model codebase uses weight constraints and the authors report benefits in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02696">their paper</a>. And <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370">BiT</a> uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10520">weight standardization</a>. Various other techniques have been proposed but are not common practice in modern large-scale training.<label for="sn1"></label><span>For some more examples, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07868">Salimans et al, 2016</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957">Miyato et al, 2018</a> and our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07227">Liu et al, 2021</a>.</span> Normalizing the weight matrices might be a good idea for a few reasons. Weight constraints make understanding the relative size of optimization updates easier. They remove the problem of weight norms exploding. They allow us to focus hyperparameter tuning effort on tensors whose size matters most. They can force matrices to have a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number">condition number</a>, making their behaviour more predictable. And relatedly, weight constraints facilitate <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04674274v1">Lipschitz guarantees</a> for robustness to perturbations.</p>
<p>This post covers one appealing way to constrain the weight matrices of a neural network—by keeping the tensors constrained to submanifolds at each layer. This opens the door to re-thinking optimization, as we can co-design optimization algorithms with these manifold constraints. As an example, we propose<label for="sna"></label><span>This algorithm builds on work from Jianlin Su and Franz Louis Cesista, as discussed further below.</span> a manifold version of the Muon optimizer whose weights are constrained to the Stiefel manifold: the manifold of matrices with unit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number">condition number</a>. We conclude the post by defining the idea of a <em>modular manifold</em>, which is a composable manifold that attempts to make it easier to scale up and train large networks.</p>
<p>Our goal in writing this post is to provide an introduction to a research area that we are excited about, and highlight many directions for future work. We would love to see more work from the community on the topics mentioned at the end of the post!</p>
<h2 id="the-shape-of-a-manifold-optimizer">The shape of a manifold optimizer</h2>
<p>This section works through the simplest example of learning on a manifold: a vector parameter constrained to a hypersphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The vector parameter is trained to minimize a loss function defined over the full space $\mathbb{R}^d$. This setup might be useful for, say, individual embedding vectors in a transformer model. This section will be a good warmup for the following section on <a href="#muon-on-the-stiefel-manifold">manifold Muon</a> that considers matrix parameters.</p>
<p>We will not be too formal about the definition of a manifold here: it is enough to understand that a manifold is a curved surface that looks flat when you zoom in close enough. The locally flat approximation at a point on the manifold is called the <em>tangent space</em> to the manifold, as visualized in <a href="#fig:tangent-space">Figure <span data-ref="tangent-space"></span></a>:</p>
<figure id="fig:tangent-space">
<canvas id="canvas-tangent-space"></canvas>

<figcaption>The sphere in three dimensions—or the hypersphere in higher dimensions—is a manifold. The locally flat approximation at a point on the manifold is called the tangent space to the manifold and is visualized as the red plane in the figure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can characterize the hypersphere in $d$ dimensions as the set of points $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ of unit Euclidean norm. And the tangent space at a point $w$ on the hypersphere is the set of all vectors $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that are orthogonal to $w$.</p>
<p>To keep the weights constrained to the manifold, we could use a non-manifold optimizer and just project the weights back to the manifold after each step. Instead, we are interested in designing methods that take steps in the tangent space. The reason is that we would like to be able to equate the learning rate of our optimizer with the actual length of the optimization step. But if the optimization steps are pointing significantly off manifold and then being projected back, this nice property does not hold. Similar motivation is given in Section 2.3 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02696">EDM2 paper</a>.</p>
<p>Before we can design a training algorithm for this manifold, something important we need to decide on is how to measure distance<label for="sn3"></label><span>For a manifold to be “Riemannian”, the distance measure must be induced by an inner product. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean ($\ell_2$) norm</a> is induced by an inner product, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan ($\ell_1$) distance</a> is not.</span> in the tangent space. A common choice is the Euclidean distance, but we could also choose to measure distance in other ways, as visualized in <a href="#fig:inscribed-norm-balls">Figure <span data-ref="inscribed-norm-balls"></span></a>. In the next section, we will talk about choosing a distance measure based on the functionality of the module.</p>
<figure id="fig:inscribed-norm-balls">
<canvas id="canvas-inscribed-norm-ball"></canvas>

<figcaption>Inscribing unit balls in the tangent space for different distance measures. The $\ell_2$ (Euclidean) unit ball is a circle while the $\ell_1$ (Manhattan) unit ball is a diamond.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Crucially, the choice of distance measure changes the direction of the best optimization step. If the distance measure is non-Euclidean, then for a fixed length step, we may be able to move further in the direction of the gradient<label for="sn4"></label><span>By gradient, we mean the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the weights. Mathematicians reserve the term gradient for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient#Riemannian_manifolds">something else</a> in Riemannian geometry.</span> by not following the gradient direction exactly! This concept is visualized in <a href="#fig:tangent-space-with-gradient">Figure <span data-ref="tangent-space-with-gradient"></span></a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:tangent-space-with-gradient">
<canvas id="canvas-tangent-with-gradient"></canvas>

<figcaption>How geometry influences the direction of the best optimization step. The pink arrow represents the raw gradient—meaning the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the weights. The yellow diamond denotes the $\ell_1$ unit ball. The green arrow is the unit vector pointing furthest in the direction of the gradient. Notice how the green arrow is not parallel to the pink arrow. (In practice, the pink arrow need not lie in the tangent space, although the green arrow will do by construction.) Try dragging the pink arrow to see how the best update direction changes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To see how this works out in math, we can formulate the optimal update direction given a manifold constraint and a distance measure as itself solving a constrained optimization problem. We will demonstrate this for the case of the hypersphere equipped with the Euclidean norm. Letting $g$ denote the gradient, $w$ the current point on the hypersphere, $a$ the update direction and $\eta$ the learning rate, we need to solve:</p>
$$\min_{a\in\mathbb{R}^d} \quad \underbrace{a^\top g\vphantom{\|a\|_2 = 1}}_{\mathclap{\text{linear change in loss}}} \quad \text{such that} \quad  \underbrace{\|a\|_2 = \eta}_{\mathclap{\text{size constraint}}} \quad \text{and} \quad \underbrace{a^\top w = 0\vphantom{\|a\|_2 = 1}}_{\mathclap{\text{tangent constraint}}}.\tag{$\star$}$$<p>Mapping back to the visual language of Figures <a href="#fig:tangent-space"><span data-ref="tangent-space"></span></a>, <a href="#fig:inscribed-norm-balls"><span data-ref="inscribed-norm-balls"></span></a> and <a href="#fig:tangent-space-with-gradient"><span data-ref="tangent-space-with-gradient"></span></a>, this formula says that the green arrow (optimal value of $a$) must belong to the red tangent hyperplane ($a^\top w = 0$) and must also lie on a yellow circle of radius $\eta$ ($\|a\|_2 = \eta$). To solve $(\star)$, we can apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">method of Lagrange multipliers</a>. The relevant Lagrangian function is given by:</p>
$$\mathcal{L}(a, \lambda, \mu) = a^\top g + \frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot (a^\top a - \eta) + \mu \cdot (a^\top w),$$<p>
where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are Lagrange multipliers. Setting the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to $a$ to zero and applying the constraints to solve for $\lambda$ and $\mu$, the optimal update $a_\mathrm{opt}$ ends up being given by the following formula:
</p>
$$a_\mathrm{opt} = - \eta \times \frac{g - ww^\top g}{\|g-ww^\top g\|_2}.$$<p>In words, the optimal update is given by subtracting out the radial component from the gradient, normalizing and multiplying by the learning rate. Since this update lies in the tangent space, actually a very small<label for="sn5"></label><span>For a learning rate $\eta$, the effect of the retraction map is $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ small, so the learning rate <em>almost</em> equals the length of the step.</span> correction is needed to stay on the manifold. The correction is known as a “retraction map” and is visualized in <a href="#fig:retraction-map">Figure <span data-ref="retraction-map"></span></a>:</p>
<figure id="fig:retraction-map">
<canvas id="canvas-retraction-map-2d"></canvas>

<figcaption>Visualizing the retraction map. The green arrow is the update taken in the tangent space. Since for large step sizes the tangent space starts to diverge from the manifold, we need to project the updated weights back to the manifold using the retraction map—illustrated by the purple arrow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can solve for the retraction map by applying Pythagoras’ theorem to <a href="#fig:retraction-map">Figure <span data-ref="retraction-map"></span></a>. For a unit hypersphere and a step of length $\eta$, the hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{1+\eta^2}$ and therefore the retraction map for the hypersphere equipped with the Euclidean norm is simply given by dividing the updated weights through by $\sqrt{1+\eta^2}$. Putting everything together, the full manifold optimization algorithm is then given by:</p>
$$w \gets \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\eta^2}} \left[w - \eta \times \frac{g - ww^\top g}{\|g-ww^\top g\|_2}\right].$$<p>As an exercise for the reader: try calculating the Euclidean norm of the updated weight vector and check that the updated weight vector indeed lies on the hypersphere.</p>
<p>To summarize this section, a first-order manifold optimizer has three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the tangent vector of unit length that goes furthest in the gradient direction.</li>
<li>Multiply this direction by the learning rate and subtract from the weights;</li>
<li>Retract the updated weights back to the manifold.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two decisions to make in applying this procedure: what manifold constraint we should use and how we should measure length. By making different decisions, we can generate different optimization algorithms as shown in the following table.</p>

<p>We will derive the final algorithm in the table, manifold Muon, in the next section. To design a manifold constraint and a distance function for a matrix parameter, we shall think carefully about the role that a weight matrix plays inside a neural network.</p>
<h2 id="manifold-muon">Manifold Muon</h2>
<p>A typical weight matrix $W$ in a transformer is a “vector-multiplier”, meaning that it transforms an input vector $x$ into an output vector $y = Wx$. We will design a manifold constraint and a distance function so that the matrix acts in a good way on input vectors: the matrix should not produce excessively small or large outputs, and updates to the matrix should not cause the output vector to change too much or too little.</p>
<p>A good way to think about how a matrix acts on vectors is through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">singular value decomposition</a>, illustrated in <a href="#fig:svd">Figure <span data-ref="svd"></span></a>. The SVD decomposes a matrix in a way that tells us how the matrix stretches input vectors along different axes.</p>

<figcaption>The singular value decomposition. A matrix $M\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ of rank $k$ can always be decomposed as $M = U \Sigma V^\top$, where $U\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$ and $V\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ have orthonormal columns and $\Sigma\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times k}$ is a diagonal matrix with only positive entries. The entries of $\Sigma$ are called the singular values of $M$. The singular values measure the stretching effect that the matrix has on vectors that align with the corresponding columns of $U$ and $V$.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We would like the matrix to have a stretching effect close to one, so we will choose a matrix manifold where all the singular values are exactly one. This matrix manifold is known formally as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiefel_manifold"><em>Stiefel manifold</em></a>. We can assume without loss of generality that we are dealing with a tall matrix ($m \geq n$), and then the Stiefel manifold can be equivalently defined as the following set:</p>
$$\mathsf{Stiefel}(m,n) := \left\{ W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \mid W^T W = I_n \right\}.$$<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp24/cse291-e/papers/StiefelManifold/StiefelNotes.pdf">one may show</a> that a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ lies tangent<label for="sn-stiefel-tangent"></label><span>Notice that the Stiefel constraint $W^T W = I_n$ directly generalizes the hyperspherical constraint $w^\top w = 1$ from the previous section. Similarly, the tangent space condition generalizes the hyperspherical one that $a^\top w = 0$.</span> to the Stiefel manifold at matrix $W$ if and only if:</p>
$$A^\top W + W^\top A = 0.$$<p>To design a manifold optimizer for the Stiefel manifold, all that remains is to choose a distance function. To limit the maximum stretching effect the weight update can have on an input vector, we will choose the <em>spectral norm</em>, which measures the largest singular value of a matrix. Although this only limits the maximum effect the update can have, since the optimizer we derive will saturate this bound, it will turn out to prevent the minimum effect of the update from being too small.<label for="sn-stiefel-spectral-norm"></label><span>There are some exceptions to this statement, such as when a weight matrix has a fan-out less than its fan-in, in which case we cannot escape from the matrix and its updates having a null space and mapping some inputs to zero.</span></p>
<p>The idea of doing gradient descent under a spectral norm constraint is what <a href="https://jeremybernste.in/writing/deriving-muon">led to</a> the Muon optimizer and, when combined with the Stiefel manifold constraint, we obtain a problem that we shall call <em>manifold Muon</em>:</p>
$$\min_{A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}} \quad \underbrace{\operatorname{trace}(G^T A)}_{\mathclap{\text{linear change in loss}}} \quad \text{such that} \quad \underbrace{\|A\|_{\text{spectral}} \leq \eta}_{\mathclap{\text{size constraint}}} \quad \text{and} \quad \underbrace{A^T W + W^T A = 0\vphantom{\|A\|_{\text{spectral}} = \eta}}_{\mathclap{\text{tangent constraint}}} \tag{$\dagger$}.$$<p>The manifold Muon problem $(\dagger)$ directly generalizes problem $(\star)$ from the previous section. Solving $(\dagger)$ is harder than solving $(\star)$, and here we will present a numerical solution inspired<label for="sn6"></label><span>I <a href="https://docs.modula.systems/algorithms/manifold/orthogonal/">figured out</a> how to solve manifold Muon in the square case late last year, but I was unable to solve the full rectangular case and thus <a href="https://docs.modula.systems/algorithms/manifold/orthogonal/#open-problem-extending-to-the-stiefel-manifold">posed the problem</a> as an open problem on the Modula docs. Jianlin Su <a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/11221">solved the problem</a> this summer by taking a Lagrangian approach and working out a fixed point iteration on the optimality condition. I saw an early version of Jianlin’s work (which did not quite work yet) and also <a href="https://leloykun.github.io/ponder/steepest-descent-stiefel/">related work</a> by Franz Louis Cesista, and I was able to work out the dual ascent algorithm presented here.</span> by work done by Jianlin Su and Franz Louis Cesista.</p>
<p>Our key insight is that $(\dagger)$ is a convex optimization problem that may be solved via a standard method known as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/convexopt/Lecture_Slides/dual-ascent.pdf"><em>dual ascent</em></a>. Here we will just sketch the main idea, but you can find a more detailed derivation <a href="https://docs.modula.systems/algorithms/manifold/stiefel/">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to Jianlin’s approach, we introduce a matrix of Lagrange multipliers $\Lambda\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. We then apply a series of transformations to convert the problem $(\dagger)$ from a <em>constrained minimization problem</em> to an <em>unconstrained maximization problem</em>:</p>
$$
\begin{align}
(\dagger) &amp;= \min_{\|A\|_\mathrm{spectral} \leq \eta} \max_{\Lambda} \;\operatorname{trace} G^\top A + \operatorname{trace}\Lambda^\top (A^\top W + W^\top A) \\
&amp;= \min_{\|A\|_\mathrm{spectral} \leq \eta} \max_{\Lambda}\; \operatorname{trace}A^\top (G + 2W(\Lambda+\Lambda^\top))\\
&amp;= \max_{\Lambda} \min_{\|A\|_\mathrm{spectral} \leq \eta} \; \operatorname{trace}A^\top (G + 2W(\Lambda+\Lambda^\top))\\
&amp;= \max_{\Lambda} \; - \eta \times \|G + 2W(\Lambda+\Lambda^\top)\|_\mathrm{nuclear}.
\end{align}
$$<p>Equation (1) reformulates the problem as a <a href="https://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/davidknowles/lagrangian_duality.pdf">saddle point problem</a>: the maximization over $\Lambda$ will send the objective to infinity whenever the tangent space condition is violated. Equation (2) follows by applying properties of the trace and equation (3) follows from Sion’s minimax theorem. The inner minimization in equation (3) is solved by setting $A_\mathrm{opt}(\Lambda) = - \eta \times \operatorname{msign}(G + 2W(\Lambda+\Lambda^\top))$ where $\operatorname{msign}$ is the <a href="https://docs.modula.systems/algorithms/newton-schulz/">matrix sign function</a>.<label for="sn7"></label><span>The matrix sign function snaps the singular values of a matrix to one. It may be computed efficiently on GPUs via Newton-Schulz iteration or the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16932">Polar Express</a> algorithm.</span> And we obtain equation (4) by substituting this expression for $A_\mathrm{opt}(\Lambda)$ into equation (3). Equation (4) is known as the “dual problem” to $(\dagger)$ and we can solve it by gradient ascent. After some work, the gradient of the dual function is given by:</p>
$$
\begin{align}
H(\Lambda) &amp;:= - \eta \times \nabla_\Lambda \|G + W (\Lambda+\Lambda^\top)\|_\mathrm{nuclear} \\
&amp;= - \eta \times [W^\top\mathrm{msign}(G + 2W (\Lambda+\Lambda^\top)) + \operatorname{msign}(G + 2W (\Lambda+\Lambda^\top))^\top W],
\end{align}
$$<p>where the nuclear norm $\|\cdot\|_\mathrm{nuclear}$ measures the sum of the singular values of a matrix.</p>
<p>Finally, we can write down the manifold Muon algorithm:<label for="sn8"></label><span>Note that this algorithm is closely related to <a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/11221">Jianlin Su’s solution</a>. Where we run dual ascent, Jianlin’s solution amounts to solving for the maximum of the dual function $H(\Lambda)=0$ via a fixed point iteration.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Run gradient ascent on the dual variable $\Lambda \gets \Lambda + \alpha \times H(\Lambda)$ to solve for $\Lambda_\mathrm{opt}$.</li>
<li>Compute the update $A_\mathrm{opt} = - \eta \times \operatorname{msign}(G + 2W(\Lambda_{\mathrm{opt}}+\Lambda_\mathrm{opt}^\top))$.</li>
<li>Apply the update to the weights $W \gets W + A_\mathrm{opt}$.</li>
<li>Retract the weights back to the manifold $W \gets \operatorname{msign}(W)$.</li>
</ol>
<p>We ran a very small experiment to sanity check the algorithm and provide a minimal implementation for students or researchers to play with. Each training run finishes in less than a minute.

<figcaption>Training a small MLP for 3 epochs on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The different lightly shaded blue curves show different weight decay settings for AdamW. Results were averaged over 3 random seeds. The manifold Muon optimizer attained higher train and test accuracy than AdamW. The third plot shows the final singular value distribution of the first weight matrix for the best performing learning rate: the singular values after training with manifold Muon are all close to 1. Manifold Muon increased the wall clock time per step compared to AdamW, although this could be improved by running fewer steps of dual ascent or adding momentum to the algorithm and running dual ascent online. Depending on other systems bottlenecks, the overhead may not be an issue.</figcaption>

<h2 id="modular-manifolds">Modular manifolds</h2>
<p>So far in this post, we have discussed manifold constraints for individual parameter tensors and co-designed optimization logic for these constraints. A question we have not answered is: what happens when we combine layers to build networks? Can we think about individual layers in isolation—or do we need to be careful about interactions between layers and modify the optimization logic in response? The goal of this section is to point out that there is a way to extend the reasoning we introduced in the previous two sections to the case of whole networks, and we call this <em>the theory of modular manifolds</em>.<label for="sn-modular-manifolds-1"></label><span>The theory of modular manifolds builds on research I did with my friend Tim Large, my postdoc advisor Phillip Isola, my PhD advisor Yisong Yue and many other amazing collaborators.</span> At the end of the section, we provide some links to learn more.</p>
<p>The idea of modular manifolds is to build an abstraction that tells us how to budget learning rates across layers. The actual optimization logic in each layer ends up being the same as what we already worked out, except that the learning rate for a layer is modified depending on where the layer appears in the network. The abstraction rests upon a key observation made in our paper on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14813">modular norm</a>, that budgeting learning rates—both across layers and when scaling up individual layers—is intimately tied to understanding the Lipschitz sensitivity of the network output with respect to the weights. The abstraction tracks this sensitivity as we build the network, and manifold constraints help us get a much tighter understanding of this sensitivity.</p>
<p>The starting point for the abstraction is to think of any neural network module—from a layer to a whole transformer—as a mathematical object with three attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A forward function $f:\mathcal{W} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ that maps from a parameter space $\mathcal{W} = \mathbb{R}^d$ and an input space $\mathcal{X}$ to an output space $\mathcal{Y}$.</li>
<li>A submanifold of the weight space $\mathcal{M}\subset\mathcal{W}$ that the weights are constrained to.</li>
<li>A norm $\|\cdot\| : \mathcal{W} \to \mathbb{R}$ that acts as a measuring stick on weight space.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a linear module equipped with the spectral norm and constrained to the Stiefel manifold, for which we have already worked out an optimizer, would be written:</p>
$$ \mathsf{StiefelLinear} = \begin{cases}(W, x) \mapsto Wx, &amp; \text{(forward function)}\\ \mathsf{Stiefel}(m,n), &amp; \text{(manifold)}\\ \|\cdot\|_\mathrm{spectral}. &amp; \text{(norm)}\end{cases}$$<p>Provided that an input $x$ to the $\mathsf{StiefelLinear}$ module has unit $\ell_2$ norm, then $\mathsf{StiefelLinear}$ is Lipschitz with respect to its weights in the module’s assigned norm with Lipschitz constant one:<label for="sn-stiefel-lipschitz"></label><span>This argument can be extended to the RMS norm on the input and the RMS–RMS operator norm on the weights.</span></p>
$$\|(W + \Delta W) x - Wx\|_2 \leq \|\Delta W\|_\mathrm{spectral} \times \|x\|_2 = \|\Delta W\|_\mathrm{spectral}.$$<p>This type of Lipschitz statement helps us understand how to scale weight updates to this module since it gives us a bound on how much the output can change when we perturb the weights. But when we compose two modules, can we automatically compile a Lipschitz statement on the joint weight space of the new module? The answer turns out to be yes, if we follow special rules for building the new module:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new forward function $f_3$ is given by composing the two existing forward functions $f_1$ and $f_2$:
$$f_3((w_1, w_2), x) := f_2(w_2, f_1(w_1, x)). \qquad$$</li>
<li>The new manifold constraint $\mathcal{M}_3$ is just the Cartesian product (see <a href="#fig:product-manifold">Figure <span data-ref="product-manifold"></span></a> for a fun example) of the two existing manifolds $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$:
$$\mathcal{M}_3 = \mathcal{M}_1 \times \mathcal{M}_2. \qquad$$</li>
<li>The new norm function is the max of the two existing norm functions weighted by special scalar coefficients $s_1$ and $s_2$. Letting $\|\cdot\|_1$ denote the first module’s norm and $\|\cdot\|_2$ denote the second module’s norm, the new norm $\|\cdot\|_3$ is given by:
$$\|(w_1, w_2)\|_3 := \max(s_1\cdot \|w_1\|_1, s_2\cdot \|w_2\|_2). \qquad$$</li>
</ol>
<p>When we use this composite norm to derive optimizers—following the same recipe we used in the first two sections of this post—we end up deriving separate optimizers for each layer, but the scalar coefficients $s_i$ budget the learning rates across layers.</p>
<p>We give much more detail on this construction, including extending it to other ways of combining modules, in our paper on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14813">modular norm</a>—although the paper does not cover manifold optimization. You can also check out our paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21265">modular duality</a> for more on building optimizers in the modular norm. The <a href="https://modula.systems/">Modula project</a> builds toward a programmatic implementation of this construction.</p>

<h2 id="directions-for-future-work">Directions for future work</h2>
<p>We are excited about any research that tries to make neural network training as principled and automatic as the forward pass. The ideas in this post benefitted strongly from interactions with external researchers like Jianlin Su and Franz Louis Cesista. We would love to see more work on these topics from the community.</p>
<p>Some possible directions for future work are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modularity.</strong> What manifolds should attention heads live on? Should embeddings be constrained differently than unembeddings? We can mix-and-match constraints in different parts of the network, or leave some tensors unconstrained.</li>
<li><strong>Numerics.</strong> Manifold constraints also place constraints on the range of values that individual weight entries can take. Does this impact numerics, or make low-precision training easier?</li>
<li><strong>Convex optimization.</strong> The manifold Muon algorithm involves running dual ascent. Can we apply more sophisticated convex optimization techniques to solve the dual problem faster or more reliably?</li>
<li><strong>Convergence analysis.</strong> How fast do these algorithms converge? Does good conditioning of the weight matrices benefit convergence? Is there more that we can say theoretically?</li>
<li><strong>Regularization.</strong> Manifold constraints implicitly regularize the model. Could we design constraints or tune their radii to improve generalization?</li>
<li><strong>Architecture-optimizer co-design.</strong> While hard manifold constraints may not ultimately be the right way to constrain weight matrices, they exemplify the idea of tightly co-designing optimization algorithms with architecural components. Are there more opportunities here?</li>
<li><strong>Non-Riemannian geometry.</strong> Most work on manifold optimization works in a Riemannian world where distances are induced by inner products and norm balls are ellipsoids. But neural networks are different: matrices act as operators, and operator norms like the spectral norm do not emerge from inner products. This implies, for example, that norm balls can have sharp corners and there is no unique gradient flow. Is there more to be discovered in this non-Riemannian world?</li>
<li><strong>Practical implementation.</strong> Applying these techniques at scale requires efficient manifold operations on GPUs. The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16932">Polar Express</a> paper shows promise for fast matrix sign computation. What other algorithmic innovations do we need?</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Manifold optimization.</strong> <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/absil">Absil, Mahony &amp; Sepulchre</a>’s textbook is a standard reference. For the Stiefel manifold specifically, see <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~edelman/publications/geometry_of_algorithms.pdf">Edelman et al, 1998</a>. These works live in a Riemannian world. Similarly most machine learning papers that consider optimization on the Stiefel manifold take a Riemannian point of view: see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01113">Li et al, 2020</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14173">Kong et al, 2022</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17901">Park et al, 2025</a> for some examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Riemannian geometry in machine learning.</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00523">Thomas Flynn’s paper</a> from 2017 on duality structure gradient descent characterizes the neural network weight space as a <em>Finsler manifold</em>, meaning a manifold equipped with a norm. It is well worth a read. Also see Jianlin Su’s <a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/11221">recent blog post</a> on Stiefel Muon as well as Franz Louis Cesista’s <a href="https://leloykun.github.io/ponder/steepest-descent-stiefel/">blog post</a> on a heuristic solution to Muon on the Stiefel manifold. Franz also wrote a <a href="https://leloykun.github.io/ponder/steepest-descent-finsler/">followup blog post</a> generalizing the solution presented here. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07529">Scion paper</a> imposes weight constraints a different way via convex combinations and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/hash/f50a6c02a3fc5a3a5d4d9391f05f3efc-Abstract.html">Carlson et al, 2015</a> wrote an early paper on (unconstrained) spectral descent.</p>

<p><strong>The Modula project.</strong> The goal of the Modula project is to build a library that automatically compiles steepest descent optimizers along with Lipschitz statements for general architectures. Check out the project page at <a href="https://modula.systems/">https://modula.systems</a> as well as our paper on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14813">modular norm</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21265">modular duality</a>. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20325">optimization anthology</a> also provides an accessible route into this space of ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lipschitz-constrained deep learning.</strong> There has been a lot of work on this topic. For example, check out <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04674274v1">Louis Béthune</a> and <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/129313/1227782217-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">Tsui-Wei Weng’s</a> PhD theses. Usually work on this topic does not connect weight-Lipschitzness to optimizer design. See also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05381">Anil et al, 2018</a> and our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338">Newhouse et al, 2025</a>.</p>
