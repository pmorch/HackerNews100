                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 200 people have been charged in a sweeping nationwide crackdown on health care fraud schemes with false claims topping $2.7 billion, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice">the Justice Department</a></span> said on Thursday. </p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/merrick-garland">Attorney General Merrick Garland</a></span> announced the charges against doctors, nurse practitioners and others across the U.S. accused of a variety of scams, including a $900 million scheme in Arizona targeting dying patients. </p><p>“It does not matter if you are a trafficker in a drug cartel or a corporate executive or medical professional employed by a health care company,” Garland told reporters. “If you profit from the unlawful distribution of controlled substances, you will be held accountable.” </p><p>In the Arizona case, prosecutors have accused two owners of wound care companies of accepting more than $330 million in kickbacks as part of a scheme to fraudulently bill Medicare for amniotic wound grafts, which are dressings to help heal wounds. </p>
    

<p>Nurse practitioners were pressured to apply the wound grafts to elderly patients who didn’t need them, including people in hospice care, the Justice Department said. Some patients died the day they received the grafts or within days, court papers say. </p>



<p>In less than two years, more than $900 million in bogus claims were submitted to Medicare for grafts that were used on fewer than 500 patients, prosecutors said. </p><p>The owners of the wound care companies, Alexandra Gehrke and Jeffrey King, were arrested this month at the Phoenix airport as they were boarding a flight to London, according to court papers urging a judge to keep them behind bars while they await trial. An attorney for Gehrke declined to comment, and a lawyer for King didn’t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press.</p>
    
<p>Authorities allege Gehrke and King, who got married this year, knew charges were coming and had been preparing to flee. At their home, authorities found a book titled “How To Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish Without a Trace,” according to court papers. In one of their bags packed for their flight, there was a book titled “Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive The System,” the papers say.</p>
    

<p>Gehrke and King lived lavishly off the scheme, prosecutors allege, citing luxury cars, a nearly $6 million home and more than $520,000 in gold bars, coins and jewelry. Officials seized more than $52 million from Gehrke’s personal and business bank accounts after her arrest, prosecutors say. </p><p>In total, 193 people — including 76 doctors, nurse practitioners, and other licensed medical professionals — were charged in a series of separate cases brought over about two weeks in the nationwide health care fraud sweep. Authorities seized more than $230 million in cash, luxury cars and other assets. The Justice Department carries out these sweeping health care fraud efforts periodically to help deter other potential wrongdoers. </p><p>In another scheme targeting Native Americans, phony sober living homes were set up promising addiction treatment. Claims were then submitted for services that were never actually performed, officials said. </p>
    

<p>Another case alleges a scheme in Florida to distribute misbranded HIV drugs. Prosecutors say drugs were bought on the black market and resold to unsuspecting pharmacies, which then provided the medications to patients. </p><p>Some patients were given bottles that contained different drugs than the label showed. One patient ended up unconscious for 24 hours after taking what he was led to believe was his HIV medication but was actually an anti-psychotic drug, prosecutors say. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Department of Justice at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice">https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice</a></span>.</p>

<p>An upgrade from Python 3.11 to 3.12 has led to the rejection of
some Python apps by Apple's app stores. That led to Eric Froemling submitting a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522">bug report</a>
against CPython. That, in turn, led to an interesting
discussion among Python developers about how far the project was
willing to go to accommodate app store review processes. Developers
reached a quick consensus, and a solution that may arrive as soon as
Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>

<p>The problem at hand is that Apple's macOS App Store is
automatically rejecting apps that contain the string
"itms-services". That is the URL scheme for apps that
want to ask Apple's iTunes Store to install another
app. Software distributed via Apple's macOS store is
sandboxed, and sandboxed apps are prohibited from using URLs
with the <tt>itms-services</tt> scheme. That string is in the
<tt><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></tt>
parser in Python's standard library, though an application may never actually use
the <tt>itms-services</tt> handler.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple did not do anything so
straightforward as to <em>explain</em> this to Froemling. Once
he filed an appeal with Apple about the rejection, Apple finally told him that
<tt>parse.py</tt> and <tt>parse.pyc</tt> were the offending
files. After that, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522#issuecomment-2169031927">he
said</a>, it was not hard to track down the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
Now in retrospect I'm frustrated I didn't think to run a full text
search for itms-services over Python itself earlier or stumble across
one of the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1655">other
cases</a> of folks hitting this.
</blockquote>

<p>Russell Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011">started the discussion</a> in the Python Core
Development discussion forum on June&nbsp;17. He wanted to know whether "<q>acceptable to app
stores</q>" should be a design goal for CPython, or if that compliance
should be a problem left to the tools that generate application
bundles for app stores.</p>

<h4>Paranoid and inscrutable</h4>

<p>Keith-Magee noted in his initial question that Apple's review processes were the
most "<q>paranoid and inscrutable</q>" of app-store-review processes,
but that other app stores also had "<q>validation and acceptance processes
that are entirely opaque</q>". One solution might be to obfuscate the
offending string to pass review, but that might "<q>lead to an obfuscation arms race</q>" and
there were no guarantees this would be the last time the project had
to resolve app-validation problems. The other option, he said, was to
consider this to be a distribution problem and leave it to tools like
<a href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/py2app/">py2app</a>, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/buildozer/">buildozer</a> to
solve. Traditionally, they have had to patch CPython anyway, he said,
because it did not support Android or iOS "out of the box". But that
will change with Python 3.13 when no patching should be required for
those platforms.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Alex Gaynor <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/3">suggested</a> that the project try a
an approach that Keith-Magee had not put forward inspired by
Gaynor's experience with the <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">cryptography</a> library.
The project often receives complaints that the library refuses
to parse a certificate that is technically invalid, but was in wide
use. He said that the policy was to accept pull
requests that work around those issues "<q>provided they are small,
localized, and generally aren't too awful</q>". 
But, he added, these patches should only be accepted on the condition
that someone complains to the third party (in this case Apple), and extracts
some kind of commitment that they would do something about it. He
suggested that the workaround be time-limited, to give users a decent
experience "<q>while also not letting large firms simply externalize
their bizarre issues onto OSS projects</q>".</p>

<p>Brandt Bucher <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/4">wondered</a>
whether obfuscation was even allowed, or if it would be seen as
circumventing the review process. That was a question no one seemed to
have an answer to; and Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/6">responded</a> with an&nbsp;8-Ball emoji and
the phrase "<q>ask again later</q>." He added that Gaynor's approach
sounded appealing, but it would be like screaming into the
void. Apple, he said, barely has an appeals process and there is no
channel available to the Python project "<q>to raise a complaint that
we could reasonably believe would result in a change of
policy</q>".</p>

<p>Another approach, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/12">suggested</a>
by Alyssa Coghlan, would be to use a JSON configuration file that
<tt>urllib</tt> would read to set up its module level attributes
"<q>rather than hardcoding its knowledge of all the relevant schemes</q>".
That could allow app generators to drop "itms-services"
from the configuration file rather than patching <tt>urllib.py</tt>
directly. Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/13">said</a> that could work, but "<q>it strikes me as a
bit of overkill for an edge case</q>" that could be handled by
obfuscation or distribution-level patching.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;20, Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/16">wrote</a>
that he had thought of another approach: adding a build-time option
called "<tt>--with-app-store-patch</tt>" that removes code that is
known to be problematic. He said it would be enabled
by default for the iOS platform, and disabled elsewhere. It could be
used when building an application for macOS, if the developer intended
to distribute that application via the macOS App Store. He suggested
that the option could also accept a path to a file with a patch, to
allow distributors to provide an updated patch if an app store changes
its rules after the maintenance window for a Python release has
closed.</p>

<h4>Let's paint the bikeshed</h4>

<p>Coghlan <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/20">asked</a>
if it was now time to "<q>paint a config option bikeshed</q>". She
said that the proposed option name was both too broad and too
narrow. The "app-store" component of the name was too broad, because
it could encompass any app store, not only Apple app stores. The
"patch" component was too narrow, because patch specifies the
method of complying with policies rather than intent. There may be
other methods required to comply with app-store-compliance
checks. Keith-Magee liked the suggestion about dropping "patch" from
the option name, and suggested painting the bikeshed a nice shade of
"<tt>--with-app-store-compliance</tt>" that would interact with
platform identification to sort out what is required.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;25, Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/31">thanked</a>
participants in the discussion for their input, and pointed to a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/120984">pull request</a>
that would implement the <tt>--with-app-store-compliance</tt>
configuration option. In the request, he noted that it would be
possible to use the option with platforms other than iOS or macOS, but
there were no use cases for that at present. If all goes well, it
should be available in Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>

<p>It is frustrating that free-software projects like Python have to
waste time finding ways around opaque review processes just so
developers can write software for non-free platforms. However, the
approach taken by Keith-Magee and other CPython developers seems to be
the least-bad option that offers the best experience for Python
application developers. It will almost certainly not be the last time that a
project runs into this problem.</p><br clear="all">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC wants to make it significantly easier for consumers to unlock their phones from their carriers, proposing that all devices must be unlockable just 60 days after purchase. How this will mesh with current plans and phone-buying trends, however, is something the agency is hoping to learn before putting such a rule into effect.</p>

<p>Mobile phones purchased from a carrier are generally locked to that carrier until either the contract is up or the phone is paid off. But despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/15/if-you-want-tech-freedom-congress-needs-to-change-a-law/">improvements to the process over the years </a>(unlocking was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/26/unlocking-your-phone-is-now-illegal-but-what-does-that-mean-for-you/">flat-out illegal </a>not long ago), it still isn’t quite clear to all consumers when and how they can unlock their phone and take it to the carrier (or country) of their choice.</p>

	
	


<p>To be clear, this is not about opening up your phone using a face, fingerprint or password, but changing settings in its software to allow it to work with different mobile networks.</p>

<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-proposes-mobile-phone-unlocking-requirement">in a press release Thursday</a>. “When you buy a phone, you should have the freedom to decide when to change service to the carrier you want and not have the device you own stuck by practices that prevent you from making that choice,” she wrote. “That is why we are proposing clear, nationwide mobile phone unlocking rules.”</p>

	
	


<p>Specifically, the release says, carriers would simply have to provide unlocking services 60 days after activation. A welcome standard, but it may run afoul of today’s phone and wireless markets.</p>

<p>For instance, although the dreaded two-year contract is no longer forced on most consumers, many still opt for them to lock in the price and get other benefits. And perhaps more to the point, the phones themselves are often paid for in what amount to installment plans: You get a phone for “free” and then pay it off over the next few years.</p>

<p>The NPRM is the stage of FCC rulemaking where it has a draft rule but has not yet solicited public feedback. Only July 18, the agency will publish the full document and open up commentary on the above issues. And you can be sure there will be some squawking from mobile providers!</p>


	
	


<p>Not knowing the specifics of the proposed rule, we can’t be sure how it would mix with these common pay-over-time details. But unlocking a phone doesn’t free someone from needing to pay the device off — they can just use it on other networks if they want. And if a carrier lets you buy a phone outright from it but locks it to the bands for six months or a year out of sheer greed, this would offer an early exit.</p>

	
	


<p>As Rosenworcel said, the point of the rule is to offer consistency and transparency: a simple, national rule from regulators setting a reasonable limit on how and whether carriers can lock down devices. We’ll know more in July when the full NPRM is published.</p>

<p><span>Project management is not just a tool to mislead the client into thinking you're actually doing something.</span></p>

<p><span>It can also be used to create a high quality product, on time, and slightly over budget.</span></p>

<p><span>For the second lighthouse I project managed, designed and then 3D printed all the parts, It looks great, and fits the brief completely.</span></p>

<p><span>But guess which one I now prefer.</span></p>

<p><span>So two lighthouses later, I realised that the act of planning sometimes loses the spirit of the idea.</span></p>

<p><span>Even so, I decided to try to plan and manage the Valve.Computer project, and fortunately, as the build grew, it gained more spirit than I can shake a stick at.</span></p>
</div><div id="a18ceec0733303a102bddc43e1de045d" data-plugin="LayoutElement"><h5>The Valve.Computer Project</h5>



<p><span>My stepdaughter is a senior Product Manager and my stepson is a Chartered Engineer and he frequently works as a Project Manager. They would know how to manage this project. Luckily they are too successful and busy to ever read this, thank goodness!</span></p>

<p><span>I tried doing the project management on a PC but gave up, and instead used 3 coloured pens, A4 paper and self adhesive address labels to cover up my mistakes. I simply found it easier. The only problem I discovered is that the paper gets a bit thick after several layers of amendments, but the big advantage is that can always find your last version, it's simply the thickest.</span></p>

<p><span>The main thing I discovered over the year was that the first time I tried almost anything I failed, but the annoying experience often enabled future success.</span></p>

<p><span>I started by stabbing at various bits of the idea. Eventually I was able to define what I wanted to do. I now realise that this definition, was the most important part of the whole project management.</span></p>

<p><span>The program seemed to consist of many complex components, all of which I needed to understand, to be able to build the Valve.Computer.</span></p>

<p><span>How do thermionic valves work, how do you design a PCB, and how on earth do you get from a NOR gate, to a memory register, via microcodes from a clock and a ROM, to actually run software. And what exactly is a microcode anyway. At times, in fact most of the time, it all just seemed impossible.</span></p>

<p><span>The main solutions I found were, firstly to keep the number of unique sub systems to an absolute minimum, secondly to use double triode valves to halve the physical size, which also reduced the construction time, and thirdly, to design multi layer printed circuit boards to reduce the inevitable build errors and produce a robust construction.</span></p>



<p><span>So far it has only gone BANG twice. The first time I pulled out plugs like my life depended on it, and Judy cried, “Everything all right!”. The second time I only slightly panicked, and Judy continued to decorate the Christmas tree, but later bought me a surpise present, a fire extinguisher!</span></p>



<p><span>But most important of all, is to have a lovely wife, who knows you're daft as a brush, and that life together is brilliant.</span></p>

<p>Linux and its code are made by people, and people are not with us forever. Over the weekend, a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ds6wc3svkyre4p2rwg4f76o67xndazaeoyjwblhuzichscyxoz@5ttdvbymxr55/T/#mfd2f4928e0e013c10375ca766035c1385e18f8e0">brief message on the Linux kernel mailing list</a> reminded everyone of just how much one person can mean to a seemingly gargantuan project like Linux, and how quickly that person can disappear.</p>
<p>Denise Finger, wife of the deceased, wrote to the Linux Wireless list on Friday evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is to notify you that Larry Finger, one of your developers, passed away on June 21st.</p></blockquote>
<p>LWN.net reckons that <a href="https://hkfuneralhome.com/larry-finger/">Finger, 84</a>, contributed to 94 Linux kernel releases, or 1,464 commits total, at least since <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16">kernel 2.6.16 in 2006</a> (and when the kernel started using git to track changes). Given the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/">sometimes precarious nature of contributing to the kernel</a>, this is on its own an impressive achievement—especially for someone with no formal computer training and who considered himself a scientist.</p>
<h2>The deepest of trenches: Linux Wi-Fi in the 2000s</h2>
<p>That kind of effort is worth celebrating, regardless. But it's the space that Finger devoted himself to that makes him a notably patient, productive contributor.</p>
<p>Getting Wi-Fi to work on a device running Linux back when Finger started contributing was awful. The chances of your hardware being recognized, activated, and working properly right after install was akin to getting a straight flush in poker. If nobody had gotten around to your wireless chipset yet, you used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper">NDISwrapper</a>, a Windows-interfacing kludge tool that simultaneously made your Linux install less open and yet still painful to install and maintain.</p>
<p>Finger started fixing this with work on <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx">Broadcom's BCM43XX drivers</a>. Broadcom provided no code for its gear, so Finger helped reverse-engineer the necessary specs by manually dumping and reading hardware registers. Finger also provided numerous Realtek drivers. Many commenters across blogs and message boards are noting that their systems are still using pieces of Finger's code today.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Fixing mainframes, science gear, and RV resorts</h2>
<figure><img alt="Larry Finger, and fish, from his Quora profile." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpeg" width="200" height="200"><figcaption><p>Larry Finger, and fish, from his Quora profile.</p><p>Quora</p></figcaption></figure><p>Finger doesn't have a large footprint on the web, outside of his hundreds of kernel commits. He has <a href="http://dwanderer-at-lwfinger.net/">a page for DRAWxtl</a>, open-source software that produces crystal-structure drawings, on his personal domain, but not a personal homepage. He <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Larry-Finger-1">sometimes answered Quora questions</a>. He had <a href="https://github.com/lwfinger">a GitHub profile</a> showing more than 100 contributions to projects in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest insight into Finger that can be found in one spot is a three-part series for Linux Journal, "<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8084">Linux in a Windows Workstation Environment</a>," written in 2005 when he was roughly 65. He summarizes his background: Fortran programmer in 1963, PDP-11 interfaces to scientific instruments in the 1970s, VAX-11/780 work in the early 1980s, and then Unix/Linux systems, until retiring from <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/about/our-history">the Carnegie Institution for Science</a> in Washington, DC, in 1999. The mineral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerite">Fingerite</a>, an extremely rare specimen, is named for Finger. His work in crystallography took him on a fellowship to northern Bavaria, as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-speed-limit-on-the-autobahn-Ive-heard-stories-of-people-driving-insane-speeds-of-150+-MPH?no_redirect=1">noted in one Quora answer</a> about the Autobahn.</p>
<p>After retirement, Finger writes in Linux Journal, "I became a full-time RV resident, dedicated to the avoidance of cold weather." He and his wife Denise arrived that year at a 55-plus RV community in Mesa, Arizona. He joined the computer club there, which had a growing number of Windows PCs sharing a DSL connection, managed by one of the systems running WinGate. A new RV resort owner wanted to expand to 22 workstations, but WinGate licenses for that many connections would have been too expensive for the club. Finger, who was "highly distrustful of using Windows 98 in a mission-critical role," set to work building a DIY Linux replacement.</p>
<p>Finger goes on across the series to describe the various ways he upgraded the routing and server capacity of the network, which grew to 38 user stations, individual Samba shares, a membership database, VPN tunnels, several free RJ-45 ports, and "free Wi-Fi access... throughout the park."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Passing it along</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpg" data-height="2400" data-width="1920" alt="Larry Finger, from his obituary page."><img alt="Larry Finger, from his obituary page." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger-640x800.jpg" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger-1280x1600.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpg" data-height="2400" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Larry Finger, from his obituary page.</p><p>Hixson-Klein Funeral Home</p></figcaption></figure><p>Lots of people have commented on the crucial work Finger did to make Linux usable for more people. A few mention that Finger also mentored people, the kind of unseen work that has exponential effects. "<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/979460/">MB" wrote on LWN.net</a> that Finger "mentored other people to get the Broadcom Open Source code into kernel. And I think it was a huge success. And that was only a small part of Larry's success story."</p>
<p>In a 2023 <a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-an-average-person-contribute-something-substantial-to-the-Linux-kernel-without-having-any-formal-training-in-Computer-Science">Quora response</a> to someone asking if someone without "any formal training in computer science" can "contribute something substantial" to Linux, Finger writes, "I think that I have." Finger links to the <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/936113/70fa396ea7bd8594/">stats for the 6.4 kernel</a>, showing 172,346 lines of his code in it, roughly 0.5 percent of the total.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have never taken any courses in Computer Science; however, I have considerable experience in coding, much of which happened when computers were a lot less powerful than today, and it was critical to write code that ran efficiently.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finger suggests in his response to start by focusing on small patches, deep reading of the guidelines, and always using git's send-email to send patches: "Nothing will get shot down more quickly than a patch submitted from a mailer such as Thunderbird." Finding typos and errors in comments and text strings can help, too, especially in projects that involve contributors across countries. Finger advises being patient, expecting criticism about following rules and formats, and to keep plugging away at it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-resource-to-learn-about-Linux-kernel-driver-development-I-have-consulted-references-like-Linux-kernel-development-and-Linux-device-drivers-but-they-are-very-old-and-difficult-to-follow/answer/Larry-Finger-1">another Quora response</a> about kernel driver development, Finger says, "This activity can be highly rewarding, and also equally frustrating!" You should learn C, Finger suggested, and maybe start with analyzing USB drivers, and take your time learning about DMA.</p>
<p>"Do not lose hope," Finger wrote. "It took me about 2 years before I could do anything more than tell the experts where my system was generating a fault."</p>

At the time, Elon Musk was rolling out a number of new, controversial features, including optional user verification for Blue subscriber accounts.</p><p>To verify users on sites like X, AU10TIX asks for a number of identifying data points, including selfies and pictures of government-issued IDs. These data points help a company confirm that a user is a real person and not a bot, but they can become a privacy liability in a situation like this. </p><p>404 Media writes that the debacle  started because an AU10TIX staffer’s login credentials were harvested by malware in 2022 and later posted to a Telegram channel. The outlet was initially alerted to the situation by a cybersecurity researcher. The name associated with the stolen credentials matched the name of a person on LinkedIn who is listed as a Network Operations Center Manager at AU10TIX, 404 writes. The credentials allowed entry into a logging platform, where data related to the users of some client platforms appeared to be visible. The cybersecurity researcher provided screenshots of the data that could be accessed using the credentials, and 404 breaks it down like this:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The accessible information includes the person’s name, date of birth, nationality, identification number, and the type of document uploaded such as a drivers’ license. A subsequent link then includes an image of the identity document itself; some of those are American drivers’ licenses.</p></blockquote><p>Gizmodo reached out to AU10TIX for comment  and will update this story if it responds. When reached for comment by 404 Media, the company&nbsp;told the outlet that “the incident you cited happened over 18 months ago. A thorough investigation determined that employee credentials were illegally accessed then and were promptly rescinded.” However, 404 Media claims that, according to the security researcher, the credentials still worked as of this month. When confronted with that information, AU10TIX said it was “decommissioning the relevant system” linked to the credentials. </p><p>On the topic of user data potentially having been accessed, the company said: “While PII data was potentially accessible, based on our current findings, we see no evidence that such data has been exploited. Our customers’ security is of the utmost importance, and they have been notified.”</p><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.au10tix.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.au10tix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AU10TIX’s website</a></span>, it has partnered with many other large, prominent platforms and brands, including PayPal, LinkedIn, Coinbase, eToro, and UpWork, among others. </p></div></div>]]></description>

We’re building a modern task queue as an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node. Our open-source repo is at <a href="https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet">https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet</a> and is 100% MIT licensed.</p><p>When we did a Show HN a few months ago (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136</a>), our cloud version was invite-only and we were focused on our open-source offering.</p><p>Today we’re launching our self-serve cloud so that anyone can get started creating tasks on our platform - you can get started at <a href="https://cloud.onhatchet.run/" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.onhatchet.run</a>, or you can use these credentials to access a demo (should be prefilled):</p><pre><code>  URL: https://demo.hatchet-tools.com

</code></pre><p>
People are currently using Hatchet for a bunch of use-cases: orchestrating RAG pipelines, queueing up user notifications, building agentic LLM workflows, or scheduling image generation tasks on GPUs.</p><p>We built this out of frustration with existing tools and a conviction that PostgreSQL is the right choice for a task queue. Beyond the fact that many developers are already using Postgres in their stack, which makes it easier to self-host Hatchet, it’s also easier to model higher-order concepts in Postgres, like chains of tasks (which we call workflows). In our system, the acknowledgement of the task, the task result, and the updates to higher-order models are done as part of the same Postgres transaction, which significantly reduces the risk of data loss/race conditions when compared with other task queues (which usually pass acknowledgements through a broker, storing the task results elsewhere, and only then figuring out the next task in the chain).</p><p>We also became increasingly frustrated with tools like Celery and the challenges it introduces when using a modern Python stack (&gt; 3.5). We wrote up a list of these frustrations here: <a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/problems-with-celery">https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/problems-with-celery</a>.</p><p>Since our Show HN, we’ve (partially or completely) addressed the most common pieces of feedback from the post, which we’ll outline here:</p><p>1. The most common ask was built-in support for fanout workflows — one task which triggers an arbitrary number of child tasks to run in parallel. We previously only had support for DAG executions. We generalized this concept and launched child workflows (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/child-workflows">https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/child-workflows</a>). This is the first step towards a developer-friendly model of durable execution.</p><p>2. Support for HTTP-based triggers — we’ve built out support for webhook workers (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks">https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks</a>), which allow you to trigger any workflow over an HTTP webhook. This is particularly useful for apps on Vercel, who are dealing with timeout limits of 60s, 300s, or 900s (depending on your tier).</p><p>3. Our RabbitMQ dependency — while we haven’t gotten rid of this completely, we’ve recently launched hatchet-lite (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/hatchet-lite">https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/hatchet-lite</a>), which allows you to run the various Hatchet components in a single Docker image that bundles RabbitMQ along with a migration process, admin CLI, our REST API, and our gRPC engine. Hopefully the lite was a giveaway, but this is meant for local development and low-volume processing, on the order of hundreds per minute.</p><p>We’ve also launched more features, like support for global rate limiting, steps which only run on workflow failure, and custom event streaming.</p><p>We’ll be here the whole day for questions and feedback, and look forward to hearing your thoughts!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

            <guid>40810949</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 14:32:35 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pketh.org/open-sourcing-kinopio.html">https://pketh.org/open-sourcing-kinopio.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40810949">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>On the eve of it’s 5th anniversary, I’ve decided to make the code for the <code>kinopio-client</code> app public. That means you can run Kinopio on your own computer, make changes, and share improvements.</p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/github-logo@2x.png" width="24" height="25"> <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client">kinopio-client on github</a></p>

<p><code>kinopio-client</code> is the app that’s downloaded and run in your browser when you go to <a href="https://kinopio.club/">https://kinopio.club</a>. It can save data locally, and to the <code>kinopio-server</code>.</p>



<p>Because the app weighs only ~220kb, in an alternate dimension where we didn’t have the Internet but had html, I’d ship kinopio to you on a single floppy disk. It wouldn’t even need to be high-density.</p>



<p>To be honest, opening up 5 years of private code does feel a bit intimate, like inviting someone over. I’ve cleaned the dishes and swept up, but … don’t look in that closest.</p>

<p>That said, compared to other commercial codebases, you might find it refreshingly straightforward. It’s just a node.js app and here’s the entire install process:</p>

<div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/pketh/kinopio-client.git
<span>cd </span>kinopio-client
npm <span>install
</span>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> @vue/cli
npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> hostile
hostile <span>set </span>localhost kinopio.local
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then create an <code>.env.local</code> file containing <code>VITE_PROD_SERVER=true</code>.</p>

<p>And to run it:</p>

<div><pre><code>npm run serve
https://kinopio.local:8080
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="why-make-commercial-app-code-public">Why Make Commercial app code public?</h2>

<p>I’ve long been thinking about how to share the amount of work that goes into Kinopio. The more you know how something is made, the more you appreciate it –&nbsp;even more so when it’s a quality product built to last a lifetime.</p>

<p>But at the same time, making software isn’t like carving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F12qUyIACM">fountain pens</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UijpPTEuJgY">acoustic guitars</a>. As much as I would like to sometimes, I don’t toil in meditative isolation until I’m ready to deliver the perfect timeless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_d%27art">objet d’art</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pketh.org/images/2024/oss/sculptor.jpg">
  <figcaption>Not my life <a href="https://www.cosmos.so/e/441491231">(Source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By contrast, delivering software is more like delivering a gooey crying baby. It’s alive. Squirming, growing, and changing because the technologies it relies on do too. Physical materials rarely change, but web browsers, operating systems, and servers sure do.</p>

<p>The big benefit of public code for me is that it’s another way to share the work that goes into Kinopio. One more piece of the puzzle, in between diagnosing bug reports, discussing feature requests, and sharing updates on social media.</p>

<p>Some kind souls might <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute changes</a>. But because Kinopio is such a complex interface-based app, I have no idea yet how often that’ll happen.</p>

<h2 id="risks">Risks?</h2>

<p>Sharing the code for paid software carries some potential risks worth considering,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A counterfeiter could theoretically use the code to make a clone product. Commercial derivatives are prohibited by the <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client/blob/main/LICENSE.md">license</a>, but even if they ignore that, the forger would still have to reverse engineer their own kinopio-server. It’d be way easier to use an off-the-shelf infinite canvas library or tldraw&nbsp;instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code contributions are appreciated, but having too many PRs to review can be very stressful. On paper, Kinopio is a one person operation, but I’m not really alone because I’ve got a community of users I trust that moderate discussions and answer questions when I’m not able to. As always, I’ll be relying on their help and generosity.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-happens-next">What Happens Next?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in contributing, please by sure to read the <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributor docs</a> first. And just like in the discord and forums, there’s only one rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re all friends here, so let’s be cool, constructive, and always treat each other with respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pketh.org/images/2024/oss/journey.webp">
  <figcaption>Hirō Isono</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Compared to a library or CLI tool, where new features and more options don’t really complicate basic usage, what the ‘correct’ thing to do for a GUI application is far fuzzier and subjective.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of activity takes place in the repo. Will I spend more time reviewing and less time coding? Maybe I’ll stream some live coding sessions?</p>

<p>With loving scrutiny,</p>

<p>– Pirijan, Kinopio Creator</p>

<p>I <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-17-one-click-finetuning.html">previously</a> experimented with one-click LLM finetuning providers and now is a good time to return to the core of the matter: evaluating how well all these fine-tuned models and experiments are faring. I have a gut feeling that my fine-tuned models did pretty well, but we’re not in the business of gut feeling so I’m hoping to be able to put some real numbers down to either prove or disprove this hypothesis.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder if you didn’t read <a href="https://mlops.systems/#category=isafpr">any of the previous posts in the series</a>, I’m building a model that can take a press release text like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“2011-11-S-011 ISAF Joint Command - Afghanistan For Immediate Release KABUL, Afghanistan (Nov.&nbsp;7, 2011) — A combined Afghan and coalition security force conducted an operation in search of a Haqqani facilitator in Argo district, Badakshan province. The facilitator coordinates suicide attacks with other insurgent leaders in the area. During the operation, a local national male failed to comply with repeated verbal warnings and displayed hostile intent toward the security force. The security force engaged the individual, resulting in his death. The security force confiscated a shotgun and intelligence linking the local national to the Haqqani network. The security force also detained two suspected insurgents during the operation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and then turn it into structured data (i.e.&nbsp;a JSON object) like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>

<p>I’ve now fine-tuned several models and I want to get a sense of how good these are. I showcased <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-03-isafpr-evaluating-baseline.html">some initial baseline evaluations</a> using OpenAI’s <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> but I want to pit model against model now.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in teasing out some of the edge cases where I know I struggled as a human annotator. (I <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/strickvl/isafpressreleases">released the dataset</a> for this project publicly on the Hugging Face Hub and also was responsible for annotating every single item so I know the data intimately.) I can even consider using the hard examples to generate some synthetic data to boost performance on those edge cases, but that’s a task for much later on.</p>
<p>This blogpost is a prose overview of some of the evaluations I’m adding to my suite of tests (and why I’m adding them). I learned a lot from <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/">Hamel Husain’s “Your AI Product Needs Evals” blogpost</a> and if you’re interested in this I’d recommend reading it and then actually implementing his suggestions.</p>
<section id="core-evaluations-for-accuracy">
<h2 data-anchor-id="core-evaluations-for-accuracy">Core evaluations for accuracy</h2>
<p>The most important measurement to start with is just a pure “did the LLM make a correct prediction or not?” If I was doing all these evaluations manually myself, I’d take a look at the example above, for example, and ask myself “was the start date of the event mentioned in the blogpost really ‘2011-11-07’ as predicted by the model?” and “did the event take place in Badakhshan province?” and “were the Haqqanis the group targeted?”</p>
<p>It’s fairly straightforward to make these determinations when comparing each property one by one. I can then repeat this over every example in my test slice of my dataset and take an average if I want a single aggregate figure, or I can get individual figures for dates, provinces, target groups and so on (to know if maybe there’s one part of the prediction it struggles with most).</p>
</section>
<section id="out-of-domain-data">
<h2 data-anchor-id="out-of-domain-data">Out of domain data</h2>
<p>The ISAF mission has come to an end, so I don’t have to worry too much about new data and having to adapt to a continuously changing world, but it is possible that some smaller groups weren’t well represented in the training data (for predicting the target group, for example) so I want to know how well my model does with data it hasn’t seen.</p>
<p>My prompt passes in the schema for the data and I encourage it to follow the schema in its response, but if there’s a new group will it add the new group to the schema? I can write an evaluation to test this.</p>
<p>Another edge case is the possibility that a press release doesn’t follow the standard format. Having read them all, I know that the vast majority are pretty formulaic, but sometimes there is a special event or incident which caused the author of the press release to depart from the standard formula. I want to know that my model will:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>not just make something up so as to have <em>some</em> kind of JSON response even if the press release is about someone’s birthday party</li>
<li>even better, produce some sort of error code or blank response when this happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can use examples of this out of domain data to see what happens, and put a value to how often my model will just hallucinate something out of nothing. This will be important since the name of the game for this model is accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section id="gradations-of-some-a-few-many">
<h2 data-anchor-id="gradations-of-some-a-few-many">Gradations of ‘some’, ‘a few’, ‘many’</h2>
<p>The press releases try to give some information without actually giving too much. Indeed, when I published <a href="https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/special-reports/a-knock-on-the-door-22-months-of-isaf-press-releases/">my report</a> on the press releases back in 2011, ISAF even <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/news/78455/isaf-responds-use-aan-news-releases-study">issued a press release</a> (!) in which they stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Release of information in insurgent warfare is not always made public, so studies based on the use of press releases can be both incomplete and problematic. […] Authoritative research cannot be conducted through mere analysis of press releases, since the release of information through such releases is, by design, incomplete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So reading the press releases is very much an exercise in reading between the lines. In the press release cited earlier, all the numbers are specific (“a facilitator”, “a male”, “two insurgents”) so it’s easy to put numbers to how many were killed or captured. In many of the press releases, particularly during times where raids were being conducted at a very high tempo, you have to just take assumptions about what their words mean and assign minimum values to those words.</p>
<p>So ‘a couple’ meant at least two, but ‘a few’ meant 3 or more. Similarly ‘dozens’ means multiple dozens so that meant a minimum value of at least 24. From the original report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a press release said that ‘insurgents’ were detained, without further details, we assigned that incident as having a minimum number of 2 detained (since we could not be sure of more). ‘A couple’ we took to mean 2. ‘Several’ we took to mean at least 3, even though on other occasions ‘several’ was used to refer to 7 or 8. Other terms we classified as denoting at least 3 included: ‘a few’, ‘some’, ‘a group’, ‘a small group’ and ‘multiple’; these terms sometimes were used to refer to far larger numbers but we chose the smaller number (if no other information was available in the press release) in order to come up with a minimally acceptable figure. ‘Numerous’ and ‘a handful’ we took to mean at least 4, and ‘a large number’ at least 5.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reports mostly referred to events that had taken place that day or the day before, but occasionally they’d refer to events that took place “last Thursday” or “last week” and so then you’d have to know what day the press release was issued and then make calculations accordingly. For this backwards-referring time assignations, I’m particularly interested (read: concerned!) to know how well my LLMs did. Whatever score we get, it’s probably fixable with a bit of manual parsing and logic, but we need to know if there’s a problem or not first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking there were province names assigned to incidents (all but 23, to be precise) but when they weren’t, then the LLM has to work back from a village name, potentially, or just specify that an incident took place in southern Afghanistan or Afghanistan as a whole. On a few occasions, the press release actually made an error, stating that village X or Y was in a particular province, when this was incorrect and it was in a different province. So for this, would we expect the LLM to assign the event to the correct province for that village, or just retain the error in the press release?</p>
<p>Sometimes a press release might refer to an event having taken place “in the provincial capital of X province” but without mentioning that city by name. So the LLM will have to have some knowledge of these things and I want to test how well it performs with this.</p>
<p>These might seem like tiny errors to get wrong, but for a project like this (where my report was making some strong accusations and drawing certain conclusions based on the data), it wouldn’t do to get things factually wrong. For an internal-facing LLM-powered chatbot, the price of mistakes is minimal, but for a project like this, there are potentially far more serious consequences which is why I’m putting together such detailed evaluations.</p>
</section>
<section id="spelling-variation">
<h2 data-anchor-id="spelling-variation">Spelling variation</h2>
<p>Another issue with some of the press releases is that they use a variety of spellings for the same locations or names of individuals. For some things — province names, for example — it makes sense to standardise on a fixed naming convention but for others it’s not always clear what to do. So our evaluation should ensure that common variations of certain provinces or designations or names are captured correctly by the LLM output.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-stories">
<h2 data-anchor-id="complex-stories">Complex stories</h2>
<p>Some stories are very complicated and there may be no correct way to assign numbers, for example, to the text that was published. In those cases when annotating I often just left the minimum numbers at zero even though we know that <em>something</em> happened. Would the LLM also make the same call? What is the threshold for deciding not to take a chance on making a guess?</p>
</section>
<section id="next-step">
<h2 data-anchor-id="next-step">Next step</h2>
<p>The obvious next step is to actually code up these evaluation criteria and run those across our fine-tuned LLMs as well as the API-driven proprietary ones. I’ll be working on that over the coming days. Luckily, I did most of the work to identify all of the above when I first wrote the report so there isn’t much ground that needs to be broken so much as just sitting down and getting it done.</p>

<p>Google Sheets is one of the first products at Google to use WasmGC on Chrome. The move was announced in 2022, and the Sheets and Chrome teams partnered on standardization, engineering, and tooling to provide real-time feedback on optimizations. This partnership set a precedent for how engineering teams at Google can effectively work with Chrome to have more Google apps running on WasmGC.</p>

<h2 id="the_challenge_javascript" data-text="The challenge: JavaScript" tabindex="-1">The challenge: JavaScript</h2>

<p>The Google Sheets calculation engine was originally written in Java and launched in 2006. In the early days of the product, all calculation happened on the server. However, from 2013, the engine has run in the browser using JavaScript. This was originally accomplished through Google Web Toolkit (<a href="https://www.gwtproject.org/">GWT</a>), and later through Java to Closure JavaScript transpiler (<a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/">J2CL</a>). The JavaScript calculation engine runs in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Worker</a> and communicates with the main thread using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MessageChannel"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">MessageChannel</code></a>.</p>

<p>Migrating users from the server to the JavaScript version of the calculation engine (and later from GWT to J2CL) was a major undertaking that required careful validation. To ensure that the JavaScript calculation engine produced precisely the same results as the Java version, the Sheets team developed an internal validation mechanism. This mechanism can process a large corpus of sheets and validate that the results are identical between multiple versions of the calculation engine. The Sheets team uses this tool regularly to validate changes to Sheets. But the team didn't just compare the results of those calculations, they also compared the performance between JavaScript on the client and Java on the server. They found that the JavaScript version of the calculation engine was more than three times slower than the Java version.</p>

<h3 id="why_is_javascript_slower_than_java" data-text="Why is JavaScript slower than Java?" tabindex="-1">Why is JavaScript slower than Java?</h3>

<p>JavaScript is fast for a loosely-typed, dynamic language. Heavy investment in just-in-time (JIT) compilers (for example, <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/maglev">Maglev</a>, <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug">Sparkplug</a>, and <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/turbofan-jit">Turbofan</a>) over the past 15 years has increased JavaScript's performance. However, JavaScript's loose types and dynamic behavior make it challenging for JIT compilers to generate optimal code. This means JavaScript still lags behind languages like Java and C++ for raw throughput. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> adds type safety to JavaScript, but that type information is designed to make development easier, not to provide the sorts of guarantees needed by compilers to generate optimal code. For cases like Google Sheets, where large spreadsheets can take tens of seconds to calculate, JavaScript is fast, but not fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="the_solution_wasmgc" data-text="The Solution: WasmGC" tabindex="-1">The Solution: WasmGC</h2>

<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasmgc/">WasmGC</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc">extension</a> to the existing <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> specification which adds the primitives needed to compile garbage collected languages (such as Java). For example, WasmGC adds instructions for defining types and allocating garbage collected data structures. WasmGC is poised to do for garbage collected languages what Wasm did for C++ (for example, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web#webassembly_porting_with_emscripten">Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://web.dev/case-studies/earth-webassembly">Google Earth</a>), which is to bring them to the web at near native speed. At Google, we believe that WasmGC has the potential to be even more impactful than Wasm because of the popularity of garbage collected languages.</p>

<h2 id="google_workspace_partners_with_chrome" data-text="Google Workspace partners with Chrome" tabindex="-1">Google Workspace partners with Chrome</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/MVP.md">WasmGC MVP draft specification</a> was published in 2019. In late 2020, Google Workspace and Chrome partnered to evaluate WasmGC using the Sheets calculation engine. Workspace's multiplatform team has significant expertise building and optimizing compilers and transpilers. Sheets, a part of Workspace, was identified as an ideal candidate for evaluating WasmGC: it is performance-sensitive and has robust performance and correctness validation mechanisms. Chrome has the <a href="http://v8.dev/">V8</a> team to build and optimize the WasmGC runtime as well as contributors to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">Binaryen</a> to build ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizations. Between Chrome and Workspace, there's all the expertise needed to build and optimize a WasmGC toolchain, with Google Sheets as an ideal testbed.</p>

<h3 id="the_first_prototype" data-text="The first prototype" tabindex="-1">The first prototype</h3>

<p>By mid 2021, the teams had a working <a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/tree/master/samples/wasm">Java to WasmGC compiler</a>. Toward the end of the same year, they had a prototype version of Google Sheets running as WasmGC and doing calculations. Along the way, they hit many challenges. Tooling for profiling and taking heap dumps did not exist and had to be built. The existing implementation relied on many JavaScript libraries for which replacements had to be found or written for WasmGC. Validating the correctness of the Wasm calculation engine was a time-consuming effort due to the experimental nature of the specification, compiler, and new libraries. But Sheets' validation mechanisms were once again extremely helpful. The teams ultimately got it all working, and performance data started coming in early 2022.</p>

<h3 id="additional_optimizations" data-text="Additional optimizations" tabindex="-1">Additional optimizations</h3>

<p>The initial version of Sheets Wasm showed calculation performance roughly two times <em>slower</em> than JavaScript. However, this isn't a bad result for a new specification, new compiler, and several new libraries. From this point, the Sheets team began optimizing. Of the optimizations they found, a few categories emerged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replicating core optimizations that already existed in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and in V8.</li>
<li>Using highly optimized browser APIs.</li>
<li>Removing JavaScript-specific coding patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, the Sheets team needed to replicate optimizations which already exist in other toolchains. The best example of this is optimizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">virtual method dispatching</a>, which has long been optimized by the JVM and V8, but nothing existed for WasmGC. Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching">speculative inlining</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/ConstantFieldPropagation.cpp">devirtualization</a>—two very common optimizations—sped up calculation time by roughly 40% in Chrome.</p>

<p>Second, there are cases where browser APIs are backed by optimized native implementations that are difficult to compete with using Wasm. Strings and regular expressions are two good examples. Specifically, with regular expressions, the team saw nearly a 100 times speedup of regular expression operations when switching from <a href="https://github.com/google/re2j">re2j</a> (compiled to WasmGC) to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">RegExp</code></a> browser API in Chrome, which can compile each regular expression to its own machine code.</p>

<p>Lastly, they found that years of optimizing had caused the codebase to be over-fitted to JavaScript. For example, they had a core data structure in Sheets which was blurring the lines between arrays and maps. This is efficient in JavaScript, which automatically models sparse arrays as maps, but slow on other platforms. So they had to rewrite the code in a more platform-agnostic way. This is another thing the team like about WebAssembly: it makes it easier for multiplatform applications to get good performance on the web. You don't have to bend your whole application to the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion" data-text="Conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>

<p>WasmGC is a powerful technology that has the potential to advance the way developers build web applications. Over the coming years, at Google, we hope to see WasmGC advance to support <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5163209685467136">shared memory multithreading</a> and further improve single threaded performance.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lawyers for the Post Office arranged a secret meeting with a judge to prevent disclosure to defence solicitors in a criminal trial, the&nbsp;Post Office Inquiry heard yesterday.&nbsp; Solicitor Martin Smith and his barrister colleague Simon Clarke met the judge at Birmingham Crown Court in 2013 on the eve of a trial of a sub-postmaster accused of theft.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the interim report by forensic accountants Second Sight had revealed potential problems with the Horizon system which had been the basis for previous prosecutions.</p>
<p>The prosecuting lawyers applied for public interest immunity on the report, successfully persuading the judge that the defence solicitors should not be made aware of it.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the inquiry, Smith accepted he was the instructing solicitor on the case but stressed he was only present at the meeting to take notes and he could not remember any details of what was said to the judge.</p>
<p>The inquiry heard of several issues with disclosure as the Post Office and its representatives approached the mediation scheme and potential reviews of past convictions.</p>
<p>In the case of north Wales sub-postmaster Noel Thomas, who had been jailed in 2006 for false accounting, Smith suggested that an investigation report from the time should not be disclosed to him when it was reviewed in 2014. If it was to be disclosed, the inquiry heard, it should be heavily redacted – and Smith himself had written that Thomas should not be shown a Post Office note from 2005 which noted that operator Fujitsu was testing the reliability of Horizon.</p>
<p>‘Such a [note] may well invite a request for disclosure of the test results,’ Smith had emailed a colleague. ‘There may also be a risk that [Thomas] will suggest the investigation was inadequate or incomplete.’</p>
<p>On another occasion, Smith and Bond Dickinson’s Andy Parsons discussed whether disclosure might give a ‘ticket to the Court of Appeal’ to Seema Misra, who had been wrongly convicted in 2010 while she was pregnant with her second child.</p>
<p>Smith admitted that he had not complied with his duties as a prosecuting solicitor to ensure that the Post Office expert witness was aware of his obligations. He accepted he did not have the ‘requisite skill and expertise’ for the role he was in and did not know why Cartwright King had been given the task of handling Post Office prosecutions.</p>
<p>‘Quite why Cartwright King thought it was appropriate to take on this prosecution with hindsight I have no idea, because we certainly didn’t have the training for it,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘I was simply not aware of the duties on a prosecutor to make sure an expert witness was fully aware of their duties.’</p>
<p>He added that the approach to expert witnesses was ‘undoubtedly not compliant.’</p>
<p>The inquiry continues.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>However, CSS Anchor Posititioning can be used for more than just popovers and tooltips, it can be used to create basic flow chart diagrams. In this post we will learn how to use CSS Anchor Positioning to create flow charts and diagram with just CSS.</p>

<p>To create our first anchored element we need to provide a name to div "one" so we can reference it. Anchor names must be unique and start with two dashes <code>--</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>.one</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --anchor-one<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Next we need to provide the anchor positioning for div "two". We will use <code>anchor(--anchor-one top)</code> to position div "two" relative to the top of div "one".</p>
<pre><code><span>.two</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>position-anchor</span><span>:</span> --anchor-one<span>;</span><br>  <span>bottom</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--anchor-one top<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>justify-self</span><span>:</span> anchor-center<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We assign the div "two" bottom position to the top of div "one" using <code>anchor(--anchor-one top)</code>. We also use <code>justify-self: anchor-center</code> to center div "two" horizontally relative to div "one". We can position any side of dive "two" to any side of div "one" using the same syntax (top, left, bottom, right).</p>

<p>With CSS Anchor Positioning we can anchor an element to two other elements at the same time.</p>

<p>Just like div "one" we assign an anchor name to div "two" for our new third div to reference.</p>
<pre><code><span>.one</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --anchor-one<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>.two</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --anchor-two<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>The third div can now reference anchors one and two for positioning. To poisition div "three" to the center of both divs "one" and "two", we use the <code>anchor()</code> function for each side of the element. We can position any side of div "three" to any side of either div "one" or "two".</p>
<p>In this instance we are using <code>center</code> instead of a side to position relative to. This creates a overlap effect for the anchors.</p>
<pre><code><span>.three</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>top</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--anchor-one center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>bottom</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--anchor-two center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--anchor-one center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--anchor-two center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>Using what we leanered with anchor positioning we can create a basic flow chart.</p>

<p>Using the same technique by anchoring an element between two nodes we can create a flow chart like effect with some additional CSS tricks.</p>

<pre><code><span>.line</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --line<span>;</span><br>  <span>top</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--one center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>bottom</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--two center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--one center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--two center<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>position</span><span>:</span> absolute<span>;</span><br>  <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> -1<span>;</span><br>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>linear-gradient</span><span>(</span>#2d2d2d<span>,</span> #2d2d2d<span>)</span> no-repeat center/2px 100%<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>This approach can be expanded on by providing additional nodes and chaining the anchors. However when we add additional lines we need to flip the line directions depending on the nodes relative position to the anchor. The CSS <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api/#adjust_anchor_positions_with_position-try">position-try-options</a> allows a easy way to declare fallback positions to use if the element can't be rendered within the provided space relative to the anchor.</p>

But it basically did what I needed?  Except for…  man, look at that Y axis.  This cannot stand!</p><p>Bad axes marking is a personal bugaboo — I hate them sooo much!  But it’s easy to understand how they end up that way, because it’s a genuinely tricky problem.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.jpeg" alt="" width="262" height="338" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.jpeg 262w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-233x300.jpeg 233w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"></a></p><p>For instance, for decades Google Finance had charts looking like this, with totally nonsensical axes.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-1.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-1.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="500" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-1.jpeg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-1-180x300.jpeg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>They basically just use the largest number as the highest Y marking, and then add a couple lines equidistant towards origo, and then go off and collect their paychecks.</p><p>These useless charts were there until, I think, 2021?  I used to check them irregularly for years to see whether they’d gotten sufficiently embarrassed by this shameful thing, but nope.  But then they reimplemented the entire site, and they finally got proper axes.</p><p>I was particularly interested because I worked for a stock broker, and one of the first things I did (back in 1997-ish) was implementing a <a href="https://quimby.gnus.org/circus/chart/chart-manual.php" data-cached-time="2024-06-20T20:33:04" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ewp7XjR7e.png" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">chart library</a>:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>And the problem isn’t exactly “hard” in a “solve for Eulers dilemma” maths way, but it just requires some thought about what “pleasing numbers” are (basically 1, 2 and 5 in various scales), and thoughtful handling of the many border cases you get when plotting stock charts (a range can be between $0.00001 and $0.00002, or between 1e9 and 1e10 etc etc), and how do to time periods (years, sure, but then half years and then quarters and months and weeks? and then possibly divide months into weeks? so many details).</p><p>So why didn’t I just use this PHP thing for my charts?  Well, while it’s really convenient to generate stuff on a web server — that’s not really very convenient when you’re futzing around in Emacs with some numbers.  There’s a reason Excel and Jiputer Notebooks are so popular, after all — interactively massaging the data until it shows what you want it to show is where it’s at.  I mean, giving others an optimal experience of the data.</p><p>Now, of course <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html" data-cached-time="2024-06-20T20:33:12" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ewpbrLPk8.png" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">Org</a> has functions for doing plots, but…  it uses Gnuplot as the backend, and I’ve never enjoyed how Gnuplot does anything:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="602" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4.jpeg 1512w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4-300x215.jpeg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4-1024x735.jpeg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4-768x551.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>Again, look at that Y axis and roll your eyes.  I mean, it’s chosen nice numbers for the axis, but the formatting?</p><p>I mean, Gnuplot is perfectly OK, but…</p><p>But mainly, I had a stomach bug thing, so I didn’t really have anything to do, so I decided to type up this thing anyway.  So:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1.png" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1.png 400w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1-300x300.png 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p><p>Look!  The Y axis!  It has numbers that make sense!</p><p>And…  I wasn’t really going to implement everything from <tt>chart.php</tt>, but when I got started, it was just irresistible to do everything.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.jpeg" alt="" width="468" height="312" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.jpeg 468w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></a></p><p>But also more, like “dark mode”.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-3.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-3.jpeg" alt="" width="472" height="313" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-3.jpeg 472w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-3-300x199.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px"></a></p><p>One fun thing in the PHP library are the gradients, which were painstakingly written by hand (including a GIF colour map resource thing, if I remember correctly).  So they were painted pixel by pixel, I think?  But in the Emacs Lisp version, I just use SVG, and SVG has support for gradients.  So I just make a polygon and gradient that (as shown above).</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>And here’s the PHP original.  Looks pretty similar?</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>Just about the only thing I didn’t implement was this other, weird gradient, because…  er…  well, it would be hard!  I’d have to re-implement the pixel by pixel thing…  or at least line by line thing, and that would involve math and stuff.</p><p>But it’s not like anybody would use that…</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>But it does look nice in the backgrounds?  *sigh*  Nah, not gonna implement it.</p><p>So what does the Emacs user interface for this look like?</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="983" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4.jpeg 1499w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-256x300.jpeg 256w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-875x1024.jpeg 875w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-768x899.jpeg 768w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-1312x1536.jpeg 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>You go to a buffer with a lot of numbers in, and you type <tt>M-x eplot</tt>.  (Yes, I had to call the thing <tt>eplot</tt>, since <tt>chart</tt> was taken.)</p><p>It’ll then pop up a buffer and show the plot.</p><p>But how do you then adjust the plot?  After all, the point of all this is that it should be easy to tweak plots until you get what you want, so…</p><p>To digress a bit — sometimes I happen upon what seems to be nice libraries (or frameworks, as they often call themselves), and the selling point is often “we do all the boring stuff for you!  Things just work!”  And then they present a minimal example, like I’ve done here, and then they sort of leave it hanging how you do the rest.</p><p>So when you google that, you discover that if you want to change any of the defaults, you have to write a depth-first traversal algorithm (in Haskell), and then override all of the stuff everywhere, and then you end up with 4x as much code as if you’d just written the darn thing yourself the way you wanted it.</p><p>That is: Many frameworks seem to actually have the motto “we make the simple things trivial, and then the slightly more difficult things almost impossible”.</p><p>So — I hope I haven’t landed there myself?</p><p>OK, the first “extra” thing I did was introduce the concept of “headers”, like this:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-5.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-5.jpeg" alt="" width="549" height="695" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-5.jpeg 549w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-5-237x300.jpeg 237w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px"></a></p><p>I’m using a compact format with a small chart, just as a demonstration here — don’t need all that scrolling on the blog here.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-6.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-6.jpeg" alt="" width="514" height="656" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-6.jpeg 514w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-6-235x300.jpeg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></a></p><p>And that’s basically it — most of the different variations you see in the very first image on this blog post are by these simple headers thingies.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-7.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-7.jpeg" alt="" width="520" height="667" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-7.jpeg 520w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-7-234x300.jpeg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"></a></p><p>All the useful things can be controlled by these headers, so iterating through this stuff is fast — just add some headers and <tt>C-c C-c</tt> and then you immediately see the results.  (Yes, there’s an <tt>eplot</tt> mode to make this easier.)</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-8.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-8.jpeg" alt="" width="516" height="659" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-8.jpeg 516w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-8-235x300.jpeg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px"></a></p><p>Yada yada.  I’ve even written a README.md file that documents all the various possibilities.</p><p>This is still very much a work in progress, but I’ve put it on <a href="https://github.com/larsmagne/eplot" data-cached-time="2024-06-26T16:34:43" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ewpqTOLvE.png" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">Microsoft Github</a>.  I think it should basically be somewhat useful now, but I’ve been hacking away at this for a week now, and I keep redoing everything, so perhaps not?  In any case, the code is a complete mess now as I’ve been programming it test case by test case, in the least efficient way possible, and I need to consolidate a lot of code paths, and make the code more readable.</p><p>But I feel like taking a break now, so I just pushed it.  So there.  Caveat end userage.</p></div></div>]]></description>

For reference, I'm using Arch Linux and Wine 8.20, however these instructions should work just as well on other distros too with a similar Wine version.</p><div>

<p><strong><span>Installation</span></strong></p><p>

Unfortunately, Adobe Creative Cloud - i.e. the main installer hub for Adobe software - does not currently work on Wine. Thankfully, Adobe apps are not picky about running from the same place they were installed from, and can therefore be copied straight from a Windows install with few issues.</p><ol>
<li>Set up a Windows VM (or computer) if you don't have one already. Either Windows 10 or 11 should be fine.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/creative-cloud">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> and use it to install Photoshop.
<ul>
<li>This process will require an Adobe account, and may ask for a credit card even if you're only installing the free trial. A tool called <a href="https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper">CCStopper</a> can be used to bypass the credit card check.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once Photoshop has finished installing, you'll now want to transfer the following folders from your Windows computer into your Wine prefix:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe
</code></pre></div>
These folders are essential. If you get an error that says "Could not complete your request because Photoshop was unable to communicate with Creative Cloud Desktop.", adding the second folder should fix it (note it's the "Common Files" folder in "Program Files (x86)" specifically, not just "Program Files").
<ul>
<li>Optionally, you may want to grab the following folder(s) too, though they don't affect basic operation (they appear to contain lens profiles for Camera Raw):
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once those folders are in place in your Wine prefix, you'll also need to transplant some DLLs from Windows too. Grab the following files from Windows and place them in your "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024" folder:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\CoreMessaging.dll
C:\Windows\system32\netapi32.dll
C:\Windows\system32\msvcp110_win.dll
C:\Windows\system32\dsreg.dll
C:\Windows\system32\srvcli.dll
C:\Windows\system32\wkscli.dll
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>CoreMessaging is a WinRT DLL that's simply missing in Wine. Simply copying it over seems to do the trick.</li>
<li>netapi32 must be replaced to fix a random yet frequent crash that occurs when Photoshop tries to phone home. For the record, it attempts to contact "ic.adobe.io/service/status/v1" for unknown reasons. All remaining DLLs are required dependencies of Windows' version of netapi32.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You'll need to add a DLL override for netapi32.dll. To do this, open "winecfg" (in your Wine prefix), browse to the "Libraries" tab, and add "netapi32" as a new override. It should be set to "native, builtin".

<li>Photoshop should now launch, however it'll present you with a broken login page. At this time, I'm not sure if there's any way to get it to accept login information correctly. For this reason, you'll probably need to bypass this using <a href="https://github.com/cw2k/Adobe-GenP">GenP</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, run the following <a href="https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/">Winetricks</a> to improve Photoshop's appearance/user interface:
</li>
<li>Done! If everything went correctly, you should now have a functional Photoshop 2024 build on Linux!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span>Known Issues</span></strong></p><p>

Currently an issue prevents Photoshop from using OpenCL, meaning regardless of your GPU's capabilities, Photoshop will use software rendering only. This means it will run somewhat slower than it otherwise would on the same hardware.</p><p>

Adobe Premiere currently has the same issue, and I'd like to try investigating this further at some point, but currently have no real information about why it happens or how to fix it.</p><hr><p>

I hope this tutorial was helpful, enjoy Photoshopping!</p></div>

			<div><p>First of all, amazing that you took the time to write down the process for others to potentially follow.</p><p>

Secondly, I tried getting PS2024 running like this and ran into a hand full of issues.</p><p>

For one, even after copying all the files you listed it still cried about missing a bunch of additional dlls, which I of course did not have the foresight to write down before getting them.<br>
I am also now running into a problem where it still cries for </p><p> and </p><div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>api-ms-win-core-localization-ansi-l1-1-0.dll</code></pre></div><p> despite them being already there and even getting different versions from different sources does not change that it complains.</p><p>

However what I expect to be the issue here, largely because I do not know what it's talking about and googling just spitting out worthless reviews of azure, is the following error message preceding the remaining dll complaints.
</p><div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>00ec:err:module:find_forwarded_export module not found for forward 'DSREG.DsrGetJoinInfo' used by L"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Photoshop 2024\\netapi32.dll"</code></pre></div><p>

Any help and ideas naturally appreciated.</p></div>

			<div><p>First of all, which version of Wine are you using? It's possible you might need more DLLs on older versions than mine.</p><p>

Secondly, the "DSREG.DsrGetJoinInfo" error <em>should</em> be solved by transplanting "dsreg.dll". Perhaps you need to add another DLL override for that? Did you get your Windows DLLs from Windows 10 or Windows 11? From memory, I got mine from Windows 10, perhaps the Windows 11 DLLs have different requirements.</p><p>

Finally, try running "winetricks vcrun2022" in your prefix. I didn't have to do that on mine, but maybe other setups need it.</p></div>

			<div><p>Well now I feel moderately stupid.<br>
I was using <span>wine-6.0.3</span> which appears to have been the issue indeed.<br>
I had already resigned myself to accepting that CS6 has already been running without any problems and is really all I need anyway.<br>
But as is the brain of a nerd, it wouldn't leave me alone and I upgraded wine to <span>wine-8.0.2</span> which still required me to get <span>msvcp140_codecvt_ids.dll</span> but then immediately ran as expected.</p><p>

So I guess we can assume with moderate certainty that wine 8 is indeed a requirement. Or at least anything later than 6.</p></div>

I *think* msvcp140_codecvt_ids.dll comes with one of the vcruns, I should double check and maybe add that to the OP.</p></div>

			<div><p>That may well be the case, yeah. I only tried to run <span>winetricks vcrun2022</span> while still on wine 6 which just complained about invalid arguments so I didn't even think to try again after updating wine.<br>
Either way just getting the dll file online was evidently enough.</p><p>

However I have noticed some rather odd behavior.<br>
While Photoshop 2024 now launches and, as far as I can tell, runs as it should... it doesn't close as it should.<br>
I was playing around wanting to switch between 2024 and CS6 (the latter of which btw seamlessly integrates in my system and can launch .psd files while 2024 merely starts and complains) when I suddenly could not launch either version anymore.<br>
Come to find out, 2024 simply did not actually shut down, meaning it didn't see a reason to start when told to. Similarly preventing CS6 from starting too.</p><p>

When I launch 2024 <span>Main Thread</span>, <span>Adobe Crash Pro</span> and <span>wine</span> processes launch. (sometimes wine does not appear and <span>Main Thread</span> is just called <span>Photoshop.exe</span> but otherwise the behavior is identical)<br>
When closing 2024 by any means other than killing the process directly, the window disappears but none of the mentioned processes do. <span>Main Thread</span> does reduce CPU usage to 0.06 though.<br>
Interestingly also, killing <span>wine</span> or <span>Main Thread</span> also kills the other while <span>Adobe Crash Pro</span> just doesn't care. While I don't see a significance here, it's interesting to note.</p><p>

On the other hand CS6 just launches one <span>Photoshop.exe</span> process and dies just as it should when closed.</p><p>

While having to kill at least two processes by hand isn't a major issue as long as the software runs fine, it could be something to note for others who might end up wondering why they could only start photoshop once and don't think to check for processes.<br>
Me being not very well versed in the way linux and wine operate at this point (I've been running Mint for about a year now), I'm also not certain if this is a configuration issue or just a result of us doing something that is not meant to be done.</p></div>

			<p>Massive thumbs up for this guide, I can't help but notice just how ridiculously good Linux is getting on the desktop lately. No doubt that a lot more technically minded people are going to start to make the switch.</p>

			<p>Do you know the requirements for other creative cloud applications such as illustrator or indesign? Technically I can get some of those launched as well but all of them except photoshop has errors that either make it unusable, crashes instantly, or fails to fully launch. So there must be some requirements for those other ones that I'm missing. Illustrator can launch but the interface is completely broken and bugged to the point where it's technically usable if you've memorised every button, but that's just a pain.</p>

			<div><p>Wanted to drop my thanks for writing this guide. Krita is nice, but I'm just too attached to Photoshop for certain tasks.</p><p>

Photoshop seems to work fine for the most part, but there is a strange issue with the Liquify window -- when you hover any UI element, every control will "grey out" as if they are disabled.</p><p>

I think, normally, this is supposed to happen when the window loses focus. It seems like hovering over any UI element seems to make Photoshop think the Liquify window has lost focus. Maybe its an issue with my window manager (KWin)?</p><p>

The one liquify brush I can select works fine, though, so it seems like the only issue is the UI bugging out.</p><div>

</p></div></blockquote><p>

Hey, thanks! This does seem to make the GPU work, however it does break the Liquify tool for me, citing a "disk error". </p><p>

Speaking of, disabling tooltips altogether seems to fix the Liquify window losing focus when hovering over stuff. Another workaround if you're using KDE is to set mouse focus to be under the cursor exclusively, but that's a bit hacky and it's annoying if you don't want that behavior enabled all the time.</p></div>

The following is instructions on getting the (currently) latest version of Photoshop running on Wine.</p><p>

For reference, I'm using Arch Linux and Wine 8.20, however these instructions should work just as well on other distros too with a similar Wine version.</p><p>Screenshot_20231115_222420.png</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><span>Installation</span></strong></p><p>

Unfortunately, Adobe Creative Cloud - i.e. the main installer hub for Adobe software - does not currently work on Wine. Thankfully, Adobe apps are not picky about running from the same place they were installed from, and can therefore be copied straight from a Windows install with few issues.</p><ol>
<li>Set up a Windows VM (or computer) if you don't have one already. Either Windows 10 or 11 should be fine.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/creative-cloud">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> and use it to install Photoshop.
<ul>
<li>This process will require an Adobe account, and may ask for a credit card even if you're only installing the free trial. A tool called <a href="https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper">CCStopper</a> can be used to bypass the credit card check.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once Photoshop has finished installing, you'll now want to transfer the following folders from your Windows computer into your Wine prefix:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe
</code></pre></div>
These folders are essential. If you get an error that says "Could not complete your request because Photoshop was unable to communicate with Creative Cloud Desktop.", adding the second folder should fix it (note it's the "Common Files" folder in "Program Files (x86)" specifically, not just "Program Files").
<ul>
<li>Optionally, you may want to grab the following folder(s) too, though they don't affect basic operation (they appear to contain lens profiles for Camera Raw):
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once those folders are in place in your Wine prefix, you'll also need to transplant some DLLs from Windows too. Grab the following files from Windows and place them in your "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024" folder:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\CoreMessaging.dll
C:\Windows\system32\netapi32.dll
C:\Windows\system32\msvcp110_win.dll
C:\Windows\system32\dsreg.dll
C:\Windows\system32\srvcli.dll
C:\Windows\system32\wkscli.dll
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>CoreMessaging is a WinRT DLL that's simply missing in Wine. Simply copying it over seems to do the trick.</li>
<li>netapi32 must be replaced to fix a random yet frequent crash that occurs when Photoshop tries to phone home. For the record, it attempts to contact "ic.adobe.io/service/status/v1" for unknown reasons. All remaining DLLs are required dependencies of Windows' version of netapi32.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You'll need to add a DLL override for netapi32.dll. To do this, open "winecfg" (in your Wine prefix), browse to the "Libraries" tab, and add "netapi32" as a new override. It should be set to "native, builtin".
<p>Screenshot_20231115_222101.png</p></li>
<li>Photoshop should now launch, however it'll present you with a broken login page. At this time, I'm not sure if there's any way to get it to accept login information correctly. For this reason, you'll probably need to bypass this using <a href="https://github.com/cw2k/Adobe-GenP">GenP</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, run the following <a href="https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/">Winetricks</a> to improve Photoshop's appearance/user interface:
</li>
<li>Done! If everything went correctly, you should now have a functional Photoshop 2024 build on Linux!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span>Known Issues</span></strong></p><p>

Currently an issue prevents Photoshop from using OpenCL, meaning regardless of your GPU's capabilities, Photoshop will use software rendering only. This means it will run somewhat slower than it otherwise would on the same hardware.</p><p>

Adobe Premiere currently has the same issue, and I'd like to try investigating this further at some point, but currently have no real information about why it happens or how to fix it.</p><hr><p>

I hope this tutorial was helpful, enjoy Photoshopping!

<p>First on LateNighter: One of the richest repositories of late-night videos is no longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ComedyCentral.com had been home to clips from every episode of <em>The Daily Show</em> since 1999, and the entire run of<em> The Colbert Report</em>, but as of Wednesday morning, the site is gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, visitors to the Comedy Central site are greeted with this message: “While episodes of most Comedy Central series are no longer available on this website, you can watch Comedy Central through your TV provider. You can also sign up for Paramount+ to watch many seasons of Comedy Central shows.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately for those in search of older episodes of <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-daily-show/">The Daily Show</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-colbert-report/">The Colbert Report</a></em>, neither can be found on Paramount+.</p>



<p>Other content lost in the purge were clips and full episodes of other short-lived late-night entries like <em>The Opposition with Jordan Klepper</em>, <em>The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</em>, the Chris Hardwick-hosted <em>@midnight</em> (predecessor to <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/after-midnight">After Midnight</a></em>), and <em>Lights Out with David Spade</em>.</p>



<p>This morning’s closure of ComedyCentral.com comes days after two other Paramount-owned sites—MTV.com and CMT.com—<a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also went dark</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move would appear to be part of continued belt-tightening measures at Paramount, which is more than $14 billion in debt, led by losses at Paramount+ and its aging cable networks. The company had been in merger talks with Skydance up until earlier this month when Shari Redstone, Paramount’s largest shareholder, is reported to have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/paramount-special-committee-meets-vote-skydance-deal-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-06-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed the deal</a> at the eleventh hour.</p>



<p>Those hoping to view clips from Comedy Central’s golden age of late-night programming will still find some clips on YouTube, but nothing near the complete collection that had been available on ComedyCentral.com.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars, and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether there was an ounce of truth in it.</p><p>I was running a profitable tech PR agency. It looked impressive enough on LinkedIn. It paid for fancy dinners and weekend getaways. I had the clients, the connections, and a couple of shiny awards gathering dust on my bookshelf. My phone buzzed constantly.</p><p>But something was starting to unravel.</p><p>Like a loose thread on a comfortable sweater. You know you shouldn't pull on it, but you can't help yourself.</p><p>A nagging doubt. An odd moment of <em>"Jesus, what the hell am I doing?"</em></p><p>I would lie awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It had been years since I'd displayed a shred of journalistic integrity. </p><p>The thread kept unraveling.</p><p>One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release touting yet another "game-changing" startup that had raised - yet another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn't remember the last time I'd written something I believed in. The words that used to flow felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty tube.</p><p>That was the day I cracked.</p><p>It wasn't about the individual startups or the overhyped products. It was the whole damn ecosystem—if we can call it that. The inflated valuations, cult-like frat house “culture,” and the relentless, mindless pursuit of growth that comfortably glossed over the human cost of "disruption."</p><p>Somewhere along the way, I'd allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex. I'd convinced myself that I was part of something bigger, something world-changing. But deep down, in the quiet moments between pitch meetings and product launches, I knew better.</p><p>It was a slow-building wave, gathering momentum with every story I was hired to spin, every tone-deaf founder I media-trained to sidestep hard questions, every time I was asked to massage the numbers and make a struggling startup look like a unicorn in waiting.</p><p>Going back to my roots as a writer felt like coming up for air after a long, deep dive in a river of shit. The first few months were disorienting as hell. It's tough adjusting to life outside the echo chamber. I've had to relearn how to write without an agenda, how to ask questions without anticipating the "right" answers, how to look at the tech industry with clear eyes.</p><p>There are days when I question my decision—when I gather up the courage to look at my dwindling bank account, for example. Tech has a way of tempting you back, whispering sweet nothings about stock options and catered lunches.</p><p>Well-meaning friends in the industry have texted, called, emailed. They've told me that I'm burning bridges, that a critical stance will make me unemployable in tech circles. They've advised me to soften my tone, to find a middle ground that won't alienate potential future employers or clients.</p><p>I get it. I do. In an industry built on network effects, taking a stand can feel like career suicide. The pressure to conform, to go along with the prevailing narrative, is immense. Trust me, I know.</p><p>But then I sit down to write, and I remember why the fuck I'm doing this. I write about the human cost of gig economy apps that treat workers as disposable resources. I write about the venture capital industry that repeatedly and stubbornly fails to invest in anyone who doesn't look like Mark Zuckerberg's clone.</p><p>I can't go back to writing comforting VC pandering fictions. I won't do it, no matter how many zeroes are dangled in front of me.</p><p>This isn't to say that I've become an anti-tech fanatic, railing against all notions of progress. Technology has potential when it's guided by ethical considerations and a genuine desire to improve the human condition. I've spent the last 6 months interviewing founders who are building companies without following the VC playbook, without setting fire to the world around them.</p><p>But I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a blind pursuit of "disruption" will lead us to a better world.</p><p>I've seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders' vision. I've watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started their companies in the first place.</p><p>I'm reminded of a quote attributed to Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." For years, my salary—and my sense of self-worth—depended on not understanding the deeper implications of my work. I can't keep faking blameless ignorance.</p><p>I don't know where this will lead me. The tech industry has a long memory.</p><p>So it goes.</p><p>At least I have my integrity. The machine may grind on, but I'm glad to have stepped off the treadmill.</p><p>Howard Zinn said: "You can't be neutral on a moving train." Tech is an out-of-control locomotive with no fucking brakes, and I've chosen where I stand. It may not be a comfortable or lucrative position, but it's one I can live with.</p><p>And for the first time in years, when I look in the mirror, I can recognize the person looking back. That's worth all the stock options in the world.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The API cost is $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.</p><p>This completes the trifecta. All of OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic have kept their biggest and more expensive model static for now, and instead focused on making something faster and cheaper that is good enough to be the main model.</p><p>You would only use another model if you either (1) needed a smaller model in which case Gemini 1.5 Flash seems best, or (2) it must have open model weights.  </p><p>Updates to their larger and smaller models, Claude Opus 3.5 and Claude Haiku 3.5, are coming later this year. They intend to issue new models every few months. They are working on long term memory. </p><p>It is not only the new and improved intelligence.</p><p>Speed kills.

approaching for this set of benchmarks, and (2) the releases are coming quickly one after another and the slope of the line is accelerating despite being close to the maximum.  </p><p>We are still waiting for the Arena ranking to come in. Based on reactions we should expect Sonnet 3.5 to take the top slot, likely by a decent margin, but we’ve been surprised before.</p><blockquote><p>We evaluated Claude 3.5 Sonnet via direct comparison to prior Claude models. We asked raters to chat with our models and evaluate them on a number of tasks, using task-specific instructions. The charts in Figure 3 show the “win rate” when compared to a baseline of Claude 3 Opus. </p><p>We saw large improvements in core capabilities like coding, documents, creative writing, and vision. Domain experts preferred Claude 3.5 Sonnet over Claude 3 Opus, with win rates as high as 82% in Law, 73% in Finance, and 73% in Philosophy.</p></blockquote><p>Those were the high water marks, and Arena preferences tend to be less dramatic than that due to the nature of the questions and also those doing the rating.

If the shared image happens to contain a human face, Claude never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, Claude describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. Claude can request the user to tell it who the individual is. </p><p>If the user tells Claude who the individual is, Claude can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images. Claude should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. Claude should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding.</p></blockquote><p>Other than ‘better model,’ artifacts are the big new feature. You have to turn them on in your settings, which you should do.</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic: When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows.</p><p>This preview feature marks Claude’s evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. It’s just the beginning of a broader vision for Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the near future, teams—and eventually entire organizations—will be able to securely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate.</p></blockquote><p>I have not had the opportunity to work with this feature yet, so I am relying on the reports of others. I continue to be in ‘paying down debt’ mode on various writing tasks, which is going well but is going to take at least another week to finish up. After that, I am actively excited to try coding things.</p><p>They commit to not using your data to train their models without explicit permission.</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic: One of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model development is privacy. We do not train our generative models on user-submitted data unless a user gives us explicit permission to do so. To date we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models.</p></blockquote><p>Kudos, but being the only one who does this puts Anthropic at a large disadvantage. I wonder if this rule will get codified into law at some point?</p><p>There are two headlines here.</p><ol><li><p>Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still ASL-2, meaning no capabilities are too worrisome yet.</p></li><li><p>The UK Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI) performed a safety evaluation prior to release.</p></li></ol><p>The review by UK’s AISI is very good news, especially after Jack Clark’s statements that making that happen was difficult. Now that both DeepMind and Anthropic have followed through, hopefully that will put pressure on OpenAI and others to do it.</p><p>The refusal rates are improvements over Opus in both directions, in terms of matching intended behavior.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png" width="1120" height="457" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:457,&quot;width&quot;:1120,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83732,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Beyond that, they do not give us much to go on. </span><a href="https://x.com/m_bourgon/status/1803890128672428068" rel="">The system card for Gemini 1.5 gave us a lot more information</a><span>.

saves them hours of time.</p><p>Claude makes you feel like you have superpowers, suddenly no problem is too ambitious.</p><p>The future of programming is here folks.</p></blockquote><p>This is obviously not any sort of foom, or even a slow takeoff. Not yet. But yes, if the shift to Claude 3.5 Sonnet has substantially accelerated engineering work inside Anthropic, then that is how it begins.</p><p>To be clear, this is really cool so far. Improvement and productivity are good, actually. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/thegartsy/status/1804150156520231226" rel="">Tess Hegarty</a><span>: Recursive self improvement is already happening </span><a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI" rel="">@AnthropicAI</a><span>.</span></p><p>I will explain my understanding of why this matters in plain English. This matters because many AI safety researchers consider “recursive self improvement” a signal of approaching AI breakthroughs. “Recursive” implies a feedback loop that speeds up AI development. </p><p>Basically, it boils down to, “use the AI model we already built to help make the next AI model even more powerful &amp; capable.” </p><p>Which could be dangerous &amp; unpredictable. </p><p>(“Timelines” = # of years until human level artificial intelligence, aka time until we may all die or be permanently disempowered by AI if that goes poorly)</p><p>Andrea Miotti: This is what recursive self improvement looks like in practice.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1804204710020157672" rel="">Dean Ball</a><span>: This is what people using powerful tools to accomplish their work looks like in practice. </span></p><p>Be afraid, folks, be very afraid. We might even get *gasp* improved labor productivity! </p><p>Think of the horrors.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/profoundlyyyy/status/1804261619075105084" rel="">Trevor Levin</a><span>: I feel like the term "recursive self-improvement" has grown from a truly dangerous thing -- an AI system that is sufficiently smart and well-equipped that it can autonomously improve *itself* -- to "any feedback loop where any AI system is useful for building future AI systems"?</span></p><p>Profoundlyyyy: +1. Were it actually that, ASL-3 would have been hit and how everything has played out would be very different. These policies still remain in place and still seem set to work when the time is right.</p></blockquote><p>Dean Ball is of course correct that improving labor productivity is great. The issue is when you get certain kinds of productivity without the need for any labor, or when the labor and time and compute go down faster than the difficulty level rises. Improvements accelerate, and that acceleration feeds on itself. Then you get true RSI, recursive self improvement, and everything is transformed very quickly. You can have a 'slow’ version, or you can have a faster one. </p><p>Will that happen? Maybe it will. Maybe it won’t. This is a sign that we might be closer to it than we thought. </p><p>It is time for an episode of everyone’s favorite LLM show, The New Model Is An Idiot Because It Still Fails On Questions Where It

I imagined their systems might even be built to discourage catching these mistakes because it would detract, or at a minimum distract, from top-line revenue.</p><p>So we put in the first order for 10 pizzas.</p><p>He called in and placed an order for 10 pizzas to a friend's house and charged $160 to his personal credit card. A Doordash call center then called into his restaurant and put in the order for those 10 pizzas. A Doordash driver showed up with a credit card and paid $240 for the pizzas.</p><p>It worked.</p><p><strong>Trade 1</strong></p><p>We went over the actual costs. Each pizza cost him approximately $7 ($6.50 in ingredients, $0.50 for the box). So if he paid $160 out of pocket plus $70 in expenses to net $240 from Doordash, he just made $10 in pure arbitrage profit. For all that trouble, it wasn't really worth it, but that first experiment did work.</p><p>My mind, as a combination trader and startup person, instantly had the though - just run this arbitrage over and over. You could massively even grow your top-line revenue while netting riskless profit, and maybe even get acquired at an inflated valuation :) He told me to chill out. Maybe this is why he runs an "actual business" while I trade options while doing brand consulting and writing newsletters.</p><p>But we did realize, if you removed the food costs this could get more interesting.</p><p><strong>Trade 2</strong></p><p><span>The order was put in for another 10 pizzas. But this time, he just put in the dough with no toppings (he indicated at the time dough was essentially costless at that scale, though pandemic baking</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/why-theres-no-flour-during-coronavirus/611527/" rel=""> may have changed things</a><span>). </span></p><p>Now suddenly each trade would net $75 in riskless profit ⇒ $240 from Doordash minus ($160 in costs + $5 in boxes).</p><p>This got a bit more interesting. If you did this a few times a night, you could start to see thousands in top-line growth with hundreds in pure profit, and maybe you could do this for days on end.</p><p>So over a few weeks, almost to humor me, we did a few of these "trades". I was genuinely curious if Doordash would catch on but they didn't. I had visions of building a network of restauranteurs all executing this strategy in tandem, all drinking from the Softbank teat before the money ran dry, but went back to work doing content strategy stuff.</p><p>Was this a bit shady? Maybe, but fuck Doordash. Note: I did confirm with my friend that he was okay with me writing this, and we both agreed, fuck Doordash.</p><p><span>Tricking businesses onto your platform and creating additional headaches for small business owners in the pursuit of Softbankian growth is a bad as it gets. Many restauranteurs were complaining about their Google listings being "</span><a href="https://support.google.com/business/thread/5820393?hl=en" rel="">hijacked</a><span>" by Doordash, sometimes even usurping their own preferred delivery.</span></p><p><span>These underhanded tricks aren't unique to Doordash though. In recent weeks there has been some great work coming out around a Yelp - Grubhub phone scam. This one is just priceless (seriously, </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/grubhub-phone-order-call-fee-coronavirus" rel="">read this Buzzfeed piece</a><span>). Grubhub for their own sites generates a phone number for each restaurant that goes to a centralized, Grubhub owned call center. If someone calls in and orders via this number, the restaurant gets charged a fee. Apparently, some enterprising BD folks came up with the idea that Yelp could put the Grubhub phone numbers in place of the real </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/wjwebw/yelp-is-sneakily-replacing-restaurants-phone-numbers-so-grubhub-can-take-a-cut" rel="">restaurant phone number on the Yelp listing</a><span>. Customers who think they’re “helping” their local restaurants by calling in the order are still creating a fee for Grubhub.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Which brings us to the question - what is the point of all this? These platforms are all losing money. Just think of all the meetings and lines of code and phone calls to make all of these nefarious things happen which just continue to bleed money. Why go through all this trouble?  </p><p>Grubhub just lost $33 million on $360 million of revenue in Q1.</p><p><span>Doordash reportedly</span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/with-public-debut-looming-doordash-projected-450m-2019-loss" rel=""> lost an insane $450 million</a><span> off $900 million in revenue in 2019 (which does make me wonder if my dream of a decentralized network of pizza arbitrageurs does exist).</span></p><p><span>Uber Eats is Uber's "</span><a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/breaking-uber-eats-lead-steps-down-amid-profitability-struggles/572976/" rel="">most profitable division</a><span>” 😂😂.

The primary labor is treated poorly. And the businesses themselves are terrible.</p><p>&nbsp;This Business Insider piece did a good job covering the problematic dynamics of the industry:</p><blockquote><p>As this conflict comes to a boil, one thing is becoming clear: there are no winners in this fight.</p><p>Restaurant owners are losing money. Diners are seeing their costs raised, either by delivery companies that need to pay delivery drivers or by the restaurant owners who raise prices to offset delivery fees. And delivery drivers still make low, unpredictable wages frequently with no benefits.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>How did we get to a place where billions of dollars are exchanged in millions of business transactions but there are no winners? My co-host Can and my restaurant friend both defaulted to the notion “delivery is a shitty margin business” when discussing this post. But I don’t think that’s sufficient here. Delivery can work. Just look at a Domino’s stock chart. But, delivery has been carefully built as part of a holistic business model and infrastructure. Maybe that’s the viable model.&nbsp;</p><p>After the start of this pandemic, my friend actually launched in-house delivery at one of his restaurants. He said he’s starting to get a sense of the economics and explained he’s starting to get a sense of the volume required per location to make the economics reasonably work. That’s what is so odd to me about third-party delivery platforms. The business of food delivery clearly is not intrinsically a loser. Domino’s figured it out. Every Chinese restaurant in New York City seemed to have it figured out long before any platform came along. My friend is figuring it out. </p><p><span>That’s the thing about how industries have evolved over the past decade.

Maybe the right model is a wholly-owned supply chain like Domino’s. Maybe it’s some ghost kitchen / delivery platform hybrid. Maybe it’s just small networks of restaurants with out-of-the-box software. Whatever it is, we’ve been delayed in finding out thanks to this bizarrely bankrolled competition that sometimes feels like financial engineering worthy of my own pizza trading efforts.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The more I learn about food delivery platforms, as they exist today, I wonder if we’ve managed to watch an entire industry evolve artificially and incorrectly.

They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant’s website and don’t charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed onto the platform. If we had to pay a customer fee on the order, it would’ve further cut into our arbitrage profits (though maybe we could’ve </span><a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/What-fees-do-I-pay?language=en_US" rel="">incorporated DashPass</a><span> as part of the calculation).&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Note 2</strong><span>: A few months ago, in the pre-pandemic times, I was at an East Village pizza place and watched as the owner was arguing with a Doordash driver. The owner insisted the driver take the pizza in a heated bag so the customer didn’t get cold pizza, but leave an ID so the driver would be compelled to return the bag. The driver argued the amount of time it would take to come back to return the bag would mean he couldn’t make enough deliveries to “pay my rent”. #Innovation.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>
