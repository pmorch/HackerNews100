    <address>Carson Gross, Alex Petros</address>
    <p><time>January 01, 2025</time></p><h2 id="in-the-beginning"><a href="#in-the-beginning" aria-label="Anchor link for: in-the-beginning">In The Beginning…</a></h2>
<p>htmx began life as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a>, a library built around jQuery that added behavior based
on HTML attributes.</p>
<p>For developers who are not familiar with it, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a venerable JavaScript
library that made writing cross-platform JavaScript a lot easier during a time when browser implementations were very
inconsistent, and JavaScript didn’t have many of the convenient APIs and features that it does now.</p>
<p>Today many web developers consider jQuery to be “legacy software.” With all due respect to this perspective, jQuery is
currently used on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library">75% of all public websites</a>, a number that dwarfs all other JavaScript tools.</p>
<p>Why has jQuery remained so ubiquitous?</p>
<p>Here are three technical reasons we believe contribute to its ongoing success:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very easy to add to a project (just a single, dependency-free link)</li>
<li>It has maintained a very consistent API, remaining largely backwards compatible over its life (intercooler.js works
with jQuery v1, v2 and v3)</li>
<li>As a library, you can use as much or as little of it as you like: it stays out of the way otherwise and doesn’t
dictate the structure of your application</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="htmx-is-the-new-jquery"><a href="#htmx-is-the-new-jquery" aria-label="Anchor link for: htmx-is-the-new-jquery">htmx is the New jQuery</a></h2>
<p>Now, that’s a ridiculous (and arrogant) statement to make, of course, but it is an <em>ideal</em> that we on the htmx team are
striving for.</p>
<p>In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value
addition to the toolkits of web developers. Alex has
discussed <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc">“Building The 100 Year Web Service”</a> and we want htmx to be a
useful tool for exactly that use case.</p>
<p>Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time, and websites built with htmx should be capable of
the same (or better).</p>
<p>Going forward, htmx will be developed with its <em>existing</em> users in mind.</p>
<p>If you are an existing user of htmx—or are thinking about becoming one—here’s what that means.</p>
<h3 id="stability-as-a-feature"><a href="#stability-as-a-feature" aria-label="Anchor link for: stability-as-a-feature">Stability as a Feature</a></h3>
<p>We are going to work to ensure that htmx is extremely stable in both API &amp; implementation. This means accepting and
documenting the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks</a> of the current implementation.</p>
<p>Someone upgrading htmx (even from 1.x to 2.x) should expect things to continue working as before.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, we may add better configuration options, but we won’t change defaults.</p>
<h3 id="no-new-features-as-a-feature"><a href="#no-new-features-as-a-feature" aria-label="Anchor link for: no-new-features-as-a-feature">No New Features as a Feature</a></h3>
<p>We are going to be increasingly inclined to not accept new proposed features in the library core.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t feel pressure to upgrade htmx over time unless there are specific bugs that they want fixed, and they
should feel comfortable that the htmx that they write in 2025 will look very similar to htmx they write in 2035 and
beyond.</p>
<p>We will consider new core features when new browser features become available, for example we
are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/examples/move-before/">already using</a> the experimental <code>moveBefore()</code> API on supported browsers.</p>
<p>However, we expect most new functionality to be explored and delivered via the
htmx <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/extensions/">extensions API</a>, and will work to make the extensions API more capable where
appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="quarterly-releases"><a href="#quarterly-releases" aria-label="Anchor link for: quarterly-releases">Quarterly Releases</a></h3>
<p>Our release schedule is going to be roughly quarterly going forward.</p>
<p>There will be no death march upgrades associated with htmx, and there is no reason to monitor htmx releases for major
functionality changes, just like with jQuery. If htmx 1.x is working fine for you, there is no reason to feel like you
need to move to 2.x.</p>

<p>htmx does not aim to be a total solution for building web applications and services:
it <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3648188.3675127">generalizes hypermedia controls</a>, and that’s roughly about it.</p>
<p>This means that a very important way to improve htmx — and one with lots of work remaining — is by helping improve the tools
and techniques that people use <em>in conjunction</em> with htmx.</p>
<p>Doing so makes htmx dramatically more useful <em>without</em> any changes to htmx itself.</p>

<p>While htmx gives you a few new tools in your HTML, it has no opinions about other important aspects of building your
websites. A flagship feature of htmx is that it does not dictate what backend or database you use.</p>
<p>htmx is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/">compatible with lots of backends</a>, and we want to
help make hypermedia-driven development work better for all of them.</p>
<p>One part of the hypermedia ecosystem that htmx has already helped improve is template engines. When
we <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/">first wrote</a> about how “template fragments” make defining partial page
replacements much simpler, they were a relatively rare feature in template engines.</p>
<p>Not only are fragments much more common now, that essay
is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/issues/260">frequently</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsfreixes/jinja2-fragments">cited</a>
as an inspiration for building the feature.</p>
<p>There are many other ways that the experience of writing hypermedia-based applications can be improved, and we will
remain dedicated to identifying and promoting those efforts.</p>
<h3 id="writing-research-and-standardization"><a href="#writing-research-and-standardization" aria-label="Anchor link for: writing-research-and-standardization">Writing, Research, and Standardization</a></h3>
<p>Although htmx will not be changing dramatically going forward, we will continue energetically evangelizing the ideas of
hypermedia.</p>
<p>In particular, we are trying to push <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3648188.3675127">the ideas</a> of htmx into the
HTML standard itself, via the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/">Triptych project</a>. In an ideal world, htmx
functionality disappears into the web platform itself.</p>
<p>htmx code written <em>today</em> will continue working forever, of course, but in the very long run perhaps there will be no
need to include the library to achieve <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/examples">similar UI patterns</a> via hypermedia.</p>
<h2 id="intercooler-was-right"><a href="#intercooler-was-right" aria-label="Anchor link for: intercooler-was-right">Intercooler Was Right</a></h2>
<p>At the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/docs#philosophy">end of the intercooler docs</a>, we said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many javascript projects are updated at a dizzying pace. Intercooler is not.</p>
<p>This is not because it is dead, but rather because it is (mostly) right: the basic idea is right, and the implementation
at least right enough.</p>
<p>This means there will not be constant activity and churn on the project, but rather
a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship_(theology)">stewardship</a> relationship: the main goal now is to not screw
it up. The documentation will be improved, tests will be added, small new declarative features will be added around the
edges, but there will be no massive rewrite or constant updating. This is in contrast with the software industry in
general and the front end world in particular, which has comical levels of churn.</p>
<p>Intercooler is a sturdy, reliable tool for web development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGyAWH5btwY">the snark at the end of the third paragraph</a>, this thinking
is very much applicable to htmx. In fact, perhaps even more so since htmx is a standalone piece of software, benefiting
from the experiences (and mistakes) of intercooler.js.</p>
<p>We hope to see htmx, in its own small way, join the likes of giants like jQuery as a sturdy and reliable tool for
building your 100 year web services.</p>

        </p>
    

    <p>OK, this is going to sound crazy: I believe all clocks are 30 seconds late.</p>
<p>Let's get a few things out of the way: this is neither about time zones, nor leap seconds.
It's not about synchronization of clocks, and it's not about relativity or any obscure corner of physics.
I'm talking about everyday clocks. The ones that you might have around in your house, like this one that sits on my desk:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/post2image1-2.webp" alt="post2image1"></p>
<p>Or this one that stands in London:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/572px-big_ben_elizabeth_tower_london_2023_01_detail.webp" alt="572px-Big_Ben_Elizabeth_Tower_London_2023_01_Detail"></p>
<p><em>(Photo from Wikipedia)</em></p>
<p>Or even the clock on your phone! Maybe they're all correctly set very precisely to a very accurate reference clock, but here I will argue that they are still exactly 30 seconds late. In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be more accurate if they were thirty seconds ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-are-you-on-about">What are you on about?</h2><p>All the above clocks have one thing in common: they don't show seconds. They truncate down to the nearest lower whole minute, right? So when it's actually <code>14:15:45</code>, they'll show <code>14:15</code>.
And when the actual time goes from <code>14:15:59</code> to <code>14:16:00</code>, then that's when your clock changes from <code>14:15</code> to <code>14:16</code>.</p>
<p>They apply the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor function</a>!</p>
<p>Ok great. Now hear me out! Let's compute the average error between a usual (truncating) clock, and the precise current time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the error is 1 or 2 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it's actually <code>14:02:01</code></li>
<li>Sometimes the error is almost 60 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it's actually <code>14:02:57</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the average error of a truncating clock is 30 seconds. Let that sink in for a moment: <strong>the average error of a clock is 30 seconds</strong>. If clocks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounded</a>
to the nearest minute instead of truncating, the average error would be 0. Therefore all clocks are 30 seconds late!</p>
<p>Similarly of course, all clocks that show seconds but not milliseconds are half a second late.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-just-a-convention">This is just a convention</h2><blockquote>
<p>But this is just a convention! Truncating, rounding or even ceiling are all valid, as long as we pick one and stick to it. By your logic we should say that it's Tuesday as soon as it's one second past noon on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well... kind of.</p>
<p>It would be weird if we rounded for years, months and days, that's for sure. I think most people think of those scales as intervals. In other words, July is a period of time, with a start and an end. So are years, centuries, seasons. We are inside of it or outside.</p>
<p>Is it the same for the current minute of the current hour ? I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Basically I'm arguing that rounding for clocks would be more useful than flooring.
This is especially apparent when you're trying to calculate "how much time until my next meeting?", and your next meeting is at noon. If it's 11:55, you would usually mentally subtract and conclude: the meeting is in 5 minutes. That's how I always do it myself anyway! But the most probable estimate given the available information is actually 4'30"!</p>
<p>If you had a rounding clock instead, 5 minutes would be the correct estimation.</p>
<p>In fact, as we go down the various scales of time all the way from years, months, days and we reach hours, that's when we start truncating! At hours! For example: if it's <code>10:43</code> and you are asked the time and (for some context appropriate reason) you reply with just hours, you would say it's 11! Personally, I would never say that it's 10 if the clock shows anything past <code>10:30</code>. I realize that's probably very different in other cultures, though! And I'd be interested to learn about how different cultures approximate time in language.</p>
<p>So, looking at the various scales of time and how I mentally view them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Years</strong>: truncate. If the full date has <code>2019</code> in it, I'll say "the year is 2019" - all the way to the end. Saying "it's 2020" in September 2019 is super weird.</li>
<li><strong>Months</strong>: truncate. It's January all the way until it's February.</li>
<li><strong>Days</strong>: truncate. It gets a little weird if it's past midnight and I haven't slept yet. Is tomorrow today? Or is it the day after that? I think collectively we still haven't quite figured that one out yet. And that's ok. Kind of like how "next Friday" becomes ambiguous on Thursdays. Some cultures use times beyond 24:00, like 25:30 to indicate one hour and a half past midnight, and I think that's lovely!</li>
<li><strong>Hours</strong>: That's when mentally, I switch to rounding! At <code>15:48</code> I definitely feel like it's pretty much <code>16:00</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Minutes</strong>: At <code>15:48:57</code>, I definitely feel like it's <code>15:49</code>! But clocks switch back to flooring for for some reason! But mentally we round! This is why I feel like all clocks are 30 seconds late: because the truncating convention doesn't match my intuition at the minute scale.</li>
<li><strong>Seconds and below</strong>: definitely rounding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please someone tell me I'm not crazy 🙃</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent advances in data collection technology, accompanied by the ever-rising volume and velocity of streaming data, underscore the vital need for time series analytics. In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an important activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber security, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While traditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical measures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years call for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for time-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.

  <p>The top image shows the structural editor, and shell, for the <a href="https://eyg.run/">eyg</a> programming language running on a phone.
Later on I’ll show it running on a TV.
On both devices the structural editor is a better coding experience than a text editor would be.</p>

<p>This post outlines the evolution of the editor over several years, and highlights the major changes over time along with some design thoughts and implementation notes.
The web editor is built in <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre">Lustre</a>; originally it was <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>. 
There also exists a terminal based structural <a href="https://vimeo.com/827006232">editor built in Go</a>.</p>

<p>Want to jump in and code with it? The latest version is at <a href="https://eyg.run/">eyg</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-a-structural-editor">Why build a structural editor?</h2>

<p>Structural editors, also known as projectional editors, enhance writing, editing and understanding code. Unlike traditional text-based editors, these tools treat code as a structured tree rather than a flat sequence of characters.</p>

<p><em>This structured data may be the Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) of the represented program, however it can also be a different structure.
For this post I won’t quibble over the differences.</em></p>

<p>Some traditional editors have tools that understand the code structure, for example autocomplete.
However in most cases these tools work as suggestions and a traditional text editor will accept any input.</p>

<p>I define a structural editor as one that does not accept invalid or arbitrary input.
Changes to the program always proceed through well known states.</p>

<p>This clarification is important because the editors I talk about here render the program to the user as text, but it’s important to note that there is no way to enter arbitrary text.</p>

<p>The benefits of a structural editor are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No syntax errors.</strong>
  Zero time is spent on missing quotes, semi-colons or other details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better type information.</strong>
Because the program is always in a valid state the type checker can always run and give meaningful feedback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No keywords</strong>
Variables can be called <code>var</code> and functions called <code>fn</code>. Either can also be called 🧪 or <code>!_//</code> though maybe they shouldn’t be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rich visualisations</strong>
A program can be shown as box and wires, or boolean logic operators. On a smaller scale a record of latitude and longitude can be shown on a map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduced complexity</strong>
There is no lexer or parser so issues like <a href="https://gleam.run/news/fault-tolerant-gleam/">fault tolerant parsing</a> are entirely circumvented.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Several other structed editor projects exist. Jetbrains has <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/">MPS</a> which targets creating your own domain specific languges.
<a href="https://tylr.fun/">Tylr</a> is a beautiful example but currently only good for one line of code at a time.</p>

<h2 id="an-adhoc-first-attempt">An adhoc first attempt</h2>

<p>This is my first recording of the structural editor - admire the minimalistic and clean look.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/664401317?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="Week 1"></iframe></p>

<p>The first generation editor worked by directly editing the AST with no effort to hide the details from the user.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>a</code> increased the selection by moving the current selection to the parent node, <code>j/k</code> moved to the previous/next node and
<code>i</code> entered insert mode on the current node. You might see the vim influence of these bindings.</p>

<p>This first version got a few things right.
The command pallet approach in particular is very nice.
It allows you to put a lot of help with certain actions. 
For example when creating a variable the pallet can show all the variables in scope at that position.</p>

<p>At the outset the AST design was driven by the development of the editor, one single enum represented all the expressions in the program.
This is the complete expression type from that time.</p>
<pre><code>pub type Node(m, g) {
  Binary(value: String)
  Tuple(elements: List(Expression(m, g)))
  Record(fields: List(#(String, Expression(m, g))))
  Access(value: Expression(m, g), key: String)
  Tagged(tag: String, value: Expression(m, g))
  Variable(label: String)
  Let(pattern: Pattern, value: Expression(m, g), then: Expression(m, g))
  Function(pattern: Pattern, body: Expression(m, g))
  Call(function: Expression(m, g), with: Expression(m, g))
  Case(
    value: Expression(m, g),
    branches: List(#(String, Pattern, Expression(m, g))),
  )
  Hole
  Provider(config: String, generator: Generator, generated: g)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The update function, called when you press a key in the editor,
was a huge case statement for each combination of key pressed and current position in the tree.
This approach although simple didn’t scale with complexity.
The AST was used by the editor, type checker and code generation so it was not possible to adapt it to the requirements of any particular use case.</p>

<p>In this first version too many concerns were rolled into one project.</p>

<p><em>The <code>Provider</code> node is my implementation of type providers and not part of this story.
But you can see other videos in my <a href="https://petersaxton.uk/log/">log</a> about them.</em></p>

<p>This first effort eventually ground to a halt under its complexity.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-ast">A simple AST</h2>

<p>As a rich AST could not work for all usecases I focused on creating the simplest AST.
Complexity for type checking or editing would move to the appropriate modules.</p>

<pre><code>pub type Expression {
  Variable(label: String)
  Lambda(label: String, body: Expression)
  Apply(func: Expression, argument: Expression)
  Let(label: String, definition: Expression, body: Expression)
  Vacant(comment: String)
  Binary(value: BitArray)
  // .. other primitives for integer, string and builtins
  Empty
  Extend(label: String)
  Select(label: String)
  // .. other operators for lists, unions, effects and references
}
</code></pre>

<p>This AST was the result, it still looks almost <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/8a2a5c0a82ea99a321cfe8e7a0f6cbecaac4f97a/eyg/src/eygir/expression.gleam#L22-L61">identical today</a></p>

<p>By making all features of the language first class, there is a minimal number of compound nodes in the tree. 
Only <code>Lambda</code>, <code>Apply</code> and <code>Let</code> contain child expressions.</p>

<p>To create the record literal <code>{name: "Eve"}</code> required the following expression</p>
<pre><code>Apply(Apply(Extend(label: "name"), String("Eve")), Empty)
</code></pre>

<p>This change makes interpretation and type checking much simpler, take my word for it.</p>

<p>It also simplifies several details of the editor for example:
Positions in the tree are denoted by a list of integers where each integer identifies the child node.
This path is followed from the root node until the required point in the tree.</p>

<p>This <code>step</code> function implements one step of following that path, it takes an expression and goes to n’th child.
Only the three nodes mentioned have to be taken into account by the <code>step</code> function.
It is known that asking for a child of any other kind of node is an error.
This means that variants can be added/removed to the <code>Expression</code> type without in any way modifying or moving around the tree.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn step(exp, n) {
  case exp, n {
    e.Lambda(param, body), 0 -&gt; Ok(#(body, e.Lambda(param, _)))
    e.Apply(func, arg), 0 -&gt; Ok(#(func, e.Apply(_, arg)))
    e.Apply(func, arg), 1 -&gt; Ok(#(arg, e.Apply(func, _)))
    e.Let(label, value, then), 0 -&gt; Ok(#(value, e.Let(label, _, then)))
    e.Let(label, value, then), 1 -&gt; Ok(#(then, e.Let(label, value, _)))
    _, _ -&gt; Error("invalid path")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This change didn’t effect the external look of the editor but it did substantially clean up the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="text-editing-is-intuitive-familiar">Text editing is <del>intuitive</del> familiar</h2>

<p>Moving around the code was tricky in the previous editor. 
This was because the order of nodes in the tree might not match the order they were shown on screen.</p>

<p>For example selecting the field from a record.</p>

<pre><code>let x = user.name
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>user</code> is selected, to move to <code>name</code> required moving left and another move left would jump back to the <code>x</code> of the variable declaration.</p>

<p>This is because the <code>.</code> syntax is sugar for calling the select operator on the variable user. 
In all other cases arguments come after the function but, for select, reversing the order it’s projected to the user makes more sense.</p>

<pre><code>Apply(Select("name"), Variable("user"))
</code></pre>

<p>Making transformations directly on the AST felt powerful but there were too many occasions where an understanding of the AST was needed to know how to move.</p>

<p>The next version aimed to fix the navigation issue by keeping a cursor centric approach.
This means that one key press of left moves the cursor one position left and a key press of right moves the cursor one position right.</p>

<p>Even with moving back to a text based navigation I wanted a fully structural editor so that the program was always a valid structure.</p>

<p>Traditional editors have similar behaviour, for example: when typing <code>(</code> an automatic <code>)</code> is often placed.
In this way you don’t go through a state of having unmatched brackets. 
The main difference is in a text editor this bracket matching features are adhoc and many other ways exist to create a syntactically invalid program.</p>

<p>You can see this working here.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/833330371?h=9aeaa64b46&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="05/06/2023, Features of the structured editor"></iframe></p>

<p>This editor was actually quite short lived.
I liked that it showed the type of holes in the program directly in the editor.</p>

<p>However the editor was unintutive in many cases.
Keeping the editor structural but pretending it wasn’t led to too many inconsistencies.
There were places that typing certain characters would do nothing because the character was invalid.</p>

<p>Implementing this editor got complicated quickly.
Intercepting all keyboard events meant dropping out of Gleam and understanding the <a href="https://javascript.info/selection-range">range and selection</a> API’s in the browser. This resulted in a lot of <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/40d1606d50292724970d79a6b1f61926294bc10f/eyg/src/easel_ffi.js">foreign function interface code</a></p>

<p>A positive aside of this effort to go text based meant I wanted better Gleam bindings to the browser API’s and that need kicked off building <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/plinth">plinth</a> a library to do just that.</p>

<h2 id="adding-sugar-and-projections">Adding sugar and projections</h2>

<p>The two previous editors were at opposing ends of a spectrum.
For the first, movement was entirely based on the layout of the AST.
For the second, movement was entirely based on the layout of the text.</p>

<p>I wrote approximately 10k “lines” of EYG code, including a JSON parser and type checker, using the simple AST editor.
Transforming the AST felt very powerful when it worked. However, where the visuals did not match the AST representation navigation was unintuitive.
I eventually mastered it but it was clearly a blocker for anyone else picking up the editor.</p>

<p>This generation of the editor tries to find a middle ground one the spectrum from text to AST.
Navigation is always by whole AST nodes. In addition directions are always consistent with how the program is laid out on screen.</p>

<p>This was achieved by creating a representation of the program specifically for manipulation in the editor. There is:</p>

<ol>

<p>The basic AST is still used by the interpreter and type checker so the complexity of presenting code to the user is only in the modules which deal with showing code to a user.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</h2>

<p>Working with a keyboard is efficient, but only if you know the key bindings to each action you need.
Which key to press to get a desired action is not discoverable from looking at the UI element.
After all the UI for keyboard actions is just a cursor somewhere in the page.</p>

<p>A user is required to consult a cheatsheet of keyboard actions and learn some before ever getting started.
This friction makes getting started very challenging.</p>

<p>Devices without keyboards have to show virtual keyboards to use keyboard shortcuts.
If the actions are being presented on screen they might as well be shown as something more relevant than the letter code corresponding to the short cut.</p>

<p>This latest iteration adds a menu and icon based UI for each transformation that is possible on the AST.
A question mark button at the top toggles showing text descriptions of each action but at the cost of less screen to work with.
The UI works with keyboard, mouse, touch or TV remote.</p>

<p><img src="https://crowdhailer.me/2025-01-02/the-evolution-of-a-structural-code-editor/tv.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It also works great with a keyboard and if you forget the key, seemlessly switch to the visual.</p>

<p>Implementing the visual UI was simple with Lustre and the state and event approach it has.
Lustre is an implementation of the Elm architecture.</p>

<p>The state of the program works by <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/441e5686c6721373d6b66636c4f1ce73301d60d7/website/src/website/components/snippet.gleam#L302-L352">switching on key press events</a>.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn update(state, message) {
  let Snippet(status: status, ..,) = state
  case message, status {
    UserPressedCommandKey(key), Editing(Command(_)) -&gt; {
      let state = Snippet(..state, using_mouse: False)
      case key {
        "ArrowRight" -&gt; move_right(state)
        "ArrowLeft" -&gt; move_left(state)
        "ArrowUp" -&gt; move_up(state)
        "ArrowDown" -&gt; move_down(state)
        " " -&gt; search_vacant(state)

        "l" -&gt; insert_list(state)
        "#" -&gt; insert_reference(state)
        "z" -&gt; undo(state)
        "Z" -&gt; redo(state)
        // "x" -&gt;
        "c" -&gt; call_function(state)
        "v" -&gt; insert_variable(state)
        "b" -&gt; insert_binary(state)
        "n" -&gt; insert_integer(state)
        "m" -&gt; insert_case(state)
        "M" -&gt; insert_open_case(state)
        "," -&gt; extend_before(state)
        "EXTEND AFTER" -&gt; extend_after(state)
        "." -&gt; spread_list(state)
        "TOGGLE SPREAD" -&gt; toggle_spread(state)
        "TOGGLE OTHERWISE" -&gt; toggle_otherwise(state)

        "?" -&gt; #(state, ToggleHelp)
        "Enter" -&gt; execute(state)
        _ -&gt; show_error(state, NoKeyBinding(key))
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The UI buttons make use of the same events and update logic.
Each button in the visual UI consists of;</p>

<ul>
  <li>the icon to show (I use the heroicon library and the outline style)</li>
  <li>a text description of the action (which is shown when “show help” is on)</li>
  <li>the keypress event to dispatch.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>fn cmd(x) {
  ShellMessage(snippet.UserPressedCommandKey(x))
}

fn item_before() {
  #(outline.arrow_turn_left_down(), "item before", cmd(","))
}

fn item_after() {
  #(outline.arrow_turn_right_down(), "item after", cmd("EXTEND AFTER"))
}

fn undo() {
  #(outline.arrow_uturn_left(), "undo", cmd("z"))
}

fn redo() {
  #(outline.arrow_uturn_right(), "redo", cmd("Z"))
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>There are more actions than available keys so the <code>EXTEND AFTER</code> string value can be dispatched by clicking the correct button, but not by any keyboard binding.</em></p>

<p>Here is the final result, as of today.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1043702197?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="1/3/2025, Fibonacci sequence in visual editor"></iframe></p>

<p>There will be more iterations of the editor but this one is interesting.
I want to see what other people make of the structured editor experience.
You can <a href="https://eyg.run/">try it out now</a> and if you have any opinions please get in touch. <em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crowdhailer.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> the best right now</em>.</p>

<p>The EYG language is still developing. References to external packages and better error messages based on effects will be coming soon.

<p>In Engineering, quarterly OKRs (Objectives &amp; Key Results) can feel like a duplication of product planning. Basically, they say “Ship the Roadmap.” What new information are they <a href="https://jessitron.com/2024/12/22/okrs-for-evil-and-good/">communicating</a> in that case? And if the OKRs say anything else, they’re in conflict the roadmap!</p>



<p>An example (that I made up):</p>



<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="840" height="317" src="https://i0.wp.com/jessitron.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-19.55.15.png?resize=840%2C317&amp;ssl=1" alt="Objective: Deliver Frontend Observability

<p>In Marketing, quarterly OKRs express our intentions clearly. They work really well to describe the focus for this time period. Marketing doesn’t complain about having to make OKRs.</p>



<p>A marketing example (that I made up):</p>



<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="840" height="251" src="https://i0.wp.com/jessitron.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-19.55.24.png?resize=840%2C251&amp;ssl=1" alt="Objective: Launch of Frontend Observability drives pipeline

<p>Why are OKRs easier in Marketing?</p>



<p>Partly: Marketing is closer to project work, while Engineering (at places like Honeycomb) is product work. Projects like Marketing campaigns fit within a quarter or two, while product work is an ongoing rhythm of updates.</p>



<p>There’s an ongoing rhythm of work in Marketing, too! There are ads to run, webinars to run, emails to send, events to staff. OKRs express <em>which</em> ads and webinars and events — who we’re targeting and with what message.</p>



<p>Does this duplicate the campaign briefs? … yes. Therefore, OKRs often mention only new campaigns, new audiences or channels. They say what we’re spending money and time on <em>this</em> quarter, that we don’t do <em>every</em> quarter.</p>



<h4>Regular ongoing work doesn’t show up in OKRs, usually. That’s what KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are for.</h4>



<p>Marketing has KPIs for their core job: bringing in leads, which become sales opportunities. We count those. We monitor website traffic, ad performance, SEO ranking, webinar attendance, contacts made at events.</p>



<p>These KPI numbers only show up in OKRs when we’re trying to improve them or get them differently, like in a new audience or with a new message. OKRs express shifts in focus, changes in process, or conversations we need to have.</p>

<p>Engineering has KPIs for our core job: running software and shipping updates. Service-Level Objectives (<a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/honeycomb-internal-slos">SLOs</a>) and <a href="https://nicolefv.com/writing">Accelerate</a> metrics like Deployment Frequency tell us we’re working smoothly.</p>

<p>Shipping features from the roadmap is a chunk of our core job. It shouldn’t usually be in our OKRs. OKRs say what is different this quarter, what we’re changing, and what we’re trying to figure out.</p>

<p>Wait a minute! One of these examples is “Smooth launch of Frontend Observability.” Doesn’t that say ‘ship the roadmap’?</p>



<p>Shipping the features is part of a smooth launch, but it doesn’t end there. Of all the features we’re shipping this quarter, that one is the most critical to the business. Its presence in the OKRs tells people that we’ll push other work, we’ll respond immediately to bug reports, we’ll support this release with enthusiasm.</p>



<p>When a team’s OKRs duplicate the roadmap, I read that as “We aren’t trying to improve. This is a quarter for trudging along.” Not a good sign.</p>



<p>OKRs are for “What is special about this quarter? What is new? How do we want to be different? What do we want to figure out?”</p>



<p>Let OKRs highlight a special focus. Don’t try to cram everything you do into them.</p>

        <p>Why Apple Intelligence failed even though everything it's built upon is nearly perfect</p>

    <p>A while ago, I got really frustrated at my Samsung S7. It was failing to hold a battery charge, or having issues with the Wi-Fi, or DNS over LTE or something and I reached a breaking point where I bussed over to Bellevue Square and bought an iPhone 7. It was my first Apple product that I'd ever bought with my own money and my first non-Android phone since I used Windows Mobile 6 on a T-Mobile Dash in high school.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I loved it at first sight and all my phones since have been iPhones. The camera is good enough that I have to go out of my way to make my actual cameras different from what you can get on an iPhone. Hell, the iPhone is a fully capable cinema camera these days. It's easily been one of the best technology moves I've ever done for my creative career. The device enables me to do things and create memories of them to share with others.</p>
<h2>Bicycles for the mind</h2>
<p>Way back in 1981, Steve Jobs (one of the co-founders of Apple) described the vision of Apple computers like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species
on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And,
humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way
down the list. [...] But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight
to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And [...] a human
on a bicycle, blew the condor away. [A computer is] the most remarkable tool
that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our
minds.</p></blockquote>
<p>-<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9281634-i-think-one-of-the-things-that-really-separates-us">Steve Jobs</a></p>
<p>Apple computers aim to make it easier for people to be creative while spending less energy to do it. One of the big things that Apple made the Macintosh for was typography. With that, they made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite">MacWrite</a>, one of the two programs that shipped with every Macintosh computer for free. If you were used to having to write documents out by hand or using a typewriter to make them, the leap to something like a word processor is so amazingly vast that it's difficult for anyone younger than me to comprehend it. We've had them all our lives.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/macwrite.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/macwrite.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/macwrite.webp"><img alt="A screenshot of an emulated Macintosh running MacWrite with the first paragraph of The Bee Movie script in it." loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/macwrite.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>A screenshot of an emulated Macintosh running MacWrite with the first paragraph of The Bee Movie script in it.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine not being able to reliably use the backspace key when you're writing something. Imagine a world where all you could do was just write more text. Sure, there were ways to "cover up" a mis-typed letter, but they were vastly more inconvenient than just ignoring it or re-typing the word and crossing the wrong one out by hand.</p>
<p>Word processors let you use the backspace key to delete text and then look at the screen to get a reasonable approximation of what the printed document would look like. Before you print it.</p>
<p>To say that this enables a vastly different kind of creative process is like saying that water makes things damp. Word processors like MacWrite absolutely transformed the ways that everyone used computers. They were bicycles for the mind and without them our world would be starkly different. I shudder to imagine that <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> would be a thing without word processors.</p>
<p>Many companies want to make computers that you can use to do computer things. Apple makes tools that you use as an extension of your body in order to do creative things. They don't just sell computers, they sell something that helps enable you to create things that just so happen to be computers.</p>
<p>This is the big vision difference that puts Apple in its own class. They sell bicycles for the mind.</p>
<h2>Intelligence as a faucet</h2>
<p>In June 2024, Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>: a set of features aimed at making your smartphone smart. The biggest thing that stood out to me was this example of what Apple Intelligence was going to enable in Siri:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/podcast-other-day.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/podcast-other-day.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/podcast-other-day.webp"><img alt="An Apple Keynote slide saying 'Play that podcast my wife sent the other day'." loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/podcast-other-day.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>An Apple Keynote slide saying 'Play that podcast my wife sent the other day'.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If they could really just correlate relationships, categorize links, and make all of that context visible to Siri, that would be fundamentally transformative in ways that the word processor would be to people that didn't have it before. Everything else done with it would be added bonuses or party tricks on the side. The real benefit would be being able to search through all of your digital life across every app with simple queries and then have your phone do things for you.</p>
<p>Sure Craig's example was playing a podcast, but the basic idea holds for other types of media too. "Share those pics from San Francisco to Instagram." All this context that everything is building up would finally be useful to the users instead of just useful to the companies making all of the apps we use.</p>
<p>They wanted to make all Apple devices be able to tap into <em>intelligence</em> as a faucet in the same way that Spotify lets you tap into music as a faucet and that the AWS API lets you tap into compute as a faucet. This is massive and if it was pulled off right would be the new standard that companies like Samsung and Google would clone the same way they cloned the hardware and software design of the iPhone.</p>
<p>In that keynote, they spilled out the vision that computers should work <em>with</em> you in order for you to do what you want to do. They should enable you to be creative. They should be bicycles for the mind. The fact that they are computers should only be a footnote in an appendex titled "implementation details".</p>
<p>Then they casually dropped the holy grail of trusted compute, but in order to understand why it's so big we need to take a little detour into the modern Internet user's view of the Internet.</p>
<h2>Apps as thin as reception</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with modern applications is that they are thin shells around web services. When you open the Instagram or Bluesky apps, your phone makes a request to their servers and then shows you posts when it gets a response. You don't know or care how those responses are getting made, you just know that when you open the app, you get content and that makes you happy.</p>
<p>However, when you don't have signal, you don't have the app. Go on an airplane and once you run out of reception the app is worthless. You can't queue posts to be made when you get back into signal. You can't view posts that were available before you lost connection. You can't even view things that you just posted in some cases. The app breaks and you are slowly alienated from your data one photo at a time.</p>
<p>This is the way nearly every single app on my phone works with only two exceptions: Signal and everything Apple makes. If you want to read more about how the modern user's experience with the Internet is like, check out Ed Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/">Never Forgive Them</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user,
everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising,
microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user
experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on
mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers,
video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email
or for us to let them send us notifications.</p></blockquote>
<p>-<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/">Ed Zitron</a></p>
<p>Not to mention, you don't know how the services that power your apps work. The market at large does not want to pay for chat programs or social media. Running chat programs and social media apps is mind-bogglingly expensive. Venture capital only lasts so long and the companies involved have to make money somehow. The big pile of user data starts to look like a really good thing to mine in order to make a profit.</p>
<h2>The holy grail of trusted compute</h2>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to the goal of something like Apple Intelligence. When possible, Apple Intelligence will run on your device. Apple <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514">went out of their way</a> to make it possible and easy to run large language models and other AI models on your device without having to make too many compromises in the process. If something is done on your device (or at least on hardware that you can look at, like a Mac mini in your office), then the computation is <em>infinitely</em> more private than anything involving making a request to the outside world.</p>
<p>In Apple's WWDC keynote they claimed that they had a system called Private Cloud Compute that would enable users to have the same privacy guarantees (or more) when making requests out over the network as they did for computations running on their local devices.</p>
<p>This seemed impossible to me. From what I know about how the web service sausage is made, it seems impossible to have all of these guarantees at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>User data is only used to fulfill requests and then erased.</li>
<li>The load balancing infrastructure doesn't know who is making a request and what server it is going to.</li>
<li>Researchers are able to inspect and verify the Private Cloud Compute system and simulate it on their laptops.</li>
<li>Apple site reliability staff does not have privileged access to Private Cloud Compute nodes and logging is minimized at the compiler level.</li>
<li>An attacker cannot reliably figure out which node is being used to make any request from any user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any modicum of site reliability experience, this seems like an unsatisfiable set of constraints. It seems literally impossible, yet here they are claiming that they have done it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://security.apple.com/documentation/private-cloud-compute">technical details</a> of how they pulled this off is well worth reading, if only because it is the first time I have ever seen any company's AI product team put together a cogent security model and release that security model to the public. TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>They X-ray the hardware at every step of the assembly process and compare that to reference images in order to combat threats from factory workers adding unapproved hardware to the boards of the servers.</li>
<li>You can set up your own local copy of a Private Cloud Compute node and punish it with all the hellfire you want to see if you can break it and get root. Apple will pay you a lot of money if you can.</li>
<li>The hardware certification process involves a lot of unrelated people in unrelated departments of Apple.</li>
<li>Every Private Cloud Compute node is rigged to not only decertify itself when power is removed, they also rigged the main power for the board to the chassis intrusion switch. Open the server? Power gets cut and the node is de-certified.</li>
<li>Every time your devices make a request to Private Cloud Compute, they record the node ID that was used to fulfill it and you can go in and verify that all of the nodes your device used are still certified.</li>
<li>The production OS images are free for the public to download and not encrypted in any way.</li>
<li>Every package that makes up the important parts of the OS are split into two types: code and data. You cannot mix code into a data package or vice-versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is literal madness in comparison to how most other AI products are run. Most of the time, an AI product is run on some GPUs you got somewhere that run some firmware that you probably haven't tested or verified (even though everyone with access to the GPU can reflash the firmware from software), with bog-standard ngnix or something choosing to route your requests to a service running somewhere without any real guarantees that the service is not logging and storing literally everything you put into it. From a user privacy standpoint, it's basically the same as using Instagram. You assume that everything is being logged and used to make money somehow.</p>
<p>Apple is standing in stark opposition to this and saying "no, we ain't doing that" and then backing it all up with code as well as detailed documentation for how they pulled it all off. They also released the source code for the security-critical parts of Private Cloud Compute <a href="https://github.com/apple/security-pcc">openly on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This is the holy grail for remotely attested trusted compute. This OS is the kind of thing that Richard Stallman was warning about in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html">The Right to Read</a>. You don't get root there. You don't get a compiler. You don't get a debugger. You don't get anything but the ability to run software that was shipped with the OS image. If this OS were shipped to consumers, you would have a nearly unhackable system that would make it basically impossible to tinker with. There are many reasons why you would want such a thing in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWzz3NeDz3E">the era of phone scamming the elderly</a>, but it would make it difficult for people like me to be developed with it.</p>
<p>However, for something like Private Cloud Compute, it's a perfect match. All the computer can do is known in advance and nothing else is allowed to happen. This makes it a lot easier to ensure that privacy guarantees are that: guarantees.</p>
<p>It's really frustrating that this foundation of trusted compute is being squandered. I wish I had an OS like Private Cloud Compute's as an option for building production systems.</p>
<h2>What we got</h2>
<p>We got the first batch of Apple Intelligence features at the end of October 2024. They've been advertised as if they are all out. With that we got Writing Tools to help you summarize and rewrite text; summaries for notifications, webpages, and emails; Clean Up in case you want to remove things from photos; the ability to search for photos based on their contents; Siri being able to search through the documentation for your device; and Math Notes to let you solve equations in the Notes app. Later we got Image Playground and email categorization. That mythical personal context is omnipresent in the advertising yet somehow, it's not launched yet.</p>
<p>I'm gonna break down my feelings about each of these features in their own little sections after having used them somewhat extensively.</p>
<h3>Math Notes</h3>
<p>I just want to start out by saying that out of all of these features the one that I love the most is Math Notes. Holy crap, Math Notes is incredible. It lets you type out things like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>Rent <span>=</span> <span>2300</span>
</span><span>FamilySize <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
</span><span>Rent / FamilySize <span>=</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then the Notes app will just insert <code>1150</code> after that last equals sign. It's fantastic. I end up using this to do basic calculations with variables including terrible estimates for how much money I'm making vs spending. It's probably one of the best features ever made for any Apple device ever.</p>
<p>I have zero complaints about Math Notes.</p>
<h3>Writing Tools</h3>
<p>I'm not the target audience for Writing Tools. I've written a bunch of articles on my blog and frankly, I don't really need help from an AI model in order to write; I have a bigger problem not writing than I do writing. With that in mind, Writing Tools is basically useless for me. It's just a way to get a slightly worse version of what I already have the ability to make myself better.</p>
<p>Using Writing Tools makes me feel the worst side effects of existing AI tools and how they replace the creative process instead of adding to it. When I put text through Writing Tools I get an opaque answer. I don't get layers into the answer or steerability beyond "make this professional" or "turn this into a table", I just get a blob of text that can be painful to read.</p>
<p>For example, I asked Writing Tools to summarize that last paragraph and here's what I got:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/writing-tools-fail.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/writing-tools-fail.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/writing-tools-fail.webp"><img alt="a modal dialog over the previous paragraph in Apple Notes titled 'Writing Tools Unavailable: Certain capabilities are unavailable at this time.

Try again later.'</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can't make this up. I asked it to make it friendlier and I got this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Writing Tools has some serious drawbacks. It feels like it’s taking away the creative process instead of enhancing it. When I input text into Writing Tools, I get a generic response that lacks depth and customization options. It’s like getting a one-size-fits-all answer that’s hard to follow and doesn’t allow for much creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be useful for taking a bunch of ranting I do on stream and turning that into an outline that I can use for a starting point in writing, but it does a terrible job of doing the writing for me. I imagine that for other people that don't have extensive English experience that it'd be a lot more useful, but I don't know how useful it is for me.</p>
<h3>Notification, Message, and Email summaries</h3>
<p>This is the biggest feature that sounds like a good idea until you actually implement it. The core idea is that when you get a bunch of notifications from your apps, you have a stack of things that can be tedious to go through. A summary is easier to digest and gets the point across much easier.</p>
<p>This works great until it doesn't. Here's the summary of a scam text message I got as I was writing this post:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sms-scam-fail.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sms-scam-fail.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sms-scam-fail.webp"><img alt="A message summary: 'Package delivery delayed due to incomplete address information...'" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sms-scam-fail.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>A message summary: 'Package delivery delayed due to incomplete address information...'</figcaption></figure>
<p>This phrases a <em>literal scam message</em> in ways that make me think immediate action is required. You can see how this doesn't scale, right? It's gotten to the point where the news has reported on how notification summaries <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">made people think a suspect in custody killed themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Even more, if you have Apple Intelligence enabled for some of the other features but disable notification summaries because you find them worthless, you can get your notifications delayed up to <em>five seconds</em>. It's kind of depressing that telling your computer to do <em>less work</em> makes the result take longer than doing <em>more work</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, none of the summarization features work on my iPhone and I can't be bothered to figure out why and fix it. I personally don't find them useful. I just leave them enabled on my MacBook so that notification delivery is not impacted.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is percussive-maintenance" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/percussive-maintenance/128"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>Even though it has decent "Apple polish", it just feels half-baked somehow.
It's almost like it's not done yet but they were made to just ship whatever
they had in order to meet some arbitrary deadline made up by someone that
doesn't understand the details. This feels like it's happening across the
industry though, especially as companies try to milk the money generator for
more money.</p></div></div>
<h3>Clean Up</h3>
<p>I don't like Clean Up from a philosophical standpoint. I'm a photographer. When I frame a shot and take it, I want the data coming off of the sensor to be the data that makes up the image. I want to avoid as much processing as possible and I want the photo to be a reflection of reality as it is, not reality as it should have been. Sure, sometimes I'll do some color correction or cropping in post, but that doesn't change the <em>content</em> of the image, only its presentation.</p>
<p>Clean Up is best explained by this famous photo editing example:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/stalin-photo.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/stalin-photo.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/stalin-photo.webp"><img alt="A picture of Joseph Stalin, former Prime Minister of the Soviet Union next to Nikolai Yezhov before and after being removed from Soviet history after being purged." loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/stalin-photo.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>A picture of Joseph Stalin, former Prime Minister of the Soviet Union next to Nikolai Yezhov before and after being removed from Soviet history after being purged.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This tool allows you to capture a moment in time as you wish it happened, not as it actually happened. I don't like this from a philosophical standpoint. I'd much rather capture things as they were. As such, I haven't used Clean Up and can't talk about it much more.</p>
<h3>Image Playground</h3>
<p>I have a lot of thoughts about Image Playground. I've used a lot of image generation models and I'm currently working on experiments with conveyance (images that convey feelings or moods that would take many words to explain) in generative AI. Here's one of my successful examples:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sakura-flower-field.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sakura-flower-field.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/sakura-flower-field.webp"><img alt="A picture of a brown-haired anime woman smiling in a field of blooming pink flowers, heavy depth of field so only the woman and a couple of flowers are in focus.

Made with Stable Diffusion 1.5 and ComfyUI.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I made this using a stack of about 11 to 12 models in a complex diffusion flow using a Stable Diffusion 1.5 finetune from late 2022. Let's call this the upper bound of how good you can get outputs from techniques of the era. There's some glaring flaws (mostly involving the continuity of the fence, but that could be explained with fence construction methods).</p>
<p>In comparison, here's one of my Image Playground generations of the East Berlin TV tower at sunset:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/berlin-tv-tower.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/berlin-tv-tower.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/berlin-tv-tower.webp"><img alt="An AI-generated illustration of the East Berlin TV tower at sunset." loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/berlin-tv-tower.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>An AI-generated illustration of the East Berlin TV tower at sunset.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is also pretty good, there's problems with how the sky is half mid-day and half sunset and the windows/decks have a lot of issues with many straight lines, but it'd be mostly passable at a casual glance. Especially on a phone screen. I'm able to see a lot more of the flaws due to my extensive experience with AI tools, but in a pinch you probably wouldn't blink too hard at this.</p>
<p>I hate to admit that this is heavily cherry-picked. Most of the time, you will get horrors beyond mortal comprehension like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/hoof-taco.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/hoof-taco.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/hoof-taco.webp"><img alt="An AI-generated illustration of a taco smoking beer at a party.

<p>This is horrifying. I don't even know where to begin in talking about all of the things that are off or wrong with this image. I also don't think you would need special training or experience to understand what is wrong with this image.</p>
<p>Mind you, this both of those images were generated with plain text prompts. You can add people to these images. Using a photo of yourself is a great way to experience what dysmorphia feels like. Here's one of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/quinnypig.com">Corey Quinn</a> doing his typical gremlin smile:</p>

<p>I cannot believe that this is a shipped product from Apple. I genuinely am stunned. What the hell is going on over there?</p>
<p>This is from the company that refused to ship so many things that we'll never hear about. This is from the company that <em>defined</em> the idea of having a vision-based product. Of having a product vision so strong that they were willing to accuse people of <em>holding a device wrongly</em> rather than admit they messed up.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee/128"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>I feel like Image Playground (and Genmoji, which isn't talked about here due
to the fact that it's difficult to extract emoji from chat messages without
losing quality) creates results that are just as soulless and empty as it is.
This is the complete opposite of the level of care and quality that I've come
to expect from Apple over the years. It's like they've been forced to just
ship something due to either investor pressure or not wanting to be behind on
the curve; and nobody at the product team was able to stop it from hitting the
market.</p></div></div>
<p>And now every company out there is going to copy this with open-weights models and make things that don't look like horrifying monsters. While you get the oompa-loompas of doom staring into your soul on iPhones, the rest of the industry is going to be able to make things like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/flux-pro-berlin-tv-tower.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/flux-pro-berlin-tv-tower.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/flux-pro-berlin-tv-tower.webp"><img alt="A cartoon illustration of the Berlin TV tower at sunset.

<p>It's frustrating. It'd be better if there was an IntelligenceKit for developers to be creative with the models or something, but there isn't. It all just feels half-baked like they were forced to release it out of obligation to shareholders, not out of choice for meeting the product vision.</p>
<h2>Generative AI is not a product</h2>
<p>Back in September, I had a strange dream. If you know me well enough, you know that when I have a "strange dream", that usually means that something wild happened. In this dream, I had a conversation with Steve Jobs about product design, the philsophy of Apple enabling people to be creative, but the most salient point we discussed was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real way that technology can change lives is by acting as a bicycle for the mind, a way to take human's latent creativity and allow them to focus it and employ it into something that makes their lives better. Imagine picking up a guitar and creating a song by purely feeling out the notes and working it into a melody just from what feels "right". Based on what you've described, most generative AI is useless for that because it removes all the creative control when going from A to B.</p>
<p>If anything, the human cost seems like that it would outweigh any process gains from being able to draw a cat on the moon faster. Generative AI is completely useless as a product unto itself, but could be part of a larger product in some way. It should never be the selling point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-"Steve Jobs" in a dream, September 2024</p>
<p>Breaking this apart, what does being able to make a terrible illustration of <a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/berlin-tv-tower.jpg">the Berlin TV Tower</a> in a second or two really net us in terms of enabling creativity? You get a single final output. You don't get the layers to edit things like the color grading of the sky. Sure it'd be useful for low-effort social media posts, but this is not a product. This is a tech demo, and not even a good one. It'd be amazing if this was released 3 years ago, but it is 2025, not 2022.</p>
<p>If generative AI is not a product, then what is it really useful for? I know how to use it in creative flows because I already have the training needed to be an artist. I know how to use it in research environments due to having years of experience throwing science at the wall to see what sticks. I understand these tools and what they are good and bad at (this is why all of my AI illustrations that I put effort into end up with an anime-inspired artstyle because recreating humans photorealistically gets you inhuman monsters 7 times out of 10).</p>
<p>I think that it's better to view generative AI as an implementation detail, not the critical identity of the product. One of the best ways to understand a product is to start taking things away. If you take color out of a word processor, you still have a word processor. If you take bold or italic formatting out of a word processor, you still have a word processor. If you take font selection out of a word processor, you still have a word processor.</p>
<p>If you take away the display output from a word processor, you have a typewriter instead of a word processor. Thus, the core of a word processor is being able to see on the screen what you would see on the page before you hit print.</p>
<p>The core of why ChatGPT works as a product isn't the AI. It's the experience of each word being typed one at a time by the AI and saving your conversations with the AI for later.</p>
<h3>Where should we use generative AI?</h3>
<p>In terms of where I think generative AI is actually useful, it's in places that are not as flashy or exciting. Think data analysis, <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/qualitative-data-coding.html">qualitative data coding</a>, data entry, reading data out of images, and things along that nature. I've been working with a fellow redditor on a study involving people's experiences of medtation and the difficult to describe sensations that come up. We want to use generative AI to try and categorize those sensations and see if we can get an effective result without as much drudgery involved as you'd get doing it by hand.</p>
<p>I'll have more news about this by June. It'll involve publishing a paper or two in actual journals.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think that Apple Intelligence is a failure of a product from an implementation standpoint. This is frustrating because the foundation they are building on top of is nearly invincible. All data is processed on device as much as possible. Everything that can't be processed on your device is put into frontier-grade security practices to make sure it's as private and encrypted as possible.</p>
<p>The thing that sucks about it is that they made the holy grail of remotely attested trusted compute and then made the end result so much worse to use than manually making your own integrations with <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> on the <em>same device</em>. Using Ollama lets you pick models that are so much better than what you get with Apple Intelligence. And it'd be just as private.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee/128"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>I just can't help but imagine what it could have been. I know that the Apple
we have would never do that, but I just can't help but wonder. Apple spends
untold amounts of money trying to create things and they get beaten by a bunch
of people in caves with boxes of scraps and consumer GPUs.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee/128"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>You know, maybe that's why the open-source community will always win here.
Apple has no real limits. The open-source community has to milk everything
they can get out of the hardware they have. Their withered hardware requires
them to use <a href="https://newsletter.bijanstephen.blog/lateral-thinking-with-withered-technology/">lateral
thinking</a>
to get what they want. And they'll pretty much always win because then they
can deploy their creations into production. With zero modifications.</p></div></div>
<p>Needless to say, they did not give us bicycles of the mind. They gave us marginal improvements that feel like tech demos. The potential was so infinite and it just all feels wasted.</p>
<p>Except for Math Notes. Holy crap. I love Math Notes so much. I wish other note-taking apps had it. It's easily the best feature they've ever come up with.</p>
<p>I have a lot of complicated and nuanced thoughts about all this, and probably still have another 5-10k words left in me. Wish me luck.</p>

<div>

		<p>I stopped going on Twitter a while ago because it has the tendency to evoke rage, as it is designed to do. But every now and then I check back in - it can be useful sometimes for keeping up with graphics research, gamedev news and some people do post nice things, like sharing projects they are working on, so there is something to pull me back from time to time.</p>

<p>After checking the other day I saw this debate going around about not using an IDE or debugger, just using ‘notepad’ to write code. I looked in the comments, people arguing about who was right and all the usual toxic vibes, and it reminded me of some earlier occasions of people discussing the same topic.</p>

<p>It feels like the same old debate has been going on for a long time now, it’s packaged differently each time, but I don’t really know why people get so wound up about things. The main arguments are “if you need to use a debugger you’re an idiot and you don’t understand the code you are writing” (that’s not an actual quote but there was a similar take along those lines). Then there is “If you can’t use a debugger you’re an idiot”. The hating on the ‘printf’ crew is omnipresent.</p>

<p>At the risk of poking a hornet’s nest, I just wanted to share some thoughts and ideas on this subject in a balanced way, because I don’t think there needs to be an ultimate solution here. We need to debug code and there are tools out there to help us, some are more useful than others in certain situations, but at the end of the day do whatever you need to do to fix those bugs.</p>

<h2 id="debuggers">Debuggers</h2>

<p>I use a debugger regularly, I will launch most work in C++ from Visual Studio or Xcode and preferably run in a debug build. I know for some people this is often a terrible UX because of the performance of debug builds, so a prerequisite here is fast debug builds. This is hard to retrofit but having a usable debug build is useful. Once running I can use the debugger break and step if I need to, and if I encounter a crash then there is a nice call stack I can look through in more detail.</p>

<p>I have noticed that it is extremely common for graduate and junior software engineers to have little to no debugging knowledge or experience. It’s not something that seems like it is taught at university and I have also been told stories of teachers imposing their usage of VIM and esoteric debugging strategies upon the students. For the record I am not a VIM user (another topic that ends up in polarising debates). I find using a mouse and 2 finger typing works for me.</p>

<p>The moment when you show someone how to use a hardware breakpoint or a watchpoint and find a bug immediately is like seeing the lightbulb appear on top of their head, a whole world of possibility opening in front of them, or the dismay of the wasted hours trying to catch some dodgy logic through layers and layers of object oriented spaghetti.</p>

<p>Some of those argue about using only ‘notepad’ and no debugger because they can dry run their code on paper and they “don’t write bugs”, but I find it difficult to understand how they work within a larger team project or codebase . A lot of bugs and issues I have ever had to fix were not in code I wrote myself, they were in legacy systems, colleague’s code, or in open source code (and some hard as nails bugs to track too!) that had been just lifted into a project. If you believe in the impending AI coding apocalypse then human engineers may merely be around to debug and fix issues with AI generated code. So yeah, being able to write perfect code yourself is one thing, but using a debugger to debug existing code in a large complex project shouldn’t be a thing of shame and we might need all the tools we can to help.</p>

<p>Along with debuggers we get all sorts of other tools, which also should be used as and when we need them. Address sanitizer can catch memory issues easily, where in a bygone era we would have this 1 in 1000 crash somewhere reading outside of an array bounds, we can enable ASan and catch this every time without the undefined behaviour lottery. Same for undefined behaviour sanitizer, now we can catch UB when it’s benign and not only when a noticeable side effect occurs.</p>

<p>I don’t know if these notepad-only coders are taking all of those tools off the table as well, but when you have something like ASan that can catch an issue for you I just don’t really know why you wouldn’t use it. I have seen a lot of comments that seem to suggest the debugger slows them down, but in this case I certainly think the debugger speeds you up.</p>

<p>So if you’re reading this and you don’t know about these tools I would say take a look and see, they can be useful and might be able to save you a lot of time. There are tons of things you can do and it’s hard to cover it all here. I learned a lot from working with other people and side by side debugging difficult problems. I think there should be more resources to teach these skills instead of it being handed down information.</p>

<h2 id="printf-debugging-is-ok">Printf debugging is OK</h2>

<p>So for the ‘printf’ haters I would also say that whilst using a debugger most of the time, sometimes I revert to ‘printf’ debugging. There are some situations where there is no other choice - in the past I have had to debug release builds where we were unable to reproduce the bug in debug. Even pulling in debug modules for the engine (for on screen debug info) changed the executable such that we couldn’t reproduce the issue. The last thing was to put a few print statements in using the raw ‘printf’ and removing them and adding more as we narrowed down the issue and eventually extracted enough information to fix the problem.</p>

<p>I have also had the need to use ‘printf’ when debugging certain kinds of behaviours in an application. In the case of something like touch event tracking for mobile devices, if you try to debug an issue with breakpoints you interrupt the hardware and it makes it difficult to reproduce issues in the same way they appear naturally. So here printing the state of touch down events, touch up events, and being able to see the logical flow can identify a problem. There are many more scenarios that benefit from this type of debugging. Just throw the prints in and make sure to remove them after so no one knew you were ever there, like a ninja.</p>



<p>Custom UI based debugging tools can go one step further than printf debugging, providing some similar traits but also allowing more flexibility and controllability, I assume the notepad wielders who don’t use a regular debugger must have some such custom tools and things to help them track down issues. I am a big fan of embedded debugging and profiling tools within an application. You know stuff like performance counters that I can just pop-up in a UI or tweakable values to help to refine behaviours or visual appearance. I find that since the explosion of ImGui the level of integrated ad-hoc debugging tools and info has exponentially increased.</p>

<p>But with these kinds of custom tools, I personally wouldn’t try and re-invent the wheel. I would aim to make stuff that complements the existing tools I can pull off the shelf. So for example I like to have a quick, at a glance profiler for all my key performance hotspots that I can check whenever I notice something. But for more in-depth profiling I would use a CPU or GPU profiler to dig deeper.</p>

<h2 id="just-doing-what-needs-to-be-done">Just doing what needs to be done</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, finding bugs is just something that we need to get done, whatever helps you find and fix the issue doesn’t bother me as long as we get the job done. On a closing note, I noticed some code in a pull request left in by accident by another person:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>some_condition</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I found this interesting. I do the same thing except I usually name my variable ‘a’. This is to insert some code where a breakpoint can be put on the ‘int x’ line and then it kind of acts like a conditional breakpoint when some_condition is true. You could use a conditional breakpoint within the debugger, but they can be slow and for me historically unreliable, but this little snippet gives you your own conditional breakpoint that works without fail.</p>

<p>Just make sure to remove the code before the PR next time!</p>

  <h2><a name="Why">Why?</a></h2>
  <p>
   I love food and I love to cook. I love to study the science of cooking.
   I'm very lucky—I'm not in a position that I <em>have</em> to strongly
   limit my food expenses, but I have always wanted to see how well I could
   cook and eat on a limited budget.  It would encourage me to think about new
   ingredients, new techniques, and new dishes.  I love cooking competition
   shows like <i>Iron Chef</i>, and enjoy cooking with limited
   ingredients, or cooking with a lot of a specific ingredient that someone
   dumps in my lap.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Okay, that's only part of my inspiration.  I used to have a huge box of
   <i>Richie Rich</i> comic books that I bought from my friend for $3.  In
   case you're not familiar with all of the employees of the Rich family,
   their chef was Chef Pierre, the world's greatest chef.  One time, Chef
   Pierre was kidnapped and held by a bunch of criminals.  The criminals told
   Chef Pierre that he had to cook for them—<em>but they only had potato
   chips and ketchup!</em>.  Not a problem for the world's greatest chef!  He
   created food that was so delicious that the criminals quickly got
   fat—so fat that they couldn't get through the entrance to their
   hideout!  Chef Pierre then escaped by simply walking out unchallenged!
   (After which, Mr. Rich's security force swept in and cut all the criminals'
   heads off.)

  </p><p>
   In any case, I always wanted to be <em>that good</em>, and be <em>that
   versatile</em> with ingredients: so good that I could make a good meal out
   of whatever's on hand.  I'd love to be on a cooking challenge show, and see
   how well I could do with constraints and surprises, and with limited
   ingredients (like whatever's on a great sale, or your neighbor drops on
   your doorstep.)  I consider this my preparation.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Why250">Why $2.50 a day?</a></h2>
  <p>
   It seemed like a fairly challenging target; enough so that I'd have to
   think harder and perhaps learn more.  When I started this challenge for the
   first time in 2014, a friend of mine noted that in nursing school, they
   were challenged to eat on $5/day.  (And record their nutrition and caloric
   intake.)  I estimated some of my meal costs, and decided that $2.50/day
   would be challenging, but safe and still fun.
  </p>

  <h2>Play Along</h2>
  <p>
   I encourage you to try challenging yourself to make meals for whatever
   price you care to choose, for whatever duration you choose, whether it's
   for 45 days, or once a week, or whatever.  Please let me know what you do,
   either by email at <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com"><i>eliasen@mindspring.com</i></a>
   or on  Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/aeliasen" target="_blank">@aeliasen</a>.
   I'll share good recipes and recommendations on here.  Also, share food with
   others and donate to your local food banks!
  </p>

  <h2><a name="RulesAndGuidelines">Rules and Guidelines</a></h2>
  <p>
   I've set some rules and guidelines for myself to follow:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li><b>Have Fun!</b>  This is a fun experiment.  I <em>get to</em> make
    yummy food that I'm proud of and that I'm happy to eat!  If I'm not having
    fun and eating great food, I'm doing it wrong.

   </li><li><b>$2.50 a day.</b> I could do this a lot of different ways, such as
   <em>averaging</em> food costs over 45 days.  However, I think that setting
    an approximate limit of $2.50 <em>each and every day</em> is a stricter
    constraint.  (As an engineer, I find strict constraints freeing.  It
    reduces the number of possibilities you have to consider.)  I feel I'll
    have to think a bit more and learn more with the stronger constraint.  If I
    have money left over after a day, I'm generally not going to let that "roll
    over" to the next day.  This <em>doesn't</em> mean that I can't make a big
    batch of something that costs $10 to make, and then eat it for 4 days!

   </li><li><b>Be Safe!</b> Maintain and track nutrition, get enough calories, and
    don't eat rotten food.  (I would say "I'm not going to dumpster dive" but
    after watching the fascinating Documentary <a href="http://www.divethefilm.com/" target="_blank"><i>Dive!</i></a>, I
    think that's a valid approach!)
    
   </li><li><b>Share Food!</b>  I'm going to share the food I make with others.
    That's part of the fun.  So I'm going to report my costs as single-person
    costs here.  That said, I'm not going to "cheat" by buying bulk
    ingredients in huge quantities that I can't properly preserve and use.
    When I find good deals, I'm going to buy more for food banks, too.
    
   </li><li><b>Share Recipes and Techniques!</b>  That's the point of this blog.  I
    hope if you have good recipes and ideas, you'll <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">share them with me.</a>

   </li><li><b>Track and Minimize Waste.</b>  Food that I don't use needs to be
    factored into my costs.  Plan meals to prevent spoilage.  Learn to
    preserve.

   </li><li><b>Gifts are Free!</b> If someone gives me food (like the awesome
    canned fruits my Aunt gives out for Christmas,) I consider it free.  If
    you have excesses of food, give them to your friends and neighbors.

   </li><li><b>Don't make myself tired of my favorite foods.</b> I don't have a
    membership to a Costco or other membership warehouse, and I'm not planning
    to get one for this experiment. I used to have one, but with 1 or 2 people,
    there was hardly anything in quantities that I could use in time.
    (Especially when sharing a freezer between 4 guys in college.)  I'm going
    to buy what I can conveniently buy and store, (and not eat tater tots for a
    solid month straight like I did in college.  I loved tater tots before that
    and couldn't stand them for years afterwards.)

   </li><li><b>Be realistic.</b>  I'm not going to drive across town because they
    have a slightly cheaper deal on chicken wings.  I'm not going to spend all
    day clipping coupons.  I'm going to shop pretty much like I always have.
    I will look into ways of getting food cheaper, though.

   </li><li><b>Be efficient.</b> Especially with my time.  Making big batches and
    eating the same thing for several meals is one of the secrets of
    efficiency.  Spending part of a day making freezable food that will feed
    you for weeks is incredibly efficient.
    
   </li><li><b>Keep on Sciencing!</b>  Yes, I've built my own sous vide cooking
    apparatus.  I made molecular gastronomy kits for my relatives for
    Christmas.  I buy sciencey cooking books.  I <em>will not</em> apologize
    for busting out the science or a cool apparatus.

   </li><li><b>Don't burden others.</b>  If I want to go with friends to dinner, I
    will!  I will order whatever I'd normally order.  I won't make my friends
    worry about my experiment, and I certainly don't want people not to invite
    me.  I won't be a food snob or a martyr.  This is a <em>fun</em>
    experiment.

   </li><li><b>Demonstrate Calculating Costs and Nutrition.</b>  I've developed an
    awesome calculating tool and programming language called <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> that helps make calculations with units of
    measure easy.  Interspersed with this document will be calculations that
    demonstrate how easy Frink makes it to calculate things!

   </li><li><b>Exceeding my budget is not failure.</b> As an engineer, I know that
    everything you try isn't a success the first time.  Every day, I'll try to
    analyze and point out how I could have done better, and can do better the
    next time.  In science, a negative result is every bit as important as a
    positive result.  To quote Thomas Edison, when asked why thousands of his
    experiments on batteries didn't produce a working result: "Results! Why,
    man, I have gotten a lot of results!  I know several thousand things that
    won’t work!" <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/07/31/edison-lot-results/">--Edison: His Life and Inventions, 1910</a>.
  </li></ol>

  <h2><a name="Day1">Day 1 - Tomato Soup and Two Toasted Cheese Sandwiches</a></h2>
  <p>
   The first day, not coincidentally, coincided with Ash Wednesday, the first
   day of Lent.  Since that's typically a date of fasting, I'm having a single
   meal.  But one of my favorites—good old Campbell's tomato soup and a
   couple of toasted cheese sandwiches!  And they were <em>proper</em> toasted
   cheese sandwiches.  Butter the bread on the outsides, fill them with good
   cheese, and cook them in an electric frying pan at 350 °F for a couple
   minutes on each side.
  </p>

  <p>
   I forgot to take pictures, but <em>you know what a toasted-cheese sandwich
    and tomato soup looks like.</em>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day1MeasuringCheese">Measuring Ingredients</a></h3>
  <p>
   I'm not always going to remember to measure and weigh my ingredients, but I
   did today, so I'll describe the process briefly.  A digital kitchen scale
   is very very useful for many types of cooking.
  </p>

  <p>
   I like my tomato soup made with milk, so I added 1 can of milk.  Now, a
   digression:
  </p>

  <div>
   <h4><a name="OuncesVsFluidOunces">Ounces vs. Fluid Ounces</a></h4>
   <p>
    A quick digression:  Ounces (and pounds and kilograms) are a unit of
    <em>mass</em>.  "Fluid ounces" (also written fl.oz.) are a unit of
    <em>volume</em>.  Don't confuse them.
   </p><p>
    The labels on liquids and semi-liquids (like mayonnaise) is usually
    indicated in fluid ounces (volume.)  The labels on solids and canned goods
    is usually labeled in ounces (mass.)
   </p>
   
   <p>
    (By the way, if you think that a pound or an ounce is a unit of
    <em>weight</em>, and not mass, that's a common (but potentially dangerous)
    misconception.  Read the full discussion of this in <a href="http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/faq.html#pound" target="-blank">this
    Frink FAQ entry.</a>)
   </p>
  </div>

  <p>
   Okay, back to the topic.  I buy my milk by the gallon (volume) but the can
   of soup is marked by the <em>mass</em> it contains.  I wanted to measure
   the volume of the can.  The easiest way to do that, using just a scale, is
   to weigh the can filled with water, and then weigh the can empty and
   subtract the weights.  This gives you the weight of water that filled the
   can.  Fortunately, our units of mass and volume are calibrated around water.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following are all basically equivalent statements:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>1 gram of water fills 1 milliliter.
   </li><li>1 gram of water fills 1 cubic centimeter, or 1 cc, or 1 cm<sup>3</sup>.
    (That is, a cube 1 centimeter on a side.  Note that this is the same as a
    milliliter.) 
   </li><li>1 kilogram of water fills one liter.
   </li><li>1 kilogram of water fills a cube 10 cm on a side (this is the same as a
    liter.)
   </li><li>1 ounce of water fills 1 fluid ounce.
   </li><li>1 pound of water fills one (U.S.) pint. (a pint is 16 fluid ounces.)
   </li><li>The density of water is 1 kilogram / liter.
   </li><li>The density of water is 1 gram / cm<sup>3</sup>.
   </li><li>The density of water is 1 ounce / floz.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   These rules make it easy.  The can, filled with water, was 10.7 ounces 
   heavier than the empty can, so it contained 10.7 fluid ounces of water.
   Since a gallon of milk cost $2.99, the total milk cost was $0.25.
  </p>

  <p>
   I used up the last of a bit of fancy yummy shredded Tillamook Italian
   3-cheese (mozzarella, smoked Provolone and Parmesan!) that I still had
   open, so the cheese price was higher than some cheaper cheese that I bought
   later. (Again, no waste!)  We'll call it $6 / lb.  But how do you weigh
   shredded cheese?  You can't weigh the cheese first and then put it on the
   sandwich, because how will you know how much you're going to need?  I
   weighed the cheese by weighing the plate + bread before and after putting
   cheese on the bread and subtracting the difference.  It turned out to be 58
   g of cheese (total) for 2 sandwiches.
  </p>

  <p>
   I even measured the butter on the bread!  I didn't remember until buttering
   the last sandwich, and I didn't want to get butter all over my scale, so I
   weighed the butter dish + butter before and after buttering the last
   sandwich.  There was 16 g of butter for one sandwich (2 pieces of bread),
   so a whopping 32 grams for 2 sandwiches.  That amount surprised me.  When
   butter is $3.69 / lb, that comes to $0.26 of butter.  Surprising.  Hidden
   costs like this can add up!  I have to be careful not to miss them!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day1Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>A big part of eating inexpensively is watching for stuff to go on sale.
    Results that I can obtain today, I may not be able to obtain tomorrow!
   </li><li>Dollar Tree sells 41% larger cans of Campbell's tomato soup (15.2 oz
    vs. 10.75 oz) for $1.00.  (Safeway's advertised "everyday price" is $0.91,
    making Dollar Tree's offering 1.29 times as efficient.)
   </li><li>Look into house brands or giant cans of soup?
   </li><li>I can make <em>huge</em> batches of amazing soup much cheaper.  Stay
    tuned!
   </li><li>I'm using up existing food in my fridge for the first few days.  My
    costs should decrease as I start planning and buying better.
   </li><li>A good part of this exercise will be to develop and memorize "rules of
    thumb" to estimate how much a portion of food costs.
   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  A cup of milk costs about $0.20.
   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  A stick of butter can cost around $1.00.
   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  A tablespoon of butter costs about $0.12 (there are 8
    tablespoons in a stick of butter.)
   </li><li>Where is the "cent" sign on my keyboard?  My TRS-80 used to have one!
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   <i>Note:</i> The half can of milk and half can of soup was because I wasn't
   eating alone!  Again, the costs that I'm going to list here are for
   the portions that I personally eat, even if I share the meal with others.
   I also probably paid less for the tomato soup, but I don't have that old
   receipt.
  </p>

  <p>
   I mentioned homemade kimchi here, but I'll describe that another day when
   I have less to write about!
  </p>

  <div>
  <h4>Frink Calculations</h4>
  <p>
   I mentioned before that I've created a calculating tool / programming
   language called <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> which is
   great for helping with physical calculations.  I'm including some sample
   calculations so you can see how easy Frink makes calculating costs.  The
   above calculations were:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    milkcost = 2.99 dollars / gallon<br>
    10.7 floz milkcost<br>
   </code>
   <code>
    0.2499453125 dollar (currency)
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    cheesecost = 6 dollars/lb<br>
    58 g cheesecost<br>
   </code>
   <code>
    34800000/45359237 (approx. 0.76720867240337398) dollar (currency)<br>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    buttercost = 3.69 dollars/lb<br>
    2 * (272 - 256) g buttercost   // Multiply by 2 sandwiches<br>
   </code>
   <code>
    0.26032183918790344732 dollar (currency)
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   An important thing to note is that you specify the units of measure in each
   Frink calculation, and Frink automatically does the right thing with them.
   It contains a large <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdata/units.txt" target="_blank">data
   file</a> of physical quantities, freeing you from having to look them up,
   and freeing you to make effortless calculations without getting bogged down
   in the mechanics.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that in the above calculations, Frink already knows about units of
   measure such as dollars, gallons, pounds, grams, and allows you to
   transparently mix those units of measure in calculations.  For example, in
   the cheese calculations, the cost was specified in dollars per pound, while
   the cheese was weighed and had its mass specified in grams.  Nevertheless,
   you can transparently multiply these and Frink helps ensure the results
   come out right.
   </p>

   <p>
    <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> runs on your computer
    (Windows, Mac, Linux) or on your Android device with the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=frink.android&amp;hl=en">Frink
    Programming Language</a>.  You can use Frink <a href="http://futureboy.us/fsp/frink.fsp" target="_blank">in a web-based
    interface.</a> Give it a try!  It'll make you look smarter.

  <h2><a name="Day2">Day 2 - Cabbage Burgers:  My Secret Weapon</a></h2>
  <p>
   I actually started preparing for this experiment a few days in advance, and
   readied my secret weapon: <b>Cabbage Burgers!</b> These are also variously
   known as "Krautburgers" (although that gives the incorrect impression that
   there's sauerkraut inside; it's just cooked unfermented cabbage,) or known
   as "Cabbage Rolls" or "Runza" or "The Best Food You Can Prepare in Advance
   and Freeze."  They're a bun filled with cabbage, onions, and ground beef.
   They're delicious, nutritious, filling, inexpensive, and they freeze and
   microwave incredibly well, so you can make a giant batch and have cheap
   food ready in minutes!
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/krautburgers1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/krautburgers640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"></a>

  <p>
   The previous weekend, I made a gigantic batch of these little delights,
   using 4 pounds of ground chuck, 2 heads of cabbage, 5 onions, 13 cups of
   flour, 13 egg yolks (which left me 13+ egg whites for breakfast for 4 days)
   and a few other ingredients.  It was a huge undertaking, but it produced 61
   delicious krautburgers that went into the freezer and should provide about
   30 meals!  Each krautburger cost, by my estimate, about
   <strike>$0.41,</strike> $0.47 (see <a href="#CabbageRollCost">cabbage roll
   cost update</a>), and two of them make a good meal for only about
   <strike>$0.82</strike> $0.94!  I've learned that making a huge batch will
   last for weeks or months, and is as easy as making a smaller batch.
  </p>

  <p>
   Because I'm going to be eating Krautburgers many times over the next 45
   days, I'll publish the recipe and the cost breakdown later.  <i>Update:</i>
   the recipe was published on <a href="#Day13">day 13</a> and the cost
   breakdown on <a href="#Day16">day 16</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   To combine my "Reduce Waste" and "Gifts are Free" rules, I ate half of the
   orange that I got in my Christmas stocking (I've never cared that much for
   most fruit, and I might have let it go to waste if not for this
   experiment,) and 6 cherries that my aunt canned this year and gave as
   Christmas presents.  These were delicious!  I also ate 1/8 of the pound of
   asparagus I bought for $0.99 / pound.  (Put in microwave-safe ventable
   casserole dish, add 1/4 inch water, put the lid on, open the vent, and
   microwave for 7 minutes.)   Later, I had a bowl of vanilla pudding that I
   made a few days earlier.  A good day of eating, and quite cheap!
  </p>

  <h3>Personal Notes</h3>
  <p>
   I have to admit that I went to bed the previous night feeling rather
   hungry.  I expected this.  The more I eat, the more I <em>need</em> to eat
   to feel satisfied.  The less I eat, the less I <em>need</em> to eat to feel
   satisfied.  My super-scientific hypothesis is that my stomach "shrinks" a
   bit when I don't eat.  Since I had a semi-fasting day yesterday, I felt
   hungry.  And I found it hard to sleep.  Hope I adjust.
  </p>

  <p>
   It's weird, but if I go to sleep hungry, I usually wake up <em>not</em>
   feeling hungry.  It was hard not to snack before bed, but I managed to pull
   through.  
  </p>

  <p>
   About my usual eating schedule: I very rarely eat breakfast.  Never have,
   at least since college.  I'm usually not hungry in the morning, I'm always
   grumpy in the morning, (okay, I'm grumpy all day, always) and I'd
   <em>always, always</em> choose sleeping 5 more minutes over spending time
   eating!  I'm usually fine with eating just one meal a day in the evening,
   and maybe a snack later.  Everybody's schedule and needs are going to be
   different.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day2Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>A very inexpensive day!  $1.48, far below my target!  Planning ahead by
    making a large batch of great krautburgers <em>definitely</em> pays off.  I
    didn't feel hungry when going to bed, and I could have eaten twice as many
    krautburgers and still made my target!

   </li><li>Krautburgers combine two of the great inexpensive "fillers":  flour and
    cabbage.  (Another is potatoes.)  There's not a lot of calories in cabbage,
    but it's delicious and filling, and figures in a lot of low-cost recipes.

   </li><li>In old prison films, prisoners only get "bread and water" or maybe
    "bread and cheese."  Should I try this one day?  Can I make bread cheaper
    than I can buy it?
    
   </li><li>I'm glad I'm not addicted to coffee or caffeine any more.  I never
    drank coffee but I used to drink at least 4 caffeinated soft drinks a
    day. A roommate of mine was once quite surprised that a majority of his
    daily costs went to coffee.  If you shop carefully, you can get a can of
    soda for $0.33 or so, or it can be much more if you buy it from a vending
    machine!

   </li><li>It's not a stated goal of this experiment, but I have a few extra
    pounds of fat around my gut that I don't mind losing.  I'm down about 2
    pounds already, which isn't unwelcome.  Should I graph my weight?

   </li><li>I'm probably not at the calorie total I need to be sustaining
    long-term.

  <h2><a name="Day3">Day 3 - Egg Salad and Surprise Salmon</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="EggSaladSandwiches">Egg Salad Sandwiches</a></h3>
  <p>
   Egg salad sandwiches are one of my favorite sandwiches ever—they're
   rich and luxurious and filling.  I always considered them to be rather
   expensive and difficult, but they're quite the opposite.  They're
   especially cheap if you have cheap eggs (Albertson's had a dozen eggs for
   $0.99, which is considerably cheaper than the average $2.19/dozen.)  And if
   you have eggs that are already hard-boiled, as I did, it's even easier.
  </p>

  <p>
   (I didn't actually boil the eggs, though.  I steamed them in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/West-Bend-TEM500W-Muffin-Toaster/dp/B008YNFB3Q/" target="_blank">Breakfast Machine</a>, which I love.  It's a toaster that
   can also cook 1 to 4 eggs, either poached/steamed, soft-boiled, or
   hard-boiled.  (There's also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/West-Bend-TEM4500W-Muffin-Toaster/dp/B008LTIYN2/" target="_blank">4-slice, 8 egg model</a>.)  Fill it with the appropriate
   amount of water (it comes with a cup marked with the right amounts of water
   for hard, medium, soft, and poached eggs,) and push the button, and you have
   perfectly-cooked eggs. This is good because I've never been good at getting
   eggs cooked just right; I live at more than a mile above sea level, and
   water boils at the lower temperature of 204°F (95°C), so none of
   the "never fail" egg-boiling recipes you hear ever work right for me.  A
   "3-minute egg" is still basically uncooked.)
  </p>

  <p>
   I made egg salad by mashing 3 hard-boiled eggs with 80 grams of mayonnaise,
   a tiny squirt of mustard, and some salt and pepper.  That's it!  I should
   note most strongly that <em>if you put anything else (like celery) into
   your egg salad, you are a terrible monster.</em> Also, egg salad is best on
   plain old soft cheap white bread.  (There's also nothing more elegant and
   delicate for your afternoon tea than an egg salad sandwich with the crusts
   cut off!)
  </p>

  <p>
   Each sandwich only used about 3/4 of an egg, (about $.06 at my good egg
   prices,) $0.08 of mayonnaise, and $0.10 of plain old white bread, for a
   total of $0.24 per sandwich.  I had one and a half sandwiches, a few chips
   that I still had open (I weighed them to see how much they would cost) and
   felt like a king.
  </p>

  <p>
   (By the way, I saw an egg salad sandwich at the grocery store for $4!)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SurpriseSalmon">Surprise Salmon</a></h3>
  <p>
   Today, I went shopping at Albertson's, with a carefully-selected shopping
   list based on their weekly advertisement.  Since it's a Friday during Lent,
   I planned on making a fish dish.  (I've never understood how eating fish
   was in any way a sacrifice, though.)  I had an interesting recipe for fish
   chowder (which I've never made before,) which sounded filling (it had
   potatoes and milk).  Albertson's advertised frozen tilapia, swai, and
   pollock on sale for $2.99/lb.  These fish can be somewhat bland, but that's
   a pretty good price for fish.  This was my plan.
  </p>

  <p>
   However, when I looked at the frozen fish, I saw that they had <em>whole
   frozen pink salmon for $1.99/lb!</em> Salmon is one of my very favorite
   fish, and that is a <em>fantastic</em> price for salmon, which is usually 7
   to 10 dollars per pound, so I made the decision on the spot to buy a whole
   salmon and eat plain salmon instead!  (They had the same deal on whole
   salmon a year ago, and I didn't buy one, and I was sad for the whole year!)
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/wholesalmon1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/wholesalmon640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"></a>

  <p>
   2.25 pounds of salmon for only $4.48!
  </p>

  <p>
   It was kind of scary, because the fish I picked was rather large (2.25
   pounds) and frozen solid.  I hoped I'd be able to cut it and save portions
   for later.  Luckily, a rough serrated knife sawed through the
   completely-frozen fish quite easily, allowing me to separate it into
   portions for freezing:
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/cutsalmon1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/cutsalmon640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"></a>

  <p>
   I'm not good at butchering whole fish, but a long, thin, flexible knife let
   me remove the backbone and fins without much problem.
  </p>

  <p>
   I prepared a couple of baked potatoes by first microwaving them (using the
   "potato" button) and then brushing them with a bit of olive oil and kosher
   salt and finishing them in a 400°F oven (for crispiness.)
  </p>

  <p>
   While the potatoes were cooking, I brined and thawed the salmon in cold
   water for 30 minutes with some sugar and salt.  You know sometimes when you
   cook salmon and the yellow, buttery-looking albumin comes out in blobs on
   the surface of the fish?  It doesn't look great, but brining prevents the
   albumin from leaking out and adds flavor to the fish.  This is extremely
   important when smoking salmon, too!
  </p>

  <p>
   Since the oven was not at the right temperature for cooking salmon (I
   either bake it low and slow or under a hot broiler,) I decided to pan-fry
   the salmon using a technique that I learned from Eric Ripert that gives you
   super-crispy, yummy skin.  You dry the skin very well, and sprinkle the skin
   with a bit of salt, pepper and a fine dusting of Wondra flour.  Then
   pan-fry, skin down, with a little bit of oil and butter, pressing the fish
   down, cooking for 80% of the time on the skin side, and turning over
   briefly to finish.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/donesalmon1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/donesalmon640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"></a>
  
  <p>
   As you can hopefully see, the salmon skin was gorgeous and crisp.  I had
   salmon, 2 baked potatoes (with butter and sour cream, not pictured,)
   asparagus, and a slice of lemon.  The 6.25 ounce portion of salmon itself
   only cost $0.77!  Amazing!  Oh, and that's free dill from my aunt's garden
   on top of the salmon!  Note the additional costs below.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day3Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I checked the weekly supermarket advertisements very carefully for
    sales before shopping, and planned several meals to avoid waste.

   </li><li>The moral of this story is: read the ads, and plan your meals around
    deep discounts.

   </li><li>The moral of this story is: don't be afraid to adjust your plan based
    on what you see at the store.
    
   </li><li>Much of the hidden costs of cooking salmon and baked potatoes is in the
    olive oil and butter, as I was too lazy to walk 30 feet to grab some plain
    vegetable oil for cooking.  I'll do better next time.

   </li><li>The butter and sour cream on the baked potatoes are more expensive than
    the potatoes!  I cut back a bit on them, but could cut back more and still
    be happy.  Are there other things that are good on baked potatoes?

   </li><li>The cost for potatoes calculated above is for the potatoes I had left
    over in the pantry.  I bought potatoes much cheaper ($3 / (10 lb)) today,
    so I will do even better in the future on potatoes.

   </li><li>I thought potato chips would be too cost-prohibitive, but a small
    amount of house-brand chips doesn't cost a lot.  I like my salt!

   </li><li>Whenever you're cooking baked potatoes, cook a few extra and
    refrigerate them.  This lets you make fried potatoes the next day.  Fried
    potatoes are <em>much</em> quicker and better when the potato is already
    mostly cooked!  If they're not cooked already, it's hard to get the inside
    of the potato cooked without overcooking the outsides.

   </li><li>I have to say that Albertson's advertisements had at least ten times as
    many great deals than the other stores, which made me decide to go there.
    There were far, far more deep deals.  The other grocery stores (King
    Sooper's and Safeway) didn't even begin to compete on advertised bargains.
    You'll be impressed with some of the deals I got in the next days or weeks!

   </li><li>Almost every single thing on my receipt was on deep discount.  The only
    things not on sale were milk and butter.

   </li><li>Margarine is 1/4 the price of butter, but I'm sticking with butter.
    (Partially to avoid trans-fats.)  A bit of vegetable oil for cooking is
    even more cost-effective.

   </li><li>Answering my questions from the other day, big "family-sized" cans of
    tomato soup are actually <em>more</em> expensive per ounce than small
    cans!

   </li><li>I had bought 2 dozen eggs a week ago for the amazing price of
    $0.99/dozen, (they're normally $2.19/dozen) and I was sad that they were
    running out.  However, I was surprised to see eggs at Albertson's today
    for the incredible price of $0.50/dozen!  Yes!  I bought 2 dozen.  That's
    barely more than $0.04 an egg!

   </li><li>Eggs are <em>amazing.</em>  If someone asked you, as an engineer, how
    much you would charge to create an egg in a laboratory, how much would it
    cost?

   </li><li>When buying whole fish, you have to assume some waste from bones and
    fins and such.  There wasn't too much waste at all, but you have to factor
    this into your costs.  I still feel a little bad that I didn't try making
    fish stock from the bones and tail.  I will next time.  (Saving stock is
    great for other recipes or the best ramen ever.)

   </li><li>I didn't eat the salmon tail.  I've hosted cajun food parties almost
    every year for the past 20 years.  The first year, I asked the butcher
    to save me salmon tails, which I heard were good breaded and deep-fried.
    They ended up just being all bones and basically inedible.

  <h2><a name="Day4">Day 4 - Pork Soft Tacos</a></h2>
  <p>
   How is it possible that one of the most delicious cuts of meat you can buy
   is also one of the most inexpensive?  Nothing is more luxurious than a
   falling-apart-tender pork shoulder with its delicious mix of meat, fat, and
   gelatin.  The only trick is to cook it correctly, and that's not even a
   trick.  Pork shoulder requires low and slow heat for a long time to become
   tender.  This is where your slow cooker (also known as a crock pot) comes
   in.  A slow cooker is almost fool-proof.  In the morning, you can drop in
   your roast with some onions, seasonings, and liquid, set it to low, and
   come back 9 hours later for meat that's as tender as any you've ever tasted.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkrub1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkrub640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Uncooked pork shoulder with rub"></a>
  <p>
   <i>I rub you, my delicious pork shoulder.</i>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   And that's what I did.  In the morning, I took out the crock pot, set it to
   low, put in 3 chopped onions, took a pork shoulder and covered it with my
   <a href="#MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">homemade spice rub</a>, and set it
   on top of the onions, and added hot water to cover.  I then walked away.
   (Okay, I came back to add water as it warmed up.  More about that tomorrow
   when I discuss the science of meat temperatures.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Nine hours later, the house smelled amazing, the roast was tender, and the
   crock pot was filled to the top with rich, delicious broth.  Let me make a
   very, very important point:
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Save that broth!</b>
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkbroth1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkbroth640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pork Broth"></a>
  
  <p>
   I will repeat that:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <b>Save that broth!</b>  I had 4 quarts of dark, delicious, flavorful pork
   broth into which the fat, gelatin, meat juices, onions, and spices had
   mingled.  You can freeze this broth and make the most amazing ramen you've
   ever tasted.  Which I'm going to do soon.
  </p>

  <p>
   The pork shoulder was 3.41 lb at $1.99/lb, and it will make several meals
   of pork tacos.  Shredding the pork for tacos is easy.  Put some of it in a
   bowl, and take two forks and shred it.  It just pulls apart.  The tacos had
   shredded cheese (which I got for the very good price of $2.88/lb,) soft
   flour tortillas, and shredded cabbage.
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porktacos1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porktacos640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Completed Pork Tacos"></a>

  <p>
   It's a bit difficult to estimate the cost of the pork that went into each
   taco until all the pork is gone (which will take several days.)  Much of
   the original pork's mass went into the broth in the form of melted fat,
   gelatin, and meat juices, so weighing the final pork isn't enough to get a
   cost estimate.  I weighed all the other ingredients, though, and estimated
   a final cost of about $0.51 per big yummy taco.  I ate 4 tacos, so the
   estimated total for dinner was $2.04, for a very satisfying and balanced
   meal.
  </p>

  <p>
   The tacos have all your major food groups:  grains, dairy, meat, and
   vegetables.  Nothing more is required!
  </p>

  <p>
   For lunch, I had one and a half egg salad sandwiches and some kimchi, like
   yesterday.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day4Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Next time, make sure to warm up the tortillas, cheese, and cabbage
    before putting the pork in the taco.  It'll all come out warmer and nicer.

   </li><li>Save a little of the pork broth to reheat tomorrow's pork shoulder in,
    just as gently as your crock pot cooked it.  Don't boil or microwave it!

   </li><li>The pork and broth comes out of the crock pot quite hot.  Before I put
    it in the refrigerator or freezer, I put it into a container (a ziploc bag
    for the pork roast and tubs for the broth) and cool them in a cold water
    bath in the sink.  (Add ice to make it even faster.)  This reduces the
    time that the food spends in the so-called "danger zone" between 40°F
    and 140°F where bacteria can grow.  (I'll write more about food safety
    one of these days.)

   </li><li>Plan your pork and broth usage so that you're done eating it within 3-4
    days, unless you freeze it.

   </li><li>The cabbage was quite hard.  I'm thinking of salting a bit of the
    cabbage before adding it to the tacos tomorrow.  This rapidly softens the
    cabbage, (and makes it delicious!) as I'll describe when I describe how to
    make kimchi!

   </li><li>Some fancy pork tacos these days are made with kimchi instead of raw
    cabbage.  Try that?
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Wow!  <strike>Very close to my goal, but 5 cents over.</strike>
   <i>Update:</i> The price of pork <a href="#PorkRevision">was recalculated
   after the pork was done, bringing me back under budget.</a> Some of the
   costs that I've charged to this meal are actually in the 4 quarts of broth
   that are going to be used in future meals.  Saving the broth effectively
   makes these future meals cheaper or free!  I'm not going to try to do
   "creative bookkeeping" here, but track my costs honestly and
   conservatively.  I consider today a success.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Day5">Day 5 - Meat Science (and French Toast)</a></h2>
  <p>
   Breakfast/lunch was french toast and fried potatoes.  As I mentioned on <a href="#Day3Thoughts">day 3</a>, whenever you're baking potatoes, make
   another one or two for fried potatoes the next day.  Fried potatoes are
   <em>much</em> quicker and better when the potato is already mostly cooked!
   If they're not cooked already, it's hard to get the inside of the potato
   cooked without overcooking the outsides.  The fried potatoes cost $0.12 for
   about 4 ounces of potatoes.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/frenchtoast1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/frenchtoast640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="French Toast"></a>
  <p>
   French toast is easy, and contains two inexpensive ingredients:  eggs and
   bread.  (And a little milk and sugar.)  It turns out that each slice of
   toast uses 1/2 of an egg, so the total cost per slice was $0.10.  I had two
   slices.  Breakfast/lunch cost $0.32.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was exactly like day 4—more delicious pork tacos!  I believe
   that I greatly overestimated the amount of pork that I used on day 4, so I
   may go back and revise the cost of these meals after all the pork is gone,
   and I can divide the cost of the pork by how many tacos it made.
  </p>

  <p>
   Since I wrote about the pork tacos on <a href="#Day4">day 4,</a> as
   promised, I'm going to drop some meat science on you!

  </p><h3><a name="MeatScience">Meat Science!</a></h3>
  <p>
   A pork shoulder, uncooked, is a rather unruly chunk of meat.  It's a mix of
   intermingled muscle and fat.  As you may know, whenever muscle connects to
   fat, or muscle connects to bone, there's some connective tissue (commonly
   known as gristle when not cooked correctly) which is unchewable and
   <em>not</em> good eats.  However, when a pork shoulder is slow-cooked for 9
   or more hours at low temperature, you can eat every single bit of the
   shoulder, and it's smooth and delicious!  The connective tissue is no
   longer a problem.  What happened to it?
  </p>

  <p>
   The connective tissue is made mostly of collagen, a tough protein.  You can
   think of collagen as a three-stranded rope, which it strongly resembles.
   It's a helix of three strands wound around each other.  When you cook
   collagen above about 145°F (63 °C), the three strands begin to
   unwind from each other.  Each strand is gelatin.  Gelatin is an interesting
   protein that can hold up to 10 times its mass in water.  However, there's
   not much water originally in this gelatin strand.  With enough time and
   moisture, these gelatin strands will absorb water from the surrounding
   cooking liquid and muscle fibers (which squeeze out their own moisture as
   they heat up.)  This makes a rich gel that keeps the meat moist and
   delicious.
  </p>

  <p>
   Breaking down collagen into gelatin and making the gelatin absorb water is
   a process that takes both heat and time.  Collagen breaks down into
   gelatin and absorbs water well at temperatures around 174°F
   (79°C), which is the temperature that a good slow cooker on low setting
   should hold.  Collagen will break down and absorb water at even lower
   temperatures, but it takes significantly more time.
  </p>

  <p>
   (My slow cooker gets significantly hotter than this, eventually boiling (at
   the altitude I live, that's 204°F (95°C)) at the edges even on the
   low setting, so I like to start cooking with just enough water to cover the
   roast, and add more water as it gets too hot (as measured by a probe
   thermometer) eventually filling it to the top so I have lots of good broth.
   Starting with a small amount of water is smart because a crock pot heats
   quite slowly.  (My simple crock pot heats at only 215 watts on low and 335
   watts on high.)  Before your crock pot reaches 140°F (60°C), you are
   in the so-called "danger zone" where bacteria can grow.  You thus want to
   start with hot water to minimize time in the danger zone.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note:  Collagen also holds muscle fiber to muscle fiber, which is why you
   can shred individual fibers of the pork shoulder apart with a fork after
   breaking down the collagen with long, slow cooking.  This further
   tenderizes the meat, and holds moisture in the gelatin between muscle
   fibers.
  </p>

  <h4>So Why Don't We Cook All Meat This Way?</h4>
  <p>
   Cooking a pork shoulder at 174°F to 190°F for 9 or more hours makes
   it moist and luxurious.  This is a cut of meat with lots of collagen, which
   turns to gelatin, which holds liquids in the meat and keeps it moist and
   tender.
  </p>

  <p>
   However, if we tried to cook a lean piece of meat (without much connective
   tissue) this way, we would absolutely murder it and turn it into a dry,
   tight brick.  As meat gets much warmer than about 140°F (60°C), the
   muscle fibers and connective tissue contract and squeeze moisture out,
   making the meat very dry.  A piece of lean meat cooked at these
   temperatures for this amount of time would be tough and dry, especially
   because there's no gelatin to hold 10 times its mass in moisture in the
   meat.
  </p>

  <p>
   (For comparison, beef is a nice medium-rare at 131°F (55°C) and
   lean pork is "done" and no longer pink at 145°F (62.7°C).)
  </p>

  <p>
   "Stew meat" that cooks a long time in stews or chilis is usually something
   like pork shoulder or beef brisket with lots of collagen.  You won't
   improve your stew by putting in filet mignon or ribeye steak.  But pork
   shoulder or beef brisket are actually made <em>better</em> by long, slow,
   moist cooking at temperatures that would tie leaner meats into tough knots.
  </p>

  <p>
   I'll write more later about the two major proteins in meat, and why
   breaking one down protein (myosin) is good, and breaking the other protein
   (actin) down is bad, and how you can have the best of both worlds with the
   right cooking technique.  (Hint: it's called "sous vide".)

   Again, I won't know the pork cost per taco until all the pork is gone, so I
   may revise these figures.  The pork cost for day 4 was almost certainly
   overestimated, and I'm easily back within my budget today.
  </p>

  <p>

  <h2><a name="Day6">Day 6 - The Best Damn Ramen that You've Ever Seen</a></h2>
  <p>
   After shoveling heavy snow and breaking ice for almost two hours at very
   cold temperatures, I had 3-inch-long icicles of sweat hanging from my hair,
   and I was ready for a shower and a huge hot bowl of ramen noodles!
  </p>

  <p>
   Luckily, as you may remember from <a href="#Day4">day 4</a> when I made
   Pork Tacos, I saved the delicious broth from the slow cooker, which is the
   secret for the best ramen you'll ever have:
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkbroth1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkbroth640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pork
    Broth"></a>

  <p>
   That broth paid off.  It's rich and thick and delicious.  So rich, in fact,
   that I diluted it to half-strength.  The 4 quarts of broth that I saved
   will go quite a long way.
  </p>

  <p>
   The other secret ingredient for making ordinary ramen extraordinary is your
   refrigerator's friend, <b>Bok Choy</b>!  I hadn't used Bok Choy much in the
   past, but it's an incredibly tolerant and long-lasting vegetable.  It will
   stay fresh in your refrigerator for far longer than you'd ever expect.
   Just buy a big head for about $1.00/lb and break off what you need.  (Baby
   bok choy is beautiful and cute, but it costs about 5 times as much in my
   local supermarket.  You may be able to buy it cheaper in Asian
   supermarkets, which may have 10 different types of little bok choys,
   sometimes in huge bags.)
  </p><p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/bokchoysliced1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/bokchoysliced640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sliced
     Bok Choy"></a>

  </p><p>
   Long after cabbage and lettuce and other vegetables have wilted or molded
   in your fridge, the Bok Choy will still be good.  Chop it into pieces, and
   boil it in your broth for about 7-10 minutes.  It maintains a very nice
   crisp texture even if you under- or over-cook it, and it absorbs the flavor
   of the broth, making it quite delicious.  3.2 ounces of bok choy cost
   $0.20.
  </p>

  <p>
   After the bok choy cooked, I boiled a packet of cheap ($0.16)
   chili-flavored ramen in the broth for the usual couple minutes.  I then put
   it in a giant bowl (29 fluid ounces!) and, for an extra bit of flavor and
   protein and richness, I cracked a raw egg ($0.08) into it, which cooked in
   the hot liquid.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/ramenwithegg1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/ramenwithegg640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Ramen
    with Egg"></a>

  <p>
   That was unbelievably delicious and rich.  Look at that broth!  That's
   nothing like your usual ramen-seasoning-packet broth, and there was more
   than twice as much of it!  There was even broth left over after re-filling
   my bowl partway.  More than two pounds of hot, delicious ramen soup in my
   belly made me feel a lot warmer.
  </p>

  <p>
   While I ate my ramen, I watched a Simply Ming episode in which chef Ming
   Tsai makes elaborate, super-expensive ramen with a new Japanese Iron Chef.
   They used A-5 grade Kobe beef, smoked maitake mushrooms, dried scallops,
   mussels, and many more super-expensive ingredients.  I'll bet I was every
   bit as satisfied with my delicious bowl of ramen that cost about $0.54.
   (For this price I could only buy about 1.5 grams of A-5 kobe beef.  For
   comparison, a U.S. dollar bill has a mass of about 1 gram.)
  </p>

  <p>
   By the way, I forgot to account for the cost of the spice rub that I put on
   the pork shoulder in <a href="#Day4">day 4</a>, which made the broth so
   delicious, so I'll account for it below.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">Making Spice Rub and Buying Spices</a></h3>
  <p>
   Tiny little jars of commercial spice rub for cooking meat are incredibly
   expensive (maybe $4 for a 1.75-oz jar) and meat takes a <em>lot</em> of
   rub!  I make my own spice rub with some inexpensive ingredients I have in
   my cupboard.  I usually make a fairly large batch and have some left over,
   because it's good to sprinkle on anything from meat to fried or baked
   potatoes to vegetables.  The proportions for my spice rub are somewhat
   like:
  </p>

  <h4>Spice Rub (very) approximate recipe</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>3/4 cup brown sugar
   </li><li>1/4 cup chicken bouillon powder
   </li><li>1 tablespooon garlic powder
   </li><li>1/2 tablespoon cumin
   </li><li>1/2 tablespoon black pepper
   </li><li>Every other spice you like including:
    <ul>
     <li>Cayenne pepper
     </li><li>Paprika
     </li><li>Chili Powder
     </li><li>Onion Powder
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Brown sugar is relatively cheap.  A good rule of thumb is that it's
   $1.00/lb, or about twice as expensive as white sugar.  A cup of brown sugar
   costs $0.50.  I'm going to wildly overestimate the total cost of the big
   batch of rub that I made as $1.50, about half of which went into the broth
   (and I have half left over.)  Since there's enough broth for about 8 huge
   bowls of ramen, I'll call it $0.10 in spices per bowl.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was pork tacos again.  I definitely have overestimated how much the
   pork cost, so I'll revise the above calculations when I'm done.  There's
   still enough for a few more pork tacos.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="BuyingSpices">Buying Spices</a></h4>
  <p>
   <img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/boullion.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Bouillon">
   By the way, a good way to buy spices more inexpensively is to go to what
   Walmart calls the "Hispanic Foods" aisle.  This is especially true for
   bouillon powder.  Walmart sells a giant jug that they call "Knorr Hispanic
   Chicken Granulated Bouillon, 35.3 oz" for $4.98.  This is a fraction of the
   cost of bouillon in the spice aisle.  I use this in a <em>lot</em> of
   recipes, and it lasts me many months.
   <br clear="RIGHT">
  </p>

  <p>
   <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/cumin.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/cumin150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Cumin"></a>
   The "Hispanic Foods" aisle of your grocery store may also contain other
   spices <em>much</em> cheaper.  I usually get cumin, chili powders, and
   other spices in this aisle, usually under the "Órale!" brand.  These
   spices come in bags instead of jars, and cost about 1/3 what they do a
   couple aisles away.
   <br clear="LEFT">
  </p>

  <p>
   Another great place to buy inexpensive spices in bulk is Indian markets.
   These often have bags of spices like cardamom, cumin, coriander, cinnamon,
   mustard seeds, sesame seeds, and a wide variety of chili powders for
   drastically lower prices than you can find them elsewhere.

  <h2><a name="Day7">Day 7 - Colcannon and Pork Pancakes</a></h2>
  <p>
   Breakfast was a bowl of quick oatmeal.  I can count on one hand the number
   of times I've eaten oatmeal in my life, but it was very good (once you
   add brown sugar.)  Total cost:  $0.16.
  </p>

  <p>
   Containers are starting to sprout strange new labels:
  </p>

  <p>
   That gigantic container cost less than a much smaller can of Quaker brand
   oats. ($2.99)
  </p>

  <p>
   For lunch, I had a hot dog on a bun.  Unfortunately, the purchase of these
   hot dogs (Oscar Meyer Classic Bun-Length, my favorite) predated this
   experiment, so they weren't the most cost-effective.  I have newer hot dogs
   that cost 1/3 the price.  A hot dog was $0.32, and a bun was $0.16, for a
   total of $0.48 for a single hot dog.  (I have cheaper hot dogs that I could
   eat on bread for a total $0.15, less than 1/3 the price.)  However, my
   rules for this experiment are that anything I have to throw away, I have to
   charge myself for, so chow down, wide load.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Colcannon">Colcannon</a></h3>
  <p>
   It's sort of funny how upset I get when I see something in an advertisement
   that's much cheaper than I just paid for it.  For example, last week I
   bought 10 pounds of potatoes for $2.99, which I thought was a pretty good
   deal.  But yesterday I saw the same bag at the same store for $0.99!  That
   made me sad.  I started thinking, "well, I could still eat 8.3 pounds of
   potatoes a day at the old price.  Or <em>25 pounds</em> a day at the new
   price."  At this moment, I became enlightened.  If I were ever hungry, I
   could eat a bunch of potatoes.  The only thing I'd have to be wary of is
   spending too much money on stuff like butter, sour cream, or sauce (Mae
   Ploy sweet chili sauce is really good on boiled potatoes!)
  </p>

  <p>
   So how could I make a bunch of ready-to-eat, delicious long-lasting
   potatoes?  The answer came from a recipe I've made for many a St. Patrick's
   Day party: <b>Colcannon.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
   Colcannon is an Irish dish (in Irish Gaelic, <i>cál ceannann</i>, meaning
   "white-headed cabbage",) made with mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage.
   Other variations use kale, leeks, onions, and scallions, in addition to
   possibly ham or bacon.
  </p>

  <p>
   Since a stick of butter costs around $1.00, I decided to try to use the
   cabbage to keep the mashed potatoes moist, and eliminate butter or cream
   entirely.  I boiled/steamed some cabbage with water and salt, and saved the
   cabbage water.  This got added to 3.5 pounds of mashed potatoes.  The
   result was still far too dry, so I added 2 cups of milk (which was probably
   a bit too much.)  This made 4.5 pounds of finished Colcannon, all for the
   price of $1.96!  I'll have this ready to eat with any meal.
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/colcannon768x1024.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/colcannon480x640.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Colcannon"></a><br>
  <i>Colcannon, or, Life Discovered on Jupiter's Moon Europa</i>
  
  <p>
   By the way, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Jumbo-Potato-Santoprene-Handle/dp/B000BUB58A" target="_blank">big
   potato ricer</a> makes making mashed potatoes immensely easier and more
   repeatable.  A potato ricer is basically an extruder press that you put
   boiled potatoes in and <em>squeeeeeeze</em> them through little holes.
   (It's like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GAtKkWOU2s" target="_blank">Fuzzy
   Pumper Barber Shop</a> (which I always wanted as a kid) but instead of
   being for Play-Doh, it's for food!)  No mashing!  You don't even need to
   peel the potatoes!  The potato skins stay in the ricer.  And when you cut
   up the potatoes for boiling, you can cut them into very large, coarse
   pieces.  All of these benefits make mashed potatoes in a ricer much simpler
   than the traditional method.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="PorkPancakes">Pork Pancakes</a></h3>
  <p>
   The original plan was to finish up the pork tacos for dinner, but I
   happened to see an episode of <i>Simply Ming</i> in which chef Ming Tsai's
   dad used a bunch of leftover pork and onions and some simple dough to make
   crispy pancakes!  So that became the new plan.
  </p>

  <p>
   The "hot water dough" was simple enough:
  </p>

  <h4>Hot Water Dough</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>2 cups flour
   </li><li>3/4 cups <em>hot</em> tap water
   </li><li>3/4 teaspoon salt
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Mix the three together, knead them for about 6 minutes, and then let it
   rest, covered, for about an hour.  There's no leavener, so they don't rise,
   so you could probably skip this step if you're in a rush.  The dough cost
   $0.32.
  </p>

  <h4>Pork Pancake Assembly</h4>
  <p>
   Roll the dough out as thin as possible on a well-floured surface, spread a
   thin layer of vegetable oil over the whole surface, and then spread
   leftover cooked pork, cooked onions, and cooked cabbage over the whole
   surface.  Roll tightly like a jelly roll into a long cylinder.  Cut the
   cylinder into about 4-inch (10 cm) lengths, try to twist the ends shut
   (just try) and then twist and squish the cylinders from end to end into a
   thin, flat pancake:

   <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkpancake1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/porkpancake640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pork Pancake"></a>

  </p><p>
   Fry them with a bit of oil in a hot skillet, about 375°F (190°C)
   for about 3 minutes on each side or until crisp and brown.
  </p>

  <p>
   These were quite good!  I'd definitely make them again with leftovers.  The
   breading is very inexpensive ($0.32 for the entire batch) and it stretches
   the remaining pork nicely.  This was the first dinner that I've actually
   felt <em>full</em> after eating (along with 6 oz Colcannon.)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="PorkRevision">Pork Revision</a></h3>
  <p>
   As noted before in the last 3 days, it was difficult to estimate how much
   pork cost per serving until I was done with the pork.  The pork shoulder,
   which cost $6.79, made 28 portions, which is 7 more portions than I
   originally estimated.  Thus, I've revised the last few days' pork prices
   downward to $0.24 per portion, a reduction of $0.04 per portion.  This
   actually means that the last few days were under budget as I'd hoped!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day7Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>The pork shoulder went farther than I thought, so I was able to
    recalculate some earlier days' costs, which puts me back under budget for
    every day!  W00t!
    
   </li><li>I'm starting to think I should keep track of everything in my head as
    its cost per pound.  If something costs much more than about $2.00/lb, it's
    hard to fill up on it.

   </li><li>I need to add an example here of converting per-mass costs into
    per-volume costs (for example, how do you calculate how much a cup of flour
    costs when you bought it by the pound?)  My language <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> helps here, because it knows
    the densities of a lot of common materials, for example:
  <p>
   <code>
    flourcost = 2.50 dollars/(5 lb)<br>
    1 cup flour_scooped flourcost<br>
   </code>
   <code>
    0.15625 dollar (currency)
   </code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Note that Frink knows the average density of flour in many forms,
     including scooped or sifted.  <code>flour_scooped</code> is the density
     of scooped flour.
    </p>

    </li><li>See what Frink knows about different forms of flour by entering <a href="https://futureboy.us/fsp/frink.fsp?fromVal=%3F%3Fflour&amp;toVal=&amp;keep=1#calc" target="_blank"><code>??flour</code></a> in its interactive interface.  (Or just click that link.)

  <h2><a name="Day8">Day 8 - Braunschweiger and Book Recommendations</a></h2>
  <p>
   Today was a simple lunch of a Braunschweiger (liverwurst) sandwich, one of
   my all-time favorites.  The Braunschweiger component of the sandwich cost
   $0.31 out of about $0.42 total, so it's a fairly economical sandwich.  (The
   Braunschweiger I got was $2.50/lb which is fairly good for a meat product.)
   I didn't have any lettuce, so I put on a few cabbage leaves I had left over.
  </p>

  <p>
   I also had some homemade kimchi, a very small amount of potato chips, and
   half of some sort of lovely pear (Bosc, I believe) that was in the fridge
   from before this experiment began (again, if it goes to waste, I have to
   charge myself for it.)  I don't remember how much it cost, but fruit can be
   <em>very</em> expensive and blow my budget easily.  (A single honeycrisp
   apple, for example, can be $1.79!)  I'm going to take the worst-case
   scenario and estimate the whole pear at $1.00, which is the current selling
   price of fancy Asian pears in the advertisements.  This could easily wreck
   my budget, and I may revise the price when I go back to the grocery store.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   (I lived in Germany for 6 months on a youth exchange
   when I was 21, and dinner in all of my families was almost always a cold
   dinner of good, dense German bread along with cold cuts of meat and cheese
   and butter, and something like tomatoes.  The meats were always delicous,
   but Leberwurst was always my favorite (until I got the courage to try the
   steak tartare, which then became my favorite.  Sorry, liverwurst.))
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was the last of the pork pancakes and colcannon, and a bit more
   asparagus.  See <a href="#Day6">day six</a> for the cost breakdown of the
   pork pancakes and colcannon.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day8Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Luckily, the day's meal was quite under my budget, even with the
    expensive pear estimate.  The potential sky-high price of pears stressed me
    out, though.

   </li><li>I have expensive honeycrisp apples in the fridge from before the
    experiment which also gnaws at me.  One of these days, I may have to eat an
    apple and nothing else!  Stupid pre-experiment lavish lifestyle.

   </li><li>Walmart's price for Bosc pears is $1.67/lb, quite a bit cheaper than I
    estimated.  How much did my pear weigh?  6 oz?  The half that I ate would
    be $0.31 then.

   </li><li>Whenever I don't know the price of something, or want to
    comparison-shop, I like to look at <a href="http://delivery.walmart.com/" target="_blank">delivery.walmart.com</a> which allows you to get actual
    current prices (from the luxury of your home,) on almost everything that
    Walmart carries. (You can even have someone put together an order for you
    that you'll pick up or have delivered in some markets.)  Put in a zip code
    for the Denver area (say, 80112) to check prices if they don't have this
    service in your region.  This is very useful for price comparisons!  (Note:
    The site doesn't work for me in Firefox, probably because of my aggressive
    ad-blocking.  All searches just silently return no results.)

   </li><li>I have hard-working friends who like Walmart's service.  They fill
    their cart online, and pick up their order at the store.  I haven't heard
    how well their grocery delivery works, but I know people who could use
    that.  The ability to choose very specific products, quantities, and prices
    from their whole selection is a very nice feature compared to other
    shop-at-home systems which allowed the store's shoppers to easily blow out
    your budget with a poorly-chosen subsititution.

   </li><li>Thinking about lunchmeats, I was wondering what the cheapest would be.
    I haven't eaten bologna for a <em>long</em> time, but that looks pretty
    cheap.  You can get Oscar Meyer brand for $2.00/lb and Bar-S for
    $1.28/lb.  I'll probably stick with Braunschweiger, though.

   </li><li>That pork shoulder lasted 5 days!  Sometimes pork can start tasting or
    smelling "off" to me after 3 days.  I'm very sensitive to that.  I hope
    that cooling it rapidly in the water bath after cooking and before
    refrigerating helped to prevent any spoilage.  It was recooked each time
    it was served, too.  I didn't notice any "off" tastes.

   </li><li>If you're old-school, you might think you have to cook pork to very
    high temperatures to avoid trichinosis.  Trichina is a parasitic roundworm
    that was historically spread through pork.  In 1943, 1 out of 6 people in
    the U.S. were infected with trichina.  However, due to better pork-raising
    practices and screening, it has been virtually eliminated in pork in the
    United States and much of the world.  Jeff Potter notes in his excellent
    O'Reilly book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805888" target="_blank">Cooking for Geeks</a> that "a century ago, ~1.4% of pork
    was infected [with trichina]; in 1996, of 221,123 tested animals in the
    United States, 0 were infected."

   </li><li>Want to know more about pork safety?  Want to try to convince your
    friends that they don't need to overcook their pork?  Here's the USDA's <a href="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/trichinae/docs/fact_sheet.htm" target="_blank">Fact Sheet on Trichina</a>!

   </li><li>I've seen some recipes that tell you to cook pork chops to 180°F
    (82°C)!  Poor, dry, crispy pork chop.

   </li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805888" target="_blank">Cooking for Geeks</a> is really an awesome book.  It
    discusses <em>why</em> you're doing what you're doing when cooking, which
    allows you to generalize your knowledge and predict outcomes.  It also goes
    into a fun variety of interesting techniques including sous vide cooking,
    molecular gastronomy, and much more.  Very highly recommended.  Perhaps my
    favorite cooking book of all time.  It's an <em>O'Reilly</em> book.  For
    cooking!  (For nerds, that's all you have to say.)

   </li><li>I'll write up my kimchi recipe one of these days.

   </li><li>Sorry, no pictures today!

  <h2><a name="Day9">Day 9 - Banana Bread and Urad Dal</a></h2>
  <p>
   Before shoveling lots more snow in the morning, I wanted some quick energy
   so I ate half of a banana ($0.14) and a quick egg sandwich on two pieces of
   dry white toast from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/West-Bend-TEM500W-Muffin-Toaster/dp/B008YNFB3Q/" target="_blank">Breakfast Machine</a>.  Why dry?  Since I noticed the other
   day that buttering bread for grilled cheese sandwiches was rather
   expensive, I decided to save a few cents.  I don't know how Elwood Blues
   eats dry white toast.  Next time I'll butter it.  Sandwich cost was $0.18.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   For lunch, I had the most amazing ramen again, as described on <a href="#Day6">day 6.</a>
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/ramenagain1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/ramenagain640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Best Ramen Again"></a>

  <p>
   Saving the pork broth from <a href="#Day4">day 4</a> keeps paying off.
   Look at that broth!  I used up my bok choy, so the total cost was about
   $0.62.  I was very full and had broth left over afterwards, which went
   to good use again, as you will see below.
  </p>

  <p>
   Also, here's a loaf of my mom's award-winning banana bread, which is the
   best thing ever (and it's a great use for 3 bananas that were getting
   overripe):
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/bananabread1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/bananabread640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Banana Bread"></a>

  <p>
   The whole loaf cost $2.52 to make.  I ate about 1/16 of it, (I could have
   eaten the whole thing,) which cost $0.16. I ate the banana bread without
   butter.  It was very good and moist.  You can see a slice on the
   right-hand-side of the ramen picture above.
  </p>

  <p>
   Many people have suggested dried beans as a cost-effective meal.  I had
   some Urad Dal (a small, white lentil-like bean, also called "matpe bean" in
   English) from an Indian market.
  </p>
  
   <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/uraddalbag1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/uraddalbag640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Bag of
    Urad Dal"></a>

  <p>
   I've never used them before, so these became an experiment.  1 cup of dry
   beans (7.6 oz, cost $0.95) were brought to a boil in the leftover pork
   broth from lunch, reduced to a simmer and covered, and then simmered for
   about 45 minutes until they were soft.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/uraddalcooking1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/uraddalcooking640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Urad Dal cooking"></a>

  <p>
   While they were cooking, they smelled exactly like Campbell's Bean and
   Bacon soup (which is one of my favorites!)  Must have been the pork broth.
   When finished, they were slightly gelatinous and slippery.  They were quite
   delicious and filling.  I ate approximately 1/4 of the final product, for a
   cost of $0.25.
  </p>

  <p>
   I tried adding other spices to the Urad Dal, such as garam masala and tikka
   masala powders, but it really didn't need it.  The pork broth again worked
   its miracle!
  </p>

  <p>
   Since I wasn't too hungry for dinner after the huge bowl of ramen, I also
   had a (relatively expensive) hot dog and some colcannon.  After calculating
   my costs for the day, I was at $1.99, so I decided to have a bonus piece of
   banana bread, this time with butter (the butter cost only $0.03), which
   brought me to $2.12 for the day.  Yum.
  </p>

  <p>
   By the way, so far I haven't tried to eat as close to $2.50 as I can.  I
   haven't needed to, as I haven't been significantly hungry.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="APicturePuzzle">A Picture Puzzle</a></h3>

   color is this dress?"</a> debate, in which some people saw the the dress as
   white and gold, and others saw it as blue and black.  In that spirit,
   here's another picture puzzle, which I took after making the ramen:

  <p>
   What color are the burners?  Do you see them as blue and black (or white and
   gold?)  I tell you that both burners are in fact, <em>both the same

  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day9Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I've wondered about accounting for costs of very small quantities of
    things like salt and baking soda.  Even in inefficient quantities, these
    are usually less than a cent in most recipes.  (1 teaspoon of baking soda
    for banana bread was about 0.6 cents, so I'm not going to worry much about
    these tiny costs from here on out.)

   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  1 teaspoon baking soda: 0.6 cents.

   </li><li>Again, I'm finding that foods that cost less than $2.00/lb are
    efficient for filling you up.  Too much more than this, and you may have
    trouble getting enough at this price level.

   </li><li>Useful link: <a href="http://delivery.walmart.com/" target="_blank">Walmart price search.</a>

   </li><li>I watched Martha Stewart cooking some blueberry crisp and a couple of
    other recipes, and I was able to easily estimate the cost of the dry
    ingredients (not the blueberries) in my head simply using the rules of
    thumb that I've listed here.  I think that's quite useful!

  <h2><a name="Day10">Day 10 - Tuna Casserole</a></h2>
  <p>
   Lunch was 1.5 fried egg sandwiches with mayonnaise.  See the calculations
   below for calculating the cost of mayonnaise (which is sold by volume, but
   I measured it by mass.)  Total cost: $0.38.  My stomach must be shrinking,
   because I was full after 1.5 sandwiches.
  </p>

  <p>
   Since it was a Friday during Lent, a fish dish was in order for dinner.  It
   was time to break out a delicious recipe that's at least 80 years old for
   Tuna Casserole!  I obtained this recipe from my friend Richard who made it
   for a potluck, and everyone loved it.  He generously gave me the old family
   recipe, which noted that his mother made it for his father on their
   honeymoon in 1935, and they ate the whole batch in one sitting!
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/tunacasseroledone1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/tunacasseroledone640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Tuna Casserole"></a>

  <p>
   It's a tuna casserole that's covered with bready pinwheels, and is really
   delicious and filling.  It's quite easy to make, and may last more than one
   sitting if you can restrain yourself.  There is no sacrifice in eating this
   dish; it's a year-round family favorite of more than one family!  (By the
   way, if you do it right, your pinwheels will be prettier and actually look
   like pinwheels.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The most expensive part of the dish is 4 cans of tuna, which I bought for
   $0.79/can, which is a fairly good price.  You don't need whole chunk fancy
   tuna, as you're going to break it up anyway!  I looked at large cans of
   tuna, but they were more expensive per ounce than small cans on sale.  The
   body of the casserole is onions, green bell peppers, and tuna in a flour and
   milk sauce.  (You can call it Béchamel sauce if you're fancy.) The
   rolls are made from Bisquick and milk, with a bit of cheese rolled in.
  </p>

  <p>
   I modified the original recipe in a few ways:  I reduced the amount of
   cheese in the rolls from 8 oz to 3.5 ounces (you can never taste it
   anyway), used one bell pepper instead of 2 (because I only had one) and
   eliminated the jar of pimientos that are usually sprinkled over the top
   (they're pretty, but I could never taste them.)  Also, I had no nutmeg.
  </p>

  <p>
   The whole casserole cost $7.98 to make (great!) so each of the 15
   "pinwheels" marks a serving that cost $0.53 to make.  I ate 3 pinwheels,
   and the last of the asparagus.  Finding inexpensive tuna makes this quite
   an inexpensive recipe (the tuna was $3.16 of the total cost.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Since I'll probably be eating this casserole for another couple of meals,
   I'll post the recipe another day.  <b>Update:</b> The recipe is posted on
   <a href="#TunaCasseroleRecipe">day 11</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   After calculating my costs for the day, I had money left over, so I had
   another slice of banana bread with butter.  Total daily expense:  $2.23.

  <h4>Frink Calculations</h4>
  <p>
   I mentioned before that I've created a calculating tool / programming
   language called <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> which is
   great for helping with physical calculations.  Here's how to calculate the
   cost of mayonnaise (which is labeled by volume) but weighed by my scale.
   To do this, we either have to measure or look up the density of mayonnaise.
   We can easily search for the <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap815e/ap815e.pdf" target="_blank">density of mayonnaise</a> which gives "0.91 g/ml").  Each
   sandwich took a total of 0.75 oz (this is a mass) of mayonnaise:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
     mayocost = 3.48 dollars / (30 floz)<br>
     mayodensity = 0.91 g/ml<br>
     0.75 oz mayocost / mayodensity<br>
   </code>
   <code>
    0.0916 dollar (currency)
   </code>
   </p>

   <p>
    So light mayonnaise on (both sides) of a sandwich costs about $0.09.

  <p>
   Lunch was a Braunschweiger sandwich with kimchi and a few chips.  Total
   lunch cost, $0.66.  Dinner was the tuna casserole from <a href="#Day10">day
    10</a> and some more colcannon.

  <p>
   As promised, here's the recipe for the Tuna Casserole!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="TunaCasseroleRecipe">Tuna Casserole Recipe</a></h3>
  <p>
   This is the original 80-year-old recipe for the tuna casserole.  My
   suggestions follow.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   Chop 1 large onion and 2 green peppers.  Sauté in a melted stick of butter
   until glossy.  Add 1/2 tsp salt, also pepper and nutmeg to taste.  Add 1/2
   cup flour and stir together well.  Slowly, and over medium heat, add and
   stir in enough milk for a thinnish white sauce.  Add 3 or 4 cans of drained
   tuna, stir, put into a 9x13 inch cakepan.  Prepare a biscuit mix using 3
   cups Pioneer or Bisquick mix with one cup of milk.  Roll out into a
   rectangle 3/8 inch thick.  Sprinkle 1/2 lb. shredded cheddar and one large
   jar of chopped pimientos over the biscuit mix.  Roll up and cut into 12
   equal-sized rolls.  Place the rolls on top of the tuna mix.  Bake at
   350°F for 45 minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
   Alan's suggestions:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>I find it better to cook at 350°F for 20 minutes, then lower the
    temperature to 325°F for another 20 minutes.  The rolls get a bit too
    dry otherwise.

   </li><li>After cooking, cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 5-10 minutes
    for the filling to set.  This steams the rolls a bit further.

   </li><li>I found that 15 rolls fit better in a 13x9" pan.

   </li><li>As mentioned in <a href="#Day10">day 10</a>, I reduced the cost a bit by
     using less cheese and no pimientos.
  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="Day11Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Today's total was $2.49, very close to my target.  I didn't realize
    that I was quite this close!
    
   </li><li>I went to King Soopers today to pick up some items like bread and
    butter.  Butter was on sale for $1.99/lb, almost half the price that I've
    been paying, so I got a couple of pounds.  Butter prices are at an
    all-time high.

   </li><li>During WWII when butter was rationed, people would "extend" butter by
    whipping it with either water or another kind of oil, then refrigerating it
    to solidify.  If using water, a bit of emulsifier like soy lecithin would
    help keep it together.  I might experiment with this.  Emulsifiers keep oil
    and water from separating in solutions.

   </li><li>There weren't many other good sales at King Soopers (nor in
    the other grocery store advertisements) this week.  Quite a change from
    last week's many good deals at Albertson's.

   </li><li>As I unpacked all the food, I labeled each item with its prices (and
    per-serving cost when applicable) with a permanent marker.

   </li><li>I also got a few inexpensive experimental items like lard, chicken
    livers, and bologna.  Perhaps I will use them all in the same dish!
  </li></ul>

  <h2><a name="Day12">Day 12 - End of the Tuna Casserole</a></h2>
  <p>
   Today was like some days before -- oatmeal and half a banana for breakfast
   ($0.35), a braunschweiger sandwich and a very small amount of potato chips
   for lunch ($0.42), and the last of the tuna casserole for dinner.  Daily
   total: $2.35.

  <p>
   That tuna casserole is excellent.  I highly recommend it even if you're not
   trying to eat inexpensively.  It's worth every penny.
  </p>

  <p>
   At the end of the day, I had $0.15 left in my budget, so I had a small
   piece of banana bread with butter.  Final total: $2.48.

  <h2><a name="Day13">Day 13 - Cabbage Rolls</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="CabbageRollsRecipe">Cabbage Rolls Recipe</a></h3>
  <p>
   As promised on <a href="#Day2">Day 2</a>, here's the Cabbage Rolls /
   Krautburger recipe!  They're a bun filled with cabbage, onions, and ground beef.
   They're delicious, nutritious, filling, inexpensive, and they freeze and
   microwave incredibly well, so you can make a giant batch and have cheap
   food ready in minutes!
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/krautburgers1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/krautburgers640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"></a>

  <p>
   This recipe is for a <em>single batch</em> but you
   should always plan on making <em>at least</em> a triple batch because they
   freeze extremely well, and it's just as easy to make a large batch.  I made
   a larger-than-quadruple batch.  A single batch will make about 15
   krautburgers.
  </p>

  <h4>Breading</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>1 package active dry yeast
   </li><li>1 cup lukewarm milk (110 to 115 degrees)
   </li><li>2 tablespoons sugar
   </li><li>1 teaspoon salt
   </li><li>3 cups all-purpose flour
   </li><li>3 egg yolks
   </li><li>4 tablespoons butter, softened
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Sprinkle the yeast into 1/2 cup of the milk.  Add the sugar and salt and
   stir until dissolved (actually it will stay clumpy because of the milk.
   Just let it sit for a while and it will unclump.)  Place the mixture in a
   warm draft-free place for 5 to 8 minutes or until the mixture has begun to
   bubble.  (It may take longer than that.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Pour the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center.  Drop in
   the yeast mixture, egg yolks, remaining 1/2 cup of milk, and butter, and
   with a large wooden spoon, gradually stir the flour into the other
   ingredients until a fairly firm dough is formed.  Cover the bowl and let
   rise in a warm place for an hour.  (Over a bowl of warm water is good.)
   Punch down, let rise for another 45 minutes.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
  </p>
  
  <h4>Filling</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>2 finely chopped onions
   </li><li>1/2 head finely chopped cabbage
   </li><li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil
   </li><li>1 pound ground beef, (80% Lean/20% fat preferable)
   </li><li>Garlic or garlic powder to taste
   </li><li>Salt to taste
   </li><li>Pepper to taste
   </li><li>(Optional) Cumin to taste.
   </li><li>(Optional) other spices you like.  Paprika is good!  Taco seasoning
    would be really good too!
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   In a large pot with a lid, heat oil and cook onions with some salt for 5
   minutes.  Add cabbage, some salt and pepper (or bouillon powder for even
   more flavor,) and about 1/2" of water, cover pot and steam until cabbage is
   tender, stirring occasionally.  Add small amounts of water if necessary
   while cooking.  A little bit of onion and cabbage juice left in is good!
  </p>

  <p>
   <em>Lightly</em> brown ground beef with garlic and <em>do not drain.</em>
   Mix beef with cooked cabbage and onions and season to taste.  The filling
   will be easier to work with and less wet if cooled somewhat before using.
  </p><h4>Assembly</h4>
  <p>
   Cut dough into manageable sections and roll out on lightly floured surface
   (or unfloured on a dough sheet.)  Roll thin using rolling pin.  Cut dough
   into pieces (whatever size you like, about 4" square is good).  Roll out
   again with a rolling pin for efficient use of your dough!  Fill with a
   couple spoonfuls of filling.  Fold corners of dough together, pinch closed,
   and turn over with seam down on cookie sheet.  Bake in oven for 10-12
   minutes or until golden.  Cool on rack.  Can freeze after cooled.  These
   reheat very nicely in the microwave.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Update:</i>  I broke down the <a href="#CabbageRollCost">cabbage roll
    costs</a> in day 16.  Note that the final cost was about $0.47, an
   increase of $0.06 over my estimate.  In another year, when ground beef was
   on sale, I made them for about $0.37 apiece with lots of filling left over!
  </p>

  <p>
   Breakfast was a bowl of oats ($0.18).  I've already eaten more oats in the
   last week than I have during the rest of my life combined (and I've only
   eaten about 3 bowls.)  Lunch was a delicious egg salad sandwich (with the
   last egg that cost $0.08 and two new new super-cheap eggs that cost $0.04
   each) and 1/4 cup of the Urad Dal from <a href="#Day9">day 9</a>.  The Urad
   Dal was absolutely <em>delicious</em>.  (Have I mentioned that you should
   <em>save your pork broth?</em>)  Dinner was 2 cabbage rolls, the last of
   the colcannon, and, since I was well under budget, another 1/4 cup of Urad
   Dal.
  </p>

  <p>
   After dinner, I had still only spent $1.55 for the day.  As an evening
   snack, I had banana bread and tapioca pudding.  Daily total:  $1.96.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day13Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>If you don't roll the dough quite thin, you will run out of dough
    before you run out of filling.  That's fine!  The filling is delicious by
    itself, or can be packed into a freezable pan to make a delicious
    meatloaf, or, covered with mashed potatoes, a cottage pie!
    
   </li><li>The first few times I made krautburgers, I didn't have a good breading
    recipe, so I used Pillsbury Grands! biscuits and rolled them out flat.
    These were good (especially the buttery ones,) but rather expensive and
    not as good and elastic as this outstanding breading recipe (thanks to
    Jenny's mom for the recipe.)
    
   </li><li>When tripling or quadrupling the breading, I was lazy and dumb and
    quadrupled the amount of yeast that I used.  This is silly because yeast is
    a magical little animal that will multiply <em>itself</em> if you feed it
    and give it a bit of time!

   </li><li>What I should have done is to start a package of yeast in some warm
    water or milk with sugar and flour, and let it stand for several hours to
    a day in a warm place.  One packet of yeast would multiply enough to supply
    the whole recipe.

   </li><li>If you keep yeast cultured and fed, it can last indefinitely, and
    you'll always have yeast available.

   </li><li>It's hard to make bread cheaply if a single packet of yeast costs
    <em>at least</em> $0.50, half the cost of a loaf of store-brand bread!

   </li><li>The best way to provide "free" live yeast culture is to culture your
    own sourdough.  A sourdough starter is very rich in yeast, and makes
    gorgeous dough.

   </li><li>I may start another sourdough culture to see if I can
    make bread inexpensively.  I started sourdough last summer, but didn't
    bake often enough to make it useful.  You need to bake every couple of
    days (to a week if you keep it refrigerated) and constantly feed and use
    it.

   </li><li>Oh, geez.  I just convinced myself.  I just got up and made a sourdough
    starter.  I'll talk about that another day.

  <h2><a name="Day14">Day 14 - Potato Pea Soup and Fried Chicken</a></h2>
  <p>
   I had 3 items which were on sale—milk, butter, and potatoes.  Add
   peas and it becomes one of my favorite dishes—potato pea soup!  I
   decided to make a big batch.  It ended up being about 1.4 gallons (5.4
   liters).  That's a big pot!  It took 5.23 pounds of potatoes, 2.2 lb of
   frozen green peas, 110 fl.oz. of milk, and 1/2 lb butter (I usually use
   even more butter than this!)
  </p>

  <p>
   The whole batch cost $7.82, or about $0.35 cents per cup.  I had 3 cups for
   $1.05.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/chickennsoup1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/chickennsoup640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Potato Pea Soup and Fried Chicken"></a>

  <p>
   Since I also wanted some protein, I made some fried chicken!  I can count
   on about 2 fingers the times I've made actual fried chicken in my whole
   life, so I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I had some big, beautiful
   chicken thighs (the best part of the bird) for the great price of $0.88/lb,
   which is about as low of a price as you can get for meat.  (Even cheap
   bologna on sale costs more.)  I basically used <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/fried-chicken-recipe.html" target="_blank">Alton Brown's recipe</a>, except I didn't soak the chicken
   in buttermilk.  Since I didn't plan ahead and the chicken was frozen solid,
   I brined/thawed it in water with salt and a bit of sugar.
  </p>

  <p>
   I've pan-fried fried chicken before, but it's hard to get right.  Instead,
   I used my ever-ready deep fryer, which already had oil in it from many
   dinners in the past.  After 20 minutes at 325°F (160 °C), this is
   what it looks like:
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/friedchicken1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/friedchicken640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Fried
    Chicken"></a>

  <p>
   Conclusion: a deep-fryer is <em>much</em> more foolproof than cooking fried
   chicken in a skillet with a smaller amount of oil.  It was cooked through
   and cooked evenly.  It was <em>much</em> easier than the fried chicken I've
   made before.  Will do again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Each thigh was very large and averaged about 8 ounces, and with the flour
   and spices, cost $0.46.  I would have gladly eaten several of them, but I
   ate one and I'm saving one for tomorrow.  Or later tonight.
  </p>

  <p>
   Lunch was an egg salad sandwich and the last of the Urad Dal.  Since I had
   $0.45 left over, I had a late-night snack of a $0.25 frozen burrito.  Daily
   total: $2.30.
  </p>
   
  <h3><a name="Day14Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I woke up <em>very</em> hungry and a bit weak.  I had about $0.54 left
    over yesterday, so I should have eaten more.  I ate a late-night burrito
    today to fill out my total.

   </li><li>I'm not quite sure how to account for the oil, but it has already
    cooked many meals and I plan on re-using it for as long as it stays good.

   </li><li>I even counted a couple of bad potatoes that I had to throw out into my
    costs.

  <h2><a name="Day15">Day 15 - An Emulsifier Experiment</a></h2>
  <p>
   For lunch, I had a couple of extremely cheap hot dogs (Bar S Classic Bun
   Length Franks, $0.75 for 8) that I had bought on sale 2 weeks ago.  Each
   hot dog was only $0.09, and I ate them on ordinary white bread instead of a
   bun, which made them quite cheap: only $0.15 apiece.  Compare this to $0.48
   for my previous hot dog plus bun!  I could have 3 hot dogs for the price of
   1, but only ate 2.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was more potato pea soup (3 bowls) and another piece of delicious
   fried chicken from yesterday.
  </p>

  <p>
   When serving the potato pea soup from the refrigerator, there was a huge
   crust of butter that had solidified on top of the soup which had to be
   broken apart and carefully portioned into the soup.  I got to thinking
   about ways to improve this, and decided I would do a little experiment with
   an emulsifier.
  </p>

  <p>
   Emulsifiers help to prevent oil and water from separating.  Look how the
   droplets of butter separate into large droplets in ordinary soup, within
   seconds of stirring:
  </p>

  <p>
   My mom and I made molecular gastronomy kits for several friends and family
   this Christmas, and I had an emulsifier, soy lecithin, in my kit.  I added
   1.2 g of soy lecithin to a bowl of soup (this is a concentration of 0.5% by
   mass, cost $0.05) and stirred it vigorously and heated it in the microwave.
   After re-stirring, this is what the soup looked like:
  </p>

    Pea soup with emulsifier"></a>

  <p>
   Note that the butter no longer separates into large droplets.  The
   emulsifier helps disperse the butter more evenly into the soup.  Would this
   make my soup easier to serve and more uniform?  Since butter is less dense
   than milk, it will still try to float to the surface of the liquid, so it
   probably won't solve my refrigerator storage problem.  But it's an
   interesting experiment nevertheless!  I'll have to try adding some
   emulsifier to a batch of soup that I store in the fridge and see how well
   it prevents separation.  A big problem is that mixing it vigorously (like
   with a stick blender) would also break up the potatoes and peas.  If I'm
   going to add emulsifier, I'll have to add it to the hot milk and butter
   before adding the potatoes.
  </p>

  <p>
   This was a very quick-and-dirty experiment, but it demonstrated that a
   little bit of soy lecithin will help keep fats from separating in soup.  No
   difference in taste was detected.  I tasted a small amount of the soy
   lecithin powder, and it didn't have a strong taste.
  </p>

  <p>
   For a late-night snack, I also had some tapioca pudding and banana bread.
   Some of the banana bread had to be frozen because it's not getting eaten
   fast enough.  Daily total: $2.27.

   <li>The sourdough starter is going well.  It smells like sourdough.  I'll
    need to feed it with flour (and a bit of sugar) about 12 hours before
    making some bread.

   </li><li>You'll very often see soy lecithin in the ingredients list of anything
    that contains fat and liquid, such as salad dressings, soups, broths,
    etc.  It may also appear in things like macaroni and cheese to keep the
    cheese fats from separating from the liquids.  Look for it!

   </li><li>I have a recipe for incredibly creamy macaroni and cheese that can be
    made with any kind of cheese.  Often, melting cheese can make it lumpy and
    oily, but a little bit of emulsifier like soy lecithin or calcium citrate
    will keep it smooth and creamy.  Due to the cost of fancy cheese, I may
    not be able to make it during this experiment, though.

   </li><li>I added in the soy lecithin cost ($0.05) even though it was a Christmas
    present.  At my cost, it would cost $1.02 to add enough emulsifier for the
    entire 1.4 gallon batch.

  <h2><a name="Day16">Day 16 - Potato Pea Soup and Cabbage Roll Cost</a></h2>
  <p>
   Lunch was, again, 2 cheap hot dogs on bread.  Total cost:  $0.30.  Dinner
   was 2 bowls of potato pea soup (which is disappearing very rapidly!) for
   $0.70 and 2 cabbage rolls for $0.94.  I was hungry, so for a late-night
   snack I had a bowl of rather ordinary ramen ($0.17) with some bok choy
   $(0.27) and an egg ($0.04).

   Since I had been working on the estimate that each krautburger cost
   $0.41, this increases my costs somewhat on a few days!  Luckily, I just
   went back and revised the totals for the 2 other days (day 2 and day 13)
   on which I had krautburgers, and was still well under the total on those
   days!  Whew!  I just stressed myself out there for a minute.

   <li>The cabbage roll supply is holding up very well.  Making a gigantic
    batch of them was a very good choice.

   </li><li>Obviously, the largest part of the cost of the cabbage burgers is
    ground beef.  If you can find it on sale, it's an even better deal.  You
    can also use more cabbage and less beef (by weight, beef costs 5 times
    as much as cabbage.)

   </li><li>Making a sourdough starter or feeding the yeast and giving it time to

  <h2><a name="Day17">Day 17 - A Sourdough Experiment Gone Awry</a></h2>
  <p>
   For lunch, I had 1.5 fried egg sandwiches and 1/2 of a lovely grapefruit
   that were on sale for $0.25.  
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was another piece of the salmon that I bought on <a href="#Day3">day
    3</a>, prepared about the same way, along with a bowl of potato pea soup.
   I slightly overcooked the salmon in an attempt to get the skin crispy (and
   splashed hot oil on my hand in the process.)
  </p>

  <h3>Sourdough Experiment</h3>
  <p>
   I mentioned before that creating your own sourdough starter was a way to
   have an active culture of yeast available to make bread more inexpensively.
   I looked at a few sourdough recipes, and decided to try and adapt a
   non-sourdough recipe for <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/cast-iron-pull-apart-pepperoni-garlic-knots.html" target="_blank">Garlic Knots</a> that I had seen.  Take a look at the
   pictures in that recipe.  It looks good.
  </p>

  <p>
   I had recently created a sourdough starter, which I fed with a cup of flour
   and a cup of water about 12 hours in advance so it would be nice and
   active.  The sourdough starter had some gentle bubbles in it, so I made a
   very simple pizza dough recipe, adapting the <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/07/basic-new-york-style-pizza-dough.html" target="_blank">recipe from the garlic knots site.</a> It was approximately
   1 cup sourdough starter, 2.5 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons
   salt, 1 fl.oz. olive oil, and water.  Since I made the dough the night
   before, I followed the usual pizza dough advice and put it into the
   refrigerator overnight, and then warmed it the next day and tried to let it
   rise for about 5 hours.
  </p>

  <p>
   In order to try and make it cheaper, and because I didn't have the
   ingredients on hand, I eliminated the pepperoni, cheese, even the onions.
   I used garlic powder, onion powder, and a few other spices like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za_KilRD-do" target="_blank">oregano</a>. 
   I also used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  Again, since I was using a
   sourdough starter, I didn't add any yeast.
  </p>

  <p>
   Unfortunately, when I was ready to eat, the dough still hadn't risen
   appreciably.  It had risen a little bit, but I was too impatient to wait
   another 5 hours or whatever, so I cooked it anyway.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/garlicknots1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/garlicknots640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sad
    Garlic Knots"></a>

  <p>
   So...yeah.  To make a long story short, the garlic knots didn't really
   rise, and were very dense.  The taste was good, and they smelled
   <em>amazing</em>, but they were doughy inside and very solid outside.  I
   made the mistake of putting them back into the oven to try and remove some
   of the doughiness inside, but it just made them harder.
  </p>

  <p>
   What I learned was that I needed a more active sourdough starter, or a
   higher proportion of it.  Putting the dough in the refrigerator overnight
   was probably a mistake too.  Ah, well, it was a half-assed experiment.
   I'll try to do better next time.
  </p>

  <p>
   I know that sourdough <em>can</em> make a gorgeous pizza dough; I made a
   batch about a year ago that was the most beautiful, perfect dough you've
   ever seen.  I don't recall if I added additional yeast, though.  I may have.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day17Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I'm really dubious of the "425°F for 25 to 30 minutes" idea from
    the original recipe.  Even smeared with olive oil, those things were
    sizzling within minutes, and I'd think they would be burnt black and hard
    as a rock in that amount of time.  I had to reduce the temperature to keep
    them from deep-frying and to keep the oil from smoking in the pan.

   </li><li>You could probably make these with Rhodes frozen rolls, sort of the way
    you make monkey bread.  Still, you'd have to <em>drastically</em> reduce
    the time and temperature.

  <h2><a name="Day19">Day 19 - Hot Chicken.  HOT CHICKEN!</a></h2>
  <p>
   Since I had more beautiful, large, inexpensive chicken thighs ($0.88/lb) in
   the freezer, I decided to try my luck again with fried chicken.
  </p>

  <p>
   I have always been afraid of making fried chicken.  It's hard to cook it
   evenly.  It's hard to make sure it's cooked through.  It's hard not to burn
   it.  It's hard not to spatter yourself with oil.  It's hard to keep the
   crust on the chicken.  However, I'm getting drastically more confident with
   cooking it now that I know how easy it is in a deep fryer instead of a
   skillet.  It's also <em>much</em> easier to use just one very tolerant part
   of the chicken (thighs) so everything cooks evenly and at the same time.
   I passed the first chicken test on <a href="#Day14">day 14</a>, so it was
   time to take it a step further.  To <b>HOT CHICKEN!</b>
  </p>

  <p>
   Over the last year, I've seen more and more "hot chicken" on cooking shows.
   I've seen chefs who have had their lives changed by trying hot chicken.
   It's especially popular in Nashville, which even has a <a href="http://hot-chicken.com/" target="_blank">Hot Chicken Festival and Hot
   Chicken Coalition.</a> I've never even <em>tried</em> hot chicken, and I'm
   not planning on going to Nashville any time soon, so I better try making my
   own.
  </p>

  <p>
   What makes hot chicken hot?  Well, according to most recipes, the chicken
   is seasoned and fried in more or less the usual manner, but after it's
   fried, it's always basted with a hot oil and spice mixture which contains
   unbelieveable amounts of cayenne pepper, along with other spices like
   garlic powder, chili powder, and usually a fair amount of brown sugar to
   make a glaze and temper the heat.
  </p>

  <p>
   Many recipes insist that the hot oil actually has to be lard.  I bought
   lard on <a href="#Day11">day 11</a>, so I was ready to go!
  </p>

  <p>
   Most recipes also dredge the chicken in flour <em>twice</em> to get a
   thicker, crispier crust, dipping it in an egg-and-milk wash in between.
   This is the first time I've done a double-dredge.  Here's the process for
   hot chicken!
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Brine chicken (I just used salt and cold water for about 2 hours as the
    thighs were frozen solid.)
   </li><li>Dry chicken.
   </li><li>Season chicken (I used the barbecue rub I made on <a href="#Day6">day
     6</a>).
   </li><li>Dredge chicken in flour and a bit of salt.  Shake off excess.
   </li><li>Let chicken stand for 5 minutes or more to make a sticky, gummy
    coating that won't break off in the hot oil.
   </li><li>Dip chicken in a wash of approximately equal parts egg and milk.  (Some
    recipes add hot sauce to the mix.)
   </li><li>Dredge chicken again in the flour mixture.  Shake off excess.
   </li><li>Let chicken stand for 5 minutes or more.
   </li><li>Deep fry at 325°F (160 °C) for about 18 minutes (or less.
    Don't burn it!)
   </li><li>Brush or dip chicken in spicy coating mixture (see below.)
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   For the spicy coating, I slowly heated 3.5 oz of lard with a frightening
   amount of spices.  I used <em>2 tablespoons</em> of cayenne pepper which is
   very intimidating to see being measured out.  I also added about 2
   teaspoons of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, some salt, and
   about 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I let this warm slowly and for a long
   time so that the spices could bloom in the oil and impart their flavors to
   it.  I believe that this tempered the heat of the cayenne pepper
   significantly.  If I would have eaten that much raw cayenne pepper, it
   would have blown my head off.  Instead, it developed a rich, smoky, complex
   flavor that was absolutely delicious.  I think that the lard may have
   helped to add rich, meaty flavors here.
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/hotchicken1024x668.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/hotchicken640x417.jpg" width="640" height="417" alt="Hot
    Chicken!"></a>

  <p>
   Look at that delicious crust.  I brushed the first piece lightly with the
   hot oil, because I was afraid how hot it would be.  It turned out that it
   was pleasantly hot, and the brown sugar in the glaze made it absolutely
   delicious.  The second piece I brushed quite generously.  Yum.
  </p>

  <p>
   I simply can't overstate how good this was.  I've made some very good
   chicken wings in my life.  People have told me they were the best wings
   they've ever had.  They've told me that they were the best <em>chicken</em>
   they've ever had.  I've even had people tell me it was the best thing
   they've ever eaten.  Once I literally had so many people rave about my
   wings that I had a vegetarian decide at that moment to go back to eating
   meat, and she did.  This chicken is as good as any I've ever made, if not
   even better.  It's already one of my favorite foods I've ever eaten.  It is
   one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I literally couldn't stop talking
   about it.  The flavor was balanced and rich, spicy and sweet, the crust was
   crisp and the chicken was moist.  And it was amazingly inexpensive and
   filling (the thighs averaged about 8 oz. before cooking.)  Eating two
   pieces of chicken, I'd never guess for a second that I was trying to eat
   inexpensively.  Wow.  What a meal.
  </p>

  <p>
   Not bad at all for a day I only spent $2.00 on food!  Easily, a
   life-changing meal.  I can see how professional chefs become obsessed with
   hot chicken and need to make it in their own restaurants!
  </p>

  <p>
   (You may have noticed some other deep-fried treats in the background of
   that picture.  Those are corn and potato fritters, which are also
   delicious.  I'll write about them tomorrow, as I have <em>more hot chicken
   to eat tomorrow!</em>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Breakfast was a big bowl of minute oatmeal ($0.22).
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day19Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>The biggest mistake that I made was setting the chicken in the basket
    of the deep fryer, waiting a minute or two, and then lowering the basket
    into the fryer.  The crust in the first batch stuck very badly to the
    basket, and I broke much of the crust off while trying to free it.

   </li><li>Always lower the chicken slowly directly into the oil (you can put the
    basket underneath, but let it cook for at least 20 seconds before it hits
    the basket.)

   </li><li>Some recipes for hot chicken use 6 tablespoons or more of cayenne
    pepper for a similar recipe size!  I found that this would have been
    somewhat pointless; the oil was already saturated with a solid layer of
    spices on the bottom that had to be stirred up.  You could adjust the
    amount of cayenne that got onto the chicken by how you scooped up the oil.
    The oil on the top had less cayenne.  The oil that was dug from the bottom
    of the pan was solid with cayenne.  You can estimate how hot it's going to
    be from the redness of the chicken.

   </li><li>I'm not sure how to keep the spices suspended in the oil better.

   </li><li>Don't burn the spices!  Very long, low, slow heat works best.

   </li><li><b>Update:</b> Don't crystallize the brown sugar!  I made spicy chicken
    livers using approximately the same recipe, and the brown sugar cooked
    into a hard candy lump of inedibility, and I had to filter it out.  Maybe
    just add the brown sugar close to the end of cooking the sauce?

   </li><li>Since the chicken is mostly spiced <em>after</em> frying, you can
    adjust the level of spice in each portion to everyone's liking.

   </li><li>Don't forget the brown sugar and salt!  The balance of the hot and
    sweet was what made this so amazing.

   </li><li>Put a little bowl of the spiced oil on the side of the plate for
    dipping.  You will find yourself dipping.

   </li><li>Hot chicken is usually served on top of a piece or two of soft,
    store-bought white bread.  And with dill pickle slices.  I didn't do this.
    I will tomorrow. 

   </li><li>Again, chicken thighs are about the most inexpensive meat you can buy.
    At $0.88/lb, this was an incredible deal!  I can't wait until I eat it
    again.  Oh, yeah, that's <em>tomorrow</em> because I have more that I
    saved!

  <h2><a name="Day20">Day 20 - More Hot Chicken!</a></h2>
  <p>
   Breakfast/lunch was another big bowl of minute oatmeal ($0.22).
  </p>

  <p>
   For dinner, I had <b>more hot chicken!</b>  I saved one piece for today and
   slathered it heartily with the hot cayenne sauce.  I did it right this time
   and served it on a piece of soft, store-bought white bread, and served it
   with some dill pickle.  (My aunt's homemade dill pickles!)
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/hotchickenright1024x831.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/hotchickenright640x520.jpg" width="640" height="520" alt="Hot Chicken Done Right!"></a>

  <p>
   Look at that splattery, messy mess of good food!  D for plating, A+
   for flavor!
  </p>

  <p>
   It was unbelievably good and the crust was still crisp, as I wrapped the
   chicken in paper towels to absorb moisture before refrigerating it, and
   reheated it long and slow in an oven at 225°F, increasing to 250°F
   because I didn't want to wait any longer.
  </p>

  <p>
   I also had another grapefruit, the last of the potato pea soup, and a
   couple more corn and potato fritters!  I promised to describe the
   potato-corn fritters yesterday.  (You can see them at the top of the
   plate.)  They're very simple.  The recipe comes from the side of a box of
   Hungry Jack Potato Pancake mix:
  </p>

  <img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/potatopancakemix.jpg" width="450" height="450">

  <p>
   It's basically one pouch of potato pancake mix (there are 2 pouches per
   box) to which you add a can of corn (which I bought earlier for $0.25/can!) 
   some flour, milk, and an egg.  The potato pancake powder has baking soda
   for a leavener, so these make a very light airy batter that you then
   deep-fry for a few minutes.  They're delicious and light but quite filling.
   The recipe is on the side of the box.  Dip them in the spicy oil for the
   chicken (as seen at the bottom of the picture) and they're even better.
  </p>

  <p>
   I have to repeat everything I said yesterday about how good the Hot Chicken
   was.  It's absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to have it again.  You'll
   note in the picture that it's even redder today, as I brushed it heavily
   with the spicy coating.  The bread absorbed some of the drippings and had a
   delicious flavor.
  </p>

  <p>
   Since I was at only $1.70 for the day, I had a late-night snack of a peanut
   butter sandwich ($0.29).  The thing that surprises and saddens me about
   that is that I could have had an egg salad sandwich or a fried egg sandwich
   even cheaper!  Daily total: $1.99.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day20Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I went to Albertson's and Dollar Tree today.  Surprisingly, Albertson's
    had almost no interesting discounts today (other than still having whole
    salmon for $1.99/lb.  I didn't get any.)

   </li><li>Dollar Tree didn't have any deals on any food I was interested in.
    It's generally a poor idea to go to a dollar store for anything that ever
    dips under a dollar; they round everything <em>up</em> to a dollar.
    Almost all the items I saw were cheaper at a grocery store.  Except
    spices.  Dollar Tree can be good for spices.  It's where I got the big can
    of cayenne pepper that made the hot chicken hot, and I thought would last
    forever.

   </li><li>I had an Albertson's coupon for eggs for $0.99/dozen, which I forgot to
    use.  I remembered before I left the store, and wasn't sure if I'd go
    through the hassle of getting them reduced.  (They were marked as
    $1.49/dozen in the store.)  It turns out that they had actually charged me
    $2.19/dozen, though, so I'm glad I went back and got the refund!  They gave
    me back $2.40, which is a whole day's food in this experiment!

   </li><li>When I got home, I found they had charged me $2.29 for a <em>half</em>
    gallon of milk (which was marked as $1.79 in the store!)  That made me
    mad.  I got a whole gallon at King Soopers last week for $1.99!

   </li><li>It's amazing how stressful it can be to find out you were charged more
    than you should have been, or more than you expected, due to bad labeling
    or your own error.

   </li><li>As expected, the weekly ads have green cabbage and corned beef on
    sale for St. Patrick's Day week.

   </li><li>A couple friends of mine have said that their mothers or grandmothers
    would make them a lard sandwich for a snack after school.  I saved a bit
    of the spicy lard.  I may have to try spreading a bit of it on bread
    soon.  I IS A GOURMET.

  <h2><a name="Day21">Day 21 - Fresh Potato Chips and Spaghetti</a></h2>
  <p>
   I've been missing potato chips, but if there's one thing I have a lot of,
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXLqsDrynpc">it's potatoes.</a>  
   And I have a deep fryer that has oil.  I have some old potatoes that were
   sprouting, but those are great for chips, because they're already drying
   out and fry quickly.  I didn't even bother peeling them.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/chipslicer1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/chipslicer640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Slicing
    potato chips"></a>

  <p>
   After a quick pass through the mandeline, the potatoes were ready for
   frying.  Egg salad sandwich and fresh chips!
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/eggsaladandchips1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/eggsaladandchips640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Egg
    salad and chips"></a>

  <p>
   They were so good that I made some more.  What made the chips even better
   was slicing them thicker and then sprinkling them with the barbecue rub I
   made on <a href="#Day6">day 6</a>.  That was amazing!
  </p>

  <p>
   Those two platefuls (about 8 oz of potatoes before cooking) cost about
   $0.16 total.  Yes!  I think the only thing that prevents people from eating
   french fries or chips with every meal is that they don't "keep" well.
   They're terrible cold and they don't reheat right in an oven or microwave.

    with BBQ Rub"></a>

  <p>
   For dinner, I made a big pot of spaghetti.  Well, rigatoni noodles,
   actually.  I use the very simple recipe that I grew up with—just
   tomato sauce, tomato paste, and ground beef.  (Along with garlic powder,
   salt, and black pepper.)  It only takes about 30 minutes to make, will feed
   you for several days, and reheats in minutes.  You can even use the sauce
   to make pizza.  A big plate of pasta + sauce was $1.37.  Daily total: $2.21.

  <h3><a name="Day21Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I forgot to weigh my portion of spaghetti, so I had to wait until the
    next day to calculate my costs.
    
   </li><li>Rule of thumb: my spaghetti sauce costs $0.10/oz.  I've been eating
    about 12 oz per serving.

   </li><li>I looked up pre-made spaghetti sauces on <a href="http://delivery.walmart.com/" target="_blank">delivery.walmart.com</a> and found that some pre-made
    sauces are only about $0.04/oz, even meat sauces. (Update: these are only
    "meat-flavored" sauces.)  I won't be switching my
    favorite recipe for these, but I wonder how they make them so cheaply.
    (For one, the "meat" sauce has less than 2% of beef.)  My sauce is thick
    and rich because of lots of tomato paste and nice fatty ground beef.
    None of the fillers like high fructose corn syrup, soybean oil, and
    carrots.

   </li><li>I could have cut the cost of the spaghetti sauce by 43% by eliminating
    the meat.  I need the protein, though, and the calories I get from using
    relatively fatty ground beef (I like 80% lean and 20% fat ground beef, and
    I don't drain off the fat!  The fat makes the sauce richer and delicious.
    This time, though, I used 85/15 because it was what was on sale.)

   </li><li>You like what you grew up with.  Every spaghetti sauce recipe except
    this one seems to have weird tastes to me and isn't as good.  Mine's all
    about bright, rich tomato flavor, like the simple sauce that my mom used
    to make.  It was all tomato sauce, tomato paste, ground beef, and garlic
    powder.  Not much else.  If you grew up with something else, you probably
    liked that better.

   </li><li>I could have gotten tomato sauce a bit cheaper at Walmart.

   </li><li>For some stupid reason, Albertson's charged significantly more for one
    large 29 oz can of tomato sauce ($1.79) than they did for two small 15 oz
    cans (which contain 30 ounces total, $0.79/can, $1.58 for both.)  I hate
    that but I'm glad I noticed.  Same brand.

   </li><li>I noticed that this tomato sauce and tomato paste had a bit of citric
    acid in them.  That's what makes lemons taste like lemons.  I always liked
    a bit of acidic brightness in my tomato sauce, and tried different ways of
    getting it, including vinegar, which didn't help.  I'll have to try some
    tomato sauce with a little bit of citric acid powder and see how it
    tastes.

   </li><li>I make a "parsley sauce" which is made with parsley, mayonnaise, olive
    oil, and lemon juice.  It's <em>amazingly</em> good on spaghetti.  I
    didn't make it this time, as it's a bit of a luxury.  Maybe citric acid
    would give some of the same tang that I like?

   </li><li>Blue cheese dressing is delicious but quite expensive ($0.22 a portion,
    and I didn't even use as much as I normally do.)  Salad is just a carrier
    for dressing, though, so I shan't reduce any further.

   </li><li>The rigatoni weighed 2.5 times as much when cooked (having absorbed
    water) as it did when dry.  No deep thoughts there, but it's interesting
    to know that as a possible rule of thumb.

  <h2><a name="Day23">Day 23 - Spicy Bread and Counting Calories</a></h2>
  <p>
   Today's lunch was similar to previous lunches—a braunschweiger
   sandwich.  Dinner was, once again, a big plate of spaghetti, a salad, and a
   piece of spicy bread.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   What's spicy bread?  I'm glad you asked.  I just invented it.  Instead of
   making garlic bread, I had saved a bit of the lard-and-cayenne-pepper
   coating from the Hot Chicken I had made on <a href="#Day19">day 19</a>.
   Instead of buttering my bread, I just warmed a bit of the hot coating and
   brushed it on the bread, and put it under the broiler for a couple of
   minutes.  Wow, was that delicious!  It's definitely spicy, but it goes
   great with spaghetti.  It would also go well with cheeses.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/spicybread1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/spicybread640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Spicy Bread"></a>

  <p>
   Later that evening, I had a hard-boiled egg ($0.04) and a piece of bread
   ($0.04).  Daily total:  $2.24.

  </p><h3><a name="CountingCalories">Counting Calories</a></h3>
  <p>
   I haven't really been tracking the amount of energy in the food I've been
   eating.  I should try harder.  How is that energy measured?  Well, in the
   U.S., it's usually measured in Calories, and in most of the rest of the
   world, it's measured in kilojoules.  A food Calorie is equal to exactly
   4.1868 kilojoules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b> There are two different units of measure that basically
   have the name "calories!"  When you're talking about food, the word
   "Calorie" should be capitalized.  This is because there happen to be two
   different calories: one as used by physicists, (and spelled with a small
   "c") and the one used in food packaging, which a physicist would call a
   "kilocalorie," and is spelled with a capital C.  A food Calorie is 1000 of
   a physicist's "calories".  Ugh.  Don't get them confused in calculations.
  </p>

  <p>
   How is the amount of energy in a certain piece of food calculated?  That
   has to be pretty difficult.  
  </p>

  <p>
   In the U.S., the "Nutrition Labeling and Education Act" of 1990 requires
   that the energy Calories of packaged food is calculated primarily from the
   energy-containing components of the food:  protein, carbohydrate, fat and
   alcohol.
  </p>

  <p>
   These labels use the Atwater system, which establishes the following
   energy densities, in Calories/gram, of those four ingredients:
  </p>

  <table summary="Atwater System">
    <tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Calories/gram
    </th></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>4
    </td></tr><tr><td>Carbohydrate</td><td>4
    </td></tr><tr><td>Alcohol</td><td>7
    </td></tr><tr><td>Fat</td><td>9
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   This allows simple calculation/estimation of the energy content of food
   without complicated experiments (like burning the food in a bomb
   calorimeter.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The trouble is determining what percentage of what is in any given
   food, of course.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata" target="_blank">Nutrient Data
   Laboratory Web site</a> provides the "USDA National Nutrient Database for
   Standard Reference" which contains detailed nutritional information on over
   8,600 foods.  You can even <a href="http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search" target="_blank">search the National Nutrient Database</a> online, or

    You can use my calculating tool and programming language <a href="https://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> to calculate the energy
    content in food.  You first define the energy content:
    
   </p><p>
    <code>
     protein = 4 Calories/gram<br>
     carbohydrate = 4 Calories/gram<br>
     fat = 9 Calories/gram<br>
    </code>
   </p>

   <p>
    Then, to find how much energy a pound of these contains, you just say
    something like:
   </p>

   <p>
    <code>1 pound protein -&gt; Calories</code>
   </p>

   <p>
    Which gives you 1814 Calories.  Again, note that in Frink we use
    <code>Calories</code> with a capital "C" for the food Calorie, which
    should not be confused with the physicist's lowercase
    <code>calorie</code>.  Frink knows about both.  You can also write
    <code>kilocalorie</code> or <code>kcal</code> or just use
    <code>kilojoules</code> or <code>kJ</code> (note that capitalization is
    correct and required.)
   </p>

   <p>
    So, if you had one pound of each of the following, here's approximately how
    many Calories it would give you, according to the Atwater system:
   </p>

   <table summary="Food Calories">
     <tbody><tr><td>1 pound protein</td><td>1800 Calories
     </td></tr><tr><td>1 pound carbohydrate</td><td>1800 Calories
     </td></tr><tr><td>1 pound fat</td><td>4100 Calories
     </td></tr><tr><td>1 pound alcohol</td><td>3200 Calories

   <li>I've mentioned before that it's stress-inducing to get back from the
    grocery store and find that something cost more than you had thought.
    Today, I got a good surprise from Walmart.  A big 21-oz link of summer
    sausage that was marked on sale as $2.50 (down from $4.98) actually only
    cost $1.00!  I know what my snacks are going to be.

   </li><li>I must also resist the the temptation to go back just to get more cheap
    summer sausage.

   </li><li>Since it's St. Patrick's Day week, as predicted, corned beef and
    cabbage are on sale.  I stopped by King Soopers on the way home and got 2
    big heads of cabbage for $0.29/lb, about $1.07 per head.  I'm going to
    feed a few people with that and some corned beef ($3.00/lb) this weekend.

   </li><li>Sprouts actually had cabbage at $0.20/lb!  I didn't go there, but saw
    it in the advertisements.  I forgot there was one on the way home.

  <h2><a name="Day25">Day 25 - Potluck: Corned Beef and Cabbage</a></h2>
  <p>
   Breakfast was a quick bowl of quick oatmeal.
  </p>

  <p>
   Lunch and dinner was a bit of a potluck with friends and relatives, so
   according to my "don't burden others" rule, I didn't really limit my
   expenditures.  Nevertheless, I had several foods that were on sale due to
   St. Patrick's Day:  Corned beef brisket and cabbage.  I also made rye bread
   with caraway seeds.
  </p>

  <p>
   Corned beef was $3.00/lb, which is about as cheap as you're likely to get
   beef.  It's not really my favorite, as there's some taste in cured meats
   that I don't really like.  (Nitrites?  Saltpeter?)  However, if you cook it
   correctly (low and slow in a slow cooker) with enough spices it can be
   pretty good. 
  </p>

  <p>
   The night before, I chopped 2 medium onions ($0.50) and put them in the
   bottom of the slow cooker on low.  I covered the beef with some of my <a href="#MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">barbecue rub</a> like I made on Day
   6.  I then put the brisket into the slow cooker and covered it with water,
   and added more rub to taste.  I then left it to cook overnight (for about
   10 hours).
  </p>

  <p>
   The next morning, I made some easy cabbage with a whole head of cabbage (at
   $0.29/pound, a big head of cabbage cost only $1.07,) two cans of diced
   tomatoes ($0.50 each) and some more barbecue rub in the pressure cooker.
   After the pressure cooker started rattling, I cooked it for 7 minutes.
   This made a good side dish, if you like cooked cabbage.
  </p>

    Beef and Cabbage"></a>

  <p>
   The rye bread was good too.  It used a tablespoon of caraway seeds, which
   are surprisingly expensive.  (The last batch I saw at the grocery store was
   about $6.50 for a ~1.5-oz bottle!)  As I knew people like my rye bread, I
   didn't skimp.  I wouldn't use caraway seeds otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
   I have to admit that I ate quite a bit of the beef at the potluck.  And the
   fat.  And bread.  And potato chips.  I had been very hungry in the morning,
   so it was welcome.  Daily cost:  exempt.

  <p>
   For lunch, I had some corned beef and cabbage leftover from the potluck on
   <a href="#Day25">day 25.</a> Since these are leftovers from a shared
   potluck, I didn't try to track it too carefully, but estimated about 6 oz
   of corned beef at $3.00/lb, for a cost of $0.94.
  </p>

  <p>
   For dinner, I had some more leftovers: spaghetti and rye bread.  With the
   leftover corned beef, I was slightly over my budget at $2.61.  I didn't
   want the corned beef to go to waste, and since it was leftover from a
   potluck, I think of it as "free food."

  <p>
   <img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/totinos.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Totino's Party Pizza">
   I skipped breakfast/lunch and a Totino's Party Pizza (cheese) sounded
   really good, so I threw one of them in the oven for an early dinner.
  </p>

  <p>
   The modern world is really pretty amazing.  I don't know how you can make
   and package and distribute a delicious pizza in a shiny box for $1.25.
   They're still one of my favorites, you can find them anywhere, and you
   can't beat the price.  (Especially when your grocery store puts them on
   sale for less than a dollar.)
  </p>

  <p>
   I remember doing an experiment with my family when I was very young; we
   cooked 3 different types of pizzas, and decided which we liked the best.  I
   remember vividly that the pizzas we tried were Totino's, Jeno's, and
   John's. (I haven't seen John's for a long time, but I occasionally see
   Jeno's.  The spices in Jeno's sauce are really good, but I like Totino's
   super-thin crust better.)  For years, we'd eat pizza on Sunday nights
   (mostly Totino's) and watch TV.  (I even remember that we watched a
   Wonderful World of Disney while we did the experiment.)  There probably
   hasn't been any significant length of time in the past 25 years that I
   haven't had a couple of Totino's pizzas in my freezer, and I probably eat
   one a week.  (I am not paid by Totino's in any way, but if they want to
   send me free pizzas for life and stuff, they totally should.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Late that evening, I was hungry again so I made 2 quick fried egg
   sandwiches.  The pan was a bit hot so it almost instantly flash-burned the
   lower layer eggs to the pan.  Grr.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i><b>Diatribe:</b> As an engineer, don't get me started on the stupidity
   of any open-loop "control system".  Like a stove burner.  A proper
   "closed-loop" control system has a sensor so you know, say, how hot your
   actual surface is, and can control its temperature, rather than just
   pumping a constant level of power into a heating element or a gas burner.
   That is literally the <em>worst</em> way to control a system.  I know that
   professional chefs like gas burners because they rapidly respond to control
   inputs, but in other ways they're the worst possible system because they
   always pump the same amount of power into your dish, regardless of what
   temperature you want to hit.  The human has to be the constant control
   system but with no actual data on, say, what the surface temperature of the
   pan is.  A real control system should let you specify what temperature you
   want to hit, and should hold that for you.  I've built my own temperature
   controller, which, given enough time to learn, controls any electrical
   system to within about 0.1°F, which I hope to write about in this
   experiment.  See more below.

  <p>
   <img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/maeploy.jpg" width="253" height="500" alt="Mae Ploy Sweet
   Chilli Sauce">
   Even later, I was still hungry so I took a bit of the leftover rigatoni and
   made one of my favorite 1-minute dishes with it:  <b>Mae Ploy noodles.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you don't know of Mae Ploy Sweet Chilli Sauce, you need to know about
   it.  It's a chef's secret weapon.  (I have a hard time typing "chilli" with
   two "L"s, but that's the way it's written on the label, so I'm going with
   it.)  It's usually just called "Mae Ploy" by chefs, even though the Mae
   Ploy company makes many other products.  You will find it in all good
   grocery stores, and you will often find it, often incredibly cheap, at the
   front of good Asian markets.  In fact, many good Asian markets will have
   big bottles of Sriracha sauce, big bottles of Mae Ploy Sweet Chilli sauce,
   and big bags of rice stacked in front, inexpensively, on pallets.  It is
   assumed that you will want all of these things.  For better prices than
   you'll find anywhere else.  Stock up.  Their wisdom is correct.
  </p>

  <p>
   Mae Ploy noodles are simply:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Cooked Pasta
   </li><li>Butter
   </li><li>Mae Ploy
   </li><li>Black Pepper (or red chili flakes)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   You just throw that in the microwave for about a minute (depending on how
   cold your initial ingredients are, it may be half that) and it's
   <em>delicious</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Mae Ploy is awesome on many foods, including pizza crusts, chicken, pasta,
   fried egg sandwiches, toasted cheese sandwiches (although Sriracha is even
   better,) cooked potatoes, meats, shrimp (especially with butter and Sriracha
   sauce) and more.  It's not too hot, it's not too sweet, it's just perfectly
   balanced.  (And as an amateur gardener who grows primarily tomatoes and
   peppers, I can't imagine how hard/expensive it is to grow enough peppers
   for a single bottle.)  This is not the cheapest ingredient per ounce if you
   don't find a good supplier, so be careful.  (As you can see below, I
   (probably overestimated) 2 floz for my dish, which at Walmart's prices,
   costs $0.39.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Simple pasta recipes are so easy that the New York Times declared a rather
   simple (but with expensive ingredients like Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese)
   recipe for <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016815-pasta-with-fried-lemons-and-chile-flakes">Pasta with Fried Lemons and Chili Flakes</a> as their most-popular recipe of the year.  (I haven't made it, but friends have and say it's great.)

  <h3><a name="Day31Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I really want to write about the temperature controllers that I've
    built.  They're super-awesome and help you precisely control the
    temperatures for cooking beef, fish, pork, chicken, eggs, tempering
    chocolate, making hollandaise sauce, and anything else that requires
    precise temperature control.

   </li><li>My temperature controller is often called a "sous vide" controller,
    which is a French term meaning "under vacuum" which refers to the way that
    meat is often cooked in a vacuum bag in a water bath.  My controller is
    even  more flexible than that; it can control any resistive electrical
    heating apparatus that you plug into it.  It's one of the most
    revolutionary and awesome cooking methods you will ever use.  I have a
    chuck roast in the freezer that I may cook for 48 or 72 hours (!) to
    demonstrate its awesomeness.

   </li><li>Have you ever cooked anything for 48 hours?  I do regularly, and having
    been raised on some strict food safety rules, it freaked me out to hear of
    such things!  Now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPflEZG4US8" target="_blank">it's my happening and it freaks me out.</a> (Yeah, that
    was way before Austin Powers borrowed the phrase.)  (I later learned more
    about bacteria kill temperatures.  In short: no food pathogens live above
    131°F and almost all die way below that.)  See the <a href="#MeatScience">Meat Science</a> section above for hints on what's
    happening.

   </li><li>I just learned of this today: It's a temperature-controlled grilling
    surface that costs a lot more than my temperature controller and does a
    fraction of what my temperature controller can control.  A trial project
    called <a href="https://cindercooks.com/?ct-referral-code=1HGfkhrJ" target="_blank">Cinder</a>.  Interesting for food geeks.  Can you cook
    chuck roast safely for 72 hours in it?  Not a chance.  Could my temperature
    controller cook chuck roast deliciously and safely for 72 hours?
    Absolutely!  I've done it many times.  Could my temperature controller do
    the same as the Cinder device (much more cheaply) if you plugged a George
    Foreman grill into it?  Certainly, given the right thermocouple.  I may
    post my plans for my device.

   </li><li>I received a George Foreman grill as a present once.  It was obviously
    obtained from Goodwill or re-gifted.  It burned the outside of everything
    to the point of smoke and carbon, while the inside stayed raw.  It went
    back to Goodwill after the first use.  I think it must have been a
    defective unit in some way; the temperatures were too high to have ever
    been reasonable for most food.  I considered mine Dangerous to Meat and
    Economy.

  <h2><a name="Day32">Day 32 - Eat Liver!</a></h2>
  <p>
   I happened to be watching an episode of <i>Simply Ming</i> in which he and
   one of his guest chefs cooks several dishes with offal.  Offal are the
   parts of an animal that aren't skeletal muscles, such as liver or kidneys.
   (It's also called "organ meats" or "variety meats" or "giblets" in poultry.)
   I remembered that I had a tub of chicken livers (20 oz, $1.69) in the
   freezer, so my task was to try and cook them in an interesting way.
  </p>

  <p>
   You may or may not like liver.  It definitely has a strong, distinct
   flavor.  If you like it, it's a filling and iron-rich treat.  I've always
   liked it, if it's prepared and cooked correctly.  The chicken livers I have
   were about $1.35/lb so they aren't cheaper than many chicken parts.  If you
   happen to come across liver on sale, it can be rather economical.
  </p>

  <p>
   First, I soaked the livers in milk.  This is a "traditional" method for
   reducing some of the stronger tastes of the liver.  I don't know if it
   actually works better than some other liquid (such as water or brine) but
   some blood did come out into the milk.  I then rinsed the livers in water
   and drained them well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The best liver I ever made was during this experiment last year; I heavily
   seasoned some cow's liver and coated them in panko breadcrumbs (these are a
   crisp Japanese type of breadcrumbs) mixed with seasoning and fried in a
   skillet.  The crispness of the breading complemented the softness of the
   liver, and made it easier to eat a lot.  So I decided to try a crispy
   coating this time.
  </p>

  <p>
   I do have some panko breadcrumbs in my cupboard, but I also had an old box
   of Corn Flakes (part of a Christmas present from over a year ago,) which I
   wanted to try to use as a coating.  My mom used to make chicken coated with
   Corn Flakes, but I never could get them to stick during frying.  I decided
   to adapt the recipe for Hot Chicken that I made on <a href="#Day19">day
   19</a>.  The only difference was that the final dredge was in crushed Corn
   Flakes instead of flour.
  </p>

  <p>
   I was worried that cooking liver in my deep-fryer would leave flavors in
   the oil, (which I want to keep using) so I decided to cook them in a
   skillet instead.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/liverscooking1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/liverscooking640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Chicken
    Livers Cooking"></a>

  <p>
   (The cooking process reminded me of why I don't like trying to cook fried
   chicken in a skillet.  Oil spatters everywhere, it's hard to control
   temperature, the food cooks unevenly and burns on the bottom, and it's a
   lot harder to clean up.)
  </p>

  <p>
   After taking them out, I brushed the livers with the Hot Chicken sauce like
   I made on <a href="#Day19">day 19</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The livers were quite good!  They had no smell, but they did taste like
   liver!  The crunch of the Corn Flakes was nice, and the spicy sauce was
   delicious.  I ate a lot of them (but not even all of the 10 oz that I
   cooked,) and was quite satisfied.  Due to the difficulty of preparation and
   cleanup, though, I'll probably choose a simpler recipe for cooking the rest
   of the livers.  I also cooked a couple of potato chips.  The liver was so
   filling that I only ate about 6 ounces of the 10 ounces I prepared.
  </p>

  <p>
   For a late snack, I made some more <a href="#MaePloy">Mae Ploy noodles</a>
   like I described yesterday.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/maeploynoodles768x1024.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/maeploynoodles480x640.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Mae
    Ploy Noodles"></a>

  <p>
   The red pepper flakes came with a pizza that I had some time in the past.
   Daily total: $1.50.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day32Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I remembered to weigh the Mae Ploy today; it was 2.6 ounces which cost
    $0.49 at my estimated cost.  That's quite expensive.  Even more expensive
    than I thought.

   </li><li>The Corn Flakes stayed on the livers quite well.  Unfortunately, after
    cooking the first batch, they burned quite badly in the oil so I had to
    strain them out.  I don't know how they'd fare in a deep-fryer.

  <p>
   Since I had some cooked chicken livers left over from yesterday, I had them
   and some more inexpensive macaroni and cheese for dinner. (I got it at
   $0.25/box earlier).  Later, I had a big bowl of oatmeal.
  </p>

  <p>
   Since I was still at only $1.02 for the day, I made myself a dang
   quesadilla (shredded cheese microwaved on a flour tortilla) and had 3.8
   ounces of the big summer sausage I got for the amazing price of $1.00 for
   21 ounces.  Daily total: $1.41.  Liver is quite filling and satisfying!

  <h2><a name="Day34">Day 34 - Simplify, Man!</a></h2>
  <p>
   I still had chicken livers left over (20 ounces goes a long way!) so I
   decided to finish them off and try to simplify my spicy liver recipe a bit.
   (I'm not using my own kitchen for most of the next week or two, so I have
   limited ingredients and utensils.)  There were 3 or 4 parts that caused
   a hassle, created a mess, added cost, and added time.  I removed these from
   the list:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Soaking the livers in milk.
   </li><li>Dredging the livers in flour.
   </li><li>Waiting 5+ minutes for the flour to get gummy.
   </li><li>Crushing up Corn Flakes.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Instead, I just rinsed the livers in water, put some black pepper on them,
   dunked them in a mixture of 1 egg and 2 floz of milk, dredged them
   in some panko bread crumbs, and put them immediately into a frying pan with
   a bit of oil.  (Again, panko are a Japanese style of bread crumbs which are
   light but crisp.)
  </p>

  <p>
   These came out quite nice.  The recipe was much simpler, and they were my
   favorite so far.
  </p>

  <p>
   Oh, I didn't mention that I <em>dipped</em> each nugget into some of the
   hot chicken sauce from <a href="#Day19">day 19!</a>  That made them amazing.
   Cooking the livers a bit longer reduced a bit of the liver flavor.  Simply
   rinsing in cold water worked just as well as soaking in milk.  The best
   liver I've made so far.  Panko bread crumbs are great; they added a nice
   crispness and were very simple.  I had Kikkoman brand on hand, which are
   great.  See below for the price difference between panko and Corn Flakes.
  </p>

  <p>
   I ate somewhere around 10 oz (probably a bit less) of livers and was quite
   satisfied.
  </p>

  <p>
   Later, I made a batch of rice in the slow cooker.  The largest batch it
   could accommodate was about 1.5 cups of rice and 3 cups of water.  It takes
   about 2 hours for the rice to get done at this altitude and with that slow
   cooker.  Since I didn't bring butter or spices with me, I had to
   compromise.  I had a bit of the spicy lard sauce that I used for the livers
   left over, so I added about a tablespoon of that to the batch.  It was
   enough to give the rice a bit of flavor.  Daily total, $1.67.
  </p>
    
  <h3><a name="Day34Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Either I'm getting more used to the liver taste, or I'm getting better
    at making it.  I didn't even think "liver" while I was eating it.  I just
    thought "yum."

   </li><li>As I've mentioned before, liver is very filling.  That 20-oz tub that I
    bought lasted for 3 days and made very nice meals.

   </li><li>I think that a nice crispy coating really complements liver.  When I
    used to cook cow liver, I never breaded it.  This is much better.
    
   </li><li>Are Corn Flakes much cheaper than Panko?  Here are the Walmart prices
    per ounce:
    <table summary="Breading Costs">
      <tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost, cents per ounce

    <p>
     Did you notice that last entry?  When I was looking up prices, I saw that
     you can get Kellogg's Corn Flake <b>Crumbs</b> already crushed up.  If
     you want to go the Corn Flake route, they're not much more expensive than
     crushing up your whole Corn Flakes.  
    </p>

    <p>
     I haven't tried the Great Value brand Panko (and I didn't notice them at
     the store.)  I like the Kikkoman brand a lot.  It's good to know that
     it's not significantly more expensive than using Kellogg's Corn Flakes.
    </p>

   </li><li>Hmmm... as I was mentioning "light but crisp," I need to think about
    Rice Krispies next time.  They have a great light texture, and you probably
    wouldn't need to crush them up.  I don't know how they'd hold up to getting
    moistened or to sustained frying.  I seem to recall my mom making Rice
    Krispie chicken as well as Corn Flake chicken.  I'll have to ask.

   </li><li><b>Shopping Tip:</b>  Walmart is pretty good at marking the price per
    ounce by each item (or price per pound for most meats).  I try to buy
    things that are 12.5¢ per ounce or cheaper (which corresponds to
    $2.00 per pound) which allows me 1.25 pounds of food a day.

   </li><li>Rice is one of the most inexpensive foods you can buy.  The 3 pound bag
    that I bought was 3.1 cents per ounce.  I didn't bring a scale with me,
    but the <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap815e/ap815e.pdf" target="_blank">Food density database</a> gives the density of raw white
    rice as 0.82 g/ml so I estimated the total rice cost at $0.36.  I ate 1/3
    of it.

   </li><li><b>Rule of thumb:</b>  1 cup of raw rice costs $0.25.  This makes about
    3 cups of cooked rice.
    
   </li><li>Reheating the hot chicken sauce (which is basically lard, brown sugar,
    cayenne pepper, and garlic powder) doesn't really work well in the
    microwave.  That's because when lard is rendered, almost <em>all</em> of
    the water is driven out of it.  (This is a big part of the reason you don't
    even need to refrigerate lard; there's no water for bacteria to grow in!)
    However, microwave ovens are designed to work at a resonance frequency of
    water molecules (approximately 2.4 GHz.)  They don't heat up lard very
    efficiently.  Microwaves heat up the water in your food, which in turn
    heats up everything else.  So I added a little bit of water to the sauce
    (which starts out solid) before microwaving it <em>carefully</em>!  Very
    carefully!  Water turns into steam at temperatures where oil is still very
    much liquid, and that can literally <em>explode</em> through and disperse
    the oil that floats on top into the water.

  <h3><a name="Day36Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>

   <li>Soda is quite expensive, but 2-liter bottles are pretty efficient.  The
    bottle of Squirt was $0.88, so 12 fluid ounces of this (the size of a
    typical soda can) would cost about $0.16.

   </li><li>I drove past every fast food place in the world today.  I'd like to do
    a day or two where I just eat fast food and see if I can make ends meet.

   </li><li>I was going to research value menus at fast food restaurants, but found
    an article called <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-to-eat-at-mcdonalds-when-youre-monumentally-broke/" target="_blank">"How to Eat at McDonald's When You're Monumentally Broke"</a>.  They break the foods down by both price/mass and price/calories.  The winner for dinner is probably the McDouble burger for $1.00 which gives 390 calories.  The sausage biscuit gives 430 calories for $1.00 for breakfast.

   </li><li>Here's also a <a href="http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/meet-the-burger-king-value-menu/" target="_blank">partial breakdown for Burger King.</a>   Their
    calories-per-dollar winner appears to be the Chick'N Crisp sandwich (which
    I've never had) which gives 470 calories for its price of $1.00.

   </li><li>I love Burger King's double cheeseburgers for $1.49, but even those are
    a bit too expensive for me for this experiment.  I can still eat 3 of my
    own cabbage rolls for that cost.

   </li><li>How much does it cost me to make a burger?  I'll have to see.  I have a
    simple, foolproof recipe that I like to make for little burgers.

   </li><li>The cheap hot dogs tasted quite good.  Walmart's Great Value brand
    white bread has an excellent texture and was soft and fresh.

  <h2><a name="Day37">Day 37 - Split Pea Soup and Fish Tacos</a></h2>
  <p>
   For breakfast, I had a quick banana.
  </p>

  <h4>Split Pea Soup</h4>
  <p>
   I wanted to make something that would
   last for several days, so I made a <em>gigantic</em> batch of split pea
   soup.  Like more than 3 gallons of it!  Split pea soup is one of my
   favorite soups.  Unfortunately, I didn't find split peas on sale (they were
   actually quite expensive most places I've seen in the past month) but
   Walmart had them for $1.37/lb.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/splitpeapot1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/splitpeapot640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Giant Pot
    of Split Pea Soup"></a>

  <p>
   Here is the basic ingredient list for a gigantic pot of split pea soup.
   (The recipe actually comes from the back of a package of <a href="http://www.hurstbeans.com/products/15/green-split-peas-with-ham-flavor" target="_blank">Hurst's HamPeas</a>.)  I didn't use their peas, (sorry, guys) but they come with a little packet of artificial ham flavor.  You will need a <em>huge</em> stockpot.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>12 quarts water
   </li><li>4 medium onions, shredded
   </li><li>4 medium carrots, shredded
   </li><li>5 pounds dry split peas
   </li><li>1/2 lb butter
   </li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda (optional)
   </li><li>Salt and Pepper to taste

  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Bring the water to a boil, and add the rest of the ingredients, cover, and
   boil until the peas are broken down.  (Your boiling time will be different
   than mine as I live at an altitude of over 5600 feet, so water boils at the
   lower temperature of 204°F (95°C), and boiling dry beans and peas
   and pasta takes significantly longer.)  You will need to boil it for at
   least an hour.  For me, it takes <em>at least</em> an hour and a half.
   Stir frequently.
  </p>

  <p><b>Tip and Warning 1:</b>  Based on a suggestion from the people at
   Cook's Illustrated, baking soda can help reduce cooking times for beans and
   lentils by helping to break down the skins.  I added the baking soda
   early in the process, and it immediately started to make the soup foam,
   which progressively got worse until it boiled over and I had to lift it off
   the heat.  Ugh.  I too-late tried the home-beer-brewer's trick of spraying
   the foam with a sprayer bottle of water, but the foam was too active and I
   was too late.  Be prepared for boilover.  Luckily, after the protein foam
   boils off or is skimmed off, you're okay for the rest of the boil.
  </p>

  <p><b>Tip and Warning 2:</b> Keep stirring!  And keep boiling!  While the
   recipe on the HamPeas bag tells you to reduce the heat and simmer after 30
   minutes, I have found that unless you keep up the convection of an actively
   rolling boil, your soup tends to stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.
   I burned a giant batch of this soup last year while doing this experiment.
   That was not fun.  (I'll note that adding some peanut butter to the soup
   reduced the burnt flavor.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The whole <em>enormous</em> batch of split pea soup (and believe me, it is
   enormous,) cost about $9.07 for about 53 cups.  That's a price of
   $0.17/cup.  I ate 3 cups with dinner, and then, when trying to find enough
   space to store it all, ate 2 more cups.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="FishTacos">Fish Tacos</a></h4>
  <p>
   To go along with the soup for dinner, I made some simple fish tacos.  The
   cheapest fish that I saw was a bag of frozen Whiting, for about $2.80/lb.
   While the soup was cooking, I cooked the fish in a glass dish with some
   oil, vinegar, water, and spices in a toaster oven at 300°F (150°C).
   It took about 20 minutes.  The texture of the fish was nice, but it really
   smelled and tasted fishy!  Some of the fishiest fish I've ever had.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/fishtacos1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/fishtacos640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Fish Tacos"></a>
  
  <p>
   I also made a mayonnaise-based sauce to go on the fish tacos.  This was
   mayonnaise, a bit of citric acid powder (to make it taste lemony without
   watering it down too much,) garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, and salt.
   This was a quite nice sauce which hid most of the fishy taste.
  </p>

  <p>
   I didn't brine the fish or remove skin first; this may have helped to
   reduce fishy taste.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The tacos also had a small bit of cheese and some cabbage.  The cost of 2
   tacos was $0.85, with $0.65 of that being due to the fish.
  </p>

  <p>
   Oh, and there was also a batch of brownies!  A box of brownie mix was
   $0.99.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day37Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Campbell's Split Pea soup, prepared, costs about $0.62/cup compared to
    the $0.17/cup that my soup costs.  A real savings.  I can eat 3.6 times as
    much for the same price.

   </li><li>I usually use chicken bouillon when making this soup, but I eliminated
    it to try and save a bit of money.  See my tips for buying cheaper
    bouillon in the <a href="#BuyingSpices">Buying Spices</a> section.

   </li><li>I didn't use ham in my soup.  Right now (around Easter) ham is often on
    sale, but I'd rather have it on the side, and I think that the soup lasts
    longer without the ham.

   </li><li>I froze several containers of soup, as it freezes and reheats very
    well.
  </li></ul>

  <h2><a name="Day38">Day 38 - Chicken I Can't Eat (Yet)</a></h2>
  <p>
   For breakfast, I had a <em>huge</em> bowl of oatmeal.  <em>Monkey
    oatmeal!</em>
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/monkeyoatmeal1024x1021.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/monkeyoatmeal640x638.jpg" width="640" height="638" alt="Oatmeal
    with Raisins for Eyes"></a>
  
  <p>
   However, the big excitement for the day was that I had some incredibly
   cheap chicken thighs that I was going to fry for real buttermilk fried
   chicken!
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/chickenlabel1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/chickenlabel640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Chicken
    Label showing $3.58 for 5.3 pounds"></a>

  <p>
   Woohoo!  Expired meats!  Okay, they weren't expired at all, but rather put
   on even deeper discount because the "sell by" date was the next day.  The
   price was $3.58 for almost 5.3 pounds of chicken thighs; this is $0.68 /
   lb, the cheapest meat I've found so far!  And that includes bologna or hot
   dogs!  That's only $0.36 per thigh.
  </p>

  <p>
   Surprisingly, I was walking by the dairy case and there was a carton of
   buttermilk that was similarly discounted; $1.10 for a quart of buttermilk.
   (It usually costs at least twice that.)  So, for the first time in my life,
   I decided to make real buttermilk fried chicken.  7 of the 10 pieces of
   chicken went into buttermilk in the refrigerator overnight.  I also added a
   good amount of salt to the marinade.
  </p>

  <p>
   A book that I recently bought, and I really like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Cooking-Cooks-Illustrated-Cookbooks/dp/1933615982" target="_blank">The Science of Good Cooking</a>, found that it was
   necessary to use buttermilk <em>and</em> a large amount of salt when
   marinating for fried chicken.  The lactic acid in the buttermilk helps to
   tenderize the meat, and the salty liquid acts as a brine to add moisture to
   the meat.
  </p>

  <p>
   I seasoned the meat with a bit of my <a href="#MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">spice rub</a> and then dredged it in
   flour with 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder.  The baking powder produces
   gases in the hot oil, which will make the breading light and crunchy.  I
   let the flour sit on the chicken for 5 minutes to get sticky and gummy, and
   then back into the buttermilk and back into the flour.
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/buttermilkdredge1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/buttermilkdredge640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Chicken with Flour Coating"></a>

  <p>
   Then, into the deep fryer at 325°F (160 °C) for 20 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/deepfryerchicken768x1024.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/deepfryerchicken480x640.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Chicken in the Deep Fryer"></a>

  <p>
   The chicken came out quite a bit darker than the chicken that I cooked the
   other day.  I could have had the thermostat set a little higher.  The other
   option is that I added a bit more oil to the deep fryer.  Perhaps the
   larger volume kept the temperature from dropping as much when the chicken
   was added.  I also refrained from doing the double dredge for the last
   pieces, as the breading was <em>huge</em> on the first few pieces.
  </p>

  <p>
   The tragedy of this whole story is that, because it's a Friday during Lent,
   I chose not to eat the chicken that day!  However, since I'm not going to
   in my own kitchen for a while, I have lots of good chicken to eat!
   Instead, for dinner, I had two cups of split pea soup and a small frozen
   bean and cheese burrito.  I also had a couple of brownies that a friend
   gave to me.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day38Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>

   <li>Although that may look like a fancy deep-fryer, I got it on
    clearance a few years ago from Wal-mart at $19.99.  It works well but is a
    bit of a pain to clean.

   </li><li>I should probably reduce the cooking time for the chicken.  It's hard
    to know when it's done inside, though.  These are <em>big</em> thighs.
    Each averaged over 8 ounces.

   </li><li>Split pea soup is good hot, warm, or at room temperature.  When it gets
    cold, though, it congeals into a slippery-smooth mass.

  <h2><a name="Day39">Day 39 - Fried Chicken (Finally!)</a></h2>
  <p>
   For lunch I finally had a piece of the fried chicken (cold.)  It was quite
   good!  It probably cooked a bit too long, as the breading had a bit of an
   overcooked taste.  Overall, good, though!  I could have used a bit more
   seasoning in the flour itself.  I forgot to put salt in the flour.
  </p>

  <p>
   I also had a piece of bread and a couple (free) brownies.
  </p>

  <p>
   Overall, though, I was saving space for all-you-can-eat sushi that night.
   That was a social event so, according to my rules, I won't count it.  I
   expected that I would eat two tons of sushi, but I guess my stomach has
   shrunk and I only ate one ton.

  <h2><a name="Day40">Day 40 - Bologna and More Chicken</a></h2>
  <p>
   For lunch, I had a bologna sandwich (the first I've had in about 30
   years).  I have to say that it wasn't great.  It was cheap ($1.00/lb) but,
   geez, the fried chicken that I made was even cheaper than that.  With a bit
   of planning, I could do much better.  I didn't have any lettuce or cabbage
   or horseradish or cheese.  It was just white bread, bologna, mayonnaise,
   and mustard.  It wasn't very tasty.  The split pea soup was good, though!
  </p>

  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/bologna1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/bologna640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Bologna Sandwich and Split Pea Soup"></a>

  <p>
   I am now ready to admit that I definitely overcooked the breading
   on the chicken.  I actually picked some of it off and didn't eat it.  And
   crispy chicken skin is one of my favorite things in the world.  Nothing
   makes me feel like I've failed like overcooking and ruining good food.  I'm
   still surprised that the chicken I cooked on <a href="#Day14">day 14</a>
   and <a href="#Day19">day 19</a> was cooked at supposedly the same
   temperature and for the same amount of time, but was cooked properly.  I'm
   still trying to figure that one out.  Next time, I won't rely primarily on
   a timer, but watch the chicken more carefully.

  <h2><a name="Day42">Day 42 - Chicken Tikka Masala</a></h2>
  <p>
   I looked at my cheap leftover ingredients which included: chicken thighs,
   potatoes, canned tomatoes, and buttermilk.  So I decided to make chicken
   tikka masala!  I bought all of these ingredients on deep discounts, so it
   should be very cost-effective!
  </p>

  <p>
   Do you eat a lot of chicken tikka masala?  Do you see it a lot?  It is
   literally the most popular restaurant dish in the U.K.
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/tikkamasalatub1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://futureboy.us/blog/links/tikkamasalatub640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Tikka
    Masala Spice Tub"></a>
  
  <p>
   I've had a quarter-pound tub of pre-mixed tikka masala spices that I bought
   about 3 years ago when visiting the amazing <a href="http://www.dekalbfarmersmarket.com/">Dekalb Farmer's Market</a> in
   Decatur, Georgia.  (Thanks for taking me, Ann!).  The whole tub of spices
   only cost $0.62, which is an incredible deal (especially when you compare
   it to a jar of premixed tikka masala sauce, which is expensive.)  I ended
   up using about 1/3 of the tub.
  </p>

  <p>
   I peeled, diced, and boiled 4 small potatoes (approx 1 lb.)  While the
   potatoes were boiling, I fried 3 chicken thighs in a pan with some oil,
   then boned them when they were just barely cooked, and finished cooking
   them through in the pan.  I also cut and fried an onion.
  </p>

  <p>
   Tikka masala is usually made with yogurt, but I had cheap buttermilk that
   smelled great, so I decided to use that instead.  I also put in two cans of
   diced tomatoes that I had bought for $0.50/can.  As it cooked, I spooned in
   spoonful after spoonful of tikka masala spices until the level of spice was
   right.  I also thought it needed some acid, so I added about an ounce of
   lemon juice (from a bottle.)  It wasn't quite as creamy as I'd like, so I
   found the end of a tub of Greek yogurt (Great Value brand, ~3 oz) and added
   that.
  </p>

  <p>
   I then added the cooked, drained potatoes, fried onion, and the cooked
   chicken to the pot and let it just simmer for a few minutes.  (You don't
   want to overcook the chicken.  Chicken thighs are cooked right at around
   161°F (72°C).  It also needed a bit of salt.  I also added the oil
   from cooking the chicken to the pot for a bit of richness (and calories,
   and not wasting food.)
  </p>

    Chicken Tikka Masala"></a>

  <p>
   That's a big pot of Tikka Masala!  Probably about 3 quarts.  And very
   inexpensive.  The whole pot cost about $3.83, and I probably only ate about
   1/4 of it.
  </p>

  <p>
   I had also made some rice in the crock pot.  I let it go too long as it was
   very mushy.  But you gotta serve tikka masala on rice!

   The tikka masala came out great!  The spice mix was very nice and I'm glad
   I finally got to use it (after 3 years.)  I probably only ate about 1/4 of
   the tikka masala, which should last about 3 or 4 meals!  A great
   combination of inexpensive ingredients came together to make a great meal.
   Lots of protein, lots of flavor, lots of complexity.  A great deal, too!
   It might even last me through the end of this experiment (although I
   generally don't like chicken after about 3 days.)
  </p>

  <p>
   I ate two big servings of the chicken tikka masala, rice, and a bowl of
   split pea soup.  I also had a free brownie.  Late that night, I had a cheap
   ($0.25) frozen burrito.
  </p>

  <p>
   Daily total:  <b>$1.52</b>
  </p>
  

  <h3><a name="Day42Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>The tikka masala would be good with some sour cream added, too.  One of
    my favorite dishes of all time is beef stroganoff, and it sort of reminded
    me of that.  I probably can't afford to make beef stroganoff on this
    budget (mushrooms are not exactly cost-effective, and that's the best
    part!)

   </li><li>I didn't skin the chicken before frying it.  I should have removed it
    before adding it to the pot, but I was hungry and in a hurry.  It didn't
    get crisp enough to be good.

   </li><li>Crispy chicken skins are one of my favorite foods.  If you salt them
    and bake them in an oven until they get crisp, they're amazing.  If I ever
    start a restaurant, I'm going to give everyone a chicken skin chip when
    they come in.  They will buy more.

   </li><li>I've heard that a tiny bit of baking soda will help make chicken skin
    brown and crisp better.  I haven't tried it, though.

   </li><li>I'm still offended by something that happened 20 years ago.  I was at a
    party, and someone stripped all the skin off of a roast chicken <em>and
     threw it away, assuming nobody would want it!</em> Ah, Boulder.  What an
    offensive waste of food, though.  Not preparing and eating chicken or
    turkey skin correctly is a huge loss.  You can render off most of the fat
    if you want.

   </li><li>Every year, we have a party to deep-fry Thanksgiving turkeys.  Turkeys
    are cheap at that time, and the oil usually costs more than several
    turkeys, so we invite everyone to bring their own turkey and fry it.  The
    skin is the best part.  One of my friends ate most of the skin off of her
    turkey, as it's never as good the next day.  <em>That was the right thing
     to do.</em>

   </li><li>I'm glad that the tikka masala spice mix was good.  Not too much of any
    ingredient that disagree with me (like turmeric.)  I made some achar
    (Indian pickles) before the start of this experiment, and the spice mix
    that I got was <em>so</em> unbelievably bitter with turmeric that it was
    coming out of my pores and I had to throw most of it out.

   </li><li>The only thing that this meal needed was a nice crisp but moist piece
    of naan (a crisp piece of indian bread.)  If you're out of naan, you can
    toast a flour tortilla in a toaster oven.

   </li><li>Having a big batch of split pea soup is great.  It's incredibly
    filling, cheap, delicious, and easy to reheat and enhance any meal.

   </li><li>If you're ever in the Atlanta area, I recommend going to the <a href="http://www.dekalbfarmersmarket.com/">Dekalb Farmer's Market</a>.
    Everything about it is amazing.  There were three things I wanted to wanted
    to do in Atlanta:

    <ul>
     <li>Go to <a href="http://www.thevarsity.com/">The Varsity</a> and have a
      hot dog (the Slaw Dog was my favorite; I was sorta disappointed by the
      meat sauce on the chili cheese dog).  Thanks for taking me, Ann!

     </li><li>Go to the Dekalb Farmer's Market.  It's amazing.  Thanks, Ann!  I
      always go to these incredible markets in distant cities (<a href="http://www.uwajimaya.com/">Uwajimaya</a> in Seattle is another
      favorite) and I'm sad that I can't take most of the foods with me
      because I don't have a refrigerator or freezer.

     </li><li>Drive a Chrysler that's as big as a whale.  My rental car was
      actually a Chrysler!  (And my flight actually left from gate B-52 in
      Denver!)
    </li></ul>

  <h2><a name="Day43">Day 43 - More Tikka Masala</a></h2>
  <p>
   Well, since I still had a ton of chicken tikka masala, rice, and split pea
   soup, that became dinner.  Later that night I had Second Dinner, which was
   more tikka masala.  I still have a <em>lot</em> of tikka masala left over.
  </p>

  <p>
   I believe I overestimated how much tikka masala that I eat with each meal,
   so I may go back and change my estimates.  I'm not in my own kitchen, so I
   don't have a scale to easily measure.  It goes a long way.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day43Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Some just-warm split pea soup is a nice counter to a spicy dish.  The
    tikka masala isn't too spicy, so I may want to add a bit more of the spice
    to the remaining meals and see if I like it better hot.

  <h2><a name="Day44">Day 44 - Tikka Masala, Again.</a></h2>
  <p>
   I still have a lot of chicken tikka masala and rice, so that was a quick
   lunch.  Today I ate the last of the split pea soup.
  </p>

  <p>
   Although I have chicken tikka masala left over, frankly, I was getting
   tired of it, so I had a Totino's Party Pizza for dinner.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day44Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I considered just trying to buy fast food today, but I have leftovers
    that need to get eaten.

   </li><li>I'm getting very close to the end of this experiment!  I can't just
    throw away leftovers <em>after</em> the experiment and be honest.  So,
    whatever I cook, I have to try and eat!

   </li><li>At some point, I miscalculated the number of days between the start and

    of the 45 days that I've been saying.

  <h2><a name="Day45">Day 45 - Fish Sticks and Ramen</a></h2>
  <p>
   Since it's Good Friday, I chose not to eat the chicken tikka masala, but
   grabbed some quick fish sticks.  It's been a long time since I've had fish
   sticks.  I chose the package that had the most mass per dollar, which was
   Van De Kamp's crunchy fish sticks.
  </p>

  <p>
   The fish sticks were good enough, but not very cost-effective.  11 very
   small fish sticks was exactly 1/4 of the box, (about 6 ounces) and they
   didn't fill me up very much.  Those 11 fish sticks cost $1.25.  Not a very
   smart purchase, but I was hungry and in a hurry.  I should have followed my
   first instinct and made tuna fish sandwiches.  I considered making fish
   sandwiches or fish tacos out of these, but, again, I'm not at home and
   don't have the ingredients on hand to make a proper sauce, so I just did
   something quick.  They were not on a good sale, either.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   I also had an ordinary bowl of shrimp-flavored ramen.  Nothing too
   exciting.
  </p>

  <p>
   Later that evening, I had the last of my broccoli with a bit of
   cheese (which was an indulgence.)  I have no idea how much the cheese cost
   so I made an estimate of $7.00/lb.  I could only do this because I was
   still well under budget for the day.  Cheese is expensive.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day45Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Up until today, I had done a good job of shopping somewhat carefully
    and with a plan.  My choices today for fish sticks were not optimal.  I
    didn't really try.  Don't shop hungry!  Since I'm not at home, I didn't
    have any of my own food to fall back on.

   </li><li>It's very clear to me from this experiment that the best way to eat
    efficiently is to watch for items that are on deep discount, and plan your
    meals around what's available cheaply.

   </li><li>Walmart prides themselves on having low prices every day, and not
    having sales on items.  This is good for average day-to-day shopping, but
    almost all of my good deals during this experiment were found from deep
    discounts, primarily from Albertson's.

   </li><li>Average prices and prices on staple items may be cheaper at Walmart,
    and I've found the quality of their Great Value house brand to be
    extremely good on most items.  Unfortunately, you'll very likely never
    find a good sale on meat or fish like you will at a store with an in-house
    butcher.  It's actually my least-favorite place to buy meat.

   </li><li>I just realized that I should have made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gea7YA75iM" target="_blank">fishstick kitties!</a>

  <h2><a name="Day46">Day 46 - The Last Day</a></h2>
  <p>
   For the last day of the experiment, I skipped breakfast and lunch, and had
   a simple dinner of fishsticks, urad dal, and half of a grapefruit.  The
   urad dal (see <a href="#Day9">Day 9</a>) was cooked with a bit of bouillon
   powder (and I got it a bit too salty.)  It wasn't as good as the batch that
   I cooked in leftover pork broth.
  </p>

  <p>
   I also made some quick sauce for the fishsticks with a bit of ketchup and
   horseradish.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day46Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I went to bed a bit hungry again, and had trouble sleeping.  I thought
    about food all night.

   </li><li>It would have been more cost-efficient for me to buy the whole salmon
    again for $1.99/lb (they were available,) but fish sticks are pretty
    easy.  I'll have to look for fish sticks at low cost for future
    reference.

  <h2><a name="Conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Overall, I think this experiment was a success.  I made my price
    targets, and experimented with good food!  My average cost was well under
    $2.50 / day, and I ate some of my very favorite foods, and discovered new
    favorites!  That's exciting!

   </li><li><a name="Recommendations"><b>Recommendations:</b></a> If you want to try
     some of my favorite recipes, I'd recommend you try:
    <ul>
     <li><b>Cabbage Rolls!</b>:  Described on <a href="#Day2">Day 2</a>
      (description), <a href="#Day13">Day 13</a> (recipe), and <a href="#Day16">Day 16</a> (cost breakdown.)  These are one of the most
      delicious and convenient foods I know how to make.  If you can find
      ground beef on sale, <em>make a ton of these and freeze them</em>.  You
      will thank me.

     </li><li><b>Hot Chicken!</b>: Chicken thighs were literally the cheapest meat
      that I found during this experiment; even cheaper than terrible bologna
      that was made out of lips and hooves.  Chicken thighs are also one of the
      most delicious meats.  And Hot Chicken is unbelievably delicious.  See <a href="#Day19">Day 19</a> for more on Hot Chicken!  When you see
     inexpensive chicken thighs, <em>make this</em>.

     </li><li><b>Split Pea Soup!</b>: The richest and most satisfying of all the
      soups.  (And one of the very cheapest!)  If you see split peas at a
      reasonable price, make a lot of this.  Eat it.  Freeze it.  Have it for
      months.  See <a href="#Day37">Day 37</a> for the recipe.  Many, many
      people have asked me for the recipe.  It's not hard.

     </li><li><b>Pork Shoulder!</b>: This is one of the cheapest cuts of meat that
      you can buy, but one of the most luxurious if you cook it low and slow.
      You can turn it into into pulled pork barbecue, pork tacos, pork
      sandwiches, <a href="#PorkPancakes">Pork Pancakes</a>, and more.
      The leftover 
      broth alone will make <a href="#Day6">the best damn ramen that you've
       ever seen.</a> See <a href="#Day4">day 4</a> for the original description
      and pork soft tacos.  Don't miss the <a href="#MeatScience">Meat
       Science</a> section to explain why pork shoulder magically turns from
      tough and gristly into luscious and juicy after 9 hours of cooking.  It
      will change your life.  You'll want my <a href="#MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">spice rub recipe</a>.

      <p>
       (Also, did you know that when you buy "country-style pork ribs" that
       they're usually just pork shoulder cut into rib-like shapes?  I bought
       an electric smoker at a garage sale for $12.50 and I use it to smoke
       pork shoulder "ribs".)
      </p>

     </li><li><b>Tuna Casserole!</b>:  Whenever you see cheap cans of tuna, think
      of this.  It's an old recipe that is absolutely delicious and a favorite
      of many families for 80 years.  The description is on <a href="#Day10">day 10</a> and the recipe on <a href="#Day11">day 11</a>.
    </li></ul>

   </li><li>$2.50 / day is a somewhat difficult target to hit.  I knew that and I
    expected it.  It's very easy for one ill-chosen ingredient to make you
    exceed your budget.  However, it can definitely be done.  I'm glad that I
    chose a difficult target.

   </li><li>I'm very lucky that I don't <em>have</em> to limit my food expenses
    severely.  I've mentioned, though, that as an engineer, I like constraints
    because it limits the number of decisions I have to make.

   </li><li>Planning ahead and thoughtful shopping is important.

   </li><li>Looking at weekly food advertisments is important.

   </li><li>Keeping alert for bargains at the grocery store (especially discounted
    about-to-expire meat) is important.

   </li><li>Buying items on deep discounts and planning your menu around these
    items is one of the best ways to reduce your costs.  Think of it as an
    Iron Chef episode:  "I have a bunch of this cheap ingredient, now what can
    I make with it?"

   </li><li>Whenever I have found great prices on things, I've bought a lot of them
    for food banks.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work for frozen/refrigerated
    items.

   </li><li>Don't forget to contribute to your local food banks or missions.  I've
    been contributing heavily each time I buy food.

   </li><li>Learning "rules of thumb" for how much things cost allows you to
    estimate the costs of a dish in your head, and in a grocery store.
    Learning some of these rules of thumb in the first days was one of the most
    important things that helped me estimate better.

   </li><li>During the experiment, I craved cheese and beef the most.  On Easter,
    the day after the experiment, I made my patented wee cheeseburger
    "sliders".  These are really good but are just on the edge of
    cost-effectiveness.  I didn't go nuts and eat anything expensive after the
    experiment, but boy, did I appreciate that slight bit of freedom!  On the
    other hand, my <a href="#Day2">Cabbage Rolls</a> are probably every bit as
    good, and cheaper.

   </li><li>Oh, yeah, when making my cheeseburgers, I
    remembered to <em>save the broth</em> that came from meat juices cooking
    with onions.  Yum!  Will I put it in ramen or urad dal?

   </li><li>I've learned to try and use all parts of the foods I cook.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd_KaF3-Bcw" target="_blank"><em>I
      paid for this fat, senator!</em></a>
    
   </li><li>You pay less for ground beef with more fat.  Yet ground beef with more
    fat <a href="#CountingCalories">has more energy.</a> Keep that fat.  Use
    that fat.  Harness its energy to make you stronger than you can possibly
    imagine.  (I meant to write a whole entry on this, but I didn't.)

   </li><li>I'm also thinking of other food-based projects.  I've always wanted to
    cook one meal a week using only solar power.  (I designed and built a big
    reflector once but it blew apart in the wind.)

   </li><li>I feel I've only scratched the surface of awesome cheap foods to make.
    Where are the fried rice and pressure-cooker stew and 50-pound-zucchini
    and fast food and sourdough and kimchi recipes?   I'm learning as I write
    this.  I want to add more.

   </li><li>Thanks to everyone who contributed food suggestions.  I'd like to
    incorporate them into further entries.

   </li><li>I plan to continue this as I find more interesting recipes and cheap
    foods.

   </li><li>Please try your own experiment and <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">let me know</a> how it goes!  It may
    be for 46 days, or one day.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Thanks for reading this.  I hope I helped someone find a new food that they
   love, and can share with others.  I will be adding to this page as I
   discover new inexpensive, amazing recipes.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_2163678"><p>The second birthday of ChatGPT was only a little over a month ago, and now we have transitioned into the next paradigm of models that can do complex reasoning. New years get people in a reflective mood, and I wanted to share some personal thoughts about how it has gone so far, and some of the things I’ve learned along the way.</p><p>As we get closer to AGI, it feels like an important time to look at the progress of our company. There is still so much to understand, still so much we don’t know, and it’s still so early. But we know a lot more than we did when we started.</p><p>We started OpenAI almost nine years ago because we believed that AGI was possible, and that it could be the most impactful technology in human history. We wanted to figure out how to build it and make it broadly beneficial; we were excited to try to make our mark on history. Our ambitions were extraordinarily high and so was our belief that the work might benefit society in an equally extraordinary way.</p><p>At the time, very few people cared, and if they did, it was mostly because they thought we had no chance of success.</p><p>In 2022, OpenAI was a quiet research lab working on something temporarily called “Chat With GPT-3.5”. (We are much better at research than we are at naming things.) We had been watching people use the playground feature of our API and knew that developers were really enjoying talking to the model. We thought building a demo around that experience would show people something important about the future and help us make our models better and safer.</p><p>We ended up mercifully calling it ChatGPT instead, and launched it on November 30th of 2022.</p><p>We always knew, abstractly, that at some point we would hit a tipping point and the AI revolution would get kicked off. But we didn’t know what the moment would be. To our surprise, it turned out to be this.</p><p>The launch of ChatGPT kicked off a growth curve like nothing we have ever seen—in our company, our industry, and the world broadly. We are finally seeing some of the massive upside we have always hoped for from AI, and we can see how much more will come soon.</p><hr><p>It hasn’t been easy. The road hasn’t been smooth and the right choices haven’t been obvious.</p><p>In the last two years, we had to build an entire company, almost from scratch, around this new technology. There is no way to train people for this except by doing it, and when the technology category is completely new, there is no one at all who can tell you exactly how it should be done.</p><p>Building up a company at such high velocity with so little training is a messy process. It’s often two steps forward, one step back (and sometimes, one step forward and two steps back). Mistakes get corrected as you go along, but there aren’t really any handbooks or guideposts when you’re doing original work. Moving at speed in uncharted waters is an incredible experience, but it is also immensely stressful for all the players. Conflicts and misunderstanding abound.</p><p>These years have been the most rewarding, fun, best, interesting, exhausting, stressful, and—particularly for the last two—unpleasant years of my life so far. The overwhelming feeling is gratitude; I know that someday I’ll be retired at our ranch watching the plants grow, a little bored, and will think back at how cool it was that I got to do the work I dreamed of since I was a little kid. I try to remember that on any given Friday, when seven things go badly wrong by 1 pm.</p><hr><p>A little over a year ago, on one particular Friday, the main thing that had gone wrong that day was that I got fired by surprise on a video call, and then right after we hung up the board published a blog post about it. I was in a hotel room in Las Vegas. It felt, to a degree that is almost impossible to explain, like a dream gone wrong.</p><p>Getting fired in public with no warning kicked off a really crazy few hours, and a pretty crazy few days. The “fog of war” was the strangest part. None of us were able to get satisfactory answers about what had happened, or why.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole event was, in my opinion, a big failure of governance by well-meaning people, myself included. Looking back, I certainly wish I had done things differently, and I’d like to believe I’m a better, more thoughtful leader today than I was a year ago.</p><p>I also learned the importance of a board with diverse viewpoints and broad experience in managing a complex set of challenges. Good governance requires a lot of trust and credibility. I appreciate the way so many people worked together to build a stronger system of governance for OpenAI that enables us to pursue our mission of ensuring that AGI benefits all of humanity.</p><p>My biggest takeaway is how much I have to be thankful for and how many people I owe gratitude towards: to everyone who works at OpenAI and has chosen to spend their time and effort going after this dream, to friends who helped us get through the crisis moments, to our partners and customers who supported us and entrusted us to enable their success, and to the people in my life who showed me how much they cared. [1]</p><p>We all got back to the work in a more cohesive and positive way and I’m very proud of our focus since then. We have done what is easily some of our best research ever. We grew from about 100 million weekly active users to more than 300 million. Most of all, we have continued to put technology out into the world that people genuinely seem to love and that solves real problems.</p><hr><p>Nine years ago, we really had no idea what we were eventually going to become; even now, we only sort of know. AI development has taken many twists and turns and we expect more in the future.</p><p>Some of the twists have been joyful; some have been hard. It’s been fun watching a steady stream of research miracles occur, and a lot of naysayers have become true believers. We’ve also seen some colleagues split off and become competitors. Teams tend to turn over as they scale, and OpenAI scales really fast. I think some of this is unavoidable—startups usually see a lot of turnover at each new major level of scale, and at OpenAI numbers go up by orders of magnitude every few months. The last two years have been like a decade at a normal company. When any company grows and evolves so fast, interests naturally diverge. And when any company in an important industry is in the lead, lots of people attack it for all sorts of reasons, especially when they are trying to compete with it.</p><p>Our vision won’t change; our tactics will continue to evolve. For example, when we started we had no idea we would have to build a product company; we thought we were just going to do great research. We also had no idea we would need such a crazy amount of capital. There are new things we have to go build now that we didn’t understand a few years ago, and there will be new things in the future we can barely imagine now.&nbsp;</p><p>We are proud of our track-record on research and deployment so far, and are committed to continuing to advance our thinking on safety and benefits sharing. We continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer. We believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.</p><p>We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.</p><p>We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. We love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.</p><p>This sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That’s alright—we’ve been there before and we’re OK with being there again. We’re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important. Given the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company.</p><p>How lucky and humbling it is to be able to play a role in this work.</p><p>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview/" title="Link: https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview/">Josh Tyrangiel for sort of prompting this</a>. I wish we had had a lot more time.)</p><p>[1]</p><p>There were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work to help OpenAI, and me personally, during those few days, but two people stood out from all others.</p><p>Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that I’m not even sure how to describe it. I’ve of course heard stories about Ron’s ability and tenaciousness for years and I’ve spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice.</p><p>But there’s nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do. I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done.</p><p>Although they worked unbelievably hard, they stayed calm and had clear strategic thought and great advice throughout. They stopped me from making several mistakes and made none themselves. They used their vast networks for everything needed and were able to navigate many complex situations. And I’m sure they did a lot of things I don’t know about.</p><p>What I will remember most, though, is their care, compassion, and support.</p><p>I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did. But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do. They are different and both fully deserve their genuinely unique reputations, but they are similar in their remarkable ability to move mountains and help, and in their unwavering commitment in times of need. The tech industry is far better off for having both of them in it.</p><p>There are others like them; it is an amazingly special thing about our industry and does much more to make it all work than people realize. I look forward to paying it forward.</p><p>On a more personal note, thanks especially to Ollie for his support that weekend and always; he is incredible in every way and no one could ask for a better partner.</p></div></div>]]></description>
