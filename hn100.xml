Fine tuning is such an enticing technology — promising to fill the gaps in GPT-4’s capabilities while also being faster and cheaper.

One of the ways that players play Magic (and my personal favorite way) is </span><em><strong>draft</strong></em><span>, where players build their decks by selecting individual cards from a rotating pool of randomized cards passed among them.</span></p><p><em><strong>Draft </strong></em><span>fits my criteria pretty nicely:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Reasoning: </strong><span>choosing a card from a randomized pack is quite skill testing and often requires a cohesive understanding of the context (e.g., what cards have you picked so far, what cards are available in the current pack)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Out-of-distribution: </strong><span>New Magic cards are released ~4-6 times a year, and the most recent cards are not found in the training corpus of LLMs.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Another important piece: </span><strong>data. </strong><span>There’s an awesome service called </span><a href="https://www.17lands.com/" rel="">17lands</a><span> that has a huge trove of historical data — players use 17lands’ tracking service to track draft data from the digital Magic client. With that data, you can extract “ground truth” by looking at the draft picks made by the best players on the service (sorted by win rate). This is all a bit fuzzy (a lot of great Magic players debate about correct picks all the time), but it’s a good enough signal to test LLM’s ability to learn a new task.</span></p><p><em><span>If you’re curious about data details, </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/davidhershey/665d45999376c34eefbb71acbf67dafd" rel="">here’s an example of what 17lands data looks like when transformed into a prompt for an LLM</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Let’s get straight to the results, then dig into some specific learnings and thoughts:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png" width="1200" height="567.3292999135696" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:547,&quot;width&quot;:1157,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:88838,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca314ee1-ea26-4fcf-a48c-eba1f745cf83_1157x547.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Thoughts:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>A fine tuned 7B parameter model handily beat GPT-4 and came close to human-level (or at least author-level) performance on this task.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong> </strong><span>It looks like fine-tuned GPT-3.5 would be even better, but </span><strong>fine-tuning GPT-3.5 is really expensive!</strong><span> (~100x more expensive than fine-tuning Mistral on bare metal + a premium price for each inference).

This bogs down the experimental workflow significantly and makes fine-tuning feel just as challenging as classical machine learning.</span></p><p>To illustrate with the Magic draft problem, I considered and tested the following:</p><ul><li><p>~5 prompt formats, in particular how much detail about each card to show</p></li><li><p>Adding additional context about the last few draft picks to have “memory”</p></li><li><p>Including training lines of “card trivia,” where the model is asked to remember details about the new cards</p></li></ul><p>I did ~ 40 hours of experiments and still don’t conclusively feel that I’ve answered questions about what prompt format is “best” for this task. There is a lot of room to experiment.</p><p><strong>Finding GPUs: </strong><span>doesn’t need to be said, but it sucks! Most places don’t have a lot of availability. I ended up renting an hourly GPU from </span><a href="https://www.runpod.io/" rel="">Runpod</a><span> (an RTX 4090 w/ 24GB of VRAM) for ~$0.7/hr. </span></p><p><strong>Fine tuning script: </strong><span>This isn’t my first ML rodeo, so my gut was to write my own training script with HuggingFace transformers + </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=peft&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="">PEFT</a><span>. Considering my limited GPU situation, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314" rel="">QLoRA</a><span> seemed like the way to go.</span></p><p><span>It turns out that writing my own script was a bad idea! There are a whole bunch of finicky little optimizations and options that range from </span><a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention" rel="">straightforward-if-you-know-about-them</a><span> to </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora#common-lora-parameters-in-peft" rel="">pretty obtuse without reading a research paper</a><span>. Nothing insurmountable, but it would take a long time to figure out yourself.</span></p><p><span>I ended up using </span><a href="https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl" rel="">axolotl</a><span>, which implements a ton of those optimizations out of the box and was much easier to get running (and running quickly). Their documentation is actually pretty decent, and I think is the right starting point for most people to fine-tune LLMs.</span></p><p><strong>A note on the models: </strong><span>Holy crap, LLMs are seriously large! The last time I trained models regularly was ~ 2019, when Bert had ~110 million parameters; now, the “small” LLMs are 70 times bigger than that. Models this large are fundamentally cumbersome. Weights being ~16GB makes storage a real concern; GPU memory is challenging even with methods like QLora. No wonder the best researchers are such a hot commodity; this is seriously challenging work at the largest scale.</span></p><p><strong>Start with evaluation first</strong><span>: One lesson from ML of old that I don’t think has been adopted enough among the prompt engineering wizards: you should always build a good evaluation before starting your experiments. Here, evaluation was pretty easy (hold out some full drafts from the training data and check if the model picks the same card as the human on the holdout data), but having a good evaluation set made reasoning about fine-tuning much more straightforward.</span></p><p><strong>Some criteria for language models are hard to define: </strong><span>The “pick the right card” task is pretty easy to define for Magic drafts, but there are some fuzzier things that I would like the final model to do, too:</span></p><ul><li><p>When it makes different picks, they should be justifiable</p></li><li><p>It would be nice if the model could give a reasonable explanation for “why” it made a pick</p></li></ul><p><span>Each of those is much harder to define, and I ended up testing them with the “eye test” by going through a bunch of examples, but this was slow. FWIW, </span><strong>GPT-4 is better at making less “weird” picks and better at justifying its choices than the fine-tuned smaller models.</strong></p><p>My two biggest takeaways from this experiment:</p><ul><li><p>Fine tuning on new data can be remarkably effective, easily surpassing GPT-4 + in-context learning on both accuracy and cost. </p></li><li><p>Fine tuning is a fundamentally experimental process to get “right”, and doing it well is a specialized skillset (and in particular, a skillset that is harder to learn than prompt engineering).</p></li></ul><p>In terms of how the bots actually feel as drafters?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>An essential means of survival for the majority, every year work costs the lives of almost three million people worldwide. And of those deaths, almost 800,000 are due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2022-06-20/the-four-day-working-week-theyd-have-to-pay-me-double-to-go-back-to-the-old-schedule.html">working more than 55 hours a week.</a> These are some of the main conclusions of the study <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank"><i>A call for healthier and safer work environments</i></a>, conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and published on Sunday, November 26. Of the 2.96 million deaths, 2.6 million are due to diseases derived from employment such as circulatory problems, cancer, and respiratory diseases. The remaining 330,000 are related to work accidents.</p><p>However, the number of deaths at work is not growing at the same rate as the population. In other words, proportionally fewer people die due to their employment now than at the beginning of the century. While deaths resulting from work have increased by 12% from 2000 to 2019 (reference data from the ILO study), the working population has increased by 26% in the same period. “Diagnostic tools have improved substantially in the last two decades, contributing to an increase in detected cases,” the report states.</p><p>The ILO study, prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), relates these deaths to the most common risks at work. The one that causes the most deaths (744,942) is exposure to long working hours of over 55 hours a week. The other risks that cause the most deaths include exposure to gases and smoke (450,381), work-related injuries (363,283), exposure to asbestos (209,481), silica (42,258), substances that cause asthma (29,641), solar ultraviolet radiation (17,936), diesel engine exhaust fumes (14,728), arsenic (7,589), and nickel (7,301) according to the figures for 2016.</p><p>The study also relates these risks to the time they cost workers (disability-adjusted life years, or DALYS). The risk that costs workers the most years of life are work-related injuries (26.44 million), followed by exposure to work days of more than 55 hours (23.26), ergonomic factors (12.27), and exposure to smoke and gases (10.86). The report gives more details: “The rate of trachea, bronchus and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-10-05/joaquin-mosquera-oncologist-the-big-obstacle-in-lung-cancer-is-not-having-screening-to-get-ahead-of-the-disease.html">lung cancers</a> attributable to occupational exposure to chromium doubled between 2000 and 2016. Mesothelioma attributable to asbestos exposure has risen by 40%. The rate of non-melanoma skin cancer increased by over 37% between 2000 and 2020. On the other hand, deaths due to exposure to asthmagens [asthma triggers] and particulate matter, gases, and fumes decreased by over 20%.”</p><p>In relation to specific diseases, the ILO indicates that 32.4% of deaths at work are due to circulatory problems, 27.5% to cancer, 14.3% to respiratory diseases, 11.3% to injuries, 7.2% to infectious diseases, 3% to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-11-27/can-asthma-be-cured.html">asthma,</a> 2.9% to neuropsychiatric conditions, 0.95% to genitourinary problems, 0.94% to digestive diseases and 0. 15% for other reasons. According to the report, more than 13 million people around the world live with a visual impairment caused by their work.</p><p>The report highlights that employment-related deaths represent 6.7% of all deaths recorded globally. This impact differs by region. The highest proportion was in Africa (7.4%), Asia and the Pacific (7.1%), and Oceania (6.5%). The proportion is lower in Europe and America, but the ILO does not provide the specific data, nor does it provide the information by country, although it will soon distribute this information in an expansion of this study. The ILO highlights agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining, construction, and manufacturing as the most dangerous sectors, and also focuses on the informal economy, in which employees lack “a stable or regular income and adequate legal or social protections.” Likewise, it points out that there are many more work-related deaths among men (51.4 per 100,000 adults of working age) than among women (17.2 per 100,000).</p><p>In addition to the global tragedy of work-related deaths, the ILO estimates that “395 million workers worldwide suffered non-fatal workplace injuries,” the organization states.</p><p><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>Sign up</i></a><i> for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/">https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38532167">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>This blog post is going to be a cursory overview of the internals iMessage, as I’ve discovered during my work on <a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush"><code>pypush</code></a>, an open source project that reimplements iMessage.</p>

<p>I gloss over specific technical details in the pursuit of brevity and clarity. If you would like to see how things are specifically implemented, check out the <a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush"><code>pypush</code> repository</a> as I mentioned above. It’s a pretty cool project, if I do say so myself. Make sure to check it out!</p>

<p>If you still end up with any questions, feel free to ask me in the <a href="https://discord.gg/BVvNukmfTC"><code>pypush</code> Discord</a></p>

<h3 id="the-foundational-layer">the foundational layer</h3>
<p>One of the most foundational components of iMessage is Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). You might have encountered this before, as it is the <em>same service</em> that is used by applications on the App Store to receive realtime notifications and updates, even while the app is closed.</p>

<p>However, what you probably <em>didn’t</em> know about APNs is that it is <em>bidirectional</em>. That’s right, APNs can be used to send push notifications as well as receive them. You can probably already tell where this is going, right?</p>

<p>Internally, after a device connects to APNs it will receive a “push token”. This token can be used to route notifications to that specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This token is technically different then the token you receive when using the <code>application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code> API. That token is scoped for per-app use, and is requested using the bundle ID of the application. However, it is basically used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>When sending push notifications to a device, you also need to specify the <em>topic</em> a message is for. This usually looks like a Bundle ID, and for iMessage it’s <code>com.apple.madrid</code>. When a device connects to APNs, it sends a filter message instructing the server on which messages it wants delivered to it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The APNs server is also known as the APNs <em>Courier</em>. The filter message includes several lists of topics, for each of the different possible states. It may want a topic to be <code>enabled</code>, <code>opertunistic</code>, <code>paused</code>, or <code>disabled</code></p>

<p>APNs is not only used for the actual message delivery part of iMessage. Using a pseudo-HTTP layer on top of APNs, IDS (which will be explained in a moment) can send queries and receive responses over APNs as well.</p>

<p>One tricky note that I will mention is that in order to connect to APNs, you need a client certificate issued by the Albert activation server.</p>

<h3 id="the-keyserver">the keyserver</h3>
<p>The next piece of this puzzle is IDS. As far as I can figure out, this stands for IDentity Services, though I don’t think there is any official confirmation on that.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also see it referred to as ESS. This is confusing because the APNs topic <em>FaceTime</em> uses is specifically called <code>com.apple.ess</code>. Moving on…</p>

<p>IDS is used as a keyserver for iMessage, as well as a few other services like FaceTime. Remember, iMessage is E2E encrypted, so the public keys of each participant must be exchanged securely.</p>

<p>The first step in registering for IDS is getting an authentication token. This requires giving the API your Apple ID Username and Password.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As 2FA is now standard, it had to be retrofitted into the IDS API. There are 2 options for this: the legacy option, in which a 2FA code is directly appended to the password, and the “GrandSlam” option. In the GrandSlam option, “Anisette data” is used to prove you are the same device and thus do not need to enter the 2FA code again. You then receive a Password Equivalent Token (PET) which can be used as if it was the password + 2FA code.</p>

<p>After one has gotten an authentication token, it must be immediately exchanged for a longer lived authentication certificate. This certificate allows registering with IDS, but it is not yet enough to perform key lookups.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important step of the IDS setup process is <em>registration</em>. This is where public encryption and signing keys are uploaded to the keyserver, as well as various other “client data” about what features the device supports.</p>

<p>When making an IDS registration request, a binary blob called “validation data” is required. This is essentially Apple’s verification mechanism to make sure that non-Apple devices cannot use iMessage.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> In order to generate the “validation data”, pieces of information about the device such as its serial number, model, and disk UUID are used. This means that not all validation data can be treated equivalently: just like with Hackintoshes, the account age and “score” determine if an invalid serial can be used, or if you get the “customer code” error.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The binary that generates this “validation data” is highly obfuscated. <code>pypush</code> sidesteps this issue by using a custom mach-o loader and the Unicorn Engine to emulate an obfuscated binary. <code>pypush</code> also bundles device properties such as the serial number in a file called data.plist, which it feeds to the emulated binary.</p>

<p>After registering with IDS, you will receive an “identity keypair”. This keypair can then be used to perform public key lookups.</p>

<p>When performing a lookup, you provide the account(s) that you would like to look up, and receive a list of “identities”. Each of these identities corresponds to a device registered on the account, and includes important details such as its public key, push token, and session token.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Session tokens are necessary to send messages to a device. They essentially prove that you made a recent lookup, because the session token expires. Session tokens cannot be shared, as they can only be used by the account that performed the lookup request.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption">message encryption</h3>
<p>Now, we’ve setup the basics of iMessage. We have enough that we can look up the public keys of another user, as well as publish our own. Now we just need to put it together with APNs to send and receive messages!</p>

<p>In order to receive messages, one simply filters the APNs connection to <code>com.apple.madrid</code> and sends the active state packet.</p>

<p>Depending on which capabilities you advertised in your IDS registration, as well as the iOS version of the sending device, you may receive messages in the legacy (pre-iOS 13) <code>pair</code> encryption format, or in the new <code>pair-ec</code> format. While the <code>pair</code> format is much more documented and easier to implement, it does not provide forward secrecy using “pre-keys” (similar to Signal) as the new <code>pair-ec</code> format does.</p>

<p>You can then decrypt the message as described in several papers, and as implemented in <code>pypush</code>. Verifying the message signature is optional, but is obviously important if you intend your client to be secure.</p>

<p>Sending messages is pretty much the inverse to receiving them. Keep in mind that you can chose to individually send out messages to each recipient, or you can bundle all the different recipients and their respective encrypted payloads into a giant bundle, which APNs will split up for you.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to keep in mind is that message are delivered to all participants in a conversation, <em>including the other devices on your own account</em>.</p>

<p>One more thing to keep in mind that is often overlooked when sending messages is that the AES key is not entirely random: it is tagged with an HMAC. Your message will fail to decrypt on newer devices if you use an entirely random AES key.</p>

<p>And that’s pretty much it! As I mentioned, this blog post is designed to give you a good idea of how the iMessage protocol fits together, so that you can explore the <code>pypush</code> code, not directly explain every technical detail.</p>

At Beeper, we believe that it is critical for you to be able to trust the software that you use, especially something as important and sensitive as your chat app. We work to earn and keep your trust in three ways:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Transparency - since we started Beeper 3 years ago, we’ve been taking opportunities like this to explain how Beeper works. We have a proud history of building products, like Pebble, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi" rel="">stand</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bradtgmurray" rel="">publicly</a><span> behind our work.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Open source - each major piece of software that we’ve built to interact with other chat networks is open source at </span><a href="http://github.com/beeper" rel="">github.com/beeper</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>Privacy and security-aligned business model - we make great software and charge a small subscription fee. Simple as that. No ads. Your data stays private.</p></li></ol><p>Read the entire post for the full story. TLDR: the following features of Beeper Mini ensure that all communication is encrypted and secure.</p><ul><li><p>All messages are end-to-end encrypted before being sent. Beeper (and Apple) cannot see your messages.</p></li><li><p>Encryption keys never leave your device.</p></li><li><p>Beeper Mini connects directly to Apple servers. There is no Mac server relay, like other apps.</p></li><li><p>No Apple ID is required. Beeper does not have access to your Apple account.</p></li><li><p>Your contact list never leaves your device.</p></li></ul><p><span>Don’t believe this is possible? Try the </span><a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush" rel="">open-source Python proof of concept</a><span> on your own computer to see for yourself. Security researchers are invited to verify all claims that we make, see appendix below.</span></p><p><span>Beeper Mini works differently than Beeper Cloud in important ways that increase your privacy and security. Beeper Mini is a standalone Android app. It does not require a cloud server to send and receive messages. It also implements </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/sec70e68c949/web" rel="">Apple’s end-to-end encryption protocol</a><span> natively within the Android app itself. All messages are end-to-end encrypted before they are transmitted directly from your device to Apple servers. Learn more about iMessage encryption on </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/guide/security/sec70e68c949/web" rel="">Apple Platform Security</a><span> page.</span></p><p>This is now possible because the iMessage protocol and encryption have been reverse engineered by jjtech, a security researcher. Leveraging this research, Beeper Mini implements the iMessage protocol locally within the app. All messages are sent and received by Beeper Mini Android app directly to Apple’s servers. The encryption keys needed to encrypt these messages never leave your phone. Neither Beeper, Apple, nor anyone except the intended recipients can read your messages or attachments. Beeper does not have access to your Apple credentials.</p><p><span>We built Beeper Mini by analyzing the traffic sent between the native iMessage app and Apple’s servers, and rebuilding our own app that sends the same requests and understands the same responses. Learn more by reading jjtech’s blog post, </span><a href="https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/" rel="">iMessage Explained</a><span>, and his proof-of-concept </span><a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush" rel="">Python implementation on Github</a><span>. Anyone can download this code, run it on any computer that supports Python, login to their iMessage account, and send and receive iMessage protocol messages. No Apple hardware required.</span></p><p><span>Another change is that Beeper Mini does not use the </span><a href="http://matrix.org/" rel="">Matrix</a><span> protocol, encryption or code like Beeper Cloud. It is a completely new codebase, versus our first Android app, which was a fork of </span><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android" rel="">Element</a><span>. In the future, we are planning to add Matrix network support back in, along with support for the 15 other chat networks in Beeper Cloud. Read more about </span><a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-cloud-and-product-roadmap" rel="">our roadmap</a><span>.</span></p><p>When you first start the Beeper Mini app and sign in with Google, a registration request is sent to our Beeper API Server. This service only exists to verify your subscription status, as well as give our support team the information they need to debug any issues that you may be running into (including your name and email address). No iMessage credentials or messages are transmitted through these servers, which are for Beeper Mini account management only.</p><p>After that, you are prompted to allow notifications, which sends a push token to Beeper Push Notification service, which enables our servers to send push notifications to your Android device. These push notifications do not contain the contents of messages.</p><p>Next, you are prompted to grant contact list and SMS permission access.</p><ul><li><p>Contact list access is used to match phone numbers to contact names, and display profile pictures. Your contact list is never sent to Beeper servers.</p></li><li><p>SMS access is used to send an SMS text message from your number to Apple’s “Gateway” service. The gateway sends a response via SMS, and the contents from that SMS response are sent to Apple to register your phone number as a blue bubble. Your SMS chat history is also used to determine if any of your recent SMS chats were with people who have iPhones. If so, these chats are shown in the inbox.</p></li></ul><p>It’s at this point that the app generates encryption keys that are used for end-to-end encrypted messaging. The public key is sent to Apple servers, and the private keys are stored in the Android device local filesystem. Beeper Mini is now signed in.</p><p>Optionally, you may also sign in to your Apple ID to enable sending/receiving from your email address. This will also enable you to send and receive messages from other Apple devices like iPad or Macs. The Apple ID login sends your username, password and a 2-factor code using encrypted HTTPS requests directly to Apple servers.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png" width="1456" height="1082" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1082,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9dd427a-aca1-4932-8f94-4376bb7a522a_2000x1486.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Apple’s iMessage protocol works over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service" rel="">Apple Push Notification service</a><span>, which most developers would be familiar as the service that allows them to send push notifications to their iOS applications. For iMessage protocol, all messaging traffic flows over this service in both directions, encrypted with keys generated locally on each device. Beeper Mini connects to APNs over TCP, using the credentials generated during the login process.</span></p><p>A persistent connection to APNs is needed to be notified of new incoming messages in real-time. On an iPhone, an APNs connection is maintained by the operating system, and connected at all times. In Beeper Mini, the connection can only be maintained when the app is running, since Android does not support APNs natively.</p><p>To work around this limitation, we built Beeper Push Notification service (BPNs). BPNs connects to Apple’s servers on your behalf when Beeper Mini Android app isn’t running. We can do this while preserving user privacy thanks to Apple separating the credentials needed to connect to APNs to send and receive content (the “push” credentials) and the keys needed to encrypt and decrypt messages (the “identity” keys). Push credentials can be shared securely with the Beeper Push Notification service, and BPNs can connect to APNs on your behalf. Whenever BPNs receives an encrypted message that it won’t be able to decrypt, it simply disconnects from APNs and sends an FCM push notification to wake up the Android app, which then connects to APNs, downloads, decrypts and processes the incoming message. BPNs can only tell when a new message is waiting for you - it does not have credentials to see or do anything else.</p><p>BPNs will be notified when you receive a message, but without the encryption keys it can’t decrypt anything BPNs receives. Also, without the identity credentials, BPNs can’t send messages on your behalf. If you don’t mind not receiving real-time push notifications for new messages, your BPNs can be disabled entirely by going to Settings → Manage Connection → Enable Push.</p><p>When you create a new chat, the phone number or email address of your intended recipient is transmitted to Apple servers. If the contact is on iMessage, a public key is returned.</p><p>Sending messages is even simpler. When you hit send, the message is encrypted with the public keys of the intended recipients and sent directly to Apple servers via an SSL encrypted TCP connection over APNs.</p><p>Beeper Mini connects to a few other services as part of its operation. We use a self-hosted installation of Rudderstack (https://rudderstack.beeper-tools.com) for analytics and diagnostic events, which we use for improving the app but can be disabled in Settings → Preferences →Share Diagnostics. We use OneSignal to send education and account related push notifications, and RevenueCat to help integrate Google Play subscriptions.</p><p>Other than that, that’s it! No other servers or services are used. Beeper Mini keeps your messaging secure by keeping all messaging credentials, keys, messages and media local to your phone, and only sends them directly to Apple’s servers after encrypting them with iMessage’s end-to-end encryption algorithm.</p><p>We value, actually, we treasure feedback. If you run into a bug or have a feature request, there’s a button in-app to report a problem. We read every single report.</p><p><strong><br><span>Brad Murray and Eric Migicovsky</span><br></strong><span>Beeper cofounders</span></p><p><span>To write this blog post, we performed a red team analysis on our own app. We made extensive use of the excellent </span><a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" rel="">mitmproxy</a><span> project to capture the network traffic coming from a real phone running a modified version of the Beeper Mini client. A modified version was needed for this analysis in order to disable certificate pinning, so that the Beeper Mini Android app would accept being connected to mitmproxy instead of only accepting Apple’s certificates for that connection. If researchers would like a copy of this version of Beeper Mini (with cert pinning disabled) to perform a similar analysis, please contact us at </span><a href="mailto:security@beeper.com" rel="">security@beeper.com</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Below is a capture of the requests that we make with Apple’s servers over HTTPS when logging into iMessage with your phone number. We first register with a service named </span><code>albert.apple.com</code><span>, which sets up our “push” credentials and allows us to connect to APNS. We then make two requests to get the number we need to send an SMS to register our phone number which is different for each carrier (This capture was taken with a device registered with Rogers, a Canadian cell phone carrier 🇨🇦). Finally, we take the contents of the response SMS (not shown here) and send it to </span><code>identity.ess.apple.com</code><span>, registering our account with iMessage and generating the “identity” credentials we’ll use to send and receive.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png" width="1456" height="266" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:266,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b45018a-3063-49b5-a572-afdb7b97a62d_2000x365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Optionally, you can also register your Apple ID with Beeper Mini as well, as shown in this capture.

Registering these together in the same call links them together, allowing any other device that you’re logged in with your Apple ID to send and receive with both your Apple ID emails and your phone number.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png" width="1456" height="320" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F569867c7-ea40-441b-bbf2-82a1ad9c5b7d_2000x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Next, a capture of the keys shared with the Beeper Push Notification sevice (hostname </span><code>imux.beeper.com</code><span>).

		<p>My server is chugging hard right now with a huge influx of traffic, so I lightly rearchitected this to still show the rest of the article below.</p>
		<p>- Lexi, Dec 5, 10:51 AM EST</p>
		
		
			<p>This part of the page is still loading while I wait for the above traceroute to load.</p>

		<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>To reach this website, your computer sent some packets across the Internet. If we’re curious what that path was, we can run a tool to generate a <em>traceroute</em> — a rough list of every server your packets touched to reach their destination. To build this website (<a href="https://github.com/hackclub/how-did-i-get-here">source code on GitHub</a>), I wrote my own traceroute program called ktr (<a href="https://github.com/kognise/ktr">also open source</a>) that can stream results in real time while concurrently looking up interesting information about each hop.</p>
<p>How does ktr work? Let’s start with a simplified explanation of Internet routing.</p>
<p>Starting with the source device, each computer that handles a packet has to choose the best device to forward it to — I will explain how these routing decisions are made in a bit. Assuming everything works correctly, the packet will eventually reach a router that knows how to send it directly to its destination.</p>
<p>My traceroute implementation uses a protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP</a>. ICMP was designed specifically for sending diagnostic information around the Internet, and, helpfully, almost every Internet-connected device speaks it. Interestingly, ICMP packets have a “TTL” (time to live) field. This isn’t actually a “time” as implied by a name — it’s a countdown! Every time a router forwards an ICMP packet along, it’s supposed to decrement the TTL number. When the TTL hits zero, the router should stop forwarding it along and instead send an error message to the packet’s source IP saying that the packet has reached its maximum number of hops.</p>
<p>We can take advantage of this TTL feature! To do a traceroute, we can send a bunch of ICMP packets with increasingly large TTLs. The first packet with a TTL of 1 will error on the first device it reaches, and so on, until we hopefully get an error back from every routing device that touched the packet. These error packets include diagnostic information like the IP address of the device that sent the error, allowing us to trace your packets’ rough path across the Internet.</p>
<h3>Frontend Fun</h3>
<p>This page will work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled. From the browser’s perspective, this website just loaded slowly. From your perspective, a traceroute magically loaded in.</p>
<p>When you loaded this website, my program received a HTTP request coming from your IP address. It immediately started running a traceroute to your IP. Then, the server started responding to the HTTP request: it sent the beginning of this web page, and then it left the connection open. As ktr, my traceroute program, gave the server updates on your traceroute, it rendered the relevant HTML and sent it to your computer. When the traceroute finished, the server generated all the text and sent the rest of the website along the line before closing out the connection.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the traceroute progressively loads in lines above the bottom line. Web pages can only load forward. Since I didn’t want to use any JavaScript, I did the hackiest thing possible: every time I update the traceroute display, I embed a CSS block that hides the previous iteration! Since browsers render CSS as the page is loading, this made it look like the traceroute was being edited over time.</p>
<h3>Front to Back, Back to Front</h3>
<p>My claim that this website’s traceroute was the path your packets took to reach my server was a bit of a white lie. To calculate that, I would’ve had to be able to run a traceroute to my server <em>from your computer.</em> Instead, I ran the traceroute from my server to your computer and just reversed it. That’s also why the traceroute at the top seemingly loads in reverse order.</p>
<p>Does running a “reverse traceroute” sacrifice accuracy? A little, actually.</p>
<p>As I said when describing Internet routing, each device a packet traverses makes a decision about where to send the packet next until it reaches its final destination. If you send a packet in the other direction, the devices might make different routing decisions… and if one device makes one different decision, the rest of the path will certainly be different.</p>
<p>This reverse traceroute is still helpful. The paths will be roughly the same, likely differing only in terms of which specific routers see your packet.</p>
<h3>So, What Are All Those Networks?</h3>
<p>This site began with talk about the “networks” you traversed to reach my server. What, concretely, are these networks?</p>
<p>Each network, also called an autonomous system (AS), is a collection of routers and servers that are privately connected to each other and generally owned by the same company. The owners of these autonomous systems decide the shape of the Internet by choosing which other autonomous systems to connect to. Internet traffic travels across autonomous systems that have “peering arrangements” with each other.</p>
<p>The Internet is often described as an open, almost anarchistic network connecting computers, some owned by people like you and me, and some owned by companies. In reality, the Internet is a network of corporation-owned networks, access and control to which is governed by financial transactions and dripping with bureaucracy.</p>
<p>If you want your own autonomous system, you can apply for an autonomous system number (ASN) with one of the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry">regional Internet registries (RIRs)</a> that govern the Internet’s numbers. Be warned, they probably won’t listen to you if you aren’t backed by a company or you don’t have enough points of presence on the Internet. Just like we use IP addresses to identify—</p>
<p><em>Wait, what exactly do IP addresses identify? Uh… let’s say they represent devices with Internet access.</em></p>
<p>… Just like we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</a> to identify devices with Internet access, we use ASNs to identify the networks of the Internet. <span>Those are the numbers like “AS63949” in the traceroute from the start.</span></p>
<h3>Notes on WHOIS</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I wrote a cool traceroute program myself is so I could pull information on which autonomous systems own the IPs along your traceroute. A couple of organizations try to keep track of which ASes contain which IP addresses. Many of them let you perform ASN lookups using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">WHOIS protocol</a>, so I wrote a small client to parse the responses from some servers I arbitrarily selected.</p>
<p>I then used this cool database called <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/">PeeringDB</a> to figure out the companies behind the ASNs; PeeringDB has information on about 1/3rd of all autonomous systems. I used all of this information, alongside a couple hundred lines of if statements, to generate the text about network traversal for you.</p>
<p>WHOIS is actually an... interesting protocol to make a parser for. It turns out that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3912/">WHOIS protocol specification</a> doesn't actually specify much. It specifies that you should make a TCP connection to the WHOIS server, send whatever you want to look up, and the server will send back some info and then terminate the connection. That’s all.</p>
<p>And yet, a lot of WHOIS servers will respond with structured-seeming information:</p>
<img src="https://how-did-i-get-here.net/whois-screenshot.png" width="942" height="716" alt="Screenshot of a Terminal app. Command was run: whois 198.58.104.130. Results are structured text, starting with a percent sign and the text &quot;IANA WHOIS server.&quot;">

<p>It turns out this structure is made up by the WHOIS server administrator and there just happen to be some shared conventions between servers. Even with the level of structure, the fields you want often show up with different names (origin? originas?) or even under multiple places at once.</p>
<p>My “parser” ended up as less of a parser and more as a lightweight simulator of how I, a human, might read through WHOIS results to find the ASN I need.</p>
<h2>BGP</h2>
<p>When you send a packet across the Internet, routers sitting at the borders where these networks connect decide which network to send your packet to next, until it reaches the network that contains the destination device.</p>
<p>These border routers talk to each other about which networks they’re able to connect to using a protocol called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).</p>
<p>BGP is the protocol that gives the Internet its shape, and you <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/10/05/tools-to-look-at-bgp-routes/">can’t directly speak it yourself</a>.</p>
<h3>History Time</h3>
<p>In 1969, the same year Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, a message was (partially) sent on a prototype of the ARPANET. Over the next 20 years, this “network of interconnected computers” thing got pretty popular and everyone wanted on the train. Various universities, government agencies, and a couple random companies started making networks of their computers left and right.</p>
<p>A couple of these organizations started connecting their networks together so they could share data more easily. The Internet as we know it didn’t exist yet, but these network interconnections were getting out of hand and there wasn’t a great standard for coordinating them. In 1989, engineers at Cisco and IBM published <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1105/">RFC 1105</a>, describing the first ever version of BGP.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years, interconnected-network people got really busy as “the Internet” rapidly became a thing. Just one year after the BGP v1 RFC, Cisco went public and brought a lot of money into the networking industry, the term “IANA” was first used to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">random guy</a> and his college department that were keeping track of numbers on the Internet, ARPANET shut down for good, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1163">BGP v2</a> was released.</p>
<p>In 1994, as the Internet-is-a-thing-now whirlwind was just beginning to calm, the final major version of BGP, v4, was specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1654">RFC 1654</a>. It was revised twice (in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1771">1995</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4271">2006</a>) and got some patches, but BGP v4 is still the protocol we use for choosing routes across the interconnected networks that make up the modern Internet.</p>
<h3>How Does This BGP Thing Work?</h3>
<p>Routers at the borders between autonomous systems (“border gateways”) keep a list of every <em>BGP route</em> they know about, called a <em>routing table</em>. Each BGP route specifies the path of ASNs that could be followed to reach an autonomous system that controls a certain collection of IP addresses.</p>
<p>These routes across the Internet are formed by <em>peering relationships</em> between autonomous systems. When the border gateways of two autonomous systems <em>peer</em>, they are typically agreeing to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Allow traffic to travel between the two routers, meaning BGP routes can go directly between the two ASNs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep each other up to date about the BGP routes they know about.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example time! Router A of AS0001 is physically connected with Router B of AS0002 and they want to peer with each other. They send BGP messages to each other to establish a <em>BGP session</em>. Router A now knows that it should go through Router B for any BGP route that starts with AS0002, and vice versa.</p>
<img src="https://how-did-i-get-here.net/networks-example.svg" width="380" height="308" alt="A diagram of 3 networks. AS0001 is connected to AS0002, which is in turn connected to AS1234.">

<p>BGP peers share the routes they know about with each other in a process called <em>route advertisement</em>. In our above example, when Router A connects to Router B, it would tell Router B “hey, here are all the routes I know about, you can go through my ASN (and by extension, me) to reach all of them.” Router B adds all of those routes through Router A — so, starting with AS0001 — to its routing table. Whenever another one of Router A’s peers advertises a new route, Router A will advertise those forward to Router B.</p>
<p>AS0001 probably directly controls some IP addresses itself. Router A would advertise those to Router B as well. Router B would then, in turn, advertise those direct routes forward, telling <em>its</em> peers that AS0002 → AS0001 is a valid route to reach those IPs. Through this process of forwarding route advertisements to peers, BGP routes are propagated across the entire network of autonomous systems such that any border gateway hopefully knows one or multiple AS paths to reach any IP on the Internet.</p>
<p>To route a packet to a certain IP, a border gateway first searches its routing table for every route that would bring it to an AS that controls that IP. The router then picks the “best” route by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol#Route_selection_process">various heuristics</a> that include looking for the shortest path and weighing hardcoded preferences for or against certain autonomous systems. Finally, it routes the packet to the first AS in that path by sending it to that AS’s gateway router which it is peered with. That router, in turn, looks at its own routing table and makes its own decision about where to send the packet next.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>When you loaded this website, it used my custom traceroute program to run a traceroute to your public IP (<span>83.78.228.237</span>), stream that over HTTP, and then render a textual explanation of the traceroute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A traceroute depicts the path of routers traversed between two devices on the Internet. My particular implementation works by sending ICMP packets with increasing TTL fields.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These routers are in networks called autonomous systems. Routers on the edges of these ASes peer with each other using BGP. Border routers use BGP to share their routing tables with each other, and then use this knowledge to make routing decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>BGP peering sessions are created according to (often private) arrangements between the owners of autonomous systems. Since traffic can only pass between peered networks, these arrangements are the sole governor of reachability on the Internet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I was frustrated with the state of understanding on the structure of the Internet and sought to write a comprehensive, interactive article covering its history and politics through the lens of protocols. However, I got caught up in a lot of complexity in life and, facing tight deadlines, didn't have the time to reach the lofty goals I had set for myself.</p>
<p>Thanks to the encouragement of my friends at Hack Club, I made the best out of what I had. “Better to ship a tiny raft than never ship that cruise yacht!” If nothing else, I got to make use of the sick ass traceroute program that powers the shiniest part of this site :)</p>
<p>I hope this serves as another fun, informative, and well-crafted thing on the web that can last, be shared around, and inspire people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="postArticle"><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post was the subject of a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38531104" rel="noopener">Hacker News thread</a>.</p><p>A somewhat obscure guideline for developers of U.S. government websites may be about to accelerate the long, sad decline of Mozilla’s Firefox browser. There already are plenty of large entities, both public and private, whose websites lack proper support for Firefox; and that will get only worse in the near future, because the ’fox’s auburn paws are perilously close to the lip of the proverbial slippery slope.</p><p>The <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" rel="noopener">U.S. Web Design System</a> (USWDS) provides a comprehensive set of standards which guide those who build the U.S. government’s many websites. Its <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/developers/" rel="noopener">documentation for developers</a> borrows a “2% rule” from its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service" rel="noopener">British counterpart</a>:</p><blockquote><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we officially support any browser above 2% usage as observed by <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" rel="noopener">analytics.usa.gov</a>.</p></blockquote><p>At this writing, that analytics page shows the following browser traffic for the previous ninety days:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>Share</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome</td><td>49%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari</td><td>34.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Edge</td><td>8.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox</td><td>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari (in-app)</td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung Internet</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Android Webview</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>1%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I am personally unaware of any serious reason to believe that Firefox’s numbers will improve soon. Indeed, for the web as a whole, they’ve been declining consistently for years, as this chart shows:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_600,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_320,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_640,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_960,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_1280,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_1600,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/brycewray-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_1920,x_0,z_01/2023-11-30_screen-cap_StatCounter-browser-2009-01--2023-11_edited_2318x1158.png 1920w" alt="Chart of browser share for January, 2009, through November, 2023" title="Chart of browser share for January, 2009, through November, 2023" width="2318" height="1158" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 100vw, 50vw" data-pagefind-ignore=""></p><p>Chrome <em>vs.</em> Firefox <em>vs.</em> Safari for January,&nbsp;2009, through November,&nbsp;2023.<br>Image: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/" rel="noopener">StatCounter</a>.</p><p>Firefox peaked at 31.82% in November, 2009 — and then began its long slide in almost direct proportion to the rise of Chrome. The latter shot from 1.37% use in January, 2009, to its own peak of 66.34% in September, 2020, since falling back to a “measly” 62.85% in the very latest data.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>While these numbers reflect worldwide trends, the U.S.-specific picture isn’t really better. In fact, because the iPhone is so popular in the U.S. — which is obvious from what you see on that aforementioned government analytics page — Safari pulls large numbers that also hurt Firefox.</p><p>In my days in tech marketing, we used to worry about how a dominant competitor would take “shelf space” in those large stores where we wanted visibility for our goods and their accompanying point-of-purchase brochures. (Remember point-of-purchase literature, fellow oldsters?) Well, Firefox is quickly losing “web space,” thanks to a perfect storm that’s been kicked up by the dominance of Chrome, the popularity of mobile devices that run Safari by default, and many corporate and government IT shops’ insistence that their users rely on only Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge browser while toiling away each day.</p><p>With such a continuing free-fall, Firefox is inevitably nearing the point where USWDS will remove it, like Internet Explorer before it, from the list of supported browsers.</p><p>“So what?” you may wonder. “That’s just for web developers in the U.S. government. It doesn’t affect any other web devs.”</p><p>Actually, it very well could. Here’s how I envision the dominoes falling:</p><ol><li>Once Firefox slips below the 2% threshold in the government’s visitor analytics, USWDS tells government web devs they don’t have to support Firefox anymore.</li><li>When that word gets out, it spreads quickly to not only the front-end dev community but also the corporate IT departments for whom some web devs work. Many corporations do a lot of business with the government and, thus, whatever the government does from an IT standpoint is going to influence what corporations do.</li><li>Corporations see this change as an opportunity to lower dev costs and delivery times, in that it provides an excuse to remove <em>some</em> testing (and, in rare cases, specific coding) from their development workflow.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li></ol><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and just like that, in less time than you might think, Firefox — the free/open-source browser that was supposed to save the world from the jackboots of Internet Explorer (which had killed Firefox’s ancestor, Netscape Navigator) — is reduced to permanent status as a shrinking part of the fractured miscellany that litters the bottom of browser market-share charts.</p><p>I surely hope I’m wrong about this, but I fear I’m not.</p><hr><p>Nearly five years ago, as the news broke that Microsoft had decided to move its Edge browser to the Blink engine that also powers Google Chrome, I <a href="https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2018/12/on-edge/">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Supporting multiple browser engines — even if there is a Really Big Dog engine among them that’s about to get even bigger — ain’t always fun, but it goes with the territory; and I firmly believe it will continue to do so, especially for sites that are commercial in nature.</p></blockquote><p>That firm belief remains unchanged, but the meaning of the “multiple browser engines” part is in serious danger of significant change. Unless something dramatically reverses Firefox’s trends, the ’fox could soon be whimpering its way down an ugly, slippery slope to irrelevance.</p><p data-pagefind-ignore="">Latest commit (<a href="https://github.com/brycewray/hugo-site/commit/b1f9fd53f6e9e605008fe0290c7aa21af4e85506" title="Latest commit for this page" rel="noopener"><code>b1f9fd53</code></a>) for page file:<br>2023-12-05 at 9:00:27 AM CST.<br><a href="https://github.com/brycewray/hugo-site/commits/main/content/posts/2023/11/firefox-brink/index.md" title="This page’s commit history">Page history</a></p><contact-button data-pagefind-ignore="" aria-label="Link for generating email to reply to this website post"><span></span><span>Reply via email</span></contact-button></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-68165">

	<div>

		
		<p>Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>
<p>Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we’re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/surveillance_as_1.html">become the business model</a> of the internet, and there’s no reasonable way for us to opt out of it.</p>
<p>Spying is another matter. It has long been possible to tap someone’s phone or put a bug in their home and/or car, but those things still require someone to listen to and make sense of the conversations. Yes, spyware companies like <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group">NSO Group</a> help the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/us-state-department-officials-iphones-hacked-nso-group-spyware">hack into people’s phones</a>, but <em>someone</em> still has to sort through all the conversations. And governments like China could <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/18/1054452/china-censors-social-media-comments/">censor social media posts</a> based on particular words or phrases, but that was coarse and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/08/1141335778/china-zero-covid-lockdown-protests-online-xi-jinping-censorship">easy to bypass</a>. Spying is limited by the need for human labor.</p>
<p>AI is about to change that. <a href="https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/best-ai-summarizers">Summarization is something</a> a modern generative AI system does well. Give it an hourlong meeting, and it will return a one-page summary of what was said. Ask it to search through millions of conversations and organize them by topic, and it’ll do that. Want to know who is talking about what? It’ll tell you.</p>
<p>The technologies aren’t perfect; some of them are pretty primitive. They miss things that are important. They get other things wrong. But so do humans. And, unlike humans, AI tools can be replicated by the millions and are improving at astonishing rates. They’ll get better next year, and even better the year after that. We are about to enter the era of mass spying.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance fundamentally changed the nature of surveillance. Because all the data is saved, mass surveillance allows people to conduct surveillance backward in time, and without even knowing whom specifically you want to target. Tell me where <em>this</em> person was last year. List all the red sedans that drove down <em>this</em> road in the past month. List all of the people who purchased all the ingredients for a pressure cooker bomb in the past year. Find me all the pairs of phones that were moving toward each other, turned themselves off, then turned themselves on again an hour later while moving away from each other (a sign of a secret meeting).</p>
<p>Similarly, mass spying will change the nature of spying. All the data will be saved. It will all be searchable, and understandable, in bulk. Tell me who has talked about a particular topic in the past month, and how discussions about that topic have evolved. Person A did something; check if someone told them to do it. Find everyone who is plotting a crime, or spreading a rumor, or planning to attend a political protest.</p>
<p>There’s so much more. To uncover an organizational structure, look for someone who gives similar instructions to a group of people, then all the people they have relayed those instructions to. To find people’s confidants, look at whom they tell secrets to. You can track friendships and alliances as they form and break, in minute detail. In short, you can know everything about what everybody is talking about.</p>
<p>This spying is not limited to conversations on our phones or computers. Just as cameras everywhere fueled mass surveillance, microphones everywhere will fuel mass spying. Siri and Alexa and “Hey Google” are already always listening; the conversations just aren’t being saved yet.</p>
<p>Knowing that they are under constant surveillance changes how people behave. They conform. They self-censor, with the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/jon-penney-on-the-chilling-effects-of-online-surveillance/">chilling effects that brings</a>. Surveillance facilitates social control, and spying will only make this worse. Governments around the world already use mass surveillance; they will engage in mass spying as well.</p>
<p>Corporations will spy on people. Mass surveillance ushered in the era of personalized advertisements; mass spying will supercharge that industry. Information about what people are talking about, their moods, their secrets—it’s all catnip for marketers looking for an edge. The tech monopolies that are currently keeping us all under constant surveillance won’t be able to resist collecting and using all of that data.</p>
<p>In the early days of Gmail, Google talked about using people’s Gmail content to serve them personalized ads. The company <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10434152">stopped doing it</a>, almost certainly because the keyword data it collected was so poor—and therefore not useful for marketing purposes. That will soon change. Maybe Google won’t be the first to spy on its users’ conversations, but once others start, they won’t be able to resist. Their true customers—their advertisers—will demand it.</p>
<p>We could limit this capability. We could prohibit mass spying. We could pass strong data-privacy rules. But we haven’t done anything to limit mass surveillance. Why would spying be any different?</p>

    <div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
          <p data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpkcr4d9001sdckw409u6h3f@published">Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu2z100083b6yhdps8ths@published">Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we’re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/surveillance_as_1.html">become the business model</a> of the internet, and there’s no reasonable way for us to opt out of it.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu31v00093b6ydyq3es74@published">Spying is another matter. It has long been possible to tap someone’s phone or put a bug in their home and/or car, but those things still require someone to listen to and make sense of the conversations. Yes, spyware companies like <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group">NSO Group</a> help the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/us-state-department-officials-iphones-hacked-nso-group-spyware">hack into people’s phones</a>, but <em>someone</em> still has to sort through all the conversations. And governments like China could <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/18/1054452/china-censors-social-media-comments/">censor social media posts</a> based on particular words or phrases, but that was coarse and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/08/1141335778/china-zero-covid-lockdown-protests-online-xi-jinping-censorship">easy to bypass</a>. Spying is limited by the need for human labor.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu33q000a3b6yz28ko6q2@published">A.I. is about to change that. <a href="https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/best-ai-summarizers">Summarization is something</a> a modern generative A.I. system does well. Give it an hourlong meeting, and it will return a one-page summary of what was said. Ask it to search through millions of conversations and organize them by topic, and it’ll do that. Want to know who is talking about what? It’ll tell you.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu35r000b3b6y6v9rv0ne@published">The technologies aren’t perfect; some of them are pretty primitive. They miss things that are important. They get other things wrong. But so do humans. And, unlike humans, A.I. tools can be replicated by the millions and are improving at astonishing rates. They’ll get better next year, and even better the year after that. We are about to enter the era of mass spying.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu37i000c3b6yvqq0igb7@published">Mass surveillance fundamentally changed the nature of surveillance. Because all the data is saved, mass surveillance allows people to conduct surveillance backward in time, and without even knowing whom specifically you want to target. Tell me where <em>this</em> person was last year. List all the red sedans that drove down <em>this</em> road in the past month. List all of the people who purchased all the ingredients for a pressure cooker bomb in the past year. Find me all the pairs of phones that were moving toward each other, turned themselves off, then turned themselves on again an hour later while moving away from each other (a sign of a secret meeting).</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/clpleu8du000d3b6yjhe475ye@published">Similarly, mass spying will change the nature of spying. All the data will be saved. It will all be searchable, and understandable, in bulk. Tell me who has talked about a particular topic in the past month, and how discussions about that topic have evolved. Person A did something; check if someone told them to do it. Find everyone who is plotting a crime, or spreading a rumor, or planning to attend a political protest.</p>

                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493695" id="428493695">Abstract</h2>
<section><p>Wikipedia is one of the most successful collaborative projects in history. It is the largest encyclopedia ever created, with millions of users worldwide relying on it as the first source of information as well as for fact-checking and in-depth research. As Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of its volunteer editors, its success might be particularly affected by toxic speech. In this paper, we analyze all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across the six most active language editions of Wikipedia to study the potential impact of toxicity on editors’ behavior. We find that toxic comments are consistently associated with reduced activity of editors, equivalent to 0.5–2 active days per user in the short term. This translates to multiple human-years of lost productivity, considering the number of active contributors to Wikipedia. The effects of toxic comments are potentially even greater in the long term, as they are associated with a significantly increased risk of editors leaving the project altogether. Using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that toxicity attacks on Wikipedia have the potential to impede the progress of the entire project. Our results underscore the importance of mitigating toxic speech on collaborative platforms such as Wikipedia to ensure their continued success.</p></section>                    
<div id="pgad385-box1"><p>While the prevalence of toxic speech online is well studied, its true impact on the productivity of online communities remains largely unexplored. In this study, we focus on Wikipedia, which as the largest and most-read online reference, serves as a vital source of knowledge for millions of users worldwide. By analyzing all comments made over 20 years on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across multiple language editions, we demonstrate that toxic speech is associated with a significant loss in the productivity of Wikipedia editors. These findings may have broad implications for large-scale collaborative projects and online communities, emphasizing the need to promote healthy and sustainable communication practices to protect crucial online information ecosystems and ensure their long-term success.</p></div>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493697" id="428493697" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s0">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wikipedia is arguably one of the most successful collaborative projects in history. It has become the largest and most-read reference work ever created, and it is currently the fifth most popular website on the Internet (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B1"></span>1). Millions of users worldwide rely on Wikipedia as their first source of information when encountering a new topic, for fact-checking and in-depth research (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B2"></span>2). Even if caution might be required when consulting less actively maintained pages (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B3"></span>3), numerous studies have shown that Wikipedia is a reliable source of information in areas ranging from political science (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B4"></span>4) to pharmacology (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B5"></span>5) and its accuracy is comparable to traditional encyclopedias (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B6"></span>6) and textbooks (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B7"></span>7).</p><p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Wikipedia’s success is that its content is exclusively created and curated by volunteer editors, known as Wikipedians. The English edition alone has more than 120,000 active editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B8"></span>8). However, this volunteer-driven model also makes Wikipedia susceptible to the inherent challenges associated with maintaining such a large online community (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B9"></span>9, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B10"></span>10). For example, it has been previously observed that Wikipedia is not free of conflict, particularly in the form of so-called edit wars (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B11"></span>11), which impose significant costs on the project (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B12"></span>12) and could negatively affect the quality of Wikipedia articles (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B13"></span>13).</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the impact of toxic comments directed toward editors on their activity. This aspect is less studied, but potentially not less important, as affected by toxic comments, Wikipedians might reduce their contributions or abandon the project altogether, threatening the success of the platform (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B14"></span>14).</p><p>Toxicity has been extensively studied on popular social media websites such as Twitter (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B15"></span>15, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B16"></span>16), Reddit (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B17"></span>17, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B18"></span>18), and similar platforms (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B19"></span>19, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B20"></span>20). However, much of these research focuses on automated toxicity detection and prevalence estimation rather than on evaluating its impact (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B21"></span>21). As an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia is often perceived as immune to toxicity and has a strict “No personal attacks” policy (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B22"></span>22). Despite that, toxic speech and harassment have been previously observed on the platform (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B23 pgad385-B24 pgad385-B25 pgad385-B26 pgad385-B27"></span>23–27). The effects of such behaviors on editors’ contributions are, however, not well understood nor well studied. The largest study to date relies on a voluntary opt-in survey of the 3,845 Wikipedians conducted in 2015 (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B24"></span>24). It reports that 20% of users witnessing harassment have stopped contributing for a while, 17% considered not contributing anymore and 5% stopped contributing at all.</p><p>In this paper, we analyzed all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of editors on the six most active language editions of Wikipedia (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian) to understand the potential impact of toxic speech on editors’ contributions (see Methods and materials section for our definition of toxic comments). User talk pages are a place for editors to communicate with each other either on more personal topics or to extend their discussion from an article’s talk page. The majority of toxic comments are left on user talk pages (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B28"></span>28).

To account for potential baseline change, we have matched editors that received a toxic comment with similarly active editors who received a nontoxic comment. We have separately studied if toxic comments increase the probability of editors leaving the project altogether. Finally, we have used an agent-based model to model the potential impact of an increased number of toxic comments on Wikipedia.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493706" id="428493706" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s1">Results</h2>

<p>To estimate the potential effect of a toxic comment, we compute the proportion of users who were active on day X before or after receiving a toxic comment (Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2). We find that, on average, editors are more active near the time when they receive a toxic comment, with a peak at 24 h prior to the comment. At this time point, more than <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn xmlns="">40</mn><mi mathvariant="normal" xmlns="">%</mi></math></span> of editors were active, as shown by the red line in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2a. This is a rather unsurprising observation since toxic comments are often made as a reaction to an edit made by a user and, thus, users are expected to be active around the time of a toxic comment. Note that if the timestamps around which the curve is centered are shuffled (black line in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2a) then this pattern disappears completely as expected.</p>                    <div data-id="pgad385-f2" data-content-id="pgad385-f2" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Fig. 2.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/2/12/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgad385/2/m_pgad385f2.jpeg?Expires=1704812577&amp;Signature=2fNieTHaIPTku2t6mpRvxIbQH7FsdxmzgpSc618hfT0gf4r9vSqljIraCoA4v8xy4wBRYtr1Rdk0rI1xC8ByOV7fDkpEP4M74b8zfTxX7kXYa~0RYqP2mi2gPDmGAr4-tIorIRb1NQALk~ijD0x304rrpjxpSxaNm3Ebscl3ejhdAvP756KrKhDZLYrprNgLfH3Zn7~KGqbrOVPnjTCAIdhqvlcHMcvnmCUNWDwAnp4fbwcH-DGhF3kGXGUE2nfaCpPLCaaBAZI1~G-bWJaDOsCi7FBAX6CHLiJ6gEQ5qWoE~pVVXbGR1XuT4DQ9SG9dNEEoiOURQex9fMl8aFWGEA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="After receiving a toxic comment, users become less active.

To rule out the possibility that this is due to a general drop in activity over time or a drop in activity after any comment, we select a control group of users who have received a nontoxic comment, and whose average activity in the 100 days before the comment is the same as the average activity of users who received a toxic comment (see Methods and materials section for details).</p><p>We observe a similar characteristic peak around the nontoxic comment, likely due to both toxic and nontoxic comments being reactions to a contribution made by an editor. However, in contrast to a toxic comment, a nontoxic comment does not lead to a significant decrease in activity (dashed and solid blue lines in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2b). Similar results hold for all six language editions that we have examined (Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F2"></span>2c–g).</p><p>We then estimate the lost activity associated with a toxic comment by computing the decrease in activity after a toxic comment, taking into account a potential baseline drop, i.e. by computing <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal" xmlns="">Δ</mi><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">After</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">toxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">−</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Before</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">toxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo><mo xmlns="">−</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">After</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">nontoxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">−</mo><msub xmlns=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Before</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">nontoxic</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>. We find that this loss is statistically significant for all language editions studied (Table <span id="jumplink-pgad385-T1"></span>1). We further explored the robustness of this result with respect to the toxicity threshold and potential filtering of users according to their activity. As expected, for higher toxicity thresholds, i.e. for more severely toxic comments, the effect is stronger (<span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/2/12/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgad385/2/pgad385_supplementary_data.pdf?Expires=1704812577&amp;Signature=d-s6BF9zZtNW0YtYo8mehCN1-eUtIRa8236kGZ1D6y4Oyx59aY10tBRtzXHl3cihdAtit8dZ7dBwyEe~VysBKn4vBGYy-gwqzit5D-IT1I6-cmeBEOaQwLNTCjw2AGwKdPTs1KA-stI9hGUB4BHmygndrSNDif-skuWQ-eTIMrIijDvwgO~eHg27ZAlBD0aXn6~K1gliVYgJtIoB-A0d~701nTIjSSXR8jbAuY~~-1zWLOUfkTsLOMyu0q5TAMetfNmQ1oU0AUfVikVZnQ17wk1RFpqzFHQUkEwab8MtC0om0HlAtjvUg65rv5vlK1wwy-AJyLkHSShIrsonaU6t6w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Supplementary Fig. S1</a></span>).

<p>As has been demonstrated above, toxic comments increase the likelihood of editors abandoning Wikipedia. If enough editors leave, this could potentially impede the progress of the project as a whole. In order to estimate the potential impact of toxic comments, we model users’ behaviors by varying the toxicity of the environment, ranging from a nontoxic environment, where the probability of a user leaving follows the empirically observed nontoxic probability distribution, <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">non</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math></span> (blue dots in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F3"></span>3), to a highly toxic environment, where the probability of leaving corresponds to an empirically observed toxic probability distribution, <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">tox</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math></span> (red dots in Fig. <span id="jumplink-pgad385-F3"></span>3). We also consider a potential attack targeted at new users. In this scenario, each user receives a toxic comment after their first and second contributions, e.g. their probability of leaving after the first and second contribution is defined by <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">tox</mi></mrow></mrow></msubsup></math>⁠</span>, and after that follows the empirically observed <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>P</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></math>⁠</span>.</p><p>For our modeling, we focus on a cohort of users who made their first contribution between the 4,000th and 6,000th day from the first recorded contribution to English Wikipedia in our dataset. We opted for this timeframe as it reflects Wikipedia’s current phase characterized by a relatively consistent number of active editors. This period follows the site’s initial exponential growth and a subsequent decline but comes before the anomalous increase in activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see Discussion section for details on these stages).</p><p>For our modeling, we employed an agent-based approach. Each day, agents (representing users) join Wikipedia and make their first contribution. The number of agents joining each day is equal to the actual count of first-time contributors to English Wikipedia on that particular day. After their first contribution, agents keep contributing, following a Poisson process, i.e. in such a way that the distance between two consecutive contributions, <em>D</em>, follows an exponential distribution: <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi xmlns="">D</mi><mo xmlns="">∼</mo><mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0" xmlns=""><mtext>Exp</mtext></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><mi xmlns="">λ</mi><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>, where <em>λ</em> is estimated from empirical data.

<p>We conducted a large-scale analysis, covering all comments made on user talk pages of the six most active language editions of Wikipedia over a period of 20 years, and found that toxic comments are associated with a decreased activity of editors who have received these comments and an increased risk of them leaving the project altogether. Additionally, via agent-based modeling, we showed that toxicity attacks on Wikipedia have the potential to impede the progress of the entire project.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is its relatively narrow scope, as it focuses solely on the association between toxic comments left on user talk pages and the subsequent decrease in users’ activity. However, this approach allowed us to formulate our findings with precision and ensure their robustness. We believe that our study complements and extends existing studies on Wikipedia and online communities more broadly, and may serve as a foundation for further exploration of the effects of toxicity, as we discuss in this section.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493731" id="428493731" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.1">Conflict on Wikipedia</h4>
<p>Conflict on Wikipedia has already been a subject of numerous studies, with particular attention given to so-called “edit wars” (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B11"></span>11, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B29"></span>29, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B30"></span>30). These arise when groups of editors, disagreeing about page content, repeatedly override each other’s contributions. It has been estimated that edit wars can impose substantial conflict and coordination costs on Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B12"></span>12). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that these costs increase over time and a smaller proportion of the total work by Wikipedians directly contributes to new article content. Conflict could also undermine content quality. For instance, the level of conflict on discussion pages, as assessed by raters, has been shown to negatively correlate with the quality of the corresponding Wikipedia articles (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B13"></span>13).</p><p>In contrast to previous studies, our focus is on comments left on user talk pages rather than article talk pages. While this narrows the scope of our study, it also ensures that the comments we examine are directly addressed to a specific editor. Our approach also mitigates potential bias that could be introduced by the topic of an article. For instance, comments on talk pages linked to articles about violence might be misclassified as toxic by an algorithm due to the presence of highly negative keywords.</p><p>It is possible that toxic comments we observe on user talk pages are not independent from a broader conflict occurring elsewhere on Wikipedia. Therefore, it is conceivable that the effect we observe is not purely explained by toxic comments, but also by a broader conflict which leads both to a toxic comment on a user talk page and decreased activity of this user. Future research is needed to address this limitation and explore the context in which toxic comments occur.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that it has already been established that toxicity on its own could lead users to stop contributing either temporarily or permanently, as this is what editors themselves report in surveys (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B24"></span>24). Our study complements such studies by providing an estimate of the potential effects while also being performed on a scale that is not achievable by survey methods.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493736" id="428493736" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.2">Stages of Wikipedia life cycle</h4>
<p>Wikipedia has not grown linearly but has instead passed through several stages. It began with exponential growth (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B31"></span>31), which subsequently slowed (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B32"></span>32). Following that, the number of active users declined before Wikipedia entered its current stage, characterized by a relatively stable number of active users (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B33"></span>33), with a slow decline observed in some language editions. A notable exception was a temporary spike in activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B34"></span>34). See <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pnasnexus/2/12/10.1093_pnasnexus_pgad385/2/pgad385_supplementary_data.pdf?Expires=1704812577&amp;Signature=d-s6BF9zZtNW0YtYo8mehCN1-eUtIRa8236kGZ1D6y4Oyx59aY10tBRtzXHl3cihdAtit8dZ7dBwyEe~VysBKn4vBGYy-gwqzit5D-IT1I6-cmeBEOaQwLNTCjw2AGwKdPTs1KA-stI9hGUB4BHmygndrSNDif-skuWQ-eTIMrIijDvwgO~eHg27ZAlBD0aXn6~K1gliVYgJtIoB-A0d~701nTIjSSXR8jbAuY~~-1zWLOUfkTsLOMyu0q5TAMetfNmQ1oU0AUfVikVZnQ17wk1RFpqzFHQUkEwab8MtC0om0HlAtjvUg65rv5vlK1wwy-AJyLkHSShIrsonaU6t6w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Supplementary Fig. S5</a></span> for an illustration of these patterns in the editions studied in this paper.</p><p>It has been found that the main reason for halted growth is a sharp decline in the retention of newcomers (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B35"></span>35). Specifically, with the project’s development, the rejection of newcomer contributions has increased, demotivating them and driving them away. Our results complement these findings by highlighting that newcomers are also particularly vulnerable to toxic comments. If users receive a toxic comment after their first or second contributions, their chances of continuing to contribute are 1.8 times lower compared to users who did not receive toxic comments.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493739" id="428493739" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.3">Diversity of editors</h4>
<p>Wikipedia is often considered a neutral and unbiased source of knowledge. In fact, this is ingrained in its “Neutral point of view” policy, which is officially one of the five fundamental principles of Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B36"></span>36). However, the claim of neutrality should not be accepted uncritically (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B37"></span>37). For instance, while Wikipedia mandates that its content is supported by reliable sources, the selection of these sources can significantly deviate from the norms of the expert knowledge community, introducing biases to Wikipedia content (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B38"></span>38). Even if the content of articles is neutral, their coverage may be biased. It is well documented, for example, that biographies of women are underrepresented on Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B39"></span>39). Wikipedia’s own rules might contribute to such biases. For instance, providing reliable sources as required by Wikipedia for biographies of women might be challenging because fewer sources exist on women due to historic inequalities (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B40"></span>40). Another case in point is the Oral Citations project, which aimed to use oral citations for content on countries that are underrepresented in other sources (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B41"></span>41). However, this initiative was met with opposition by the English Wikipedia community.</p><p>These content biases are closely connected to the lack of diversity among editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B38"></span>38, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B42"></span>42). While estimates vary, the vast majority of Wikipedians are men (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B43"></span>43). Notably, Wikipedia did not achieve its own goal of having at least 25% women editors by 2015 (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B44"></span>44). This shortfall is a significant concern for the project, as diversity can improve the quality of content and reduce its biases (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B13"></span>13, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B45"></span>45). While multiple barriers confront women editors on Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B40"></span>40, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B47"></span>47), toxicity is likely to be one of key factors contributing to the observed gender imbalance. Specifically, research has shown that while men and women are equally likely to face online harassment and abuse, women experience more severe violations (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B48"></span>48). They are also more likely to be affected by such incidents and to self-censor in an attempt to prevent potential harassment (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B48"></span>48). This has been confirmed in the Wikipedia context as well, where it has been demonstrated that the psychological experiences of women and men editors differ, leading to higher attrition rates among women (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B49"></span>49). Similar results were found in another survey (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B24"></span>24), showing that women experiencing toxicity are more likely to stop contributing in the future.</p><p>Overall, there are reasons to believe that toxicity might significantly undermine the diversity of Wikipedia editors, which can, in turn, compromise the quality of Wikipedia articles and introduce biases in its coverage. This underscores the importance of our findings. While most of the existing studies focus on the gender gap, we want to emphasize that the Wikipedia diversity problem goes beyond that, including racial, nonbinary, and other biases as well (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B50 pgad385-B51 pgad385-B52"></span>50–52). For instance, we observed that many of the toxic comments in our data set include ethnic slurs. Future studies are needed to better understand the experiences of minority groups on Wikipedia and the effects that toxicity has on them.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493743" id="428493743" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.4">Interventions</h4>
<p>The Wikipedia community is well aware of the aforementioned problems, and there have been multiple efforts to address them through various interventions. Research into reward systems showed that while they might work effectively for already highly productive editors, they fail to motivate less active editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B53"></span>53). Another study found no significant effect of positive rewards in online communities (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B54"></span>54).</p><p>To address the gender gap in Wikipedia content, numerous events dedicated to creating entries about women were organized (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46). An analysis of such interventions, which focused on two popular feminist interventions, confirmed that they succeeded in introducing content about women that would otherwise be missing (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B55"></span>55). However, there is still a need to address the gender gap on a more systematic and sustainable level. For instance, one study showed that most of the women activists who attended editing workshops later chose not to continue contributing to Wikipedia, citing safety concerns as their primary reason (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46). This issue was echoed in another study which identified safety as a core concern for women editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B56"></span>56).</p><p>A suggested solution to this problem has been the red-flagging of harassment and harassers (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B46"></span>46). However, the opinion that toxic comments are negligible and should be seen as merely over-enthusiastic participation is still present among editors (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B25"></span>25). Furthermore, various anti-harassment measures have been declined multiple times by the community, as they were seen to slow the process of content creation (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B57"></span>57, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B58"></span>58). Based on our findings, we believe there is a need to reevaluate these policies, and more research attention is required to understand the impact of potential interventions.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493747" id="428493747" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s2.1.5">The wider role of peer-production systems</h4>
<p>Wikipedia plays a crucial role in the global information infrastructure, aiming to provide millions of people with access to free, unbiased knowledge. Due to its reputation as a neutral and comprehensive information source, it has become a trusted first choice source of knowledge for many and its articles frequently appear in top search engine results (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B59"></span>59, <span id="jumplink-pgad385-B60"></span>60). In fact, studies have shown that Google search results rely heavily on Wikipedia, and the quality of these results significantly diminishes without Wikipedia (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B61"></span>61). Beyond search engines, Wikipedia was shown to be valuable to other online communities such as Stack Exchange and Reddit (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B62"></span>62).</p><p>While Wikipedia is arguably the most successful peer-production system, it is certainly not the only one. Others include hundreds of wikis hosted by Fandom, the numerous question-and-answer communities of Stack Exchange, and various other platforms ranging from online maps to online learning (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B33"></span>33). Interestingly, for these projects, the same patterns that are typical of Wikipedia have been observed (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B63"></span>63), i.e. the initial growth in number of contributors is followed by a decline characterized by a decreased retention of newcomers. This suggests that our findings might have broader implications for large-scale collaborative projects and online communities. It emphasizes the need to promote healthy and sustainable communication practices to protect crucial online information ecosystems and ensure their long-term success.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="428493750" id="428493750" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s3">Methods and materials</h2>

<p>The Wikimedia Foundation provides publicly accessible dumps of all the different wikis’ content.<sup><span id="jumplink-FN1"></span>a</sup> These dumps are updated on a regular basis, with complete revision history dumps generated once per month. For this paper, we used the English dump from 2021 November 1, the German dump from 2022 August 1, the French, Italian, and Spanish dumps from 2022 August 1, and the Russian dump from 2022 July 1. The data was obtained from a mirror hosted by the Umeå University, Sweden.<sup><span id="jumplink-FN2"></span>b</sup></p><p>From the dumps, the user talk pages were extracted. A user’s talk page is a place where other editors can communicate with the user either on more personal topics or to extend their discussion from an article talk page. When the comments left on the talk page are resolved or become too old, users can choose to archive them. This helps them keep better track of new incoming topics. Once archived, the old comments are not displayed on the talk page anymore but are rather linked in a subpage. Nevertheless, the entire history of the user talk page, as of any other page on Wikipedia, can be fully seen under the tab of revision history. The revision history records one entry for every edit made on the page saving each time the complete content of the page. Thus retrieving a single comment requires performing the difference between two consecutive revisions. The Wikimedia API does offer a method to compute the difference between two revisions, however, applying it on a scale that was necessary for this research was unfeasible. For that reason, we developed our own parser to extract comments as a difference between two versions of the page (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B64"></span>64).</p><p>We excluded from our analysis talk pages that belong to unregistered users, e.g. users who are represented only by an IP address rather than a user name, because IP addresses are dynamic and it can not be assumed that one address represents a single user throughout Wikipedia history. Additionally, we have excluded comments made by officially registered bots. Comments that were made by users on their own pages are also not considered.</p><p>When extracting comments, we cleared wiki-specific formatting and HTML markup, i.e. removed links, attachments, or other formatting-specific sequences irrelevant to the actual content.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="428493757" id="428493757" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s3.1.2">Contributions and active days</h4>
<p>In order to extract information on users’ contributions, i.e. edits of Wikipedia pages made by them, we used the MediaWiki API to retrieve timestamps for each edit made by a given user. The resulting data set is publicly available in the project repository (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B64"></span>64). The timestamps of contributions were then converted into active days. Specifically, each user <em>i</em> was represented as a binary vector <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>u</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">,</mo><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">,</mo><mo xmlns="">…</mo><mo xmlns="">,</mo><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>, where <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mn xmlns="">1</mn></math></span> if user <em>i</em> made at least one contribution, i.e. edited a Wikipedia page, within the 24-h period corresponding to day <em>d</em> and <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub xmlns=""><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mn xmlns="">0</mn></math></span> otherwise. <em>N</em> is the number of days between the first recorded contribution in our data set and the last. The conversion from contribution count to active days was performed because it is hard to interpret and compare the total number of contributions between users as one large contribution could be equivalent to multiple smaller ones. Additionally, the size of a contribution does not necessarily reflect the effort put into it. While being active on a given day could still mean different levels of activity for different users, it represents a certain level of engagement with the project and is substantially different from not contributing at all on a given day.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="428493759" id="428493759" data-legacy-id="pgad385-s3.2">Toxicity</h3>
<p>The automatic detection of offensive language in online communities has been an active area of research since at least 2010 (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B65"></span>65). Over the past decade, researchers have focused on detecting closely-related and intersecting types of offensive language such as toxicity, abusive language, and hate speech (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B66"></span>66), see (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B67"></span>67) for an overview of recent advancements in the field. In this paper, we use a model from the Perspective API (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B68"></span>68) to identify toxic comments. This is a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm that obtained competitive results at OffensEval-2019 competition (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B69"></span>69) without any additional training on the contest data and is often used as a baseline system for toxicity detection (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B66"></span>66). Perspective API is used across multiple platforms, including The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and El País. It uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture (<span id="jumplink-pgad385-B70"></span>70) and is trained on comments from a variety of online sources, including Wikipedia. Each comment is labeled by 3–10 crowdsourced raters.

Additionally, we applied different activity filters, e.g. we separately compute an estimate only for those users who were active at least <em>X</em> days in the past 100 days where <em>X</em> varies from 0 to 50. This is done in order to ensure that the results are not exclusively driven by those users who had made few edits and then stopped contributing to the project.

Finally, the results are averaged over all users. We repeat the procedure of selecting a random toxic comment 100 times and report average results. However, since most users received only one toxic comment, there is little variation across simulations and the average over 100 simulations is almost identical to the result of a single simulation.</p><p>We then compare these results with a control group comprised of users who did not receive any toxic comments. However, a direct comparison is complicated because users who have received a toxic comment are, on average, more active than those who have not. This is probably due to the fact that each contribution could lead to a toxic response with a certain probability. Hence, the more contributions a user makes, the higher the likelihood of receiving a toxic comment and thereby being in the treatment group.</p><p>Specifically, if each contribution can lead to a toxic comment with a probability <em>p</em>, then the probability of receiving at least one toxic comment depends on the number of contribution, <em>N</em>: <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi xmlns="">P</mi><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><mrow xmlns=""><mi mathvariant="normal">gettoxiccomment</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo><mo xmlns="">=</mo><mn xmlns="">1</mn><mo xmlns="">−</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><mn xmlns="">1</mn><mo xmlns="">−</mo><mi xmlns="">p</mi><msup xmlns=""><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi>N</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">(</mo><mn xmlns="">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">)</mo></math>⁠</span>.</p><p>To ensure our control group is similarly active as the treatment group, we randomly select users with a probability based on the number of their contributions using formula (1).

<p>For each toxic comment, we find the closest in time contribution that precedes that comment. We define such contributions as “contributions followed by a toxic comment” and compare the probability of leaving after such contributions with the probability of leaving after other contributions. The probability of leaving after <em>N</em> contributions is estimated as a fraction of users who have made exactly <em>N</em> contributions among users who have made at least <em>N</em> contributions. As the probability of leaving strongly depends on <em>N</em>, we make a comparison separately for each contribution number <span><span></span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi xmlns="">N</mi><mo xmlns="">∈</mo><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">[</mo><mn xmlns="">1</mn><mo xmlns="">,</mo><mn xmlns="">100</mn><mo stretchy="false" xmlns="">]</mo></math>⁠</span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Windows users are reporting that Hewlett Packard's HP Smart application is appearing on their systems, despite them not having any of the manufacturer's hardware attached.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has remained tight-lipped on what is happening, folks on various social media platforms noted the app's appearance, which seems to afflict both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>
<p>The Windows Update mechanism is used to deploy third-party applications and drivers as well as Microsoft's updates, and we'd bet someone somewhere has accidentally checked the wrong box.</p>

    

<p>Up to now, the response from affected users has been one of confusion.</p>

        


        

<p>One <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbcapfh/">noted</a> on Reddit: "I thought that was just me. I didn't install it, it just appeared on new apps in start menu out of nowhere."</p>
<p>Another <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbbkn2b/">said</a>: "I just checked and I had it installed too. Checking the event log for the Microsoft Store shows that it installed earlier today, but I definitely did [not] request or initiate it because I do not have any devices from HP."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/30/windows_ugly_sweater_2023/">Nostalgia for XP sells out Microsoft's 2023 'Windows Ugly Sweater'</a></li>

</ul>
<p>And, of course, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbdkztd/">there was the inevitable</a>: "Would it be <b>that</b> hard for Microsoft to just provide an operating system without needless bloat?"</p>
<p>To be clear, not all users are affected. Our test Windows 10 PC was far too busy suggesting that we should take a look at Copilot to bother with the HP Smart app nonsense.</p>

        

<p>WindowsLatest <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/11/30/hp-smart-is-auto-installing-on-windows-11-and-windows-10-on-non-hp-machines/">reported</a> the issue occurring on both physical Windows 10 hardware and a Windows 11 virtual machine.</p>
<p>HP Smart is innocuous enough. It's an application used in conjunction with HP's printer hardware and can simply be uninstalled.</p>
<p>However, the question is how the application got installed in the first place on a machine with no HP hardware attached or on a network, according to affected users.</p>

        

<p>In a statement to WindowsLatest, Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and it would share more details soon. <em>The Register</em> asked Microsoft to comment and will report back with any response. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="prism-article-body"><p><span>SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- </span>The skyline of San Francisco's Financial District is about as picturesque as it gets. An area that was bustling with people several years ago, but one that according to the numbers, is now more vacant than ever.</p><p>"Right now in downtown San Francisco, we have a vacancy rate of a little over 35% which is the highest that we've ever recorded in the history of San Francisco," says Colin Yasukochi who is an executive director of the tech insights center at CBRE, which focuses on the tech industry and how it affects commercial real estate. Yasukochi says that office vacancy numbers in San Francisco were 3 to 4% pre-pandemic, meaning we've seen more than a 30% increase and that trend may continue.</p><p><b>Take Action SF: <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/take-action-sf-london-breed-brooke-jenkins-bill-scott/14086522/">Mayor, city leaders to answer questions about future of city</a></b></p><p>"We think that the vacancy rate will probably creep up some more in 2024, probably at least through the first half of the year. I would say because there still are firms who are consolidating and reducing the amount of office space they have," said Yasukochi.</p><p>"The challenge still remains - remote work and the city's reliance on tech as it's largest industry and those tech workers, they've been working from home for a very long time and many of those businesses are operating successfully from home," said Jeff Bellisario of the Bay Area Council. Bellisario says homelessness, crime, public safety, and all around cleanliness are still the top concerns among current and potential San Francisco employers. He also says one thing is true.</p><p>"It's not a doom loop, right? The numbers don't necessarily suggest that. A doom loop would have high unemployment, it would have businesses running to other cities. That's not where we are but we're not in a spot where we are thriving and succeeding, we're kind of surviving," said Bellisario.</p><p>While companies like Nordstrom, Cinemark, and Old Navy have closed retail locations in the city, Bellisario says San Francisco business license data shows that overall the city is no longer losing more companies than it's gaining.</p><p><b>MORE: <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/downtown-san-francisco-investing-in-sf-empty-offices-tech/13236684/">Despite downtown SF's current rough patch, prominent business leaders are investing in it</a></b></p><p>Still though, retail vacancy rates have risen to above 18% in Union Square.</p><p>Kazuko Morgan of Cushman and Wakefield says businesses are opening up and good news is on the horizon.</p><p>"There are a number of leases that have been signed and not been announced that will probably be forthcoming next year. We have a fair amount of tenants that are under construction so that's going to add to the vibrancy as well," said Morgan.</p><p>Morgan says that workers going back to the office and more conventions would both help retail; but the positive image of San Francisco must also get out there too.</p><p><b>VIDEO: <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/always-san-francisco-campaign-sf-tourism-visit-travel/13324256/">San Francisco launches multimillion-dollar campaign to boost tourism</a></b></p><div data-testid="prism-caption"><p><span data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span>The "Always San Francisco" campaign highlights the city's most iconic sights and sounds with a minute-long commercial aimed at attracting tourists.</span></span></span></p></div><p>"Our biggest issue I think has just been the media backlash with the media throwing us under the bus, and I think that is probably been one of the toughest things we have had to deal with," said Morgan.</p><p>ABC 7 News reporter J.R.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, genetic testing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/23andme-says-hackers-accessed-significant-number-of-files-about-users-ancestry/">23andMe announced that hackers accessed the personal data of 0.1% of customers, or about 14,000 individuals</a>. The company also said that by accessing those accounts, hackers were also able to access “a significant number of files containing profile information about other users’ ancestry.” But 23andMe would not say how many “other users” were impacted by the breach that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/23andme-resets-user-passwords-after-genetic-data-posted-online/">the company initially disclosed in early October</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there were a lot of “other users” who were victims of this data breach: 6.9 million affected individuals in total.</p>
<p>In an email sent to TechCrunch late on Saturday, 23andMe spokesperson Katie Watson confirmed that hackers accessed the personal information of about 5.5 million people who opted-in to 23andMe’s DNA Relatives feature, which allows customers to automatically share some of their data with others. The stolen data included the person’s name, birth year, relationship labels, the percentage of DNA shared with relatives, ancestry reports and self-reported location.</p>
<p>23andMe also confirmed that another group of about 1.4 million people who opted-in to DNA Relatives also “had their Family Tree profile information accessed,” which includes display names, relationship labels, birth year, self-reported location and whether the user decided to share their information, the spokesperson said. (23andMe declared part of its email as “on background,” which requires that both parties agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is printing the reply as we were given no opportunity to reject the terms.)</p>
<p>It is also not known why 23andMe did not share these numbers in its disclosure on Friday.</p>
<p>Considering the new numbers, in reality, the data breach is known to affect roughly half of 23andMe’s total reported 14 million customers.</p>
<p>In early October, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hacker claimed to have stolen the DNA information of 23andMe users</a> in a post on a well-known hacking forum. As proof of the breach, the hacker published the alleged data of one million users of Jewish Ashkenazi descent and 100,000 Chinese users, asking would-be buyers for $1 to $10 for the data per individual account. Two weeks later, the same hacker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/hacker-leaks-millions-more-23andme-user-records-on-cybercrime-forum/">advertised the alleged records of another four million people</a> on the same hacking forum.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that another hacker on a separate hacking forum <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/23andme-says-hackers-accessed-significant-number-of-files-about-users-ancestry/">had already advertised a batch of allegedly stolen 23andMe customer data</a> two months before the widely reported advertisement.</p>

<p>When we analyzed the months-old leaked data, TechCrunch found that some records matched genetic data published online by hobbyists and genealogists. The two sets of information were formatted differently, but contained some of the same unique user and generic data, suggesting the data leaked by the hacker was at least in part authentic 23andMe customer data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/addressing-data-security-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosing the incident in October</a>, 23andMe said the data breach was caused by customers reusing passwords, which allowed hackers to brute-force the victims’ accounts by using publicly known passwords released in other companies’ data breaches.</p>
<p>Because of the way that the DNA Relatives feature matches users with their relatives, by hacking into one individual account, the hackers were able to see the personal data of both the account holder as well as their relatives, which magnified the total number of 23andMe victims.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! The other day, I started wondering – has anyone ever made a FUSE
filesystem for a git repository where all every commit is a folder? It turns
out the answer is yes! There’s <a href="https://github.com/fanzeyi/giblefs">giblefs</a>,
<a href="https://belkadan.com/blog/2023/11/GitMounter/">GitMounter</a>, and <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a> for Plan 9.</p>

<p>But FUSE is pretty annoying to use on Mac – you need to install a kernel
extension, and Mac OS seems to be making it harder and harder to install kernel
extensions for security reasons. Also I had a few ideas for how to organize the
filesystem differently than those projects.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be fun to experiment with ways to mount filesystems on
Mac OS other than FUSE, so I built a project that does that called
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-commit-folders">git-commit-folders</a>. It works (at least on my computer) with both FUSE and NFS, and there’s a broken WebDav
implementation too.</p>

<p>It’s pretty experimental (I’m not sure if this is actually a useful piece of
software to have or just a fun toy to think about how git works) but it was fun
to write and I’ve enjoyed using it myself on small repositories so here are
some of the problems I ran into while writing it.</p>

<h3 id="goal-show-how-commits-are-like-folders">goal: show how commits are like folders</h3>

<p>The main reason I wanted to make this was to give folks some intuition for how
git works under the hood. After all, git commits really <em>are</em> very similar to
folders – every Git commit <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/#commit-step-2-look-at-the-tree">contains a directory listing</a> of the files in it,
and that directory can have subdirectories, etc.</p>

<p>It’s just that git commits aren’t <em>actually</em> implemented as folders to save
disk space.</p>

<p>So in <code>git-commit-folders</code>, every commit is actually a folder, and if you want
to explore your old commits, you can do it just by exploring the filesystem!
For example, if I look at the initial commit for my blog, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls commits/8d/8dc0/8dc0cb0b4b0de3c6f40674198cb2bd44aeee9b86/
README
</code></pre>

<p>and a few commits later, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls /tmp/git-homepage/commits/c9/c94e/c94e6f531d02e658d96a3b6255bbf424367765e9/
_config.yml  config.rb  Rakefile  rubypants.rb  source
</code></pre>

<h3 id="branches-are-symlinks">branches are symlinks</h3>

<p>In the filesystem mounted by <code>git-commit-folders</code>, commits are the only real folders – everything
else (branches, tags, etc) is a symlink to a commit. This mirrors how git works under the hood.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l branches/
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork bazil-fuse -&gt; ../commits/ff/ff56/ff563b089f9d952cd21ac4d68d8f13c94183dcd8
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork follow-symlink -&gt; ../commits/7f/7f73/7f73779a8ff79a2a1e21553c6c9cd5d195f33030
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork go-mod-branch -&gt; ../commits/91/912d/912da3150d9cfa74523b42fae028bbb320b6804f
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork mac-version -&gt; ../commits/30/3008/30082dcd702b59435f71969cf453828f60753e67
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork mac-version-debugging -&gt; ../commits/18/18c0/18c0db074ec9b70cb7a28ad9d3f9850082129ce0
lr-xr-xr-x 59 bork main -&gt; ../commits/04/043e/043e90debbeb0fc6b4e28cf8776e874aa5b6e673
$ ls -l tags/
lr-xr-xr-x - bork 31 Dec  1969 test-tag -&gt; ../commits/16/16a3/16a3d776dc163aa8286fb89fde51183ed90c71d0
</code></pre>

<p>This definitely doesn’t completely explain how git works (there’s a lot more to
it than just “a commit is like a folder!”), but my hope is that it makes thie
idea that every commit is like a folder with an old version of your code” feel
a little more concrete.</p>

<h3 id="why-might-this-be-useful">why might this be useful?</h3>

<p>Before I get into the implementation, I want to talk about why having a filesystem
with a folder for every git commit in it might be useful. A lot of my projects
I end up never really using at all (like <a href="https://github.com/jvns/dnspeep">dnspeep</a>) but I did find myself using this
project a little bit while I was working on it.</p>

<p>The main uses I’ve found so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>searching for a function I deleted – I can run <code>grep someFunction branch_histories/main/*/commit.go</code> to find an old version of it</li>
<li>quickly looking at a file on another branch to copy a line from it, like <code>vim branches/other-branch/go.mod</code></li>
<li>searching every branch for a function, like <code>grep someFunction branches/*/commit.go</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are through symlinks to commits instead of referencing commits
directly.</p>

<p>None of these are the most efficient way to do this (you can use <code>git show</code> and
<code>git log -S</code> or maybe <code>git grep</code> to accomplish something similar), but
personally I always forget the syntax and navigating a filesystem feels easier
to me.</p>

<p>Next I want to talk about some problems I ran into.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-webdav-or-nfs">problem 1: webdav or NFS?</h3>

<p>The two filesystems I could that were natively supported by Mac OS were WebDav
and NFS. I couldn’t tell which would be easier to implement so I just
tried both.</p>

<p>At first webdav seemed easier and it turns out that golang.org/x/net has a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/webdav">webdav implementation</a>, which  was
pretty easy to set up.</p>

<p>But that implementation doesn’t support symlinks, I think because it uses the <code>io/fs</code> interface
and <code>io/fs</code> doesn’t <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49580">support symlinks yet</a>. Looks like that’s in progress
though. So I gave up on webdav and decided to focus on the NFS implementation, using this <a href="https://github.com/willscott/go-nfs/">go-nfs</a> NFSv3 library.</p>

<p>Someone also mentioned that there’s
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider/">FileProvider</a> on Mac
but I didn’t look into that.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-how-to-keep-all-the-implementations-in-sync">problem 2: how to keep all the implementations in sync?</h3>

<p>I was implementing 3 different filesystems (FUSE, NFS, and WebDav), and it
wasn’t clear to me how to avoid a lot of duplicated code.</p>

<p>My friend Dave suggested writing one core implementation and then writing
adapters (like <code>fuse2nfs</code> and <code>fuse2dav</code>) to translate it into the NFS and
WebDav verions. What this looked like in practice is that I needed to implement
3 filesystem interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>fs.FS</code> for FUSE</li>
<li><code>billy.Filesystem</code> for NFS</li>
<li><code>webdav.Filesystem</code> for webdav</li>
</ul>

<p>So I put all the core logic in the <code>fs.FS</code> interface, and then wrote two functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>func Fuse2Dav(fs fs.FS) webdav.FileSystem</code></li>
<li><code>func Fuse2NFS(fs fs.FS) billy.Filesystem</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the filesystems were kind of similar so the translation wasn’t too hard,
there were just 1 million annoying bugs to fix.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-i-didn-t-want-to-list-every-commit">problem 3: I didn’t want to list every commit</h3>

<p>Some git repositories have thousands or millions of commits. My first idea for how to address this was to make <code>commits/</code> appear empty, so that it works like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls commits/
$ ls commits/80210c25a86f75440110e4bc280e388b2c098fbd/
fuse  fuse2nfs  go.mod  go.sum  main.go  README.md
</code></pre>

<p>So every commit would be available if you reference it directly, but you can’t
list them. This is a weird thing for a filesystem to do but it actually works
fine in FUSE. I couldn’t get it to work in NFS though. I assume what’s going on
here is that if you tell NFS that a directory is empty, it’ll interpret that
the directory is actually empty, which is fair.</p>

<p>I ended up handling this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>organizing the commits by their 2-character prefix the way <code>.git/objects</code>
does (so that <code>ls commits</code> shows <code>0b 03 05 06 07 09 1b 1e 3e 4a</code>), but doing
2 levels of this so that a <code>18d46e76d7c2eedd8577fae67e3f1d4db25018b0</code> is at <code>commits/18/18df/18d46e76d7c2eedd8577fae67e3f1d4db25018b0</code></li>
<li>listing all the packed commits hashes only once at the beginning, caching
them in memory, and then only updating the loose objects afterwards. The idea
is that almost all of the commits in the repo should be packed and git
doesn’t repack its commits very often.</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems to work okay on the Linux kernel which has ~1 million commits. It
takes maybe a minute to do the initial load on my machine and then after that
it just needs to do fast incremental updates.</p>

<p>Each commit hash is only 20 bytes so caching 1 million commit hashes isn’t a
big deal, it’s just 20MB.</p>

<p>I think a smarter way to do this would be to load the commit listings lazily –
Git sorts its packfiles by commit ID, so you can pretty easily do a binary
search to find all commits starting with <code>1b</code> or <code>1b8c</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git">git library</a> I was using
doesn’t have great support for this though, because listing all commits in a
Git repository is a really weird thing to do. I spent maybe a couple of days
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/git-commit-folders/tree/fast-commits">trying to implement it</a> but I didn’t manage to get the performance I wanted so I
gave up.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-not-a-directory">problem 4: “not a directory”</h3>

<p>I kept getting this error:</p>

<pre><code>"/tmp/mnt2/commits/59/59167d7d09fd7a1d64aa1d5be73bc484f6621894/": Not a directory (os error 20)
</code></pre>

<p>This really threw me off at first but it turns out that this just means that
there was an error while listing the directory, and the way the NFS library
handles that error is with “Not a directory”. This happened a bunch of times
and I just needed to track the bug down every time.</p>

<p>There were a lot of weird errors like this. I also got <code>cd: system call
interrupted</code> which was pretty upsetting but ultimately was just some other bug
in my program.</p>

<p>Eventually I realized that I could use Wireshark to look at all the NFS
packets being sent back and forth, which made some of this stuff easier to debug.</p>

<h3 id="problem-5-inode-numbers">problem 5: inode numbers</h3>

<p>At first I was accidentally setting all my directory inode numbers to 0. This
was bad because if if you run <code>find</code> on a directory where the inode number of
every directory is 0, it’ll complain about filesystem loops and give up, which
is very fair.</p>

<p>I fixed this by defining an <code>inode(string)</code> function which hashed a string to
get the inode number, and using the tree ID / blob ID as the string to hash.</p>

<h3 id="problem-6-stale-file-handles">problem 6: stale file handles</h3>

<p>I kept getting this “Stale NFS file handle” error. The problem is that I need
to be able to take an opaque 64-byte NFS “file handle” and map it to the right
directory.</p>

<p>The way the NFS library I’m using works is that it generates a file handle for
every file and caches those references with a fixed size cache. This works fine
for small repositories, but if there are too many files then it’ll overflow the
cache and you’ll start getting stale file handle errors.</p>

<p>This is still a problem and I’m not sure how to fix it. I don’t understand how
real NFS servers do this, maybe they just have a really big cache?</p>

<p>The NFS file handle is 64 bytes (64 bytes! not bits!) which is pretty big, so
it does seem like you could just encode the entire file path in the handle a
lot of the time and not cache it at all. Maybe I’ll try to implement that at
some point.</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-branch-histories">problem 7: branch histories</h3>

<p>The <code>branch_histories/</code> directory only lists the latest 100 commits for each
branch right now. Not sure what the right move is there – it would be nice to
be able to list the full history of the branch somehow. Maybe I could use a
similar subfolder trick to the <code>commits/</code> directory.</p>

<h3 id="problem-8-submodules">problem 8: submodules</h3>

<p>Git repositories sometimes have submodules. I don’t understand anything about
submodules so right now I’m just ignoring them. So that’s a bug.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>There are probably more problems I forgot but that’s all I can think of for
now. I may or may not fix the NFS stale file handle problem or the “it takes 1
minute to start up on the linux kernel” problem, who knows!</p>

<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="https://github.com/vasi">vasi</a> who explained one million things about filesystems to me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Intel’s Optane memory modules launched with a lot of fanfare in 2015, and were recently
discontinued, in 2022, with similar fanfare. It was a sad day for me, a lover of
abstraction-breaking technologies, but it was forseeable and understandable.</p>
<p>At the time of Optane’s launch, a lot of us were excited about the idea of having a new storage
tier, sitting between DRAM and flash. It was announced as having DRAM endurance and speed with
the persistence and size of flash. It was a futuristic memory technology, but the technology of
the future met the full force of Wright’s Law.</p>
<h2 id="wrights-law">Wright’s Law</h2>
<p><em><strong>Each doubling of production volume corresponds to a 20% decrease in cost</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is the simple statement of Wright’s Law. It was originally developed by a man named Theodore
Wright in the 1930’s when looking at the production of airplane parts. Since then, it has been
verified to hold in many different industries, although the cost reduction seems to vary between
10 and 25% depending on the industry. Despite the industry difference, the history of
semiconductor technology has actually followed Wright’s Law more closely than Moore’s Law: The
density increases predicted by Moore’s Law tend to speed up and slow down with demand growth,
exactly as predicted by Wright’s Law.</p>
<p>During the last 7 years, DRAM and Flash have both experienced massive increases in density and
production volume, and in turn, Wright’s Law has given us cheaper, faster, bigger devices.</p>
<h4 id="dram-production-2015-2022">DRAM Production 2015-2022</h4>
<p>The lifetime of DDR4 memory roughly matches the lifetime of Optane. DDR4 was introduced a few
years before 2015, and became cost-effective compared to DDR3 around 2015-2016. Today, DDR5 RAM
and the CPUs that can use it have just recently been introduced to the market. Over this time,
RAM price per bit has roughly halved, and global RAM production has grown by a factor of about
10-15. However, due to competition between AMD and Intel, the number of memory channels per CPU
has also roughly doubled. Thus, a server in 2022 holds about 4x as much RAM as a server in 2015,
and memory cost as a share of system cost has increased by a factor of 2. Memory bandwidth has
increased by a factor of about 3 due to a doubling of memory channels and the channels getting
faster.</p>
<p>This means that both the capacity argument of Optane (“a system with Optane DIMMs can hold more
memory”) has diminished over time, and the performance gap between Optane and DDR memory has also
grown. A two-socket server populated with RDIMMs can now hold several TB of memory, so the value
proposition of Optane for memory capacity has been eliminated.</p>
<h4 id="flash-is-a-spectrum">Flash is a Spectrum</h4>
<p>Flash memory comes in four flavors, based on the number of bits stored in each cell. Single-level
cell (SLC) flash stores one bit per cell. It has the lowest density, but the longest endurance and
highest speeds. MLC (multi-level cell) holds two bits per cell, and is worse on speed and
endurance than SLC, but better than TLC (triple-level cell). Most SSDs today use TLC flash: it
offers a good balance between price and endurance, and most workloads are read-heavy, so there
isn’t a lot of stress on the memory arrays. QLC (quad-level cell) has recently been introduced to
the market as a capacity SSD technology: QLC has even lower endurance and speed than TLC, but
increases the capacity a lot. PLC (penta-level) is on the horizon, promising to continue the
trend.</p>
<p>On the back of this distinction, we can see a natural tiering of flash: using TLC or QLC for
capacity (in place of disk for all but the largest datasets), and using SLC for caching and
write-heavy workloads. This means that SLC flash is a direct competitor to Optane, but it
has the advantages of being much cheaper per bit without being a lot slower.</p>
<h4 id="flash-production-2015-2022">Flash Production 2015-2022</h4>
<p>After Optane’s launch, Flash memory technology advanced quickly. In 2015, NVMe drives had been out
for about a year or two. NVMe drives and the controller chips that ran them were still working out
the kinks. Understandably, Intel also created NVMe drives with Optane, offering much better read
and write latencies than NVMe drives with flash. Not only did Optane offer faster access than
flash, but it had the advantage of being a simpler, more reliable form of memory that didn’t need
complicated controller algorithms.</p>
<p>As time went on, companies quicly improved the speed, reliability, and density of each flash
technology. In 2015, TLC was roughly in the position QLC occupies today: mostly for read-only and
read-heavy workloads. Now, TLC is the workhorse flash technology used for general-purpose drives,
as its speed and endurance have improved. Similarly, SSD controller chips have also improved over
time, allowing them to work faster and make better use of the flash chips on an SSD. Lots of money
goes into R&amp;D work for flash, and it shows.</p>
<p>In the last 7 years, flash has grown to be the dominant storage technology: going from almost 20x
more per bit than hard drives to just 5x more per bit. In addition, SSD latency has dropped by
a factor of 2 due to control chips getting more powerful and algorithms getting better. Flash
bandwidth has increased to the point where an SSD can saturate a PCIe gen 4 x4 link. A modern
SLC SSD can be found with read latency under 30 microseconds, and even TLC SSDs can get close to
100 microsecond latencies.</p>
<p>Flash has advanced so much over the last 7 years that if the trend continues, I may be eulogizing
the magnetic hard drive in 2030. Flash is eating the storage world for good reason: it can offer
high speeds and high capacity, and while it had some rough edges, we have learned how to work with
it very well.</p>
<h4 id="optane-and-wrights-law">Optane and Wright’s Law</h4>
<p>Clearly, as time has advanced, Optane’s position in the memory hierarchy has been getting crushed
between expanding DDR4 DRAM and flash that is getting faster and faster. Both of these
technologies have had much more innovation and R&amp;D over the last 7 years than Optane, and it shows.
In retrospect, Intel was fighting an uphill battle if they wanted to treat Optane simply as a point
on the memory hierarchy. To make the project successful, they needed it to be a unique value add.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-proposition-of-optane">The Value Proposition of Optane</h2>
<p>After the dust settled, Optane modules only ended up having a small price difference with DRAM
modules of the same size, but were almost as slow as SLC flash, and only had 3-5x the endurance of
flash memory. The NVMe drives were faster, but not that much faster, than SLC flash. The only
value-add that was left was the abstraction difference with normal memory: Optane offered
<strong>persistence on the memory bus</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have worked on a database or a storage system, you will know how valuable this can be: lots
of code in high-throughput storage systems is there to make sure that transactions persist as
quickly as possible. Conceivably, if the normal memory writes involved in that transaction can
make it persistent, you can delete a ton of code. You could even conceivably run a small database
on an <code>mmap</code>-ed Optane file, and persistence would be given to you for free. Oh wait… a lot of
databases <code>mmap</code> their backing files already.</p>
<h4 id="persistence-on-the-memory-abstraction">Persistence on the Memory Abstraction</h4>
<p>It turns out that what developers mostly would have wanted from Optane they got from BSD and Linux
in the form of <code>mmap</code>. <code>mmap</code>-ing a file allows you to treat the contents of the file as though
they are in memory, and allows the filesystem and a cache to handle the rest. The parts of the
file you have accessed recently are in memory, while other parts of the file are fetched from disk
when you demand them - your access triggers a page fault, which in turn triggers a read from the
filesystem. Writes to the file are handled in the background. This is not the fastest way to
access files, but it is a very convenient one, and it works well enough for many high-performance
key-value databases like LevelDB, LMDB, SQLite, QuestDB, RavenDB, and more.</p>
<p><code>mmap</code> had one more secret weapon: the filesystem. If the media backing the filesystem wore out,
the filesystem (and the layers underneath it) could detect and correct issues. Optane had no
such protection.</p>
<p>When Intel thought they were enabling a whole new class of high-performance databases by offering
persistence on the memory bus, they were really offering a performance boost compared to persistent
databases using <code>mmap</code>. It might not even have been a performance boost: Optane slowed down your
median read and write operations in exchange for avoiding those page faults, so if your working set
was small or mostly fit inside RAM, <code>mmap</code> and NVMe flash was actually faster.</p>
<h4 id="persistent-memory-and-caches">Persistent Memory and Caches</h4>
<p>It turns out that offering persistence on the memory bus runs into abstraction problems with the
current memory controllers on CPUs. The memory controllers and cache hierarchies are designed
assuming that memory is dumb and volatile, and they can indefinitely delay writes to save
bandwidth.</p>
<p>The initial solution that Intel came up with was an instruction, <code>CLFLUSH</code>, that flushed a cache
line to memory. However, <code>CLFLUSH</code> was a serializing instruction, like <code>CPUID</code>, so it ended up
flushing the CPU pipeline as well as the cache hierarchy when it was issued. Worse, flusing the
cache line would invalidate it, so if you wanted to read the value back after writing it, you would
incur a cache miss. It was later supplemented by <code>CLFLUSHOPT</code> and <code>CLWB</code> which also could be used
to flush and write back cache lines without incurring the same performance penalty.</p>
<p>However, when Optane memory started to come out, <code>CLFLUSH</code> was the only instruction from this suite
that was available, meaning that initial performance tests suffered from both the speed difference
between Optane and DRAM and the substantial overhead of the <code>CLFLUSH</code> instruction. Intel would
probably have had a much easier time selling Optane if their core architecture were ready.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-methods-of-persistence">Alternative Methods of Persistence</h4>
<p>Also between 2015 and 2022, several companies were offering a different kind of persistent DIMM.
Instead of using a special type of memory, this kind of persistent DIMM used normal DRAM, but added
some flash memory and a small controller circuit on the back that saved the contents of the DRAM
to flash every time the power started to dip.</p>
<p>To make sure that the contents of the DIMM were safe, these persistent DIMMs had a supercapacitor
or small lithium ion battery (usually kept in a 2.5 inch drive bay and connected to the DIMM
through a cable) that kept the DIMM powered while the rest of the system was going down. On
power-up, the DIMM would restore the memory contents.</p>
<p>These were later specified by JEDEC as “NVDIMM-N” modules (standing for Non-volatile Dual Inline
Memory Module - NAND flash type).</p>
<p>Still, these alternatives have some problems: they are a lot thicker than normal memory DIMMs, and
they can’t offer the capacity that Optane modules could offer. However, they don’t have the same
durability problems that Optane and flash do, since the flash is rarely written, and they operate
at the same speed as the rest of the system’s memory.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-optane">Thank You, Optane</h2>
<p>So many technologies have become successful around Optane and the promises it held. Unfortunately,
Optane was not one of them.</p>
<p>SSDs using SLC flash offer blazing fast performance with a block abstraction, and enterprises and
database developers learned how to take advantage of the differences between SSDs that were small
and fast, using SLC flash, and SSDs that were slower and larger, with TLC and QLC flash. Some SSD
manufacturers also saw the idea of a caching drive and competed by adding SLC caching to their TLC
SSDs. Most high-end consumer SSDs today do this for you.</p>
<p>For the few customers who needed persistence on the memory bus, the JEDEC NVDIMM standards emerged,
with the flagship NVDIMM-N modules allowing you to have a DRAM module that was both persistent
<em>and</em> fast, and an additional standard to cover future persistent memory technologies. Intel’s
new instructions allow users to take advantage of these new modules, adding a fundamental
capability to CPUs.</p>
<p>Optane has helped us learn to build computing systems that take advantage of the spectrum of
“legacy” storage and memory technologies. I, for one, am sad to see it go, but happy that I won’t
miss it.</p>

  rescue_from SocketError do |_|
    render json: { message: &quot;error&quot; }, status: 500

<p dir="auto">Apart from <code>RageController::API</code> as a parent class, this is mostly a regular Rails controller. However, the main difference is under the hood - Rage runs every request in a separate fiber. During the call to <code>Net::HTTP.get</code>, the fiber is automatically paused, enabling the server to process other requests. Once the HTTP request is finished, the fiber will be resumed, potentially allowing to process hundreds of requests simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto">To make this controller work, we would also need to update <code>config/routes.rb</code>. In this case, the file would look the following way:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Rage.routes.draw do
  get &quot;page&quot;, to: &quot;pages#show&quot;
end"><pre><span>Rage</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>.</span><span>draw</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>get</span> <span>"page"</span><span>,</span> <span>to</span>: <span>"pages#show"</span>
<span>end</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">ℹ️ <strong>Note</strong>: Rage will automatically pause a fiber and continue to process other fibers on HTTP, PostgreSQL, and MySQL calls. Calls to <code>Thread.join</code> and <code>Ractor.join</code> will also automatically pause the current fiber.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, <code>Fiber.await</code> can be used to run several requests in parallel:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="require &quot;net/http&quot;

class PagesController < RageController::API
  def index
    pages = Fiber.await([
      Fiber.schedule { Net::HTTP.get(URI(&quot;https://httpbin.org/json&quot;)) },
      Fiber.schedule { Net::HTTP.get(URI(&quot;https://httpbin.org/html&quot;)) },
    ])

    render json: { pages: pages }
  end
end"><pre><span>require</span> <span>"net/http"</span>

    </div>
<p>A radical theory that consistently unifies gravity and quantum mechanics while preserving Einstein's classical concept of spacetime has been announced in two papers published simultaneously by UCL (University College London) physicists.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Modern physics is founded upon two pillars: quantum theory on the one hand, which governs the smallest particles in the universe, and Einstein's theory of general relativity on the other, which explains <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravity/" rel="tag">gravity</a> through the bending of spacetime. But these two theories are in contradiction with each other and a reconciliation has remained elusive for over a century.
</p><p>The prevailing assumption has been that Einstein's theory of gravity must be modified, or "quantized," in order to fit within quantum theory. This is the approach of two leading candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, string theory and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/loop+quantum+gravity/" rel="tag">loop quantum gravity</a>.
</p><p>But a new theory, developed by Professor Jonathan Oppenheim (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy) and laid out in a paper in <i>Physical Review X,</i> challenges that consensus and takes an alternative approach by suggesting that spacetime may be classical—that is, not governed by quantum theory at all.
</p><p>Instead of modifying spacetime, the theory—dubbed a "postquantum theory of classical gravity"—modifies quantum theory and predicts an intrinsic breakdown in predictability that is mediated by spacetime itself. This results in random and violent fluctuations in spacetime that are larger than envisaged under quantum theory, rendering the apparent weight of objects unpredictable if measured precisely enough.
</p><p>A second paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43348-2">published</a> simultaneously in <i>Nature Communications </i>and led by Professor Oppenheim's former Ph.D. students, looks at some of the consequences of the theory, and proposes an experiment to test it: to measure a mass very precisely to see if its weight appears to fluctuate over time.
</p><p>For example, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France routinely weigh a 1kg mass which used to be the 1kg standard. If the fluctuations in measurements of this 1kg mass are smaller than required for mathematical consistency, the theory can be ruled out.
</p><p>The outcome of the experiment, or other evidence emerging that would confirm the quantum vs. classical nature of spacetime, is the subject of a 5000:1 odds bet between <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/pub/quantum_vs_classical_bet.pdf">Professor Oppenheim and Professor Carlo Rovelli and Dr. Geoff Penington</a>—leading proponents of quantum loop gravity and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/string+theory/" rel="tag">string theory</a> respectively.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>For the past five years, the UCL research group has been stress-testing the theory, and exploring its consequences.
</p><p>Professor Oppenheim said, "Quantum theory and Einstein's theory of general relativity are mathematically incompatible with each other, so it's important to understand how this contradiction is resolved. Should spacetime be quantized, or should we modify quantum theory, or is it something else entirely? Now that we have a consistent fundamental theory in which spacetime does not get quantized, it's anybody's guess."
</p><p>Co-author Zach Weller-Davies, who as a Ph.D. student at UCL helped develop the experimental proposal and made key contributions to the theory itself, said, "This discovery challenges our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravity but also offers avenues to probe its potential quantum nature.
</p><p>"We have shown that if spacetime doesn't have a quantum nature, then there must be random fluctuations in the curvature of spacetime which have a particular signature that can be verified experimentally.
</p><p>"In both quantum gravity and classical gravity, spacetime must be undergoing violent and random fluctuations all around us, but on a scale which we haven't yet been able to detect. But if spacetime is classical, the fluctuations have to be larger than a certain scale, and this scale can be determined by another experiment where we test how long we can put a heavy atom in superposition of being in two different locations."
</p><p>Co-authors Dr. Carlo Sparaciari and Dr. Barbara Šoda, whose analytical and numerical calculations helped guide the project, expressed hope that these experiments could determine whether the pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity is the right approach.

<p>Dr. Šoda (formerly UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy, now at the Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics, Canada) said, "Because gravity is made manifest through the bending of space and time, we can think of the question in terms of whether the rate at which time flows has a quantum nature, or classical nature.
</p><p>"And testing this is almost as simple as testing whether the weight of a mass is constant, or appears to fluctuate in a particular way."
</p><p>Dr. Sparaciari (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy) said, "While the experimental concept is simple, the weighing of the object needs to be carried out with extreme precision.
</p><p>"But what I find exciting is that starting from very general assumptions, we can prove a clear relationship between two measurable quantities—the scale of the spacetime fluctuations, and how long objects like atoms or apples can be put in quantum superposition of two different locations. We can then determine these two quantities experimentally."
</p><p>Weller-Davies added, "A delicate interplay must exist if quantum particles such as atoms are able to bend classical spacetime. There must be a fundamental trade-off between the wave nature of atoms, and how large the random fluctuations in spacetime need to be."
</p><p>The proposal to test whether spacetime is classical by looking for random fluctuations in mass is complementary to another experimental proposal that aims to verify the quantum nature of spacetime by looking for something called "gravitationally mediated entanglement."
</p><p>Professor Sougato Bose (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy), who was not involved with the announcement today, but was among those to first propose the entanglement experiment, said, "Experiments to test the nature of spacetime will take a large-scale effort, but they're of huge importance from the perspective of understanding the fundamental laws of nature. I believe these experiments are within reach—these things are difficult to predict, but perhaps we'll know the answer within the next 20 years."
</p><p>The postquantum theory has implications beyond gravity. The infamous and problematic "measurement postulate" of quantum theory is not needed, since quantum superpositions necessarily localize through their interaction with classical <a href="https://phys.org/tags/spacetime/" rel="tag">spacetime</a>.
</p><p>The theory was motivated by Professor Oppenheim's attempt to resolve the black hole information problem. According to standard <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+theory/" rel="tag">quantum theory</a>, an object going into a black hole should be radiated back out in some way as information cannot be destroyed, but this violates <a href="https://phys.org/tags/general+relativity/" rel="tag">general relativity</a>, which says you can never know about objects that cross the black hole's event horizon. The new <a href="https://phys.org/tags/theory/" rel="tag">theory</a> allows for information to be destroyed, due to a fundamental breakdown in predictability.

After a two-year delay and negotiations over its rollout, the company adopted a novel but cost-effective plan to bring ultrafast internet speeds to Kentucky’s largest city. This February, only 16 months after it turned on its service, Google Fiber announced plans to turn it off, making Louisville, one of only 19 cities to get Google Fiber since its launch in 2010, the first to lose it. Now, the most visible sign of the tech giant’s screw up is lying all over the roads.</p><p>“I literally just got done driving around, looking at streets with Google,” said Metro Councilman Brandon Coan. Strands of errant sealant are “everywhere,” he said outside a coffee shop in his district, one of a few where Google Fiber ran lines before its abrupt departure. “I’m confident that Google and the city are going to negotiate a deal … to restore the roads to as good a condition as they were when they got here. Frankly, I think they owe us more than that.”</p><p>The damage goes deeper than the roads. In Louisville, a minor league city with major league ambitions<strong>,</strong> Google Fiber left behind disappointed consumers, unfulfilled promises of transformative economic development, and a slew of embarrassing headlines for a city that allowed the tech giant to use it as a guinea pig.<br></p><p>But Google Fiber got something out of its time here. It learned that nanotrenching—the cost-saving process of burying fiber optic cables just two inches underground—was a bust. “We currently do not have plans that call for 2 inch trenches, our primary specifications are focused on going deeper,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>“It is such a shame to think that we wouldn’t be having any of this conversation if they would have dug their little holes two inches deeper,” Coan said.</p><hr><p>In October 2017, when Google Fiber started signing up customers in three Louisville neighborhoods, the ISP was a year removed from a “pause” that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-fiber-cuts/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-fiber-cuts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saw its CEO resign and more than 100 employees laid off</a></span>. Turns out, disrupting the telecom industry is wildly expensive, full of intractable regulatory challenges, and opposed by powerful incumbent companies.<br></p><p>The plan in Louisville was to revive the effort with what some were calling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-fiber-2-0-targets-the-city-where-it-will-stage-its-comeback-as-at-t-fiber-prepares-to-go/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-fiber-2-0-targets-the-city-where-it-will-stage-its-comeback-as-at-t-fiber-prepares-to-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Fiber 2.0</a></span>. But first, the city had to agree to one major stipulation: Google Fiber wanted to see if it could scale a method for installing fiber cables that was easier to implement, and easier on the bottom line, than hanging lines from utility poles.</p><p>The company had buried fiber lines in other cities, but in Louisville it wanted to go shallower. Nanotrenching called for burying cables just two inches underground, rather than the typical six inches. The company also wanted to cover the trenches with epoxy, rather than the typical asphalt mix. In an email, a Google Fiber spokesperson said the company had “already performed limited trials of two-inch trenches in other markets, and believed it was a promising new method of deployment.” In Louisville, Google Fiber wanted to see if two-inch trenches would work at scale, an attempt that the spokesperson described as “ambitious” and a “lean into innovation.”</p><p>Local leaders were concerned. The city sent a team to other cities where a company spokesperson said<strong> </strong>“limited trials” with two-inch trenches had been conducted, and it sought the advice of outside experts.</p><p>“What [Google Fiber] told Louisville was that they didn’t think they could make their traditional construction work, but would we be open to letting them use a new construction technique,” said Grace Simrall, Louisville’s Chief of Civic Innovation and Technology. “There were lots of aspects that we asked a lot of questions about, trying to make them aware that we thought this might have challenges, but they, having done parts of Nashville and San Antonio this way, told us they felt confident they could make this work.”</p><p>After years of trying to woo Google—an effort that included <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2019/02/08/google-fiber-makes-louisville-pay-the-price-with-exit/2813479002/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2019/02/08/google-fiber-makes-louisville-pay-the-price-with-exit/2813479002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spending around $400,000 on legal fees</a></span> to defend an ultimately unused city ordinance that made it easier for Google Fiber to use utility poles—Louisville was in no position to say no.</p><p>Ted Smith, Simrall’s predecessor in City Hall, began working to make the city more “fiber friendly” in 2011 and credited three-term Mayor Greg Fischer, a Democrat, with recognizing that “mid-sized American cities were getting left behind.”<strong> </strong>(Disclosure: My wife is a Democratic State Representative from a part of Louisville that did not receive Google Fiber.)</p><p>“We worked very hard for many years to make the case that Louisville was a city that understands the value of cost-effective high-speed broadband,” he said.</p><p>It’s little surprise then that Louisville agreed to let Google futz around with its roads.

Louisville finally had a chance to join the cool kids.</p><p>The enthusiasm after Louisville accepted Google Fiber’s offer tells the story.

By March of 2018, just five months after Google Fiber launched its nanotrenching trial, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/belknap-neighborhood-residents-concerned-over-sloppy-installation-of-high-speed/article_4bc2a61e-8640-57f0-aba9-3dd4cb3d39e5.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/belknap-neighborhood-residents-concerned-over-sloppy-installation-of-high-speed/article_4bc2a61e-8640-57f0-aba9-3dd4cb3d39e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the method began to fail</a></span>. Not only was the sealant spilling out onto roads, leaving fiber lines exposed, but the shallow trenches left cables vulnerable during routine road maintenance.</p><p>“If anyone understood road technology or tire technology, [they] would know it’s going to be a problem,” said Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optics Association and a decades-long veteran of the industry. <br></p><p>The problem, Hayes said, is that tires easily grabbed the epoxy and ripped it out of the ground. The shorter trench walls also left less asphalt for the sealant to adhere to. Typical microtrenching, a “well-accepted method of installing fiber,” involves burying cables at least six inches deep with a groove that’s no more than an inch wide, Hayes said. “I’ve never heard of any problems with microtrenching.”</p><p>Last summer Google Fiber pitched a solution to the problem it created. It would rip out the epoxy and fill in the trenches with asphalt. “It was like, ‘Oh, in retrospect, that seems like an obvious way to fill the hole in the road,’” Coan said.</p><p>“They bid out the work to replace the sealant with asphalt,” Simrall said. But before the work started, Google Fiber saw customers lose service when the process of repaving roads damaged fiber lines. “So they shifted their attention to addressing that,” she said.</p><p>Then, last month, Google Fiber threw up its hands and quit. The company wouldn’t say how many customers it had at that point, only that the number was “very small” compared to other Fiber cities. Last summer, the local Fox TV affiliate found that the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/sunday-edition-where-is-google-fiber-mostly-in-the-highlands/article_569112e0-421e-58ef-be24-c2e42e5e53d2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/sunday-edition-where-is-google-fiber-mostly-in-the-highlands/article_569112e0-421e-58ef-be24-c2e42e5e53d2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had pulled permits to wire areas covering about 11,000 households</a></span>, but it’s not clear how many installations were completed.</p><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fiber.googleblog.com/2019/02/louisville_7.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fiber.googleblog.com/2019/02/louisville_7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a></span>, Google Fiber explained what happened. “[T]rialing” a “different type of construction method” in Louisville had failed, it said. Fixing it would be too expensive, so instead, it was skipping town, and taking the lessons learned elsewhere.</p><p>“This was not an easy decision for us,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We came to Louisville because Google Fiber is working to change an entrenched industry and we saw a chance to bring great service to Louisville’s residents. Naturally there will be unexpected challenges when you do something ambitious, and at scale, for the first time and we underestimated some of those hurdles. We couldn’t be more appreciative of the partnership we’ve had with the City of Louisville, which embraced the need for competition in this industry as part of its larger initiatives around innovation and emerging technology.”</p><p>Simrall insists that Google Fiber was “very sincere in their belief they could make it work,” and had planned to use two-inch trenches in all other Google Fiber cities if it did. That’s little consolation to many Louisvillians, who watched one of the world’s richest companies sweep into town with major fanfare, rip up the roads to test an unproven technique, and peace out when it bombed.</p><p>“I was shocked. I was disappointed,” said Candace Jaworski, president of the Louisville Digital Association, a non-profit that pushes for innovation in Louisville and campaigned to bring Google Fiber here. Jaworski was looking forward to one day becoming a Google Fiber customer and seeing the change broadband could deliver to Portland, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/11/29/study-louisville-neighborhoods-among-poorest/94541828/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/11/29/study-louisville-neighborhoods-among-poorest/94541828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the country’s poorest neighborhoods</a></span> and one of the first where Google Fiber was available.</p><p>“Google Fiber getting in and getting folks into the internet out in the West End was going to be huge with catching up that part of town with the rest,” Jaworski said. “Talk about dangling a carrot and not ever being able to get it.”</p><p>Ben Carter was lucky enough to get bite of that carrot. An attorney in the Highlands, Carter said Google Fiber provided wildly fast internet and “rock solid” customer service for the time he had it. When he got the news that Google Fiber was ending its operations in Louisville, he was disappointed, and not just because he would lose the blazing internet speed that he enjoyed primarily for its “Tim Allen, way-more-power-than-you-need” quality.</p><p>“It seemed like Louisville was batting above its weight a bit in terms of what cities were getting Google Fiber,” he said of the “coup” that the city pulled off in landing Google Fiber. “Louisville isn’t often on those lists.”</p><p>Now that Google Fiber is gone, Councilman Coan is worried that Louisville’s reputation will take a hit. “If you’re not paying attention, you’d say, ‘Oh, well. Louisville is just not a good enough city for Google Fiber.’ That’s not true.”</p><p>In the end, it may be that Google Fiber was not good enough for Louisville. Alphabet seems to be scaling back the ambitions of Google Fiber as wireless broadband technology advances and the limitations of fighting entrenched telecom giants become clear, said Matt Wood, the vice president of policy at broadband advocacy group Free Press. Its experimentation in Louisville is evidence enough that Google Fiber was looking for a new way forward. But like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211177/alphabet-google-earnings-q4-2018-moonshot-other-bets-spending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211177/alphabet-google-earnings-q4-2018-moonshot-other-bets-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so many of its “other bets”</a></span>—the heading under which Alphabet groups ambitious projects such as its life sciences play Verily, self-driving car company Waymo, and<strong> </strong>Access, the business unit that operates Google Fiber—the company seems to have lost this one.</p><p>That’s not to say Google Fiber isn’t responsible for major changes in broadband access.

<p>Farmland often harbors a multitude of pathogens which attack plants and reduce yields. A Swiss research team has now shown that inoculating the soil with mycorrhizal fungi can help maintain or even improve yields without using additional fertilizers or pesticides. In a large-scale field trial, plant yield increased by up to 40%.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides on fields reduces biodiversity and pollutes the environment. There is, therefore, great interest in finding sustainable ways to protect yields without using agricultural chemicals. One example of alternative biologicals is mycorrhizal fungi, which are beneficial organisms that help plants acquire nutrients.

<p>A team of researchers from the universities of Zurich and Basel, Agroscope, and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) has now shown for the first time on a large scale that applying mycorrhizal fungi in the field works. The fungi were mixed into the soil before sowing crops on 800 trial plots at 54 maize farms in northern and eastern Switzerland.
</p><p>"On a quarter of the plots, the mycorrhizal fungi enabled up to 40% better yields. That's huge," says the study's co-lead, Marcel van der Heijden, a soil ecologist at the University of Zurich and at Asgroscope. But there's a catch: on a third of the plots, the yield did not increase and sometimes even decreased. The research team was initially unable to explain why this happened.
</p><h2>Pathogens in the soil</h2>
<p>In their search for the cause, the researchers analyzed a variety of chemical, physical, and biological soil properties, including the biodiversity of soil microbes. "We discovered that the inoculation functioned best when there were lots of fungal pathogens already in the soil," says co-first author Stefanie Lutz from Agroscope, the federal center of competence for Agricultural Research.
</p><p>"The mycorrhizal fungi act as a kind of protective shield against pathogens in the soil that would weaken the plants." As a result, the normal yield can be maintained in fields where, without mycorrhizal fungi, there would have been losses. In contrast, mycorrhizal fungi had only a minor effect on fields that were not contaminated with pathogens.
</p><p>"The plants there are strong anyway and grow excellently. The use of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/mycorrhizal+fungi/" rel="tag">mycorrhizal fungi</a> in such cases brings no additional benefits," says the other first author, Natacha Bodenhausen from the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture.
</p><p>The aim of the study was to be able to predict the conditions under which mycorrhizal inoculation works.
</p><p>"With just a few soil indicators—mainly <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil/" rel="tag">soil</a> fungi—we were able to predict the success of inoculation in nine out of 10 fields, and thus could also predict the harvest yield even before the field season," says the study's co-lead Klaus Schläppi of the University of Basel. "This predictability makes it possible to target the use of the fungi in fields where they will work. That's a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/crucial+element/" rel="tag">crucial element</a> for developing these technologies into a reliable agricultural method," says Schläppi.
</p><p>Further research is still required to find out the easiest way to spread the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/fungi/" rel="tag">fungi</a> over large areas. Nevertheless, "the results of this field trial represent a big step toward a more sustainable agriculture," concludes Marcel van der Heijden.

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>I could make opponents concede at will so that I never lost a game in Magic: The Gathering Arena</p>
</a><blockquote><a></a><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a>Hey </a><a href="https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MTG_Arena</a> I figured out how to make an opponent auto-concede the game. Let me know how you'd like me to report the issue and I will send over the source + an explanation of how it can be mitigated. Thank you! <a href="https://t.co/dWMdkKjOA2">pic.twitter.com/dWMdkKjOA2</a></p>— Daniel Mayer (@dan__mayer) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan__mayer/status/1641669864460009472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2023</a></blockquote> 
<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>Before we get into it, I want to address some folks who read my last post and were upset that WOTC doesn't obfuscate their client-side code. I actually think it is really rad that they don't! <em>Very</em> motivated folks (read: people who make paid cheats, botters who sell accounts, etc) will always find ways to deobfuscate and analyze client logic they are interested in anyway. All the obfuscation does is raise the barrier to entry in order keep out less invested folks, which means less hacks overall, sure, but it also means less bored nerds like me who just want to poke at something on the weekend. These bored nerds are the sorts of people who report vulnerabilities that they find! You want these people looking at your game! This is my opinion for most games, but <em>especially</em> card games, because the client does even less than usual.</p>
<p>Card games are usually pretty tough targets for game hacks because they are turn based, and not a lot of information needs to move between the client and the server. This means that card games are excellent candidates for being 100% server-side authoritative, meaning that the server keeps track of the entire game state and only tells the client what it needs to know.</p>
<p>Unlike a fast-paced shooter where the opponent team's models may need to be loaded before you can see them (allowing for wallhacks), or computationally heavy routines like player movement may be offloaded to the client to save resources (allowing for speedhacks), card games are relatively chill in terms of resource consumption and the information boundaries are concrete. All a player can do is play cards and read the board state, and the server tells the player what they can do and when.</p>
<p>This means the client will do very little work itself and it will only be given information about unrevealed cards as the cards are played (by an opponent) or drawn (by you). Unrevealed information such as an opponent's hand or the decks never exists locally so they cannot be read. You can't shuffle the deck in a specific order, or change what card you draw. The server just performs these verbs for you and tells you the result. This in stark contrast to something like a first-person shooter, where a player has a lot of verbs and agency available to them at all time. That results in abuses like this:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our MW2 cheat is now done and we're currently in closed testing. This means our cheat will be ready when the game launches, with all the features you'd expect.<br>Once the game is launched you'll be able to get our cheat at a discounted price for a limited time, don't miss it! <a href="https://t.co/65N4T0ieFl">pic.twitter.com/65N4T0ieFl</a></p>— EngineOwning.to (@engineowningto) <a href="https://twitter.com/engineowningto/status/1574143483392446464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>In this first-person shooter hack, all that revealed information is already stored and cached within the client - the hack just draws it to screen. Because of the fast-paced and dynamic nature of the game, this information must be available client-side before a player gains line-of-sight to an enemy or object. Otherwise, all of the enemy or object data would have to be sent over the wire realtime at the moment line-of-sight is gained and rendered (and then immediately deleted after line of sight is broken).</p>
<p>Performance and latency issues get in the way of that. <em>For now</em>, at least. Check out Riot's anti-wallhack blog <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/demolishing-wallhacks-valorants-fog-war">HERE</a> about how they minimized client-side player position data. They are making gains in this realm.</p>
<p>So yeah. In something like a card game, since the actions a player can take are limited and happen at a set time, the client does not need to store data before it is needed. This also makes the logic to detect invalid actions, like playing a card that is not in your hand or out of turn much easier to implement. I think that's part of the reasong why you don't see a big cheating ecosystem around card games the way you do around FPSes. That doesn't mean that bugs don't exist still though! So let's explore one.</p>
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>For a card game, I thought that the best course of action was to take a look at the network communication. This is a good rule of thumb for game hacking in general - my favorite defcon talk is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAUf_ygqsDo">just 45 minutes of MMO hacking war stories</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/_EBFE">Manfred</a>. It is really worth a watch. You will see that the root of all the analysis he performs to find all these bugs comes down to reversing the network protocol. He has custom tooling built that hooks whatever function send/recieves messages after they have been decrypted (if there's encryption) and displays the traffic in some sort of hex viewer UI. It also seems like it has the ability to edit the requests before they are sent to the server or interpreted by the client, and replay messages.</p>
<p>Since MTGA is written in C#, the nice thing is that we don't need to do all the fancy stuff he does of hooking the ingress and egress of traffic. Instead, we can very easily manipulate in-game objects at runtime using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection">reflection</a>, including accessing private fields and methods. <a href="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/Unity-Hacking-101-Hacking-with-Reflection/">I have a basic tutorial on how to do this if you are curious</a>. All I needed to do was find the client code and start taking a look. From there I could fiddle with the client at runtime as needed.</p>
<h2>A lead</h2>
<p>Looking at decompiled C# is also really nice because it utilizes <a href="https://jorudolph.wordpress.com/2010/08/03/net-metadata-tokens/">metadata tokens</a> to associate elements of the compiled code with their human-readable names, which are still stored in the compiled .NET assembly. That means I can see all the function, variable, and class names that the developers wrote when they wrote their code. It turns the decompilation of non-obfuscated .NET assemblies into essentially source code review!</p>
<p>So I started searching for functions I would associate with joining a match, as that is where I would expect a lot of the client initialization for a specific game against an opponent to begin. Lo and behold, there was a <code>JoinMatch</code> function!</p>
<p>This function was quite long (over 200 lines long), and a lot of it was just dealing with the player metadata, like rank, cosmetics, etc. Down at the bottom though, I got what I was looking for:</p>
<pre><code>private void JoinMatch(NewMatchCreatedConfig matchConfig)
{
    ...
    this._matchManager.ConnectAndJoinMatch(connectionConfig, matchConfig.controllerFabricUri, matchConfig.matchId);
    if (matchConfig.matchType == MatchType.NPE)
    {
        this._npeState.NewNPEOpponent(connectionConfig.MatchDoorHost, connectionConfig.MatchDoorPort, matchConfig.controllerFabricUri, matchConfig.matchId, this._matchManager, this._assetLookupSystem);
        return;
    }
    if (matchConfig.matchType == MatchType.Familiar)
    {
        this._botTool.NewBotOpponent(connectionConfig.MatchDoorHost, connectionConfig.MatchDoorPort, matchConfig.controllerFabricUri, matchConfig.matchId, !flag3, this._cardDatabase, this._accountInformation, this._matchManager, this._assetLookupSystem);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A function named <code>ConnectAndJoinMatch</code> that takes in our match configuration information. Nice. That is likely where our game connects to the match for the first time! ...But that's not all that is there. There are two other checks <em>after</em> we connect to the game server. Do you know what those are?</p>
<p>They are Sparky!</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with MTGA, Sparky is sort of MTGA's mascot. Embodied as a small wisp of light, Sparky guides new players through the tutorial and are always available to practice new decks against. Essentially, its a cute dressing up of the tutorial and bot match features of MTGA.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/Sparky.jpg" alt="Sparky"></p>
<p>Adorable.</p>
<p>Well, I got totally side-tracked by this. Sparky is implemented in a pretty interesting way. As you can see there, if the match type is either <code>NPE</code> (which I assume stands for "New Player Experience") or <code>Familiar</code> (a standard bot match), other functions are called, which seem to take in a lot of the same information as the function to join a match as a player. Why would that be the case? Because under the hood, any time you play a bot in MTGA, the bot logic runs locally on your machine! It just also connects to the same match server as you, but all the decision-making process for what it is playing runs inside your game running on your computer.</p>
<p>I was totally surprised by this, because it means that a (mostly) fully-functioning bot capable of playing arbitrary games of Magic: The Gathering has a small enough footprint to run locally on your machine. I would have thought that a game as complex as MTG would require a lot of overhead in terms of creating an AI opponent. But nope! You can actually check out all of the logic for Sparky, including a few places in the debug UI where WOTC developers reached a corner case that they felt was not worth implementing. I don't blame them - MTG is a beast of a game to try to have full coverage for!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/corner1.png" alt="Corner Case 1"></p>
<p>Here's my personal favorite, it is reminiscent of the leaked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k238XpMMn38">Valve</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9uvdTHYNHk">Yandex</a> source code comments:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/corner2.png" alt="Corner Case 2"></p>
<p>Don't worry anonymous WOTC developer - we've all been there.</p>
<h2>The devil's in the implementation (details)</h2>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what exactly happens when you start a bot match:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/jwt.png" alt="JWT"></p>
<p>There's a lot of code here that you don't have to worry about. But check out the highlighted portion. The actual logic handler for the bot is housed inside of a class called <code>HeadlessClient</code>. That class is, well, a headless client. The bot doesn't need to render a game board or anything, so it just connects to a game server and plays the game in its brain, like a Magic: The Gathering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXwdoRG43U">Magnuss Carlsen</a>.</p>
<p>Since the headless client is also spawned from your game, it uses the same user credentials to authenticate to the game server - in this case a user ID called <code>PersonaID</code> and a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON web token</a> that is granted to your game after you successfully log in. Standard web authenication.</p>
<p>To me that was interesting though, because it means that the game servers don't see anything wrong with the same client essentially connecting to both sides of a match.</p>
<p>Were bot match game servers unique in this regard? I doubted that they were. If that were the case, I didn't think that WOTC would have implemented the bot logic client-side. To me one of the benefits of offloading the bot client is that all game servers can run exactly the same and the clients will worry about connecting, filling the appropriate seats, and interfacing with the server properly.</p>
<p>I mean "seat" literally too! That's how the game keeps track of which player you are, since the credentials are the same for a bot match:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/seatid.png" alt="SeatID"></p>
<h2>Match takeovers!</h2>
<p>So, as we know from <a href="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/Unity-Hacking-101-Hacking-with-Reflection/">my tutorial on using reflection to hack unity games</a>, we can use game objects to our own ends and alter their behavior. So to test if I could connect to both sides of a <em>regular</em> match, instead of a bot match, I could use a lot of the game logic already written for the bot and matchmaking! I just had to make my own headless client, determine what seat in the game I was, and then connect the client to the other seat. The code I came up with can be found in Appendix A right below this section.</p>
<p>Most of the is just accessing in-game memory objects to get all the information needed to know what game I am currently connected to in matchmaking. I then use that information to connect the bot to the game. Once I have all the info, the code figures out the opponent's seat based off of my own, creates and connects the bot, and as some added spice, immediately makes the bot concede.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, this worked! Even if the opponent had already connected and we are in the middle of a game, which is what you see in the video. As you can also see, I got rewards as if I beat a human opponent, because this was a matchmaking game:</p>

<p>I hope you have a little bit more respect for Sparky now. You can check out the code below if you are interested, but the servers have now been patched to make sure both seats don't have the same account and JWT for matchmaking games.</p>

test toy implementations of distributed systems. Maelstrom provides
standardized tests for things like "a commutative set" or "a transactional
key-value store", and lets you learn by writing implementations which those
test suites can exercise. It's used as a part of a distributed systems workshop
by <a href="https://jepsen.io/training" rel="nofollow">Jepsen</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom provides a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/workloads.md">range of tests</a> for different kinds of
distributed systems, built on top of a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/protocol.md">simple JSON
protocol</a> via STDIN and STDOUT. Users write servers <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/demo">in any
language</a>. Maelstrom runs those servers, sends them requests, routes
messages via a simulated network, and checks that clients observe expected
behavior. You want to write Plumtree in Bash? Byzantine Paxos in Intercal?
Maelstrom is for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom's tooling lets users experiment with <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/03-broadcast/02-performance.md">simulated
latency</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/04-crdts/01-g-set.md#a-simple-g-set">message
loss</a>. Every test includes <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/not-concurrent.png">timeline
visualizations</a> of concurrency structure,
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/03-broadcast/02-performance.md#how-many-messages">statistics</a> on messages
exchanged, <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/06-raft/final.png">timeseries graphs</a> to understand how
latency, availability, and throughput respond to changing conditions, and
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/missing-value.png">Lamport diagrams</a> so you can understand
exactly how messages flow through your system. Maelstrom's checkers can verify
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle">sophisticated safety properties</a> up to
strict serializability, and generate <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/g1-realtime.svg">intuitive, minimal
examples</a> of consistency anomalies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom can help you model how a system responds to different cluster sizes,
network topologies, latency distributions, and faults like network partitions.
Maelstrom also offers <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/services.md">simulated services</a> that you can use
to build more complex systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's built for testing toy systems, but don't let that fool you: Maelstrom is
reasonably fast and can handle simulated clusters of 25+ nodes. On a 48-way
Xeon, it can use 94% of all cores, pushing upwards of 60,000 network
messages/sec.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Maelstrom Guide will take you through writing several different types of
distributed algorithms using Maelstrom. We begin by setting up Maelstrom and
its dependencies, write our own tiny echo server, and move on to more
sophisticated workloads.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom is a <a href="https://clojure.org/" rel="nofollow">Clojure</a> program which runs on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" rel="nofollow">Java
Virtual Machine</a>. It uses
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen">Jepsen</a> to generate operations, record a
history of their results, and analyze what happens.</p>
<p dir="auto">Writing "real" distributed systems involves a lot of busywork: process
management, networking, and message serialization are complex, full of edge
cases, and difficult to debug across languages. In addition, running a full
cluster of virtual machines connected by a real IP network is tricky for many
users. Maelstrom strips these problems away so you can focus on the algorithmic
essentials: process state, transitions, and messages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "nodes" in a Maelstrom test are plain old binaries written in any language.
Nodes read "network" messages as JSON from STDIN, write JSON "network" messages
to STDOUT, and do their logging to STDERR. Maelstrom runs those nodes as
processes on your local machine, and connects them via a simulated network.
Maelstrom runs a collection of simulated network clients which make requests to
those nodes, receive responses, and records a history of those operations. At
the end of a test run, Maelstrom analyzes that history to identify safety
violations.</p>
<p dir="auto">This allows learners to write their nodes in whatever language they are most
comfortable with, without having to worry about discovery, network
communication, daemonization, writing their own distributed test harness, and
so on. It also means that Maelstrom can perform sophisticated fault injection
and trace analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom starts in <code>maelstrom.core</code>, which parses CLI operations and
constructs a test map. It hands that off to Jepsen, which sets up the servers
and Maelstrom services via <code>maelstrom.db</code>. Spawning binaries and handling their
IO is done in <code>maelstrom.process</code>, and Maelstrom's internal services (e.g.
<code>lin-kv</code> are defined in <code>maelstrom.service</code>. Jepsen then spawns clients
depending on the workload (<code>maelstrom.workload.*</code>) and a nemesis
(<code>maelstrom.nemesis</code>) to inject faults.</p>
<p dir="auto">Messages between nodes are routed by <code>maelstrom.net</code>, and logged in
<code>maelstrom.journal</code>. Clients send requests and parse responses via
<code>maelstrom.client</code>, which also defines Maelstrom's RPC protocol.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the end of the test, Jepsen checks the history using a checker built in
<code>maelstrom.core</code>: workload-specific checkers are defined in their respective
workload namespaces. Network statistics are computed in
<code>maelstrom.net.journal</code>, and Lamport diagrams are generated by
<code>maelstrom.net.viz</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>maelstrom.doc</code> helps generate documentation based on <code>maelstrom.client</code>'s
registry of RPC types and workloads.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI Options</h2>
<p dir="auto">A full list of options is available by running <code>java -jar maelstrom.jar test --help</code>. The important ones are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--workload NAME</code>: What kind of workload should be run?</li>
<li><code>--bin SOME_BINARY</code>: The program you'd like Maelstrom to spawn instances of</li>
<li><code>--node-count NODE-NAME</code>: How many instances of the binary should be spawned?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To get more information, use:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--log-stderr</code>: Show STDERR output from each node in the Maelstrom log</li>
<li><code>--log-net-send</code>: Log messages as they are sent into the network</li>
<li><code>--log-net-recv</code>: Log messages as they are received by nodes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To make tests more or less aggressive, use:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--time-limit SECONDS</code>: How long to run tests for</li>
<li><code>--rate FLOAT</code>: Approximate number of requests per second</li>
<li><code>--concurrency INT</code>: Number of clients to run concurrently. Use <code>4n</code> for 4 times the number of nodes.</li>
<li><code>--latency MILLIS</code>: Approximate simulated network latency, during normal
operations.</li>
<li><code>--latency-dist DIST</code>: What latency distribution should Maelstrom use?</li>
<li><code>--nemesis FAULT_TYPE</code>: A comma-separated list of faults to inject</li>
<li><code>--nemesis-interval SECONDS</code>: How long between nemesis operations, on average</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For broadcast tests, try</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--topology TYPE</code>: Controls the shape of the network topology Jepsen offers
to nodes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For transactional tests, you can control transaction generation using</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--max-txn-length INT</code>: The maximum number of operations per transaction</li>
<li><code>--key-count INT</code>: The number of concurrent keys to work with</li>
<li><code>--max-writes-per-key INT</code>: How many unique write operations to generate per key.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">SSH options are unused; Maelstrom runs entirely on the local node.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running ./maelstrom complains it's missing maelstrom.jar</h3>
<p dir="auto">You probably cloned this repository or downloaded the source and didn't compile
it. Download the compiled release tarball instead; you'll find it on the GitHub
release page.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run directly from source, you'll need the
<a href="https://leiningen.org/" rel="nofollow">Leiningen</a> build system. Instead of <code>./maelstrom ...</code>, run <code>lein run ...</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Raft node processes still alive after maelstrom run</h3>
<p dir="auto">You may find that node processes maelstrom starts are not terminating at the end of a run as expected. To address this, make sure that if the process passed as <code>--bin</code> forks off a new process, it also handles the process' termination.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h4>
<p dir="auto">In <code>bin/raft</code></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#!/bin/bash

# Forks a new process.
java -jar target/raft.jar"><pre><span><span>#!</span>/bin/bash</span>

<span><span>#</span> Forks a new process.</span>
java -jar target/raft.jar</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In <code>bin/raft</code></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#!/bin/bash

# Replaces the shell without creating a new process.

<p>Throughout the history of video games, there have been titles that permanently shifted the industry. These games are generally not hard to spot, as their influence quickly earned them a place in our pop culture. Tetris, Super Mario 64, Halo, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, each of these games caused massive shifts in their respective genres and gaming as a whole. But for each of these, there are also games whose influence, though significant, is largely forgotten. Did you know that almost every 3rd-person cover shooter mechanic originated in the Nintendo 64 game WinBack? How about that one of the first games to feature modern first-person-shooter controls was Alien Resurrection on the original Playstation? Or how about the fact that every 3D game Nintendo has ever made, can trace its roots back to a Game Boy demo developed by a teenager in the UK?</p>

<p>In 1992 Nintendo published a Game Boy game called X. It was based on a demo called Eclipse that was programmed by a young man named Dylan Cuthbert. It would go on to form the basis of the Super Nintendo game, Star Fox. From there Shigeru Miyamoto would begin experimenting with 3D for Mario and Zelda, leading to Super Mario 64 and the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Despite its limited, Japan exclusive release, X is generally considered to be one of the most important games ever made. And all of that came from a single, mysterious demo that until now, has remained lost to time.<img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gamehistory.org/eclipse-the-demo-that-sold-3d-to-nintendo/images/image3.jpg"></p>



<p>My name is John Rairdin, I’m the director of NintendoWorldReport.com, and a few months ago I produced a documentary in cooperation with the Video Game History Foundation called A Legacy in 3D: The Story of Star Fox, and had the honor of showing the world Dylan Cuthbert’s Eclipse demo for the first time.</p>

<p>The story of Eclipse begins at Argonaut Software in Edgware, a suburban town in north London. This was a studio run in large part by teenagers and led by a man named Jez San. Argonaut’s specialty was in 3D games for the home computers of the time. Games like Starglider and its sequel wowed players with smooth wireframe, and later fully polygonal, flight combat. Dylan Cuthbert was hired as a programmer at Argonaut at the age of 17.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-740x416.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-50x28.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1980x1114.jpg 1980w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><em>“It was really just after I started at Argonaut, maybe four months after four or five months after I started at Argonaut… and Jez said, Oh, there’s this thing called Game Boy that’s just been launched in, you know, in the West. And I said, ‘Oh, what’s that?’ And he brought one back.”</em></p>



<p>One of Cuthbert’s particular talents among the Argonaut team was his experience programming for 8-bit machines.</p>



<p><em>“I’d learned to program in Z80 on the ZX81 and the Sinclair Spectrum. And of course the Game Boy was a Z80 variant. And he wanted someone who had actually had experience in that CPU.”</em></p>



<p>This experience made Cuthbert the perfect pick for Jez San’s ambitions for the Game Boy.</p>



<p><em>“At Argonaut, I think Jez especially kind of prided himself on the fact that he could make 3D run on anything. And when he saw the Game Boy, I think he saw the chance of proving that 3D could run on it. Because obviously it was a 2D machine. No one had even thought of doing 3D on it. But we thought, okay let’s try and do it.”</em></p>



<p>And so, one of Cuthberts first projects at Argonaut would be the seemingly impossible task of developing a 3D engine for the 8-bit, monochrome Game Boy. A bit of an imposing job on its own, but 3D wasn’t the only hurdle. Argonaut also didn’t have an official Game Boy dev kit. A dev kit is a special variant of a piece of hardware built to allow developers access to programming for a game system that wouldn’t normally be available on a retail model. Instead they’d need to get creative with a Game Boy from straight off the store shelf.</p>



<p><em>“We didn’t have a Game Boy dev kit and so we were hacking it… I think we took a Tetris or Mario cartridge and we took the top off and then we were wiring the address buses and stuff to go to our Amiga system instead of the actual ROM itself. So then we could just replace the data that was actually in the ROM with our data… We had like a little security camera pointed at the Game Boy screen that was then put on a little TV so we could actually see what we were doing. The screen is pretty small and working on that every day was actually quite tiring on the eyes. So it was a very seat of the pants kind of affair… We started working on it, immediately hacking it and developing a 3D engine for it.”</em></p>



<p>While Cuthbert was able to leverage the knowledge base of Argonaut to hack the Game Boy and open the doors for their new engine, programming it, and coming up with a game would be entirely up to him alone.</p>



<p><em>“So it was basically me, that’s it. [laughs] Just me. And then I got a few 3D, we called them shapes back then, to use to test my system with. And then I did all the 2D art and pretty much everything else in the game as well. And some of the 3D stuff was done by me as well. But the cooler shapes are done by a guy called Danny Emmett, who worked at Argonaut at the time.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-740x416.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-50x28.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1980x1114.jpg 1980w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><em>Initially when I was making the game, I just pulled upon all the games that I liked at the time. And so one of those would have been Ball Blazer. One of them would be Starglider, obviously. And the other one was a bit more of an obscure game for the ZX Spectrum called Micronaut One, which is a game where you fly through tunnels. I’d always been kind of interested in trying to kind of replicate that kind of thing into a game, at least as sort of a sub-part of the game. So I was experimenting with that and trying to get it to work and I got it to work and it was kind of cool. So we included all that into the overall game… The mission structure kind of comes from F18 Interceptor on the Amiga, which is a really cool kind of fighter flight simulator kind of game… it was like the idea of having like this game where you have these very individual missions that are very different to each other, kind of comes from that particular game”</em></p>



<p>It’s here that I think it’s worth taking a moment to look at what Eclipse actually is in comparison to X, the game it would eventually become. At its core Eclipse is a combo of two different primary gameplay loops. One is a first person tank game. Players are dropped into a three dimensional environment and given an objective to destroy a certain number of enemies while hunting down a certain number of crystals. These crystals would then need to be returned to the base. The entire time players would be burning through precious fuel which, along with missiles and shields, could be replenished by selling off one of those valuable crystals. Once the objectives are completed the player moves on to the next stage, though the state of their tank is carried over.</p>



<p>Between stages the player would fly through a 3D tunnel segment, racing against a time limit. The goal is to move as quickly as possible while dodging obstacles that will stop you dead in your tracks. Make it to the end before the time runs out and you move on to the next combat mission, fail and its game over. These tunnel segments could also be played separately from the demo’s main menu.&nbsp;<img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gamehistory.org/eclipse-the-demo-that-sold-3d-to-nintendo/images/image5.jpg"></p>



<p>The final game maintains this general flow, exploring the surface completing mission objectives, then flying through tunnels on your way to the next level. However, while the final game’s missions are obviously more diverse than those present in this demo, it does somewhat lose the risk reward system of using the very same crystals necessary to complete missions to repair your ship. Rather, in X your objectives and your currency never overlap.</p>

<p>Finally the ROM also contains an object viewer, allowing the player to freely rotate and scale the fully 3D objects used by the game. When played in emulation and blown up on a modern display the objects may look somewhat crude in this low resolution window, but on the Gameboy screen, they were like nothing a Nintendo console, let alone handheld, had ever displayed before.</p>



<p>The demo was then sent out by Argonaut founder Jez San to various publishers to see if they’d be interested in developing the demo into a full game. The demo was initially picked up by Mindscape who already had some experience publishing and developing on the Gameboy with titles like Paperboy, Marble Madness, and Gauntlet II. It is at this point, with Mindscape signing on to produce Eclipse, that our story splits off in two directions. While Nintendo would of course eventually wind up producing Eclipse into a full game. Mindscape’s time with the game would see the demo into the hands of a producer named Mark Flitman. And it would be Mark’s daughter Michelle, who would reach out to the Video Game History Foundation thirty years later.</p>



<p>When Michelle emailed the Video Game History Foundation with images of pre-release game cartridges, tapes, and extensive documentation, Frank Cifaldi and Kelsey Lewin wasted no time in getting on a plane.&nbsp;When they arrived at Mark’s home, they found a treasure trove. They set to work scanning physical documents, digitizing tapes, and dumping the contents of the various cartridges. They spent days sorting through the collection, when suddenly a random unmarked Game Boy cartridge caught their attention.&nbsp;It was Kelsey who first checked the mysterious cartridge.</p>

<p><em>“I plug it in and the first thing I see is the little astronaut and it says ‘by Dylan Cuthbert’ and I’m like, I know who that is!”&nbsp;</em>Kelsey said,<em>&nbsp;“I’m like, Oh my God, this is very similar to X, but also it has all of these other kind of tech demo type things in here. So I immediately knew it was interesting.”</em>&nbsp;Kelsey then showed the demo to frank.</p>



<p><em>“We’re playing it and we both know enough to go, oh, this is X.”</em>&nbsp;Frank confirmed,&nbsp;<em>“This is like an early version of X. And so, you know, I think it is a pretty easy assumption to go, okay, this was the demo that was maybe shopped around was my guess.”</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-768x1024.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-225x300.jpg 225w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-740x987.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8-50x67.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image8.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure>



<p>While Kelsey and Frank may not have known the story of the Eclipse demo at that moment, they knew of Dylan Cuthbert, his Game Boy game X, and the partnership with Nintendo that would eventually lead to the Super Nintendo game, Star Fox. In August of 2021, I produced a documentary on the development of the Nintendo DS game, Star Fox Command.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>Shortly after its release Frank invited me to discuss the game’s history with them on their podcast, The Video Game History Hour. During the discussion I casually told the story of the Eclipse demo and its evolution into X. Only to hear Frank wonder aloud if that was in fact&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;demo they had found. I’d not expected to learn that the demo which served as the genesis for X and eventually the entire Star Fox series, had been discovered while recording that episode. It’s on episode 52 if you’re curious to hear my live reaction.</p>



<p>That is how the Eclipse demo came into the hands of the Video Game History Foundation, but it is by no means the end of the story for Eclipse itself. One of the other companies to receive the Eclipse demo was, of course, Nintendo.</p>



<p><em>“Nintendo took a bit longer.”&nbsp;</em>Dylan recalled,<em>&nbsp;“Obviously the Japanese HQ had to see it and stuff like that. Then we were flown over to Japan to show it directly and it’s around that time that Nintendo decided to sign it and basically transfer the rights of it from Mindscape. And I still have no idea how or what Nintendo did to transfer the contract that was with Mindscape or how much they paid or anything like that. I’d really like to know actually… And that’s when I started working with Sakamoto at Nintendo. And he kind of helped guide the sort of usability of the game.”</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="543" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10.png" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10.png 900w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10-300x181.png 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10-740x446.png 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10-768x463.png 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image10-50x30.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>Cuthbert was paired up with Yoshio Sakamoto who would serve as the director on the Eclipse project. Sakamoto is perhaps best known as the producer of the 2D Metroid series including the critically acclaimed Metroid Dread which was released on Nintendo Switch in 2021. Sakamoto’s job would be to shape the incredible ambition and technical knowhow into a finished game, with that signature Nintendo polish.</p>



<p><em>“With the Nintendo touch, it kind of made it easier to play. We have things like guides that help the player know how to dock with buildings and stuff like that. And then added that sort of Nintendo humor to the game as well as some funny little secrets in there and stuff like that. But</em>&nbsp;<em>really the changes were to the missions suite. So kind of gave them a sort of story which has a little bit more of a Japanese feel to it. And so a few things of that sort of came from the Nintendo, or really the Japanese kind of mind. And then all the other stuff brought in from the original kind of British feel of the game, and it’s kind of an interesting blend of both, I think. So really, I mean, we just kind of fleshed out everything with Nintendo.”</em></p>



<p>As Eclipse grew into a full game, there was still one last change to make.</p>



<p><em>“Well, Eclipse was the original game name, it’s like the prototype name. So it’s kind of the thing that I thought up in the very initial stages of the game. It was never intended to be really actually called that, but I think maybe the Mindscape signing was probably for ‘Eclipse’. I don’t think they were interested in changing the name. But for Nintendo, obviously Nintendo put a lot more effort into making sure there aren’t any name clashes and stuff like that. So a whole bunch of names were put forward. I think Lunar Chase was one of the ones I also put forward for them when they were doing their name check and it’s the one that kind of came through that was okay. And so we gave it that title for a long time.”</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-740x416.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-50x28.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11-1980x1114.jpg 1980w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image11.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The name Lunar Chase stuck with the project, to the point that the planned english release of the game, which eventually found its way online, still bears that original title. For this reason Lunar Chase is generally, to this day, still thought of as the unofficial western title for the game.</p>



<p><em>“But then about a month or two before release, suddenly Yamauchi&nbsp;</em>(Hiroshi Yamauchi was the President of Nintendo from 1949-2002)<em>&nbsp;after playing the game, he calls up Sakamoto at 8:00 a.m. or 7 a.m. in the morning, kind of woke him up he said, and basically said, ‘okay, this is fine, but you’ve got to call the game X’. And so then Sakamoto came in that morning and came to me, came to my desk and said like, ‘okay, Yamauchi called me directly and said, we’re calling the game X’. Okay, all right. And that was the name from there on.”</em></p>



<p>Despite never officially leaving Japan, X would go on to be regarded as one of the single most important games ever made. It spawned the creation of Star Fox and contributed to Nintendo’s shift in focus to 3D games. It helped launch the career of Dylan Cuthbert who would go on to work with both Nintendo and Sony, before starting his own company, Q-Games, in 2001. In 2010 Q-Games partnered with Nintendo to release X-Scape, a DSiWare sequel to the original X.</p>

<p>X itself has never been re-released or given an official release outside of Japan. With the closure of the 3DS eShop, the last digital shop to host DSiWare titles, X-Scape cannot be legally purchased.</p>



<p><em>“I’d like to see, specifically more people able to play X-Scape or X-Returns, as it’s called in Japan… It’s just a shame that not really enough people played it just because it was hard to access, being on the DSi. I’d like to see that somehow get resurrected somewhere, even if it’s like a remaster or something. There are a lot of very good DsiWare games. I would love for Nintendo to come up with a way to give people access to that catalog. We didn’t just make X-Scape on it. We also made Starship Defender and Reflect Missile (called Trajectile in some regions). And they’re all really good games, but just no one really got to see them because they’re on DSiWare. And so I’m hoping that Nintendo is going to do something about that at some point. And with X itself, I mean, obviously only the Japanese version can be played right now officially if you buy a cartridge and a very old Gameboy.”</em></p>



<p>While thanks to the efforts of Mark and Michelle Flitman along with the Video Game History Foundation, we’re able to gain new insights into the history of these games, the public’s legal access to them is borderline non-existent.</p>



<p>“<em>When we’re going into these houses we never really know what to expect and a lot of that’s because you can’t suss that information out ahead of time.”&nbsp;</em>Frank told me.<em>&nbsp;“People don’t tend to know what’s historically important because they’re not historians. We go into these things going like okay this could be a total bust. Like he might just have a bunch of like final versions of his games and business cards. Or, in cases like this he has like kind of a holy relic of a very important game series. It keeps the job really interesting and honestly it’s more wins than than duds in this line of work. Especially in that era of video games a lot of material was made and scrapped and just kind of left around so there’s still a lot to discover. If you got a basement with this kind of thing you should probably get in touch”</em></p>



<p>As for Dylan he’d love to go back to revisit that world again one day.</p>



<p><em>“I’d love to make a sequel, you know? I mean, it took a long time to make the first sequel. It was like 20 years, I think since the original game came out is when we released the first sequel to the game. But maybe we can do that in a shorter time frame at some point. But it depends. It’s a bit of a niche game, but I think there are still a lot of people who would like that kind of game still. So I’d definitely like to have a shot at it at some point.”</em></p>

<p>Aspirin is an inexpensive and readily available medication that could benefit cancer treatments, preventing metastatic cancer spread and reducing vascular complications, finds new meta-analysis study.</p><p>The Welsh Aspirin Group in Cardiff University has published a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the impacts of the use of aspirin as a treatment for cancer.</p><p>The research looked at the results of 118 observational studies based upon around a million patients with a wide range of cancers, finding that taking a daily low-dose (75 or 81 mg/day) of aspirin was associated with a 20% reduction in deaths from cancer and in deaths from all causes.</p><p>“Aspirin was first shown in 1968 to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer, as it targets a number of key biological mechanisms of cancer, reducing risks of metastatic cancer spread and vascular complications in cancer patients.” said Peter Elwood, Honorary Professor at Cardiff University.</p>

<p>Aspirin is known to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The research aimed to evaluate the risks of the use of aspirin in cancer treatments, including the risks associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The report from the Welsh Aspirin Group examined studies of stomach bleeding associated with aspirin, and shows that such bleeding attributable to aspirin is less serious than gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with stomach ulcers or stomach infection, and there is no valid evidence of any fatal bleeding attributable to aspirin.</p><p>The researchers concluded that, given the relative safety of aspirin, it should be promoted as a treatment for cancer due to the consistent evidence of reduction in metastatic cancer spread and the earlier aspirin is commenced after a diagnosis of cancer has been made, the greater the befit from aspirin.</p><p>“We believe that - given its relative safety and its favourable effects - the use of aspirin as an additional treatment of cancer is fully justified.</p><p>“As aspirin is inexpensive and readily available in almost every country. It’s promotion could have benefits worldwide, and with the present delays in specialist services for patients suspected to have cancer, this reduction could be of enormous possible benefit,” added Professor Elwood.</p><p>The research, <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-023-02506-5#:~:text=These%20explain%20the%20observed%20reductions,mortality%20associated%20with%20aspirin%20use.">Aspirin and cancer treatment: systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evidence: for and against</a></em>, was published in British Journal of Cancer.</p>

<p dir="auto">Zen is an open-source system-wide ad-blocker and privacy guard for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It works by setting up a proxy that intercepts HTTP requests from all applications, and blocks those serving ads, tracking scripts that monitor your behavior, malware, and other unwanted content. By operating at the system level, Zen can protect against threats that browser extensions cannot, such as trackers embedded in desktop applications and operating system components. Zen comes with many pre-installed filters, but also allows you to easily add hosts files and EasyList-style filters, enabling you to tailor your protection to your specific needs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>LOS ANGELES</i> – A YouTuber pilot was sentenced today to six months in federal prison for obstructing a federal investigation by deliberately destroying the wreckage of an airplane that he intentionally crashed in Santa Barbara County to gain online views.</p>

<p>Trevor Daniel Jacob, 30, of Lompoc, was sentenced by United States District Judge John F. Walter.</p>

<p>Jacob pleaded guilty on June 30 to one count of destruction and concealment with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation.</p>

<p>Jacob is an experienced pilot, skydiver and former Olympic athlete who had secured a sponsorship from a company that sold various products, including a wallet. Pursuant to the sponsorship deal, Jacob agreed to promote the company’s wallet in a YouTube video that he would post.</p>

<p>On November 24, 2021, Jacob took off in his airplane from Lompoc City Airport on a solo flight purportedly destined for Mammoth Lakes. Jacob did not intend to reach his destination, but instead planned to eject from his aircraft during the flight and video himself parachuting to the ground and his airplane as it descended and crashed.</p>

<p>Prior to taking off, Jacob mounted several video cameras on different parts of the airplane and equipped himself with a parachute, video camera and selfie stick. Approximately 35 minutes after taking off, while flying above the Los Padres National Forest near Santa Maria, Jacob ejected from the airplane and videoed himself parachuting to the ground.</p>

<p>Using the video camera mounted on the selfie stick and the video cameras he mounted on the airplane, Jacob was able to record the airplane as it descended and crashed into a dry brush area in Los Padres National Forest. After parachuting to the ground, Jacob hiked to the location of the wreck and recovered the data containing the video recording of his flight and the crash of the airplane.</p>

<p>On November 26, 2021, Jacob informed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about the plane crash. The NTSB, which launched an investigation into the crash on or about that same day, told Jacob that he was responsible for preserving the wreckage so the agency could examine it. Jacob agreed to determine the crash location and provide both the coordinates of the downed plane and videos of the crash to NTSB investigators. Three days later, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched its own investigation into the plane crash.</p>

<p>In the weeks following the plane crash, Jacob lied to investigators that he did not know the wreckage’s location. In fact, on December 10, 2021, Jacob and a friend flew by helicopter to the wreckage site. There, Jacob used straps to secure the wreckage, which the helicopter lifted and carried to Rancho Sisquoc in Santa Barbara County, where it was loaded onto a trailer attached to Jacob’s pickup truck.</p>

<p>Jacob drove the wreckage to Lompoc City Airport and unloaded it in a hangar. He then cut up and destroyed the airplane wreckage and, over the course of a few days, deposited the detached parts of the wrecked airplane into trash bins at the airport and elsewhere, which was done with the intent to obstruct federal authorities from investigating the November 24 plane crash.</p>

<p>On December 23, 2021, Jacob uploaded a YouTube video titled, “I Crashed My Airplane,” that contained a promotion of the wallet and depicted him parachuting from the plane and the aircraft’s subsequent crash. Jacob intended to make money through the video.</p>

<p>Jacob lied to federal investigators when he submitted an aircraft accident incident report that falsely indicated that the aircraft experienced a full loss of power approximately 35 minutes after takeoff. Jacob also lied to an FAA aviation safety inspector when he said the airplane’s engine had quit and, because he could not identify any safe landing options, he had parachuted out of the plane.</p>

<p>“It appears that [Jacob] exercised exceptionally poor judgment in committing this offense,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “[Jacob] most likely committed this offense to generate social media and news coverage for himself and to obtain financial gain. Nevertheless, this type of ‘daredevil’ conduct cannot be tolerated.”</p>

<p>The United States Department of Transportation – Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The NTSB and FAA provided substantial assistance.</p>

<p>Assistant United States Attorneys Dominique Caamano and Dennis Mitchell of the Environmental Crimes and Consumer Protection Section prosecuted this case.</p>

<p>After a spy camera designed to look like a towel hook was purchased on Amazon and illegally used for months to capture photos of a minor in her private bathroom, Amazon was sued.</p>
<p>The plaintiff—a former Brazilian foreign exchange student then living in West Virginia—argued that Amazon had inspected the camera three times and its safety team had failed to prevent allegedly severe, foreseeable harms still affecting her today.</p>
<p>Amazon hoped the court would dismiss the suit, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/west-virginia/wvsdce/3:2023cv00046/235914/24/">arguing</a> that the platform wasn't responsible for the alleged criminal conduct harming the minor. But after nearly eight months deliberating, a judge recently largely denied the tech giant's motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>Amazon's biggest problem persuading the judge was seemingly the product descriptions that the platform approved. An <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-amended-complaint-3-31-2023.pdf">amended complaint</a> included a photo from Amazon's product listing that showed bathroom towels hanging on hooks that disguised the hidden camera. Text on that product image promoted the spycams, boasting that they "won't attract attention" because each hook appears to be "a very ordinary hook."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad.png" data-height="1152" data-width="1940" alt="Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint."><img alt="Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad-640x380.png" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad-1280x760.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad.png" data-height="1152" data-width="1940">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because "Amazon approved product descriptions suggesting consumers use" the spycam "to record private moments in a bathroom," US district judge Robert Chambers wrote, "Amazon cannot claim shock when a consumer does just that."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"These allegations raise a reasonable inference Amazon sold a camera knowing it would be used to record a third party in a bathroom without their consent," Chambers wrote.</p>
<p>Perhaps most alarming to the plaintiff, Amazon's Product Safety Team specifically inspected the camera to "ensure" that Amazon wasn't platforming a product being used to “infringe privacy,” “surreptitiously record others for sexual purposes,” or “create and store child sex abuse material.” That review allegedly did not prevent the spy cam from being used to do just that, the lawsuit alleged, putting consumers at risk of alleged harms suffered by the plaintiff, including "chronic tremors, insomnia, headaches, nausea, hypotension with associated blurred vision, dizziness, compulsive overeating, avoidance behavior, and paranoia."</p>
<p>In addition to refusing blame, Amazon unsuccessfully argued that none of those harms could be considered physical injury. To the contrary, Chambers wrote that "if proven," the plaintiff's physical harms are considered "severe" because "emotional trauma inflicted during a child’s 'tender years' has an 'indelible effect' from which 'they may never recover.'"</p>
<p>A lawyer for the plaintiff, Lee Javins, told Ars that he thinks this is an important issue for the court to explore. He commended the court for making the right decision after taking its time "to provide a thorough legal analysis" on legal theories that he said "haven't come up a lot with today's technology."</p>
<h2>A potentially “dangerous ruling” for spycam industry</h2>
<p>The plaintiff hopes a jury will decide that Amazon "had wanton, conscious, reckless, and outrageous indifference to the health, safety, and welfare of children."</p>
<p>She has also alleged that Amazon "conspired" with the spycam seller to "market and distribute a defective product both knew was intended and used for illegal and criminal purposes." Not only did Amazon allegedly "shape" the "marketing and promotion of the camera" by controlling "how products are depicted and the content of product listings and descriptions," but Amazon also "boosted the camera’s sales" with its "specialized algorithms," the lawsuit alleged.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>A loss for Amazon could put the online retailer on the hook for punitive damages. Amazon could also be ordered to stop selling the spycam used to harm the plaintiff and any products considered "identical" to that spycam. Chambers wrote that proving "foreseeability" of harms "is key" to defeating Amazon's defense.</p>
<p>Tech legal expert Eric Goldman <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/12/amazon-may-be-liable-for-merchants-spycam-m-s-v-amazon.htm">wrote</a> that a victory for the plaintiff could be considered "a dangerous ruling for the spy cam industry and for Amazon," because "the court’s analysis could indicate that all surreptitious hook cameras are categorically illegal to sell." That could prevent completely legal uses of cameras designed to look like clothes hooks, Goldman wrote, such as hypothetical in-home surveillance uses.</p>
<p>Now, discovery will proceed as the plaintiff can argue her case at trial. The trial could shed more light on "what Amazon’s Product Safety team thought when it evaluated this item," Goldman wrote.</p>
<p>Currently, Amazon advertises several "clothes hook hidden camera" products when users search for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22bathroom+spy+camera%22&amp;crid=WK1AEHNZLNQE&amp;sprefix=bathroom+spy+camera+%2Caps%2C96&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">"bathroom spy camera,"</a> an Ars search found, but it's unclear if the spy cam at the center of this lawsuit is still available on Amazon.</p>
<p>In his blog, Goldman pointed to an Amazon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJDK7VLM/?tag=arstech20-20">online listing</a> that appeared to be the spycam in question. However, Javins told Ars that while that particular listing looked like the "same type of camera," it had a different product description from the spycam sold in the case, where "the whole vibe" of the listing "was just kind of creepy."</p>
<p>Ars unsuccessfully attempted to contact Amazon for comment on the judge's order and the online listing Goldman found. Shortly after submitting that request, Amazon appears to have removed the online listing but has not yet offered Ars any explanation.</p>

</picture><p><span>Fluorescent staining reveals the extensive network of blood vessels of the dura mater. These vessels contain T cells that, in a mouse model of chronic high blood pressure, become activated and produce conditions that can lead to dementia-like symptoms.</span><span>Image courtesy of the Iadecola lab.</span></p></div><p>A study supported by the National Institutes of Health suggests that the response of immune system cells inside the protective covering surrounding the brain may contribute to the cognitive decline that can occur in a person with chronic high blood pressure. This finding, published in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, may shed light on new ways to counteract the effects of high blood pressure on cognition. The study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a part of NIH.</p>

<p>“The role of immune signaling in cognitive decline is critically important to understand,” said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., program director, NINDS. “These findings offer insight into how signaling from the immune system could contribute to symptoms of cognitive decline that ultimately result in dementia diagnoses.”</p>

<p>Hypertension affects more than 1 billion people worldwide and can lead to a decline in cognitive function including when a stroke occurs, but also even when a person with high blood pressure does not have a stroke. However, efforts to control cognitive loss in people who do not experience a stroke with treatments that lower blood pressure have shown mixed results. The findings of this mouse study suggest that immune cells around and within the brain become abnormally activated under conditions that mimic a common form of hypertension, and this activation leads to impaired brain function.</p>

<p>Using a mouse model of high blood pressure, the researchers led by Costantino Iadecola, M.D., director and chair of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, New York City, found abnormally increased levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), a chemical normally released in the body to activate the immune system, in the cerebral spinal fluid and the brain. Previously, Dr. Iadecola’s team <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/press-releases/hold-salt-gut-reaction-may-impair-brains-mice">showed that a high salt diet increased IL-17 in the gut</a>, which was followed by cognitive impairment. These new findings add to that story by showing that IL-17 is acting within the brain itself. It’s also notable that these experiments use a different mouse model, called the DOCA salt model, that more closely mimics a common form of hypertension in people.</p>

<p>“This is currently the most realistic model of hypertension that we have,” said Dr. Iadecola. “The DOCA mouse simulates low-renin hypertension, which is a common type of hypertension in people, particularly among Black Americans.”</p>

<p>Further work showed that, once in the brain, IL-17 turned on immune cells responsible for activating inflammation and fighting off infections, known as macrophages. A series of experiments confirmed that these macrophages are important for the observed decline in cognition, as both mice in which the receptor for IL-17 was deleted in brain macrophages and those that had their brain macrophages depleted showed no effects of high blood pressure on cognitive function despite having other symptoms of hypertension.</p>

<p>Researchers still sought the source of the IL-17 acting on the brain macrophages. Based on their previous work, the researchers’ initial hypothesis was that the gut releases IL-17, which then travels to the brain through the blood stream. Once there, it sets off a reaction that damages the ability of brain blood vessels to respond appropriately to increased brain activity. However, blocking the brain blood vessels’ ability to respond to IL-17 only partially rescued cognitive impairment, suggesting that there was another source of IL-17 acting on the brain.</p>

<p>One clue came from other recent studies suggesting that one layer of the protective covering of the brain, known as dura mater, contains immune T cells that can both secrete IL-17 and can affect the behavior of mice. Using special mice where cells light up fluorescent green when they make IL-17, the researchers confirmed that hypertension increases IL-17 in the dura mater which is then released into the tissue. Normally, barriers exist within the protective covering of the brain, called the meninges, to prevent unwanted spillage into the brain. However, this barrier appeared to be disrupted in the mice with experimentally induced hypertension, and this disruption allowed IL-17 to enter the cerebral spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Two additional experiments helped to confirm this hypothesis. First, a drug was used to prevent T cell movement from the lymph nodes into the meninges. Second, an antibody was used to block the activity of T cells in the meninges. In both cases, cognitive function was restored in the mice with hypertension, suggesting that targeting overactive T cells could be a new treatment approach worth exploring.</p>

<p>“Together, our data suggest two different effects are caused by hypertension,” said Dr. Iadecola. “One is IL-17 acting on blood vessels, but this appears to be relatively minor. A more prominent, central effect is caused by cells in the meninges releasing IL-17 that directly affects immune cells in the brain. It is these immune cells, activated by signaling from the meninges, that ultimately affect the brain in a way that causes cognitive impairment.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Iadecola and his team are now looking to connect the dots between the activation of immune cells in the meninges and decreased cognitive function. <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/press-releases/pathogenic-tau-and-cognitive-impairment-are-precipitated-high-salt-diet">Previous work by the group</a> suggested a connection between a high salt diet which suppressed the production of the chemical nitric oxide in brain&nbsp;vessels that in turn led to buildup of tau,&nbsp;a toxic protein that forms clumps in neurons affected by Alzheimer’s disease. The present findings also show suppression of nitric oxide production within brain&nbsp;vessels, and whether this also leads to an increase in tau production is currently under investigation.</p>
