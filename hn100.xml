            <span>Abstract:</span>  Recently, Sukbae Lee et al. reported inspiring experimental findings on the
atmospheric superconductivity of a modified lead apatite crystal (LK-99) at
room temperature (<a data-doi="10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061" href="https://doi.org/10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061" rel="external noopener nofollow">https://doi.org/10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061</a>, arXiv: <a data-arxiv-id="2307.12008" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008">2307.12008</a>, arXiv:
<a data-arxiv-id="2307.12037" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">2307.12037</a>). They claimed that the synthesized LK-99 materials exhibit the
Meissner levitation phenomenon of superconductors and have a superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) higher than 400 K. Here, for the first time, we
successfully verify and synthesize the LK-99 crystals which can be magnetically
levitated with larger levitated angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room
temperature. It is expected to realize the true potential of room temperature,
non-contact superconducting magnetic levitation in near future.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  A material called LK-99, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the
composition Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O ($0.9&lt;x&lt;1.1$) has been reported to
be an above-room-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. It is hard to
expect that it will be straightforward for other groups to reproduce the
original results. We provide here some remarks which may be helpful for a
success.

<p>The UK’s Royal Mail today shared images of the eight Special Stamps they are issuing to <a href="https://terrypratchett.com/discworld/royal-mail-40th-anniversary-discworld-stamps/">celebrate Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series</a>, marking the 40th&nbsp;anniversary of&nbsp;<em>The Colour of Magic</em>, first book in the series. The stamps can be&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.royalmail.com/special-stamp-issues/terry-pratchetts-discworld?cid=CMAUG23_OS_0228_04">pre-ordered now</a>, and will be available for general purchase on August 10.</p>



<p>The stamps feature Rincewind, The Librarian, Granny Weatherwax, Sam Vimes, and Great A’Tuin, as well as specially commissioned artworks of Death and Mort, Tiffany Aching and Moist von Lipwig, all by artist Paul Kidby, who was Pratchett’s preferred illustrator for the Discworld.

<p dir="auto">Cycle accurate Mega Drive emulator. Verilog version of <a href="https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-MD">Nuked MD</a>.
The goal of this project is to emulate Sega Mega Drive chipset accurately as possible using decapped chips photos.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mega Drive chipset</h2>
<p dir="auto">Sega Mega Drive chipset consist of 6 integrated circuits + RAM chips:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Motorola 68000 (Main CPU)</li>
<li>Zilog Z80 (Sound CPU)</li>
<li>Yamaha YM7101 (VDP)</li>
<li>Yamaha YM2612/YM3438 (FM)</li>
<li>Yamaha YM6045 (Arbiter)</li>
<li>Yamaha YM6046 (IO)</li>
<li>TMSS (later revisions)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are number of variations of chipsets across mega drive revisions. For example early revisions use NMOS 68k and Z80 chips, while later models switched to CMOS versions. Yamaha later integrated their chips into one big chip named FC1004.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nuked-MD-FPGA currently targets NMOS 68k, NMOS Z80 and FC1004. No real mega drive used such combination, but Model 1 VA7 would be closest (CMOS 68k, NMOS Z80 and FC1004). Other variants possibly will be emulated in the future.</p>

    <p>Global warming not only increases ocean temperatures, it triggers a cascade of effects that are stripping the seas of oxygen. Fish are already moving to new waters in search of oxygen, and scientists are warning of the long-term threat to fish species and marine ecosystems.<br></p>

<div>
<p>Off the coast of southeastern China, one particular fish species is booming: the oddly named Bombay duck, a long, slim fish with a distinctive, gaping jaw and a texture like jelly. When research ships trawl the seafloor off that coast, they now catch upwards of 440 pounds of the gelatinous fish per hour — a more than tenfold increase over a decade ago. “It’s monstrous,” says University of British Columbia fisheries researcher Daniel Pauly of the explosion in numbers.</p>
<p>The reason for this mass invasion, says Pauly, is extremely low oxygen levels in these polluted waters. Fish species that can’t cope with less oxygen have fled, while the Bombay duck, part of a small subset of species that is physiologically better able to deal with less oxygen, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-021-01130-7">has moved in</a>.</p>
<p>The boom is making some people happy, since Bombay duck is perfectly edible. But the influx provides a peek at a bleak future for China and for the planet as a whole. As the atmosphere warms, oceans around the world are becoming ever more deprived of oxygen, forcing many species to migrate from their usual homes. Researchers expect many places to experience a decline in species diversity, ending up with just those few species that can cope with the harsher conditions. Lack of ecosystem diversity means lack of resilience. “Deoxygenation is a big problem,” Pauly summarizes.</p>
<p>Our future ocean — warmer and oxygen-deprived — will not only hold fewer kinds of fish, but also smaller, stunted fish and, to add insult to injury, more greenhouse-gas producing bacteria, scientists say. The tropics will empty as fish move to more oxygenated waters, says Pauly, and those specialist fish already living at the poles will face extinction.</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>Since the 1960s, the area of low-oxygen water in the open ocean has increased by 1.7 million square miles. </blockquote>
</div>
                        

<p>Researchers complain that the oxygen problem doesn’t get the attention it deserves, with ocean acidification and warming grabbing the bulk of both news headlines and academic research. Just this April, for example, headlines screamed that global surface waters were hotter than they have ever been — a shockingly balmy average of <a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/">70 degrees F</a>. That’s obviously not good for marine life. But when researchers take the time to compare the three effects — warming, acidification, and deoxygenation — the impacts of low oxygen are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01370-3">the worst</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>“That’s not so surprising,” says Wilco Verberk, an eco-physiologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands. “If you run out of oxygen, the other problems are inconsequential.” Fish, like other animals, need to breathe.</p>
<hr><p>Oxygen levels in the world’s oceans have already dropped more than 2 percent between 1960 and 2010, and they are expected to decline up to <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163855">7 percent</a> below the 1960 level over the next century. Some patches are worse than others — the top of the northeast Pacific has lost more than 15 percent of its oxygen. According to the IPCC’s 2019 special report on the oceans, from 1970 to 2010, the volume of “oxygen minimum zones” in the global oceans — where big fish can’t thrive but jellyfish can — increased by between <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/">3 and 8 percent</a>.</p>
<p>The oxygen drop is driven by a few factors. First, the laws of physics dictate that warmer water can hold less dissolved gas than cooler water (this is why a warm soda is less fizzy than a cold one). As our world warms, the surface waters of our oceans lose oxygen, in addition to other dissolved gases. This simple solubility effect accounts for about half of the observed oxygen loss seen so far in the upper 1,000 meters of the ocean.</p>

<p>Deeper down, oxygen levels are largely governed by currents that mix surface waters downward, and this too is being affected by climate change. Melting ice adds fresh, less-dense water that resists downward mixing in key regions, and the high rate of atmospheric warming at the poles, as compared to the equator, also dampens winds that drive ocean currents.</p>
<p>Finally, bacteria living in the water, which feed off phytoplankton and other organic gunk as it falls to the seafloor, consume oxygen. This effect can be massive along coastlines, where fertilizer runoff feeds algae blooms, which in turn feed oxygen-gobbling bacteria. This creates ever more “dead zones,” including the infamous one in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Researchers have even <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01096-w">suggested</a> that the rise of microplastics pollution has the potential to exacerbate the low-oxygen problem. This theory predicts that if zooplankton fill up on microplastics instead of phytoplankton — their usual prey — phytoplankton will proliferate, again feeding all those oxygen-gobbling bacteria on their way to the seafloor.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.unesco.org/go2ne">Global Ocean Oxygen Network</a> — a scientific group set up as part of the United Nation’s Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, 2021-2030 — reports that since the 1960s, the area of low-oxygen water in the open ocean has increased by 1.7 million square miles. That’s an area a little more than half the size of Canada. By 2080, a 2021study<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL095370"> reported</a>, more than 70 percent of the global oceans will experience noticeable deoxygenation.</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>Low oxygen levels affect almost everything, including fish growth, reproduction, activity levels, and outright survival. </blockquote>
</div>
                        

<p>In 2018, hundreds of researchers concerned with oxygen loss signed the <a href="https://www.ocean-oxygen.org/declaration">Kiel Declaration</a> to urgently call for more awareness of the problem, alongside work to limit pollution and warming. Researchers are now in the midst of establishing a <a href="https://oceanrep.geomar.de/id/eprint/54665/">Global Ocean Oxygen Database and ATlas (GO2DAT)</a> to consolidate and map all the data.</p>

<div>
<p>Andrew Babbin, a biogeochemist at MIT who is on the steering committee for GO2DAT, in 2021 <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GB007001">mapped out</a> huge areas of extremely low oxygen in the Pacific. “It’s concerning for sure,” says Babbin, who hopes to repeat the mapping exercise in a decade or so to see how things change. One issue, he notes, is that low-oxygen conditions tend to host a class of anoxic bacteria that produce methane or nitrous oxide — potent greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Modelling the net impacts of the three factors — solubility, mixing, and microbiology — has proven tricky. “Any one of those is hard,” says Babbin. “And then you put them all together, and it’s dramatically difficult to make any predictions.” In the tropics, for example, one model suggests that a shifting balance of biological factors that deplete oxygen, versus ocean mixing that delivers oxygen, will drive oxygen levels down until about 2150 but then <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05034-y">raise them</a> — a spot of potentially good news for tropical fish. On the whole, though, climate models seem to have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0152-2">underestimated</a> changes in oxygen levels, which have been dropping faster than expected.</p>

<p>The impacts on marine life are going to be complicated — and not good.</p>
<p>In general, a hot fish has a higher metabolism and needs more oxygen. Trout, for example, need five to six times more dissolved oxygen when waters are a balmy 75 degrees F than when they are a chilly 41 degrees F. So as waters warm and the oxygen seeps out, many marine creatures take a double hit. “Fish require a lot of oxygen, particularly the large ones we like to eat,” says Babbin. </p>
<p>Right now, there are about 6 milligrams of oxygen per liter of seawater in the tropics, and 11 milligrams per liter at the colder poles. If levels drop below 2 milligrams g (a 60 to 80 percent reduction), as they often do in some patches, the water is officially hypoxic — too low in oxygen to sustain many species. But subtler drops can also have a big impact. Fish already expend tens of times more energy to breathe than people do, notes Pauly, since they must pump the paltry oxygen out of viscous water.</p>
<p>The effects of low oxygen are well known to mountaineers, who experience headaches and potentially fatal confusion at high altitudes. Fish often try to swim away from low oxygen waters, but if they can’t escape, they become sluggish. Low oxygen levels affect <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/722899">almost everything</a> across the board, including fish growth, reproduction, activity levels, and outright survival. A host of genetic and metabolic changes can help fish conserve energy, but only within limits. In general, larger fish are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.16319">more affected</a> simply because their body-volume-to-gill ratio is larger, making it harder to feed their cells with oxygen<strong>. </strong>Overfishing has already had the effect of decreasing the number of large fish in the ocean; deoxygenation looks set to exacerbate that effect, says Verberk.
</p>

<div>
  <blockquote>Even if CO2 emissions stopped immediately, the oceans are already committed to a fourfold greater oxygen loss.</blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>The long-term chronic effects of slightly decreased oxygen levels are harder to evaluate than the short-term effects of hypoxia, says Verberk, and researchers have <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/721468">urgently called</a> for more research on the subject. “For mild hypoxia over longer terms, there’s not that many studies, but it’s likely to have quite a strong impact,” he says. “If you continually have 7 percent less energy [from 7 percent less oxygen], that’s going to accumulate to quite a large deficit.”</p>
<p>Fish are already moving to find more oxygen. Those living in deeper waters may move down to colder, and therefore more oxygenated waters, while fish living in the top few hundred meters of the water column, like coastal rockfish, may move toward the surface to catch a breath. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15821">study</a> of California reef fish from 1995 to 2009, 23 species moved up an average of 8.7 meters per decade toward the surface as oxygen levels declined. In the tropical northeast Atlantic, tuna have been driven into a narrower layer of water by oxygen declines; overall, they lost <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1304">15 percent</a> of their available habitat from 1960 to 2010.
</p>
<p>While warming and deoxygenation often go hand in hand, the two effects are not completely matched everywhere, all the time, says Verberk. The result is a patchwork of areas too hot or too low in oxygen for various fish to thrive, leading to a mishmash of different escape routes. Researchers are currently trying to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2721-y">trying to map</a> the anticipated effects for different species, studying how temperature and oxygen might restrict their future habitats and how those ranges will overlap with each other.</p>

<p>Once in waters where they can breathe, fish will then have to see what food they can find — and what predators they need to avoid. “Low oxygen is going to be a trigger to move to other places, but those other places are not empty,” says Verberk. “They will encounter other animals living there. It’s going to change competitive interactions between species.” Crabs, says Pauly, are currently marching on the Antarctic as those waters warm and will feast on unprotected mollusks. “There will be a mass destruction,” he says.</p>
<p>Over the past century, says Pauly, the greatest pressure on marine life has been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419307644">overfishing</a>, which has caused huge declines in fish numbers. That could change. If we get overfishing under control, he continues, climate-related pressures will pose the biggest problem for marine life in the coming decades. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22584-4">2021 paper</a> showed that the oceans are already committed to a fourfold greater oxygen loss, even if CO2 emissions stop immediately.

<p>If you chart out the trends in warming and oxygen loss, the cataclysmic endpoint for the ocean thousands of years from now would be “a soup that you cannot live in,” says Pauly. The ocean already has sporadic hypoxic zones, he says, “but you could imagine all the dead zones of the world coalescing into one, and that is the end of the thing.” If we don’t get a handle on greenhouse gas emissions, he says, “we have to expect this to happen.”</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    <!-- <strong> -->
                    We present "Magic123", a two-stage coarse-to-fine solution for high-quality, textured 3D meshes
                    generation from a single unposed image in the wild using both 2D and 3D priors. In the first stage,
                    we optimize a neural radiance field to produce a coarse geometry. In the second stage, we adopt a
                    memory-efficient differentiable mesh representation to yield a high-resolution mesh with a visually
                    appealing texture. In both stages, the 3D content is learned through reference view supervision and
                    novel views guided by both 2D and 3D diffusion priors. We introduce a single tradeoff parameter
                    between the 2D and 3D priors to control exploration (more imaginative) and exploitation (more
                    precise) of the generated geometry. Additionally, We employ textual inversion and monocular depth
                    regularization to encourage consistent appearances across views and to prevent degenerate solutions,
                    respectively.
                    Magic123 demonstrates a significant improvement over previous image-to-3D techniques, as validated
                    through extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse real-world images.

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2023 third quarter ended July 1, 2023. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $81.8 billion, down 1 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.26, up 5 percent year over year.&nbsp;
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “From education to the environment, we are continuing to advance our values, while championing innovation that enriches the lives of our customers and leaves the world better than we found it.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“Our June quarter year-over-year business performance improved from the March quarter, and our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in every geographic segment,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “During the quarter, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $26 billion, returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, and continued to invest in our long-term growth plans.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on August 17, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 14, 2023.

</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">This project is a simple example of how we can use diffusion models to colorize black and white images.</p>
<p dir="auto">This implementation uses the LAB color space, a 3 channel alternative to the RGB color space.
The "L" (Lightness) channel in this space is equivalent to a greyscale image: it represents the luminous intensity of each pixel. The two other channels are used to represent the color of each pixel.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>To train the model, we first load color images and convert them to LAB.
Then, we add noise only to the color channels, keeping the L channel constant. The model gets this channel "for free" because it doesn't need to learn how to predict the greyscale image: it is always known at train and test time.
</p></div>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ErwannMillon/Color-diffusion/blob/main/visualization/forward_diff.gif"><img src="https://github.com/ErwannMillon/Color-diffusion/raw/main/visualization/forward_diff.gif" width="128" height="128" data-animated-image=""></a>
</p>
<b>Forward Diffusion Process</b>

<p dir="auto"><em>Note that we actually don't need to go through all of the steps of the diffusion process to get to timestep t. Our forward diffusion process is non-Markovian, but the entire diffusion process is shown for illustrative purposes</em></p>
<div dir="auto"><p>The model is a UNet that takes a 3 channel LAB input (the ground-truth greyscale channel concatenated with noised AB channels) and outputs a 2 channel prediction of the color noise.
</p></div>

</p>
<b>Forward diffusion and denoising at train time</b>

<p>
In addition to receiving the greyscale channel as input, the UNet is also conditioned on features extracted from the greyscale channel. Intermediate feature maps from an encoder (implemented as the first half of a UNet) are concatenated with the features of the main denoising UNet throughout the downsampling stage of the forward pass.
</p><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Future Work / Ideas</h2>
<p dir="auto">This was just a quick proof of concept to satisfy my curiosity and get a feel for training diffusion models from scratch, so the results are very basic. There are many ways this project could be improved, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Using pretrained face recognition networks like ArcFace or FaceNet as feature extractors to get the conditioning features</li>
<li>Implementing cross attention on the embeddings</li>
<li>Pretraining the greyscale feature extractor as the encoder stage of a greyscale autoencoder</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">References</h2>
<p dir="auto">A lot of code for the dataset and LAB color operations was adapted from moein-sharitania's colorization project, which used Conditional GANs
<a href="https://github.com/moein-shariatnia/Deep-Learning">https://github.com/moein-shariatnia/Deep-Learning</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I implemented optional dynamic thresholding as in Assembly AI's Minimagen project (the Assembly AI blog posts are excellent for getting a deep understanding of the maths and concepts behind diffusion models)

<p dir="auto">The UNet architecture was adapted from denoising-diffusion-pytorch

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>bash download_dataset.sh</code> to download the CelebA dataset and extract it</p>
<p dir="auto">Use inference.py for command line colorization.
<code>python inference.py --image-path &lt;IMG_PATH&gt; --checkpoint &lt;CKPT_PATH&gt; --output &lt;OUTPUT_PATH&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Or run
<code>python app.py</code> for a simple gradio web UI</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>Using the full capabilities of the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer, researchers from the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory not only demonstrated best practices for scientific computing on current quantum systems but also produced an intriguing scientific result. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>By modeling singlet fission — <span>in which absorption of a single photon of light by a molecule produces two excited states</span> — the team confirmed that the linear H<sub>4</sub> molecule’s energetic levels match the fission process’s requirements. The linear H<sub>4</sub> molecule is, simply, a molecule made of four hydrogen atoms arranged in a linear fashion. A molecule’s energetic levels are the energies of each quantum state involved in a phenomenon, such as singlet fission, and how they relate and compare with one another. The fact that the linear molecule’s energetic levels are conducive to singlet fission could prove to be useful knowledge in the overall effort to develop more efficient solar panels. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“<span>This is one of the leading motivating factors behind singlet fission — conventional solar cells have a theoretical maximum efficiency of about 33%, but it has been postulated that materials that exhibit singlet fission can break that limit and can be more efficient,” said Daniel Claudino, a research scientist in ORNL’s Quantum Computational Science group and the project’s principal investigator. “The downside is that to understand fundamentally whether a certain material exhibits singlet fission is very hard. There is a specific energetic requirement, and it's difficult to find materials that fulfill it.” </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>With its high accuracy for a manageable computational cost, the ORNL team’s approach to using a quantum computer provides an effective simulation method to identify molecules that demonstrate singlet fission properties while bypassing approximations commonly found in techniques used for classical computers. The results of its work were <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c01106?ref=pdf">published in <em>The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters</em></a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Singlet fission is a multistate phenomenon, so the ORNL team needed a computational method that could describe all the process’s quantum states on an equal footing to calculate accurate energetics numbers. They turned to </span><a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/publications/increasing-accuracy-quantum-algorithms"><span><span>PDS</span></span></a><span>, which is a </span>quantum solver based on <span>the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov approach </span>and developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory<span>. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>PDS holds some advantages over classical strategies for determining a material’s energetic properties, including much higher accuracy than density functional theory and fewer computational demands than coupled cluster theory. And, because it was developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of simulations in quantum chemistry, PDS is well suited to </span>leverage the potential advantages of quantum computers.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>“The energetics of singlet fission revolve around double electronic excitations — two electrons move up to higher energy levels simultaneously, which is quite difficult to pin down with algorithms for conventional computers,” Claudino said. “But the underlying way that a quantum computer works, it can naturally treat the quantum correlations that give rise to this singlet-fission phenomenon. That’s when we came to the realization that, ‘yes, we should use a quantum computer to treat something that is inherently quantum.’ That’s well known. But I think we were the first to realize that it had the application for this specific problem.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The project was funded by DOE’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences. Access to the <a href="https://www.quantinuum.com/hardware/h1">H1-1, an enterprise-ready quantum computer built by Quantinuum</a> (formerly Honeywell), was provided by the <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/quantum-computing-user-program/">Quantum Computing User Program</a> at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science user facility. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquantum-computing">Quantum computing</a> — a technology still in its formative stages compared to classical supercomputers such as the OLCF’s exascale-class <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/frontier/">Frontier</a> — utilizes quantum bits, or qubits, to perform calculations. Unlike binary bits used in classical computers, qubits go beyond 1s and 0s to also use 1 and 0 simultaneously in a mixed superposition, exponentially increasing its processing power for certain equations, such as those based in quantum mechanics. However, quantum computer systems are still prone to high error rates, and the team had to compensate for this challenge to achieve reliable results.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“It’s better to have many more measurements to be on the safe side when it comes to circumventing errors, but then we wouldn’t be able to run this algorithm in a timely manner,” Claudino said. “That’s when we came up with measurement optimization to bring down the size of our calculations to something that was reasonable in terms of computing time.&nbsp;We went from something that was prohibitively large to something that was amenable to the quantum hardware.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>ORNL team members applied three independent strategies to decrease the problem’s computational workload, which reduced their time to solution from months to a few weeks. First, in a technique called qubit tapering, they decreased the number of qubits required to express the problem, reducing the size of the problem itself. Second, they took fewer measurements to solve the problem by measuring groups of terms once rather than measuring each individual term from every group. Third, instead of implementing each circuit individually, they found a way to run four circuits in parallel, allowing them to use all 20 qubits in the H1-1. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>“</span><span>We realized that if we wanted to just throw this entire thing into a quantum computer, it’s not going to work because it’s still too much for the current technology. The idea is that you want to envision a way to tap into the quantum computer but only for specific tasks that we know they can perform better than conventional computers,” Claudino said. “Yet, even then, you’re still limited by the current state of the art that only allows us to either go up to a certain size or perform tasks that only take so long. That’s the major bottleneck when turning to quantum computers.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The ORNL team’s project demonstrated the viability of current quantum computers to tackle scientific problems that could impact daily life. Although Claudino does not foresee tackling singlet fission again soon, his team is considering other problems — such as “the interaction of matter and light” — that may be solved using the quantum computing techniques demonstrated in this project.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC’s robocaller penalties are growing as the agency tracks down and terminates their operations — this time resulting in a record $300 million forfeiture. But whether and when that money will be paid is, as always, something of an open question.</p>
<p>The robocaller in this case was known by a variety of names and had been scamming people since 2018, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-imposes-record-fine-transnational-illegal-robocalling-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the FCC announcement explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This enterprise operated a complex scheme designed to facilitate the sale of vehicle service contracts under the false and misleading claim of selling auto warranties. Two of the central players of the operation, Roy M. Cox and Aaron Michael Jones, were under lifetime bans against making telemarketing calls following lawsuits by the Federal Trade Commission and State of Texas. The multi-national enterprise did business as Sumco Panama, Virtual Telecom, Davis Telecom, Geist Telecom, Fugle Telecom, Tech Direct, Mobi Telecom, and Posting Express.</p></blockquote>
<p>The long-running scheme used the promise of selling auto warranties to collect personal information from people. As if the fake warranty wasn’t enough, the calls also exhibited the standard robocall characteristics of failing to identify the caller, failing to respect call consent laws (like the Do Not Call list), failing to provide a call-back number and spoofing the area code.</p>
<p>Chances are you received at least one of these calls — the companies placed at least five billion of them. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel got a few herself, she mentioned in her accompanying remarks.</p>
<p>“Armed with the facts [the FCC] gave phone companies permission to cut off this traffic before going one step further and directing them to block it outright. We got results. Following our action, the number of auto warranty calls fell by 99 percent,” she wrote.</p>
<p>This effective and quick (at least, quick once they identified the culprits) action is due to various improvements to the FCC robocall enforcement mechanisms over the years. They’ve also established agreements with nearly all the Attorneys General in the U.S. so that they can coordinate with local law enforcement. But one thing they are still lacking is the ability to effectively hammer these malicious actors with proper fines.</p>
<p>The FCC is limited to investigating, taking counter-actions (like asking phone companies to stop carrying certain callers), and documenting the extent of the alleged criminal activity. But their recommendation of a $300 million fine must be evaluated and prosecuted by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>“What happens next?” writes Rosenworcel. “Under the law we will refer this Forfeiture Order to the Department of Justice to collect payment.&nbsp; I hope, however, that Congress will consider giving the FCC authority to go to court and collect these fines ourselves.”</p>

<p>Justice, like most federal agencies, is swamped; it may be a long time before anyone attempts to collect, and by the time they do, the robocallers will likely have covered their tracks or sequestered their earnings in forfeiture-proof vehicles. A few years ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/ftc-smacks-down-robocallers-but-the-penalties-dont-match-their-heinous-crimes/">I wrote</a> about how these fines often end up largely unpaid or drastically reduced due to loopholes and a lack of resources on the enforcers’ side. Florida is a popular refuge for scammers due, among other things, to laws that shield certain property from being seized.</p>
<p>Today’s operation is described as being “transnational,” which is not elaborated upon but strongly suggests even greater difficulties in tracking down and squeezing the money out of those responsible.</p>
<p>Though it may play out like a game of whack-a-mole, if the FCC were not doing their part it’s likely our phones would be blowing up non-stop. “We know the scam artists behind these calls are relentless,” said Rosenworcel, “but we are coming for them, and won’t stop until we get this junk off the line.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/08/aws-ec2-public-ipv4/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/08/aws-ec2-public-ipv4/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36989798">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>AWS recently announced that starting from February 2024, they will be <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/">charging for public IPv4 addresses</a>. According to the cloud provider, this change aligns AWS with other cloud providers, encourages frugal usage of a scarce resource, and accelerates the adoption of IPv6.</p>

<p>The new charge will be applicable across all AWS regions and services, including EC2 instances, RDS database instances, EKS nodes, and other service-managed public IPv4 addresses, such as internet-facing ELB, NAT gateways, and AWS Global Accelerators. At 0.005 USD per hour, the price hike will add 43.8 USD per year for every IP address. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbarr/">Jeff Barr</a>, chief evangelist at AWS, explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IPv4 addresses are an increasingly scarce resource and the cost to acquire a single public IPv4 address has risen more than 300% over the past 5 years. This change reflects our own costs and is also intended to encourage you (...) to think about accelerating your adoption of IPv6 as a modernization and conservation measure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To encourage the transition to IPv6 and the best use of public IPv4 addresses, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-and-usage-reporting/">AWS cost and usage reports</a> will now include public IPv4 address usage. The cloud provider also launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/aws-public-ip-insights-vpc-ip-address-manager/">Public IP Insights</a>, a new feature of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/view-public-ip-insights.html">VPC IP Address Manager</a>, providing a breakdown of public IP types and EIP usage.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2023/08/aws-ec2-public-ipv4/en/resources/1pip_top_1-1690970350345.png" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/1200x2400/filters:quality(80)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2023/08/aws-ec2-public-ipv4/en/resources/1pip_top_1-1690970350345.png" rel="share"></p>

<p><em>Source: AWS blog</em></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/identify-and-optimize-public-ipv4-address-usage-on-aws/">separate article</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodicaalexandrahuides/">Alexandra Huides</a>, principal network specialist solutions architect at AWS, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityasanthanam/">Aditya Santhanam</a>, product manager at AWS, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-lehwess/">Matt Lehwess</a>, senior principal solutions architect at AWS, explain how to identify and optimize public IPv4 address using the new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html">CUR</a> information:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the updated CUR you will see two new usage types for public IPv4 addresses: <em>PublicIPv4:IdleAddress</em>: shows usage across all public IPv4 addresses that are idle in your AWS account. <em>PublicIPv4:InUseAddress</em>: shows usage across all public IPv4 addresses that are in-use by your AWS resources. These include EC2 public IPv4 addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and service managed public IPv4 addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at The Duckbill Group, explains the <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/breaking-aws-begins-charging-for-public-ipv4-addresses/">challenge with IPv4 addresses</a> and writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a reasonable way of ensuring the rest of us aren’t made to suffer for the poor planning of a small subset of customers and incentivizing good IP addressing behavior for the rest of us. This brings AWS in line with Google Cloud and Azure’s pricing policies on IPv4 addresses. Frankly, the price hike is a good thing, once we navigate the rocky transition period to relearn how networking economically works in AWS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelzubkiewicz/">Paweł Zubkiewicz</a>, founder of CloudPouch.dev, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090776058215424001?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7090776058215424001%2C7091454054458884097%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287091454054458884097%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7090776058215424001%29">does not agree</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such significant and sudden change is never a good thing! Half a year is not enough time for most of the companies that, as Corey said, are "doing something psychotic with thousands of IP addresses" to change their architecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until now, AWS charged only for public IPv4 addresses that were allocated but not attached to an EC2 instance. In a popular <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/15c4pog/aws_public_ipv4_address_charge_public_ip_insights/">Reddit thread</a>, user <em>rootbeerdan</em> is one of many users highlighting the limited IPv6 support on AWS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazon really should not be charging for IPv4 addresses when even basic stuff like SSM isn't IPv6 ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AWS Free Tier will now include 750 hours of public IPv4 address usage per month for the first 12 months and customers will not be charged for owned IP addresses using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html">Amazon BYOIP</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Brave Software, maker of the Brave web browser, has tuned its search engine to run on a homegrown index of images and videos in an effort to end its dependency on "Big Tech" rivals.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the biz said image and video results from Brave Search – available on the web at search.brave.com and via its browser – will be served from Brave's own index.</p>
<p>Search indexes are made by visiting online resources – typically web pages, images, videos, or other files – with a crawler bot and recording the locations of these resources in a database. And when an internet user submits a query to a search engine, the search engine checks its index (and possible other sources) to find the addresses of resources that correspond to the query keywords. There's actually a lot more to it but that's the basic idea.</p>

    

<p>Ranking matches from the list in such a way that the search user sees results ordered by predicted relevance is an ongoing computer science challenge, one that Google handled effectively for years with the help of its PageRank algorithm and other machinations. And it continues to dominate the US search market, with more than 90 percent market share in June, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.similarweb.com/engines/united-states/">according to</a> Similarweb.</p>

        


        

<p>But in recent years, there has been growing sentiment that Google Search <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thestar.com/business/google-search-has-gotten-worse-here-s-the-trick-people-have-found-to-get-around/article_5d51869b-6be0-5de7-ae12-18e9b93f8323.html">is</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/">getting</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/is-google-getting-worse/">worse</a>. Part of the problem is AI content generation, which is being used to create <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/05/ai-generated-content-farms-fill-search-results-with-advert-stuffed-spam">web spam</a>, to the detriment of web users.</p>
<p>Yet AI is also part of the supposed solution, at least for rival Microsoft, which sees OpenAI's chatbot tech as a way to rewrite the expectations for web search at Google's expense.</p>

        

<p>Google has made matters worse for itself by trying to reinvent targeted advertising at a time when proliferating privacy rules and antitrust regulatory entanglements limit its options.</p>
<p>Brave now aims to ride the wave of discontent with Big Tech by highlighting its commitment to privacy and independence – Small Tech.</p>
<p>(As some have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/">pointed out</a>, Brave has some skin in the AI content-generation game alongside OpenAI <em>et al</em>: it offers <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://brave.com/search/api/">an API</a> that takes search queries and outputs answers formatted for use with, say, machine-learning models.)</p>

        

<p>"Brave Search is 100 percent private and anonymous, which sets a high bar for image/video search to meet," the developer said in a blog post provided earlier to <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>"Whether it’s a matter of personal safety or personal preference, users should be able to discover content without their search engine reporting and profiling those results to a Big Tech company."</p>
<p>The Brave browser, we're told, currently has about <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://brave.com/transparency/">57.76 million</a> monthly active users. Mozilla Firefox, as a point of comparison, has about <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity">187 million</a> monthly active users.</p>
<p>Brave Search <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/22/brave_search_engine/">debuted</a> in 2021, offering text-based search results from an independent index. A service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/23/brave_search_googles_google/">Goggles</a> that allows personal search result filtering followed in 2022. And, as we noted above, Brave <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://brave.com/search-api-launch/">launched</a> an API for its search service earlier this year.</p>
<p>By shifting to its own index for images and videos, Brave further differentiates its search offering from companies that essentially repackage Google and Bing. For example, DuckDuckGo relies <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources/">mostly on Bing</a>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/09/brave_affiliate_links_bug/">Brave sorry about coding snafu that sent search queries to affiliate links, insists practice is 'industry standard'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/23/brave_search_googles_google/">Brave Search leaves beta, offers Goggles for filtering, personalizing results</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/17/brave_duckduckgo/">Brave roasts DuckDuckGo over Bing privacy exception</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/09/brave_bounce_tracking/">Brave takes the spring out of creepy bounce tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are not many active public web search indexes: Google, Bing, and Brave in the US; Baidu, Huawei (Petal), and Tencent (Sogou), among others, in China; Yandex in Russia; and Mojeek in the UK.</p>
<p>Brave argues that having its own index frees the company from content decisions made by others. As an example, the browser biz points to an incident two years ago when Bing briefly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/04/search_engine_tiananmen/">stopped serving</a> search results for the Tiananmen Square "tank man," an inquiry that remains unwelcome in China. Brave Search also couldn't find "tank man" at the time because the service sourced its image results from Microsoft Bing.</p>
<p>No longer. However, Brave says it is committed to making it easy to conduct searches using other search engines for queries that Brave Search cannot answer. For Brave Search on the web, that means those making inquiries have the option to send their keywords to other search services – via links shown below the top 10 results – if Brave's index proves disappointing.</p>
<p>"Brave is on a mission to build a user-first Web," the company said in its blog post. "That mission starts with the Brave browser and Brave Search. With the release of image and video search, we’re continuing to innovate within the search industry, providing viable and preferable products for users who want choice and transparency in their search for information online." ®</p>

<!-- cache hit 149:single/related:01915514a4761b5c1b91403947fc606b --><!-- empty -->
<p>Tesla is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by customers who say they were misled by the company's exaggerated range claims. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.416318/gov.uscourts.cand.416318.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> was filed yesterday, days after a report revealed that Tesla exaggerated its electric vehicles' range so much that many drivers thought their cars were broken.</p>
<p>"Tesla marketed its electric vehicles as having a grossly overvalued range in an effort to increase sales to consumers," said the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks class-action status to represent all people in California who purchased a new Tesla Model 3, Model S, Model Y, or Model X vehicle. The three named plaintiffs are James Porter, Bryan Perez, and Dro Esraeili Estepanian. All three bought Tesla cars in 2022.</p>
<p>The complaint said that when plaintiffs ordered their cars online or spoke to Tesla representatives about the car features, they were never warned that the advertised range was "grossly overestimated." The plaintiffs would not have purchased a Tesla car at the prices they paid if the company "truthfully revealed that the advertised range was exaggerated and not based on normal driving conditions," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The complaint says Tesla committed "violations of state consumer fraud statutes, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, violation of California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, and unjust enrichment."</p>
<p>"As a result of Tesla's tactics and false advertising, Plaintiffs and Class Members suffered an injury in fact, incurred damages, and have been harmed by Tesla's conduct," the complaint said. They are seeking financial damages in the lawsuit, which was prepared by class-action law firm Milberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Cars “failed to accurately account for external factors”</h2>
<p>The complaint cited testing that found three Tesla models fell short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26 percent. In addition to alleging false advertising, the lawsuit said that range estimates provided by Tesla vehicles during car trips fail to account for temperature and other factors that reduce range.</p>
<p>Testing by analytics firm Recurrent "determined that Tesla model vehicles still overwhelmingly calculated that they could still deliver nearly the advertised full range, regardless of external factors—with Tesla vehicles calculating that they could travel more than 90 percent of their advertised range," the complaint said. "Put simply, Tesla vehicles failed to accurately account for external factors impacting battery performance and vehicle range, leading to a gross overestimate of the vehicle's range."</p>
<p>The lawsuit cites a recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/">investigation by Reuters</a>. "Based upon information from those familiar with Tesla's early vehicle software designs, the Reuters report explains that Tesla developed algorithms for estimating the range of its electric vehicles, which would display to drivers 'rosy' projections for the distance the vehicle could travel on a full battery," the lawsuit said. "However, once the battery reached 50 percent capacity, the algorithm would change and begin showing the driver more realistic projections. This would cause the estimated range of the vehicle to fluctuate drastically from that point."</p>
<p>"The decision to include these algorithms to present inflated range estimates came directly from Tesla's chief executive officer, Elon Musk," the lawsuit continued.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Tesla became inundated with complaints from drivers who thought their cars were broken when the actual driving range was much lower than advertised. When these drivers scheduled service appointments to address their range problems, Tesla allegedly canceled the appointments because there was no way to improve the actual driving distance. The Reuters report said that in mid-2022, Tesla started routing range complaints to a "Diversion Team" that fielded up to 2,000 cases a week and "was expected to close about 750 cases a week."</p>
<p>Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment when we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/tesla-exaggerated-ev-range-so-much-that-drivers-thought-cars-were-broken/">wrote about the exaggerated EV range claims</a> last week.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><em>Every image and video result in Brave Search is now served by Brave. Users no longer need to choose between Bing and Google for image and video search.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>After several months of development, Brave Search is releasing its own privacy-preserving image and video search that is independent from Big Tech search engines. Users will no longer need to leave Brave Search for image and video search results. Now any Brave Search query can be served directly from Brave’s own index, enabling users to benefit from a fully independent search engine that protects their privacy and is censorship-resistant. Our recently released <a href="https://brave.com/search-api-launch/">Brave Search API</a> will also imminently include these image/video results.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of <a href="https://brave.com/search-independence/">removing calls to Bing</a>’s search API for images and videos this past May. To bridge the gap between the removal of Bing (which accounted for only 7% of results) and providing our own solution today, we temporarily gave our users the option of an alternate image/video search via redirect to Bing or Google, allowing us to maintain convenient and familiar search habits from within Brave Search. We realize that the redirect option was not popular with some of our users, and thank them for their patience during this transition. This was a temporary decision to help users find results with minimum hassle, while we worked to offer a sustainable, privacy-preserving, and independent image and video search option.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Web content searches make up the majority of all search engine results, while image/video search has become fragmented, due to the exponential growth of visual content on the Internet. Increasingly, users are using their favorite social and content platforms to discover visual content—but this comes at a significant cost to user privacy.</p>
<p>Brave Search is 100% private and anonymous, which sets a high bar for image/video search to meet. Whether it’s a matter of personal safety or personal preference, users should be able to discover content without their search engine reporting and profiling those results to a Big Tech company.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-brave-search-and-users">What this means for Brave Search and users</h2>
<p>Image and video search makes Brave Search a more comprehensive search engine while protecting user privacy. With the ability to search for crucial vertical categories such as images and videos directly within Brave, users can now access even more content than before. Additionally, by keeping all searches within the Brave ecosystem, users benefit from increased speed and privacy when compared with the multiple search engines that rely on third-party providers.</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-independence">The importance of independence</h2>
<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-bing-raises-concerns-over-lack-image-results-tiananmen-tank-man-2021-06-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Bing was found to serve zero image results for the Tiananmen Square “tank man”</a>. This obviously affected third-party services—such as DuckDuckGo—that rely entirely on Bing’s API for their search results. But it also affected Brave Search because—at the time—we were relying on Bing for image search results. This created both a technical dependency, and also an unintended extension of Big Tech’s censorship.</p>
<p>By serving image/video results directly from Brave Search’s independent index, we can ensure a better check on Big Tech censorship and put our users in charge of their browsing experience.</p>
<p><em>Technical note: For all search results—text, image, and video—our goal is to offer a great alternative to Big Tech, one that can compete on both quality and independence and serve the right results all the time. However, if we can’t deliver the right result, we also strive to make it easy and intuitive to continue a search elsewhere. Functionally, this means that certain capabilities (such as advanced filters like license type or aspect ratio) will not be immediately available (but will be soon). For now, we believe offering a clear alternative is more important than complete feature parity.</em></p>

<h2 id="braves-ongoing-mission-to-improve-search">Brave’s ongoing mission to improve search</h2>
<p>Brave is on a mission to build a user-first Web. That mission starts with the Brave browser and Brave Search. With the release of image and video search, we’re continuing to innovate within the search industry, providing viable and preferable products for users who want choice and transparency in their search for information online. Users can help us by sharing their <a href="https://community.brave.com/c/brave-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feedback</a> or by anonymously opting into our <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Discovery Project</a> to contribute to our search index.</p>
<p><em>Brave Search is available to everyone at</em> <a href="https://search.brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>search.brave.com</em></a><em>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser.</em></p>

<p>A group of hackers have exposed an exploit that can unlock Tesla’s software-locked features worth up to $15,000.</p>



<p>Free heated seats and Full Self-Driving package, anyone?</p>



<p>Software-locked features that need to be activated by the owner paying or subscribing to a service are becoming increasingly popular in the auto industry.</p>



<p>Tesla has been on board that trend very early since it produced virtually all its vehicles with the same hardware and owners can unlock features later through software updates.</p>



<p>This includes features like heated seats, acceleration boost, and even Tesla’s Full Self-Driving package, which costs $15,000.</p>



<p>It creates a market for people trying to get around the software lock.</p>



<p>A group of security researchers (aka hackers) at TU Berlin announced that they managed to exploit a weakness in the onboard computer to unlock these features:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tesla has been known for their advanced and well-integrated car computers, from serving mundane entertainment purposes to fully autonomous driving capabilities. More recently, Tesla has started using this well-established platform to enable in-car purchases, not only for additional connectivity features but even for analog features like faster acceleration or rear heated seats. As a result, hacking the embedded car computer could allow users to unlock these features without paying.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They plan to unveil the result of their exploit in a presentation called “<a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#jailbreaking-an-electric-vehicle-in--or-what-it-means-to-hotwire-teslas-x-based-seat-heater-33049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jailbreaking an Electric Vehicle in 2023 or What It Means to Hotwire Tesla’s x86-Based Seat Heater</a>” next week.</p>



<p>The hack requires physical access to the car, and it involves a “voltage fault injection attack” on the AMD-based infotainment system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For this, we are using a known voltage fault injection attack against the AMD Secure Processor (ASP), serving as the root of trust for the system. First, we present how we used low-cost, off-the-self hardware to mount the glitching attack to subvert the ASP’s early boot code. We then show how we reverse-engineered the boot flow to gain a root shell on their recovery and production Linux distribution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The group of hackers claims that their “Tesla Jailbreak” is “unpatchable” and allows to run “arbitrary software on the infotainment.”</p>



<p>They add:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Second, it will enable us to extract an otherwise vehicle-unique hardware-bound RSA key used to authenticate and authorize a car in Tesla’s internal service network.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the hackers believe that they can unlock virtually all software-locked features inside Tesla vehicles even Full Self-Driving – though they believe that it would require some more reverse-engineering.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Generally, these exploits are shared with Tesla, and it helps the automaker secure its systems.</p>



<p>In this case, the hackers said that despite the exploit, they believe Tesla’s security is better than other automakers.</p>



<p>We have seen Tesla put a lot more emphasis on cyber security over the last few years. We highlighted the effort in our report: <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/08/27/tesla-hack-control-over-entire-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Big Tesla Hack: A hacker gained control over the entire fleet, but fortunately he’s a good guy</a>.</p>

A big part of it is that I just really like looking at old books. Not just looking, exactly, but finding out what we can </span><em>learn </em><span>from looking at them — how the meaning and function of a book interacts with the technologies used to produce it and the creativity and craftsmanship of its creators. </span></p><p><span>The </span><em>Hortus Sanitatis </em><span>is what’s known as an incunabulum, or “cradle book,” a term for books produced before 1500 during the infancy of movable type printing. These books have some recognizable traits:</span></p><ul><li><p>They were often printed in black letter (Gothic) font. </p></li><li><p><span>Reflecting their transitional status between the world of manuscript books and printed books, they borrow </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_David#/media/File:Rothschild_Prayerbook_2.jpg" rel="">stylistic elements from late medieval manuscripts</a><span>. </span></p></li><li><p>They were rare and very expensive, and thus typically created for social elites and official functions — academic treatises, encyclopedias, Bibles, and the like. </p></li></ul><p>Early modern printed books are a much wider category, encompassing the entire period between ~1450 CE and ~1800 CE (I tend to date the end of the early modern period to the end of the Napoleonic Wars, 1815). Printed books from this period cover a huge range of topics and dozens of languages, but for me at least, they have one thing in common: I almost always find them far more interesting —&nbsp;more beautifully designed, more strange, more intriguing —&nbsp;than modern books. </p><p>The rest of this post is a few thoughts on why. </p><p><span>I first encountered </span><em>Hortus Sanitatis </em><span>as a PhD student at UT Austin over a decade ago.

While BigAg increases prices for consumers, farmers lose revenue. After a huge overhaul of US farming in the 1960s and ‘70s spearheaded by more non-farm employment opportunities and increased productivity, the number of US farms has decreased approximately 20% over the last 30 years: </p><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2bcbdbf4-aa04-45df-a051-0cb0c95cc988/FARM_CLOSURES.png"></p></div><p> BigAg’s consolidated power throttles the price discovery process. In this case, price discovery is a literal auction for livestock and poultry. At auctions, the more buyers there are, the higher the potential sale price as buyers bid against one another. But meat processors are now the primary buyer from feedlots who in turn get their cattle from background ranches (who get their cattle from cow-calf ranches). Cheaper sales from feedlots to meat processors, reduce prices downstream for background ranches and cow-calf ranches. </p><p> Over time the share of feedlot-to-meatpacker sales done via contract has increased to 72%, so BigAg sets the price outright with no price discovery process at all. There have been Senate hearings aimed at curtailing BigAg’s power in this vein specifically; namely, to reduce contract purchases to no more than 50% of total feedlot-to-meatpacker sales. Again, this is a good start but it’s ultimately a band-aid for an industry that needs more acute intervention to encourage real competition. Collusion and price fixing would just become a cost of doing business (or at least more so than <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdGcud2EuZ292L25ld3MvbmV3cy1yZWxlYXNlcy9hZy1mZXJndXNvbi1zLXByaWNlLWZpeGluZy1sYXdzdWl0LW5ldHMtMTA1LW1pbGxpb24td2FzaGluZ3RvbmlhbnMtdHlzb24tZm9vZHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1zdGF0ZWNyYWZ0LmJlZWhpaXYuY29tJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXRoZS1jYXJ0ZWwtdGhhdC1jb250cm9scy10aGUtdXMtbWVhdC1pbmR1c3RyeSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiIyYTQ1MWViMS05ZTVkLTQ4NDktYTQwYS1mMzhlMDMyNmUyZTgiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImQxYjgwYzkzLWU4MjgtNGE5NC05OWQ0LWVjODJhMTQzMDI4YSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiN2VkZTE5MWMtOTg5OC00ODlmLWIyYmYtYzk5ZDlhZDk1YWM1IiwiaWF0IjoxNjkxMDgyMDAzLjk1OCwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.UsUdyEgd20RcbHtmW2PLWuKGkxT7ZpT-a8005ASGFL4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">they seem to already be</a>). </p><p><b><mark>Proposed Policy Solutions</mark></b>: Worth noting again, break up the 4 meat processors.

The post-pandemic economic shocks co-opted by BigAg as air cover to gouge consumers, squeeze margins out of farmers, and exploit workers, may backfire and spur political will to create real reform. </p><p><i>Thank you for reading this edition of Statecraft!

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Story 📘</h2>
<p dir="auto">We were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features. Each task required us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.</p>

<p>GNU Units converts quantities expressed in various
systems of measurement to their equivalents in other systems of
measurement.  Like many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative
scale changes. It can also handle nonlinear conversions such as
Fahrenheit to Celsius or wire gauge, and it can convert from and to sums of
units, such as converting between meters and feet plus inches.  </p>

<p>
Beyond simple unit conversions, GNU Units can be used as a
general-purpose scientific calculator that keeps track of units in its
calculations.  You can form arbitrary complex mathematical expressions
of dimensions including sums, products, quotients, powers, and even roots
of dimensions.  Thus you can ensure accuracy and dimensional consistency
when working with long expressions that involve many different units
that may combine in complex ways.  </p>

<p>
The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can 
provide your own data file to suit your needs.  You can also use your
own data file to supplement the standard data file.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>


<p>
Two simple conversion examples:
</p>
<pre>You have: mile
You want: km
        * 1.609344
        / 0.62137119

You have: furlongs per fortnight
You want: m/s  
        * 0.00016630986
        / 6012.8727
</pre>

<p>
A calculation involving roots of units:
</p>
<pre>You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4)
You have:
        Definition: 289.80882 K
</pre>


<p>
Temperature <em>differences</em> are converted using the syntax
shown above with unit names like degC and degF.  But conversion of
absolute temperatures requires a different syntax:
</p>
<pre>You have: tempF(45)
You want: tempC
        7.2222222
</pre>

<p>
Converting from a sum of units:
</p>
<pre>You have: 17 yards + 2 feet + 5 inches
You want: meter
        * 16.2814
        / 0.06141978
</pre>

<p>
Converting to a sum of units such as hours plus minutes or feet plus inches:
</p>
<pre>You have: 7 meters
You want: ft;in
        22 ft + 11.590551 in
</pre>

<p>
Converting a sixth of a (US) cup to common US measures:
</p>
<pre>You have: 1|6 cup
You want: usvol
        2 tbsp + 2 tsp
</pre>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is an attempt to wrap my head around using the Phoenix web
framework for a small project. However, it got too long so I broke it
into two parts. This is part 1 and just talks about the Elixir language,
part 2 is <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/PhoenixForCynicalCurmudgeons" title="Go to wiki page">PhoenixForCynicalCurmudgeons</a> but that is
still WIP. However, I realized that I have a number of <em>attitude
issues</em> that make Phoenix hard to start getting into, so I’m going
to attempt to write about it in a way that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>My issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t actually know Erlang too well in practice</li>
<li>I don’t actually know web programming too well in practice</li>
<li>I don’t actually like web programming much</li>
<li>I’ve spent the last 10 years being the go-to person to fix every
random technical thing that could screw up, and am thus something of a
pessimist and a control freak</li>
<li>The world is burning down around us and none of us can do anything
about it</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you share some of these issues, maybe this doc will be useful
to you. This will not teach you Elixir or Phoenix, but it may help you
figure out how to <em>think</em> about them. This is a supplement to the
<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">official
docs</a>, not a replacement, so it won’t try to cover the things that
those docs explain well.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: As far as I know this is correct, but there’s probably
details I’m missing or misinterpreting. Don’t take this as gospel. I am
not an expert, I am merely a determined idiot.</p>
<p>Last updated in August 2023. It uses Elixir 1.14, Erlang/OTP 25 and
Phoenix 1.7.7.</p>
<h2 id="elixir">Elixir</h2>
<p>Really what I want to get a handle on is the web framework Phoenix.
But Phoenix is written in the Elixir programming language, so to tackle
Phoenix, we must tackle Elixir.</p>
<h2 id="the-sales-pitch">The sales pitch</h2>
<p>I’m not going to spend too long singing the praises of The Erlang/OTP
Platform, I assume if you’re here then you already know enough to be
interested. Long story short, it gives you multiprocessing via
communicating independent processes, makes almost all state immutable so
these independent processes can <em>only</em> talk with each other via
channels, and gives you bunches of tools for handling the failure and
restarting of processes, as well as inspecting and changing code at
runtime. It runs on a VM called BEAM, because for various reasons the
conventional Unix process model can’t actually give the same level of
robustness and introspection that you can get with a sandboxed virtual
machine. Erlang itself is a wild programming language made in the late
80’s that started with Prolog with a sprinkling of Lisp here and there
and turned it into a language like nothing else on this earth. Elixir is
a much newer and more comfy-looking programming language that started in
2012 and also compiles to the BEAM VM, offering good compatibility with
Erlang code.</p>
<p>I love Erlang but have never really used it <a href="https://erlang-in-anger.com/">In Anger</a>; the biggest thing I’ve
written with it is a card game. I have dipped in and out of it many
times over the years, but most of the time I just don’t have a lot of
use cases where it’s obviously the best choice over something else. It
has always seemed like the ideal tool for non-trivial web applications,
but I never really had a need to write that. But I recently had an idea
I want want to try to write for an actual web service that’s not a
static generated site or a tiny mono-purpose API, so I figured I’d take
a good stab at using Erlang or Elixir for it.</p>
<p>Elixir at first blush looks like they just took Erlang and re-skinned
it to look like Ruby. However, Elixir offers some modest but meaningful
functional upgrades over Erlang:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested modules. Erlang has a flat module namespace, you can make a
module named <code>foo</code> but you can’t put a module named
<code>bar</code> into it and get <code>foo/bar</code> or
<code>foo.bar</code>. This is Fine but not ideal, you generally end up
faking the nesting and making a module named <code>foo_bar</code>
anyway. Erlang doesn’t care, but it also doesn’t help you.</li>
<li>Better strings. Erlang strings are by default a linked list of
characters, which probably made a lot more sense for a telecoms
infrastructure language in the late 1980’s than it does for a web
language in the 2020’s. This still actually works half decently because
a lot of I/O can be done with lists of substrings rather than
creating/modifying existing strings, but it’s still not ideal. But
Erlang also has bit-strings which are immutable arrays of arbitrary
bytes, and you can stuff ASCII or UTF-8 data into those and use them as
strings too. In Elixir the defaults are flipped: strings are immutable
arrays by default, and if you need to talk to Erlang code that expects
the linked-list type of string you can create them. It still keeps the
scatter-list-y I/O model though, so constructing a new string out of a
bunch of pieces with a format function or such won’t allocate a new
buffer and copy the strings into it, it will just produce a list of
packed string fragments. Elixir strings also assume UTF-8 by default;
Erlang bit-strings assume no particular encoding.</li>
<li>Nicer structure syntax. Erlang is sort of weird ’cause for the
longest time structs were not first-class objects, they were just tuples
with macros for creating and accessing them. Erlang is a very dynamic
language that tends to say that abstraction is done by functions and
interfaces, and if you need to rummage around in the guts of your data
structures then you should. However, its creators really didn’t want to
add hashtables everywhere as a general-purpose structure the way that
Python and Ruby do, so they just sat and mulled on the problem. They did
eventually add real structures/records, which are much nicer wrappers
around tuples, but they’re still a little tacked-on. Elixir’s maps are
basically the same as Erlang’s structures (records, whatever), but more
convenient.</li>
<li>Bigger stdlib. Erlang’s stdlib is pretty nice, Elixir’s adds to it.
’Nuff said.</li>
<li>Better macros. Erlang has actually fairly powerful macros but they
are, frankly, a cleaned up C preprocessor. You can define constants,
include files, do some basic ifdef stuff, shit like that. You
<em>can</em> get significantly fancier, but it’s pretty clear that
you’re usually not intended to; the reference docs barely tell you
anything about it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i-hate-sales-pitches">I hate sales pitches</h2>
<p>However, there’s also a bunch of cognitive bumps for me to overcome
when trying to learn Elixir:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the syntactic sugar. Elixir looks like Ruby, which is quite
loosey-goosey and malleable, and Elixir is even more malleable. There’s
a <em>lot</em> of bits in the first half of the tutorial that say “you
can also write it like this…” and gives you some uncertain thing with
less punctuation involved At first glance, it <em>feels</em> like it
tries excessively hard to make things pretty rather than good, and the
way Phoenix writes code makes that worse. It’s easy to feel like it’s
all just sugar rather than content.</li>
<li>Bigger language, period. Erlang is very appealingly simple; there’s
a small number of constructs that then fit together pretty well.
Sometimes it’s a little clunky, but if you look at some Erlang code then
there’s not much fanciness outside of how channels and processes
interact; it generally just does what it says it does. Elixir has a lot
more going on at many different levels; why do we need that?</li>
<li>Big complicated project structure. You <em>can</em> make an Elixir
project that’s just a single script or a directory with a small
collection of files, but the docs prefer to plunge you into its build
tool <code>mix</code>, designing an OTP application, how
<code>GenServer</code> works, etc. It’s all significantly more
complicated to pick up and get going with <code>mix</code> than with
<code>cargo</code>, <code>zig</code> or other tools I’m more familiar
with. Some of it like OTP and <code>GenServer</code> are already
familiar from Erlang, but in that case what does Elixir add over just
using Erlang again?</li>
<li>Tries fairly hard to look hip. The presentation for both Elixir and
Phoenix is quite shiny, it has lots of very friendly introductions that
tell you how great it is, all the <em>features</em> it has, and how it’s
totally worth all this extra complexity to get into it and do everything
with its awesome new paradigm. This makes me automatically distrust it.
It’s honestly not <em>that</em> bad, and in my more forgiving moments I
have a hard time looking at the Elixir website and docs and
realistically saying that I could do better, but I still end up feeling
like there’s still a certain amount of hype to machete your way through
before you get to the content. See the “cynical curmudgeon” part; the
harder something tries to convince me of <em>anything</em>, the more I
expect it to suck. If someone just takes Erlang, slaps on a friendly
Ruby-ish syntax and a few modest upgrades and touts it as the Next Big
Thing, do I <em>really</em> trust anything they have to say?</li>
</ul>
<p>So I’ve looked at Elixir before but this has kinda tended to turn me
off, even with Elixir’s benefits. I can <em>get</em> all those benefits
in Erlang, it just takes a little more work. Why should I bother
learning a new language with ten million special syntax frills, all
sorts of domain-specific tooling, a new stdlib, etc? There’s nothing
fundamentally wrong with that stuff, but most of the time it’s really
not my jam. I much prefer starting off with a small, simple system and
then incrementally adding bits in a controlled fashion…
<em>especially</em> when I want to make a reliable, robust, complex
system with an unfamiliar tool in an unfamiliar problem domain. If I’m
going to use something big and complicated then it needs to make it
<strong>worth</strong> it – Rust crosses this threshold for me, for
example, because it does things other languages literally cannot.
Meanwhile, Elixir starts off feeling like it wants to hold your hand a
lot. Erlang is a pretty small, conservative language where, despite its
1980’s warts, you write what you mean and that’s what you get. In
contrast, it’s easy to get the impression that Elixir is trying to be
Magical and thus actually just hiding all the real work. Yes, this is
kinda bitchy, but I’m not here to rant. I’ve looked at Elixir reasonably
seriously several times before, and every time it left a bad taste in my
mouth and I went “whatever, I’ll just use Erlang instead”. So in writing
this I wanted to look at <em>why</em> I felt that way.</p>
<p>This is the root of my curmudgeoniness: Magic is never worth it. 99%
of the time, Magic breaks. And when it does, and someone inevitably asks
me to help fix it, I do it by getting out the machete and chopping out
all the happy shiny convenient shit until you can see what is actually
going on. And when you dig through the Magic and try to figure out what
the hell is actually going on, most of the time it’s either stupid and
broken by design, or it’s not very magical at all and you’re just like
“why didn’t you just say this in the first place?” This has happened to
me again and again in all sorts of places; here’s a list of real
examples from work I’ve run into in the last couple years alone:</p>
<ul>
<li>A distributed service does Magical Autodiscovery to find other nodes
on the network without needing a central index? It just scans for UDP
ports that are willing to talk to it, starting with a Well-Known Port
Number and trying each in sequence until it thinks it’s found
everything.</li>
<li>A proprietary monitoring GUI for that service which Magically lets
you inspect it remotely? It just uses an existing open-source program
that collects that information and ships it to you over websocket.</li>
<li>A website Magically presents a live-updating display without needing
a Full Front-End Javascript Framework? It’s just an <code>iframe</code>
that is refreshed every five seconds.</li>
<li>A communication protocol you want to implement that provides a set
of RPC messages you need to receive and respond to and it all Magically
clicks together? Nope, turns out there’s a lot of undocumented
assumptions about what messages are sent when and in what order, and you
have to poke at the client and massage your server’s output until you
manage to figure out what it actually expects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over and over again, it turns out that <strong>there is no such thing
as Magic</strong>, and anyone who says otherwise is skimming over
details that will bite you in the ass later on. This is <em>fine</em>
for many purposes, because 90% of programs are small hacks and one-off
tools and so “later” very seldom actually happens. But in those cases,
why are you using a big, complicated language like Elixir in the first
place, especially when there’s already the more minimal Erlang sitting
right there waiting to be picked up?</p>
<p>It’s a pretty tough sell.</p>
<h2 id="the-epiphany">The epiphany</h2>
<p>But I still felt like Elixir deserved a good hard go, so I shrugged
off my prejudice and started digging. I read the tutorials for Elixir
and Phoenix, trusted that the people who were sensible enough to build a
web system atop Erlang are sensible enough to know what they’re doing,
and tried to put the pieces together. When gradually, bit by bit, I
realized what was going on and everything made much more sense. Here’s
the trick about Elixir: Elixir is actually a Lisp.</p>
<p><strong>Elixir is actually a Lisp.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t have the parenthesis, but it does have most of the things
things that make Common Lisp very flexible, very powerful, very dynamic,
and very metaprogramming-heavy. I don’t actually <em>enjoy</em> Common
Lisp itself very much ’cause it <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/CommonLispThoughts">comes with a lot of
baggage</a> and doesn’t have most of the things that have been developed
since 2000 or so to make programming less painful, but Elixir
<em>does</em>. Elixir also has all of Erlang’s goodness still present:
true immutability, pervasive pattern matching, extensive symbolic
programming, optional/gradual typing, etc. It doesn’t do this alone of
course; as I said, Erlang has a fair dollop of Lisp in its genetics
already. BEAM is already probably 75% of a Lisp runtime in terms of how
easy it is to introspect, modify, dig into and poke around with, but
Erlang doesn’t do a whole lot to take advantage of that directly until
you start actually getting deep into the guts of the runtime libraries,
which is not the easiest thing to do. Elixir on the other hand takes
advantage of all that introspective power right from the start and runs
with it, and runs with it <em>hard</em>. It’s relatively hard to find
Erlang programs and stuff written about Erlang that really takes you
through all the various tools and how to put them together into
something awesome; there’s a very solid handful of books and docs and
such, but apart from that people don’t seem to <em>talk</em> about
Erlang very much, or if they do it’s the same “Intro to OTP” content
every single time. Meanwhile the Phoenix web framework appears to be a
pretty good and honestly quite interesting example of how to write
Elixir programs and libraries in the large, so you can dig into
something Real and Complex and see how it can all be put together.</p>
<p>I bitched about all of Elixir’s syntactic sugar and how much
special-case nonsense it appears to do. For example, here’s a basic
hello world in Elixir:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span>def</span> greet() <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>IO</span><span>.</span>puts(<span>"Hello world!"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" tabindex="-1"></a><span>Hello</span><span>.</span>greet()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far so good. <code>defmodule</code> defines a module, and it
consists of function/method definitions starting with
<code>def ... do ... end</code>, nothing particularly surprising. Now,
here’s a snippet from the default Phoenix project template for my wiki
test project, Otter:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>OtterWeb</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span> <span>do</span></span>

<p>What the hell is going on here? <code>use</code> is fairly normal,
it’s just a module import that calls a callback to initialize stuff in
that module. (It isn’t, but that’s what you think at first.) But this
module has <code>scope</code> blocks and <code>pipeline</code> blocks,
they’re right under the top-level <code>defmodule</code>, they contain a
bunch of weird <code>plug</code> or <code>pipe_through</code>
statements… this isn’t Elixir, it’s some weird special-purpose
domain-specific language that Elixir just… happens to have built into it
somehow? Why does Elixir let a library write all this special custom
syntax? Is this just part of the language somehow because Phoenix is its
flagship software? Hang on, there’s an <code>if</code> expression at the
end of the module that looks like it’s run at compile time… can you even
<em>do</em> that? The language tutorial never heckin’ does that!</p>
<p>Buckle up, we’re in for a <em>trip</em>. ’Cause here’s the trick:
Elixir actually has only <em>one</em> syntax for calling a function or a
macro: <code>foo(arg1, arg2, arg3)</code>. That’s all. Every function or
macro call will turn into that format, and that’s the format the
documentation will show you too. So let’s see how the various layers of
syntactic sugar work with that basis…</p>
<p>First, because Elixir likes Ruby (and for pretty good reasons), you
can generally ditch the parens around a function call and just write it
as <code>foo arg1, arg2, arg3</code>. Ok, fine, that’s fairly
sensible.</p>
<p>Now if you have a function that takes a variable number of keyword
arguments, you just make the last function arg an assoc list, a list of
key-value pairs where the key is an atom. (Resist the curmudgeonly urge
to get all “hashtables and arrays are better” here, these linked lists
are generally short with good memory locality, it’s Fine.) So if you
want a function with a variable numbers of params you can define it as
<code>foo(arg1, params)</code> and call it as
<code>foo arg1, [{:arg2, something}, {:arg3, something_else}]</code>.
(<code>:foo</code> is what Lisp calls a symbol, Erlang/Elixir calls an
atom, and most of the rest of the world calls an interned string. They
are immutable, uniquely identified by name and only by name, and compile
down to integers.)</p>
<p>Since assoc lists are pretty common, there’s a piece of syntactic
sugar for them that looks more dictionary-like:
<code>[key1: val1, key2: val2]</code> is equivalent to
<code>[{:key1, val1}, {:key2, val2}]</code>. Moving the colon makes my
brain fritz a little bit but the result looks nice. So you can call a
function and give it an assoc list as an argument just with
<code>foo arg1, [arg2: something, arg3: something_else]</code>.</p>
<p>That’s nice, but really as long as our assoc list is the last thing
being passed to the function we don’t need the outer brackets of the
list either, so sure, just make it so you can call
<code>foo arg1, arg2: something, arg3: something_else</code>.</p>
<p>Are you yet thinking “oh no… they <em>wouldn’t</em>”? I have news for
you: <strong>oh yes they would</strong>.</p>
<p>This only works in some places and I still haven’t figured out quite
all the rules, but <code>do</code>, followed by a newline, followed by
<code>end</code>, is in fact sugar for an assoc list. So if you
write:</p>

<p>then it is equivalent to actually calling
<code>foo thing, do: 10</code>. Or rather,
<code>foo(thing, [{:do, 10}])</code>. And what do you know, if
<code>foo</code> is not a function but a macro, then the syntax is
exactly the same but the contents of the assoc list it gets passed is
not the evaluated expression between the <code>do</code> and
<code>end</code>, it’s a syntax tree. Made, naturally, of lists and
tuples and atoms.</p>
<p>So going back to our weird Phoenix module with all the new block
types? All those blocks that are written in the format of
<code>magical_keyword value do ... end</code>? All macros.
<code>scope</code> is a macro. <code>pipeline</code> is a macro. So
<code>defmodule</code> can contain any kind of macro call? …wait, that
means…</p>
<p><code>if</code> is a macro.</p>
<p><code>def</code> is a macro.</p>
<p><code>defmodule</code> is a macro.</p>
<p>It’s all macros. It’s ALL MACROS! ALL THE WAY DOWN! AAAAAAAAAA
AHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAA!</p>
<h2 id="maniacal-laughter"><em>maniacal laughter</em></h2>
<p>This is not done naively though, oh no! Elixir takes <em>other</em>
things from Lisp-y origins as well. Wonderful things!</p>
<p>For example, a string is written <code>"foo"</code>. Sensible enough.
Making an old-style Erlang list-y string is <code>~c"foo"</code>, sure.
Making a regex is <code>~r/foo/</code>, ok, so the <code>~</code> is
general syntax for “string-ish thing”, the way that <code>\x</code> in a
string in most languages is general syntax for “some special character”.
Not quite! Elixir calls it a “sigil”, but you can define your own sigils
just by writing a function that takes a string and does something with
it and returns some data, and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/sigils.html#custom-sigils">bam,
it works</a>.</p>
<p>Common Lisp calls these “reader macros”. They’re <a href="https://lisper.in/reader-macros">rather a pain in the ass</a>
though, Elixir’s version is a much nicer shortcut for most of the things
that you would actually want to use them for.</p>
<p>So the Elixir creators haven’t just stolen macros and homoiconic
syntax from Lisp, they’ve rummaged deeper into “what made Lisp awesome”
and pulled out other bits too. And also stolen liberally from other
languages! There’s an equivalent to Rust’s <code>dbg!()</code> macro
that prints an expression’s code and its result, then goes further and
optionally breaks into the interactive debugger, <code>pry</code>, which
appears more juiced up than Erlang’s debugger. They’ve stolen
<code>|&gt;</code> expression-pipeline syntax from the Haskell/ML world.
They’ve taken a lot of the interactive documentation functions that make
Python so easy to poke around in from the REPL. You know, all the
<em>good</em> shit.</p>
<p>Also note that while we have like 4 layers of syntactic sugar between
<code>foo([{:do, 3}])</code> and <code>foo do 3 end</code>, they are
truly <em>layers</em>. Each one fits neatly inside the previous one with
no overlapping edge cases or hazardous interactions. They’re not
separate features that you have to jig-saw together in some intricate
manner where everything explodes if you overlook something. It’s always
just a function/macro call that takes an assoc list as its last
parameter. (There actually is one sharp edge,
<code>do\n ...\n end</code> vs <code>do: ...\n</code>, but don’t harsh
my groove.)</p>
<p>Oh, then there’s <code>use</code>. You know how I said
“<code>use</code> is fairly normal, it’s just a module import that calls
a callback to initialize stuff”, and then noted that the truth was more
complicated and moved on? The truth is <em>way</em> more interesting:
<code>use Thing, option: something</code> imports the module
<code>Thing</code> like <code>require</code> does, then calls
<code>Thing.__using__(option: something)</code>. The <em>trick</em> is
that the <code>__using__()</code> function usually isn’t called for its
side effects, though that might happen occasionally. In fact, if you
read the docs more carefully it never says that <code>__using__()</code>
is a function at all, just “a callback”. Quite often,
<code>__using__()</code> is in fact a macro. A macro that will
<em>generate and return some code</em>, which is then <em>spliced into
your module</em> where you wrote the <code>use</code> statement. So you
can write a <code>Thing.__using__()</code> macro such that
<code>use Thing</code> actually expands into
<code>require Thing1; require Thing2; def some_cool_method() ...; use SomeOtherThing</code>.
<code>use</code> doesn’t import a module’s definitions into your
module’s namespace, it gives that module permission to
<strong>generate</strong> arbitrary code in your module’s namespace. So
be very aware when reading or writing Elixir code: whenever you see
<code>use</code> invoked, it’s actually some kind of turbo-macro that is
probably defining a bunch of exciting new things for you!</p>
<p>There’s probably more, but I haven’t found it yet. I’m having too
much fun to dig for many more details. Because, I’ll say it, Elixir is a
<em>better</em> Lisp than Common Lisp or Scheme. Writing either of those
comes with a lot of problems you have to solve to get started compared
to, say, Clojure or Fennel: libs, package manager, FFI, build system,
how to distribute applications, etc. No Lisp I know of has had the kind
of robustness and multiprocessing power that BEAM can give you (unless
it was <a href="https://lfe.io/">already written for BEAM</a> ).
Erlang’s pattern-matching is top-tier, and Elixir inherits all of that.
Erlang has a bunch of libs and tools for monitoring and poking around
inside a running application, and Elixir uses them and adds more. And so
on.</p>
<p>And that’s the thing about Elixir’s version of magic: none of it is
actually hidden. They don’t try to pretend it’s magic, they tell you
exactly how it works in the first half of the tutorial! It just, you
know, takes a bit of work to actually <em>absorb</em> what they’re
telling you and figure out how it all interacts. Most of the structures
that form the guts of the runtime are made out of lists and tuples and
atoms, which feels weird to a Rust person who is used to structs and
types which are not interchangeable and never public unless you know for
sure they’re supposed to be. Erlang and Elixir are just like, go ahead,
poke around, make changes, break shit! Because unlike Common Lisp with
its state baked in manually to an image, everything can be automatically
restored to a clean slate when you tell it to starting from a
declarative project specification. Elixir hides nothing behind “magic”.
It <em>wants</em> you to poke around in its magical bits. Yeah you’ll
break shit, here, have the tools you need to make sure that shit doesn’t
break in production. Just use them!</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since a programming language made me this
happy.</p><div id="categoryList"><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/_category/computer">computer</a></li><li><a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/_category/programming">programming</a></li><li><a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/_category/writing">writing</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Incus</h2>
<p dir="auto">Incus is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager.</p>

<p dir="auto">It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers or virtual machines. Incus supports images for a large number of Linux distributions (official Ubuntu images and images provided by the community) and is built around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API. Incus scales from one instance on a single machine to a cluster in a full data center rack, making it suitable for running workloads both for development and in production.</p>
<p dir="auto">Incus allows you to easily set up a system that feels like a small private cloud. You can run any type of workload in an efficient way while keeping your resources optimized.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should consider using Incus if you want to containerize different environments or run virtual machines, or in general run and manage your infrastructure in a cost-effective way.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fork of Canonical LXD</h2>
<p dir="auto">Incus, which is named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_incus" rel="nofollow">Cumulonimbus incus</a> or anvil cloud is a community fork of Canonical's LXD.</p>
<p dir="auto">This fork was made in response to <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/" rel="nofollow">Canonical's takeover</a> of the LXD project from the Linux Containers community.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main aim of this fork is to provide once again a real community project where everyone's contributions are welcome and no one single commercial entity is in charge of the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">The fork was done at the LXD 5.16 release, making it possible to upgrade from LXD releases up to and including LXD 5.16.
Upgrading from a later LXD release may not work as the two projects are likely to start divering from this point onwards.</p>
<p dir="auto">Incus will keep monitoring and importing relevant changes from LXD over time though changes and features that are specific to Ubuntu or Canonical's products are unlikely to be carried over.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Get started</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is still the very early days of this fork. No packages or even releases currently exist.
For production use, you are likely better off sticking with Canonical's LXD for the time being until stable release of Incus exist.</p>

It will be the largest geospatial foundation model on Hugging Face and the first-ever open-source AI foundation model built in collaboration with NASA.</p>

<p><a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/95470/ibm_logo.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/95470/ibm_logo.jpg" title="IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)"> </a></p>

<p>Access to the latest data remains a significant challenge in climate science where environmental conditions change almost daily. And, despite growing amounts of data — <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG%20Strategy_Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">estimates</a>&nbsp;from NASA suggest that by 2024, scientists will have 250,000 terabytes of data from new missions — scientists and researchers still face obstacles in analyzing these large datasets. As part of a Space Act Agreement with NASA, IBM <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-nasa-foundation-models" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set out</a> earlier this year to build an AI foundation model for geospatial data. And now, by making a geospatial foundation model <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/nasa-hugging-face-ibm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available via Hugging Face</a>&nbsp;— a recognized leader in open-source and a well-known repository for all transformer models — efforts can advance to democratize access and application of AI to generate new innovations in climate and Earth science.</p>

<p>"The essential role of open-source technologies to accelerate critical areas of discovery such as climate change has never been clearer," said <span>Sriram Raghavan</span>, Vice President, IBM Research AI. "By combining IBM's foundation model efforts aimed at creating flexible, reusable AI systems with NASA's repository of Earth-satellite data, and making it available on the leading open-source AI platform, Hugging Face, we can leverage the power of collaboration to implement faster and more impactful solutions that will improve our planet."</p>

<p>"AI remains a science-driven field, and science can only progress through information sharing and collaboration," said <span>Jeff Boudier</span>, head of product and growth at Hugging Face. "This is why open-source AI and the open release of models and datasets are so fundamental to the continued progress of AI, and making sure the technology will benefit as many people as possible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We believe that foundation models have the potential to change the way observational data is analyzed and help us to better understand our planet," said <span>Kevin Murphy</span>, Chief Science Data Officer, NASA. "And by open sourcing such models and making them available to the world, we hope to multiply their impact."</p>

<p>The model – trained jointly by <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/impact-ibm-hls-foundation-model?tempAccess=ris1bTFmW5Kr0-i7TWCJJAwj5t65AIiJaAdIDI99IbA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IBM and NASA</a>&nbsp;on <a href="https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 satellite data (HLS)</a> over one year across the continental <span>United States</span> and fine-tuned on labeled data for flood and burn scar mapping — has demonstrated to date a 15 percent improvement over state-of-the-art techniques using half as much labeled data. With additional fine tuning, the base model can be redeployed for tasks like tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, or detecting and monitoring greenhouse gasses. IBM and NASA researchers are also working with <span>Clark University</span> to adapt the model for applications such as time-series segmentation and similarity research.</p>

<p>The news follows IBM's <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-nasa-foundation-models" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> earlier this year to collaborate with NASA to build an AI model that could speed up the analysis of satellite images and boost scientific discovery. It's also part of NASA's decade-long <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Open-Source Science Initiative</a>&nbsp;to build a more accessible, inclusive, and collaborative scientific community. NASA, along with the White House and other federal agencies, has declared 2023 a <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/year-of-open-science" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Year of Open Science</a>&nbsp;to celebrate the benefits and successes created through the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge.</p>

<p>The model leverages IBM <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">foundation model technology</a>&nbsp;and is part of IBM's larger effort to create and train AI models that can be used for different tasks and apply information from one situation to another. In July, IBM&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-watsonx-capabilities-are-now-available-to-help-meet-enterprises-AI-for-business-needs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the availability of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/watsonx?_gl=1*1eo9g2h*_ga*NjI3OTU2MTEwLjE2MzQwNDk4Mzc.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5MDM4ODEzMC42My4wLjE2OTAzODgxMzAuMC4wLjA." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">watsonx</a>, an AI and data platform that allows enterprises to scale and accelerate impact of the most advanced AI with trusted data. A commercial version of the geospatial model, which is part of IBM watsonx, will be available through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52142&amp;_gl=1*1h60pel*_ga*MjAzNjI3MTM1NS4xNjkwNDgyODgx*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5MDQ4Mjg4MS4xLjEuMTY5MDQ4Mzc0NC4wLjAuMA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite</a>&nbsp;(EIS) later this year.</p>

    </p><article>
        

                    
        
        
                                                                                            
        <p>Ten years ago, I wrote the most beautiful, clever, over-engineered piece of code ever. I was building a REST API for a startup, and discovered lots of repetition between controllers: I was building the same kind of actions and copying code over and over again. So I came up with a solution: <em>The CRUDController™</em>.</p>
<p>It was a beautifully complex, abstract class that integrated with Doctrine (the ORM that I was using back then). It had every possible CRUD operation you could think of — not just for entities, but also for child- and has many relations; there were automatic overviews, filtering, pagination, validation, data persistence, routing, and whatnot.</p>
<p>And the only thing I had to do was to create a new controller, extend from my amazing <em>CRUDController™</em>, provide an entity class, and be done.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span><span>class</span> <span>TimesheetController</span> <span>extends</span> <span>CRUDController</span>
</span>{
    <span>public</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>getEntity</span><span>()</span>: <span>string</span>
    </span>{
        <span>return</span> <span>Timesheet</span>::class;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Such a blast!</p>
<p>Except, of course: exceptions started to emerge. Not the programming kind, but the business kind. <em>Some</em> controllers had to do <em>some</em> things a little differently. It was small things at first: different URL schemes, different kinds of validation; but soon, things grew more and more complex: support for nested entities or complex filtering, to name a few.</p>
<p>And young me? I just kept going. Adding the proverbial knobs and pulls to my abstract class (which was growing into a <em>set</em> of classes by now).</p>
<p>In the end, I created a monster; and — ironically — it had taken more time than if I had simply copied code between controllers over and over again. On top of that: I was leaving the startup, and no one really understood how more than 50 controllers actually worked.</p>
<p>You might assume I understood, but let me be clear: I didn't really know how much of it worked anymore.</p>
<p>Yes, I had failed to see the proper solution: a class generator — so that I didn't have to manually copy code again. It actually existed back then, I simply didn't know about it, no one told me about it, and I wasn't smart enough to question myself once I started going down a certain path.</p>
<p>It's such a classic example, many of you probably recognise it. I wouldn't say my coding skills were bad, by the way. No, I didn't question myself enough, I lacked self-reflection and wasn't able to critically look at my own ideas.</p>
<p>I wish I could show you <em>The CRUDController™</em>'s source code; but I don't have access to it anymore, unfortunately. Luckily, the memory still exists. And it's a memory I remind myself of very often when I'm going down the path of abstractions and complications. It's often enough to hold me back and look for better solutions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>A few years</span> ago, the discussion forum Hacker News, where <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/programming/">engineers</a> collectively decide what other engineers should read, developed a quirk. A new phrase had entered the coder lexicon, and it seemed to propel links to the top of the page with such force that to some the rankings might have looked rigged. The phrase—“local-first software”— had an artisanal, farm-to-table sort of ring, at once familiar and flicking at something new. Perhaps some engineers dismissed it as merely a marketing term. But others whittling away their workday afternoons seemed to see it as the solution to a problem they had long sensed: The <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/software/">software</a> they were writing was broken.</p><p>One of the first Hacker News links referred to a <a data-offer-url="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/static/local-first.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/static/local-first.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/static/local-first.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">white paper</a> published in 2019, coauthored by a computer scientist then at the University of Cambridge named Martin Kleppmann and a group of open source developers at an independent “industrial research lab” called <a data-offer-url="https://www.inkandswitch.com" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.inkandswitch.com&quot;}" href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ink &amp; Switch</a>. Kleppmann and the others were alumni of successful tech startups that had done what successful tech startups are generally meant to do: be acquired. They had taken a turn inside their larger buyers and emerged repentant, disappointed with certain aspects of their industry. There were more software developers than ever, but they weren’t coding better experiences for their colleagues or their users. They were coding for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cloud-computing/">cloud</a>.</p><p>The lament was not exactly new. A slogan printed on bumper stickers, T-shirts, and water bottles in Silicon Valley has long mocked the hometown industry with the statement “There is no cloud. There is just someone else’s computer.” That “someone else” being a corporation. Come to Sand Hill Road with an idea for a consumer-facing app, and there are two routes to a check sizable enough to get you written up in TechCrunch: Either monetize your users’ data for resale or advertising, or charge them a fee for accessing that data. Whichever cloud-based business model you choose—“Senator, we run ads” or “Pay us or else”—it’s imperative that the data run through your own servers.</p><p>The local-first white paper (“manifesto” might be the more appropriate term) pointed to a third way. The beauty of the cloud, for the average user, is that it is accessible from many devices and allows collaboration between many people across rooms and continents. The authors proposed to keep all that, but with software that was essentially cloudless. The word “local” in the name refers to your personal computer. “First” means your computer is prioritized over “someone else’s.” If you and I wanted to work on a document together, we would no longer have to depend on some Google data center in the Oregon high desert to maintain the master copy. Instead, we would each have copies stored locally on our devices’ hard drives. I could edit my copy offline, and you could edit yours, and the two files would reconcile our changes anytime they connect, whether once a minute or once a week.</p><p>To build products like this would require fundamentally different ways of structuring data. Different math. The result of that effort? Less shitty software. Freed from worrying about backends, servers, and extortionate cloud computing fees, startups and indie developers could skip strings-attached VC funding and pursue more interesting apps. What’s more, they could take advantage of hardware improvements that cloud developers often missed out on. When an app is cloud-based, its performance is limited by the speed of its connection to the central server and how quickly that server can reply. With a local-first app, the user’s device runs all the code. The better your laptop or smartphone gets, the more the app can do.</p><p>To a developer, the opposing trends of accelerating machines and stagnant load times are rather silly. Offensive, really. You should be offended too, because it means you’ve been missing out on something. The cloud appears heavenly, until it isn’t. Haven’t you noticed, lately, as belts tighten across Silicon Valley, that your own personal internet feels less abundant than before? That certain things are getting a little more expensive, or a little less convenient? A monthly cost to keep all your photos in storage or back up your phone. A premium upgrade to allow multiple users to edit the same file. A video game that requires a subscription and lags just as you go for the win.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The journalist and science fiction author Cory Doctorow uses the term “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>” to describe how platform capitalism squanders useful technology. A new platform, flush with venture capital, is first good to its users. Then advertisers come for its audience, and the platform is good to them too. Then, still hungry for profits, it poisons the well. It begins to interfere with the features that you value until you’re fed up. This is “how platforms die,” Doctorow writes. Cold business logic blazes this sorry path, but technological choices pave it.</p><p>Maybe that’s fine. Maybe the process is regenerative, like a wildfire clearing the underbrush. It makes way for new platforms to be good to us again, at least for a while. But what if something different could take root? What if changing the innards of software, invisible to most of us, could help nudge technology out of the shit?</p><p><span>Kleppmann and I</span> are suspended three stories above the parking lot of St. Louis’ City Museum, an old shoe factory turned architectural playground and salvage yard. It’s closing time, and the guards would like us to climb down and clear out. Kleppmann, however, is aiming for the highest point of the structure, a hollowed-out business jet from the 1960s, accessible through a steeply angled tube made of chain link. He wears a royal blue sweater that somehow instantly clocks him as European, his frizzled orange-brown hair pulled into a tight ponytail. As he slides into the fuselage, I imagine I’m pursuing a fox.</p><p>The night at the museum is Kleppman’s favorite part of Strange Loop, which might just be his favorite developer conference. It’s an event that merges joy and weirdness with practicality—his ideal combination. Kleppmann is perhaps best known for a textbook called <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em>, which explains the fundamentals of moving lots of data around vast computer systems. A quirky survival guide for the modern dev, it has sold more than 200,000 copies—enough to merit celebrity status in this community. Fans stop Kleppmann by the yawning mouth of a life-size whale sculpture and as he emerges from a five-story slide, thanking him for helping them land their first software jobs.</p><p>The seeds of the local-first manifesto can be found in a little box on page 174 of Kleppmann’s book. It describes something called a conflict-free replicated data type, or CRDT, which he defines as a “family of data structures” that allow many people to collaborate on a file and “automatically resolve conflicts in sensible ways.” In the book, Kleppmann notes that the implementation of CRDT algorithms is “still young.”</p><p>By computing standards, though, CRDTs themselves were old. They were co-developed by a French computer theorist named Marc Shapiro about two decades ago, when the cloud revolution was still nascent. Shapiro, who subscribed to many of the ideals of the peer-to-peer movement, was beginning to fear where cloud computing might lead the web. While the internet protocol itself remained open and decentralized, the stuff being built on top of it was moving in a monopolistic direction. The tech companies were growing beautiful gardens to lure users in—then building walls to discourage them from leaving.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>One area they hadn’t yet totally conquered, however, was online collaboration. Connectivity wasn’t good enough at the time. Shapiro and his colleague Nuno Preguiça wondered: Did people have to <em>be</em> online to collaborate online? Or could they work offline and collaborate peer-to-peer?</p><p>Conceptually, it wasn’t so difficult to imagine: Create many replicas of the same file, each of which automatically snaps to a state identical to its peers, like atoms in quantum entanglement. Whether you edit your replica first and then receive my changes, or I edit my replica and then receive your changes, the algorithm produces the same result for us both. In math-speak, that’s the “commutative” property. (In fact, it’s what the “C” in CRDT initially stood for.)</p><p>How should the algorithm go about this? In most cases, the answer is straightforward. If I add one paragraph and you remove another, the order doesn’t matter. But suppose we each tinker with the same word; you think it should be <em>purple</em> and I think it should be <em>mauve</em>. What stops the result from being <em>purmaupleve</em>? Different CRDTs solve this with different rules meant to preserve the intent of the various collaborators. They may rely on timestamps to order the new elements, or perhaps have some way of encoding the relationship of each element to the elements around it, preserving some notion of words or sentences. The possibilities are numerous.</p><p>These tricks to preserve order can also make the CRDT horribly inefficient. It’s too much data to keep track of. So the other task for designing a CRDT is one of editing: deciding the minimum amount of information that replicas need to send each other in order to produce a harmonious result, and how to package those changes efficiently.</p><p>Shapiro and Preguiça initially published their CRDT algorithm as a technical report. Shapiro thought about starting a company focused on collaborative editing. “A few months later, bang, Google Docs comes out,” he tells me. The new software used an older process for merging changes called operational transformation, or OT, and still relied on a central Google server. Shapiro believed he had invented something that was more theoretically sound—a stable foundation for truly peer-to-peer software. But by the time Kleppmann came upon his paper years later, few people were using the software.</p><p>Kleppmann had grown up in Germany toying with both computers and his viola. After an abandoned flirtation with a career in composition (ivory tower notions of “what was good and what was rubbish” did not agree with him), he had followed the classic techie career arc: He cofounded a startup (called Rapportive, it integrated data from social media profiles into email contacts); he moved to the Bay Area (closer to investors and social media giants); his startup was acquired by a tech juggernaut (LinkedIn). Kleppmann lasted a few years before leaving to take a research position at Cambridge.</p><p>The new job gave Kleppmann what he had long wanted: a return to creativity. He had flexibility to explore more unusual approaches to programming, including projects that might not immediately pay off. He explains his work with an analogy borrowed from his wife, a high school chemistry teacher. If you think of individual bytes of data as atoms, then data structures are like molecules. For any new coder, the next step after “hello, world” is to learn these arrangements—lists, trees, hashes, and graphs, to name a few broad categories. What Kleppmann wanted to uncover were stranger atomic arrangements that could enable different types of applications.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He describes Shapiro’s paper as “an awakening.” In CRDTs, Kleppmann saw the technical basis for a new class of software that no one was providing. But the algorithms were mostly useless for professional programmers. They were too inefficient and lacked the typical tools that developers actually use to make apps. Kleppmann realized he would have to make local-first developers’ lives easy, shepherding the idea from a set of mathematical proofs to production-ready code. He set about coding an open source implementation of CRDTs, which he called Automerge, that people could freely use to build apps.</p><p><span>I saw the</span> fruit of this effort a few years later, shortly after the local-first manifesto broke Hacker News. I met Peter van Hardenberg, one of Kleppmann’s coauthors, in a café in San Francisco. He was, like Kleppmann, rebooting after a long journey through the cloud, first as part of the founding team at Heroku, which helped other startups get their cloud services going, and then inside its acquirer, Salesforce. He wanted to show me an app called Pushpin, envisioned as a digital corkboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Van Hardenberg pulled up a blank project on his iPad. I loaded a replica of the same file on my laptop. We began tinkering, adding images and text boxes to our own files, and then allowed them to merge. Sometimes this worked seamlessly; other times the changes stopped loading, or the pixels dragged with dial-up-era latency. Pushpin felt like a toy, the sort of app that a couple of bright-eyed Stanford undergrads might code in the common room with visions of a seed round and later shelve in embarrassment.</p><p>But van Hardenberg was far from embarrassed. The technical groundwork was being laid, he believed, for local-first versions of Slack, Discord, Google Docs, Photoshop. Better design apps, calendars, budgets. More complex programs, too, if they could make Automerge far more efficient. There was the possibility of private, end-to-end encryption for all these collaborative apps, since no server would get in the way. There were technical limits to CRDTs—and plenty of applications that the cloud would serve far better. But to him, the prototype felt like a revolution. There wasn’t a server between us. Yet it worked. Mostly. We were two peers communicating, as the first bricklayers of the internet intended.&nbsp;</p><p>Van Hardenberg’s vision was somewhat easier to see when we met again in St. Louis. The tech giants were slipping. Meta’s stock was at a seven-year low. Twitter was in the midst of a hostile Elon Musk takeover. Kleppmann was spending a few hours each week as a technical adviser to Bluesky, spawned by Twitter as a decentralized experiment and now suddenly thrust in the spotlight, poised to become its competitor. Its “federated” design promised to give people the option to leave servers and services that treated them poorly. Bluesky wasn’t using CRDTs, which would be much too slow for coordinating the feeds of millions of social media users, but the goal was similar: a better relationship with “someone else’s computer.” Computing alternatives were once again in vogue.</p><p>Among them, CRDTs. Strange Loop was teeming with local-first presentations—a surprise to Kleppmann and van Hardenberg, who had until recently kept track of every project through Google Alerts and word of mouth. CRDTs were turning up in the wider world too. Developers at <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> had used them to build a tool for arranging articles on the homepage. People poking around in the code that runs Apple’s Notes app had noticed CRDTs. Jupyter Notebooks, a popular data science app, restored its collaboration tools using CRDTs after Google got rid of the cloud service it had previously depended on.</p><p>Among the presenters at Strange Loop was a Canadian developer named Brooklyn Zelenka, cofounder of a company called Fission. When she read the local-first manifesto, she recalls, “I was like, this is a great phrase. Before that, we had these awkward phrases, like ‘location independence’ or ‘user-owned data.’” Zelenka had been interested in the ideas of Web3—the moniker adopted by “decentralized” apps that use blockchain technology and cryptocurrency—but found its culture “aggressive,” which she attributed to the focus on money “so clearly, all the time.” It was nice to be getting into local-first early. “Everything is low-hanging fruit right now,” Zelenka told me.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Hers was a common trajectory. Crypto “brought out all the worst people,” van Hardenberg told me over lunch at the conference, but it also spoke to many of the same principles as local-first. In his opinion, it simply uses the wrong approach, promising users decentralization and independence but tethering them to speculative financial incentives. It’s also the opposite of offline-first: Cumbersome blockchains, controlled by whoever hoards the most resources, mediate every interaction. Still, crypto did offer a lesson in how hype can fuel the creation of new products. Van Hardenberg noted the large numbers of bored and disaffected programmers at the likes of Meta and Google who jumped ship at the height of the crypto bubble.</p><p>Local-first, he thought, could eventually elicit the same excitement, but with software that was actually good. What it needed, van Hardenberg said, was a big “exit” that would bring “signs of visible wealth” to some lucky group of local-first developers and help attract more talent and resources. Growth was also scary. Van Hardenberg and Kleppmann had so far eschewed venture capital funding for Automerge itself, fearing that it would force them into any variety of business models that “totally go against the values of local-first,” as Kleppmann told me. But at some point, they realized, growth would also be necessary. They hoped the software could stand for itself. “VCs love a replatforming,” van Hardenberg said.</p><p><span>A few months</span> after the conference, “local first” was trending again on Hacker News. One commenter called CRDTs the “dragon slayer” sword that would allow local-first apps to compete with the cloud. Another lamented that every interesting technical post about CRDTs devolved into a “weird political discussion about decentralization.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite many movements for tech decentralization, the dragon’s hoard of gold has kept growing. One problem is the perception that principles come at the expense of convenience. As fulfilling and virtuous as it might be to hew your own coffee table, it’s also hard. Eventually you get tired, and you buy your next piece of furniture off Amazon. So it goes for managing your data. “It’s so much easier to be lazy and let Apple or Google do it for you,” Shapiro told me. When I asked him what it was like to use the modern internet while adhering to his principles, he said he simply abstains from technology as much as he can. “It’s a terrible waste of your time,” he told me.</p><p>I was curious whether the term “local first” bothered Shapiro at all—whether he took it as an unwelcome rebrand of his technical creation. I was surprised when he told me loved it. There was magic to the phrase, he thought. Maybe the revolution has to be a little sneaky to land a blow: reel in developers with the technical possibilities, call it a “movement” to attract the politics-obsessed journalists (hello). Maybe it also needs to arrive at the right moment, when the Big Tech platforms seem ready to crumble, revealing the features lost and the abuses endured in exchange for convenience.</p><p>Kleppmann wasn’t demanding a return to analog or to smash all the cloud servers, which do many useful things. The sword was not a slayer but a tool to carve out something better—and even he would say that it still needs sharpening. When I asked him whether I could try out a new, CRDT-based text editor he had been working on, his usual expression of calm attentiveness transformed briefly into alarm. Of course, theoretically I could run the <a data-offer-url="https://www.inkandswitch.com/upwelling/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.inkandswitch.com/upwelling/&quot;}" href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/upwelling/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">prototype</a> that’s posted online, since it’s open source—“but please don’t do that,” he told me. He would let me know when local-first was ready.</p><hr><p><em>Let us know what you think about this article.

<p>We are excited to announce the start of company that will build around Polars, enabling data processing at any scale.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>What a ride...</p>
<p>It has been 3 years (23 June 2020) since the first commit of Polars.
It started as a pet project of mine, with the goal to learn more about query engines, Apache arrow and the Rust programming language. It has grown far beyond that since.</p>
<p>Polars has grown to one of the fastest open-source OLAP query engines [1]. And the adoption has grown beyond what I ever anticipated. In Github stars the project has been the fastest growing data processing project that I am aware of. At the moment of writing Polars has over 6 million total downloads and 19.000 github stars, closing in on Apache Spark and Pandas, the most popular DataFrame implementations in existence.
I am very thankful for all the help from the open-source community, the users, and Xomnia, without them this blog would not have been posted.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pola.rs/posts/company-announcement/star-history.png" width="80%">
</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Polars has jumped in a void that has become more wide in the last 10 years.
Laptops used by developers have become more powerful and more underused. DataFrame implementations implemented for single node were mostly single threaded, only utilized RAM memory and didn't use conventional wisdom and research available in the database community.</p>
<p>Polars was written from scratch in Rust, and therefore didn't inherit bad design choices from its predecessors, but instead learned from them. Cherry picking good ideas, and learning from mistakes. The main drivers for its success are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strict, consistent and composable API.
  Polars gives you the hangover up front and fails fast, making it very suitable for writing correct data pipelines.</li>
<li>OLAP query engine:
  I see DataFrames as a front-end on a query engine. Polars is a fast vectorized query engine that has excellent performance and memory usage. Besides that, Polars comes with a query optimizer, meaning that users can write idiomatic code and the optimizer focuses on making it fast.</li>
<li>We love to work locally and put our own machine to work.
  This is best explained by quoting from one of our issues :)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Polars is so incredibly fast (and feature-rich) that I find myself abandoning R and its data.table package. Indeed, one guilty pleasure is to code lots and lots of steps with "lazy" data frames and then run collect() at the end -- and then sit back to watch in htop as the cores on my Threadripper Pro go to work. It's ahhhh ... pretty amazing!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="we-started-a-company">We started a company</h2>
<p>We are aiming to deliver a Rust-based compute platform that will efficiently run Polars at any scale. </p>
<p>We believe that the Polars API can be used for both local and cloud/distributed environments. Our API is designed to work well on multiple cores, this design also makes it well poised for a distributed environment. We also believe that a Rust based columnar OLAP engine (Polars), is perfectly suited for efficient distributed computing. The (closed source) development of DataBricks' photon engine is proof that those environments are no longer IO bound. They concluded they need C/C++ level performance and columnar memory to unblock their CPU limits.</p>
<p>To accelerate towards this goal, we started a company. I have asked Chiel Peters to join me as a co-founder to start a company.
Chiel and I have been working at the same company (Xomnia) the past 5 years and I really trust his insights and him as a person. We successfully closed a seed round of approximately 4M$, which was lead by Bain Capital Ventures. Together we will launch Polars into its new phase and we are really excited to get started.</p>
<h3 id="polars-the-oss-project">Polars the OSS project</h3>
<p>The company will be built around the open-source Polars project. Our services will improve Polars' scalability and interoperability in enterprise environments. Polars will remain MIT-licensed and the company will sponsor and accelerate the open-source development of Polars.</p>
<h3 id="short-term-goal">Short term goal</h3>
<p>Our initial focus will be on setting up the managed environment, improving cloud connectors, caching and getting connected to companies that use Polars. I don't want to be too specific here, as that never ages well.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-you">We need you</h2>
<p>We cannot do this alone, and we need both great hires and great companies to work with us.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-hiring">We are hiring</h2>
<p>You can be a part of this. If you are an experienced Rust developer with interest/knowledge in building databases, or writing fast software, please contact us on hr@polars.tech. We are looking for +- 4 CET.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-looking-for-design-partners">We are looking for design partners</h2>
<p>We hope to find companies that want to be a part of this. By being our development partner, you can give your input and steer our product and we can learn and iterate much faster. Is your company using Polars and interesting in being our partner, please contact us at info@polars.tech.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="a-appendix">A: Appendix</h3>
<p>The suboptimal state of DataFrame implementations can mostly be attributed to:</p>
<h4 id="a1-ignoring-database-research">A.1 Ignoring database research</h4>
<p>Efficient data processing is a hard problem. A problem that has been researched for a long time, though you wouldn't tell if you looked at the problem from a DataFrame perspective. Almost all implementation runs your query as is and don't do any optimization on behalf of the user. I believe a DataFrame should be seen as a materialized view. What is most important is the query plan beneath it and the way we optimize and execute that plan. The DataFrame itself is just an intermediate data structure. It is an abstraction that helps users think about their business problem, but on our side, most important is the query engine.</p>
<h4 id="a2-implementations-are-written-in-python">A.2 Implementations are written in Python.</h4>
<p>Because Python is the host language of the most popular DataFrame implementation, Python and tools already available. This can be seen clearly with pandas. Pandas uses numpy, even though it is a poor fit for relational data processing. Numpy is great for numerical processing, but for any other data type that doesn't fit a number (arrays, strings, structs) it requires storing boxed Python objects. This has been accepted for over 10 years. For the rust programmers; a column would be somewhat similar to <code>Vec&lt;Box&lt;Mutex&lt;dyn PythonObject&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, but then the Mutex would be global and lock access for all objects.</p>
<p>Any other tool that utilizes pandas inherits the same poor data types and the same single threaded execution. If the problem is GIL bound, we remain in single threaded Python land.</p>
<h4 id="a3-idle-hardware">A.3 Idle hardware</h4>
<p>My laptop has 16 cores and 1TB hard disk. A DataFrame implementation should utilize that and efficiently (so no Python multiprocessing).</p>

<p>
This week, software developer Arthur Westbook announced his early retirement at
age 58.</p>
<p>
Westbrook spent 35 years in a codebase that allegedly powers some sort of
medical software somewhere. During his tenure, he contributed hundreds of lines
of code. Westbrook once touched legacy code without ending the company.</p>
<p>
Westbrook believes he grapsed over 4% of the entire codebase. A former colleague
called it “the War &amp; Peace of wingdings”.</p>
<p>
In the company, Westbrook was known as “one of the programmers on the team”. His
manager noted, “Arthur had a knack for working hard without learning
transferrable skills. He will be dearly missed. It’ll take two junior devs and a
Keurig to replace him.”</p>
<p>
In honor of his decades of service, one of his coworkers will take him out for
drinks “sometime next month”. Nobody on his team responded for comment.</p>
<p>
For his retirement, Westbrook plans to dabble in street performance and dumpster
diving. He also plans to hone his culinary creation: Soylent mixed with Whole
Foods Premium Adult Cat Salmon Mix.</p>

</a>  <p>The network stack does several seemingly-impossible things.
It does reliable transmission over our unreliable networks, usually without any detectable hiccups.
It adapts smoothly to network congestion.
It provides addressing to billions of active nodes.
It routes packets around damaged network infrastructure, reassembling them in the correct order on the other side even if they arrived out of order.
It accommodates esoteric analog hardware needs, like balancing the charge on the two ends of an Ethernet cable.
This all works so well that users never hear of it, and even most programmers don't know how it works.</p>

</a>  <div>
    <p>In the old days of analog telephones, making a phone call meant a continuous electrical connection from your phone to your friend's.
It was as if a wire were run directly from you to them.
There was no such wire, of course – the connection was made through complex switching systems – but it was electrically equivalent to a single wire.</p>
<p>There are too many Internet nodes for it to work in this way.
We can't provide a direct, uninterruptible path from each machine to each other machine it wants to talk to.</p>
<p>Instead, data is bucket-brigaded – handed off from one router to the next, in a chain, each one bringing it closer to its destination.
Each router between my laptop and google.com is connected to a number of other routers, maintaining a crude routing table showing which routers are closer to which parts of the Internet.
When a packet arrives destined for google.com, a quick lookup in the routing table tells the router where the packet should go next to bring it closer to Google.
The packets are small, so each router in the chain ties up the next router for only a tiny fraction of a second.</p>
<p>Routing breaks down into two sub-problems.
First, addressing: what is the data's destination?
This is handled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP, the Internet Protocol</a>, whence IP addresses.
IPv4, still the most common version of IP, provides only 32 bits of address space.
It's <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/dpino/2017/05/25/ipv4-exhaustion/">now fully allocated</a>, so adding a node to the public Internet requires reusing an existing IP address.
IPv6 allows 2<sup>128</sup> addresses (about 10<sup>38</sup>), but only has about 20% adoption as of 2017.</p>
<p>Now that we have addresses, we need to know how to route a packet through the Internet toward its destination.
Routing happens fast, so there's no time to query remote databases for routing information.
As an example, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/asr-9922-router/index.html">Cisco ASR 9922</a> routers have a maximum capacity of 160 terabits per second.
Assuming full 1,500 byte packets (12,000 bits), that's 13,333,333,333 packets per second in a single 19 inch rack!</p>
<p>To route quickly, routers maintain <em>routing tables</em> indicating the paths to various groups of IP addresses.
When a new packet arrives, the router looks it up in the table, telling it which peer is closest to the destination.
It sends the packet to that peer and moves on to the next.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol">BGP</a>'s job is to communicate this routing table information between different routers, ensuring up-to-date route tables.</p>
<p>IP and BGP together don't make a useful Internet, unfortunately, because they provide no way to transfer data reliably.
If a router becomes overloaded and drops a packet, we need a way to detect the loss and request retransmission.</p>

    <p>If the Internet works by routers handing data to each other down the line, what happens when the data is large?
What if we request the 88.5 MB video of <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The Birth &amp; Death of JavaScript</a>?</p>
<p>We could try to design a network where the 88.5 MB document is sent from the web server to the first router, then to the second, and so on.
Unfortunately, that network wouldn't work at Internet scale, or even at intranet scale.</p>
<p>First, computers are finite machines with finite amounts of storage.
If a given router has only 88.4 MB of buffer memory available, it simply can't store the 88.5 MB video file.
The data will be dropped on the floor and, worse, I'll get no indication.
If a router is so busy that it's dropping data, it can't take the time to tell me about dropped data.</p>
<p>Second, computers are unreliable.
Sometimes, routing nodes fail.
Sometimes, ships' anchors accidentally damage underwater fiber-optic cables, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_submarine_cable_disruption">taking out large portions of the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>For these reasons and more, we don't send 88.5 MB messages across the Internet.
Instead, we break them down into packets, usually in the neighborhood of 1,400 bytes each.
Our video file will be broken into 63,214 or so separate packets for transmission.</p>

    <p>Measuring an actual transfer of <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The Birth &amp; Death of JavaScript</a> with the packet capture tool <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, I see a total of 61,807 packets received, each 1,432 bytes.
Multiplying those two, we get 88.5 megabytes, which is the size of the video.
(This doesn't include the overhead added by various protocols; if it did, we'd see a slightly higher number.)</p>
<p>The transfer was done over HTTP, a protocol layered over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol</a>.
It only took 14 seconds, so the packets arrived at an average rate of about 4,400 per second, or about 250 microseconds per packet.
In 14 seconds, my machine received all 61,807 of those packets, possibly out-of-order, reassembling them into the full file as they came in.</p>
<p>TCP packet reassembly is done using the simplest imaginable mechanism: a counter.
Each packet is assigned a <em>sequence number</em> when it's sent.
On the receiving side, the packets are put in order by sequence number.
Once they're all in order, with no gaps, we know the whole file is present.</p>
<p>(Actual TCP sequence numbers tend not to be integers simply increasing by 1 each time, but that detail isn't important here.)</p>
<p>How do we know when the file is finished, though?
TCP doesn't say anything about that; it's the job of higher-level protocols.
For example, HTTP responses contain a "Content-Length" header specifying the response length in bytes.
The client reads the Content-Length, then keeps reading TCP packets, assembling them back into their original order, until it has all of the bytes specified by Content-Length.
This is one reason that HTTP headers (and most other protocols' headers) come before the response payload: otherwise, we wouldn't know the payload's size.</p>
<p>When we say "the client" here, we're really talking about the entire receiving computer.
TCP reassembly happens inside the kernel, so applications like web browsers and curl and wget don't have to manually reassemble TCP packets.
But the kernel doesn't handle HTTP, so applications do have to understand the Content-Length header and know how many bytes to read.</p>
<p>With sequence numbers and packet reordering, we can transmit large sequences of bytes even if the packets arrive out-of-order.
But what if a packet is lost in transit, leaving a hole in the HTTP response?</p>

    <p>I did a normal download of <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The Birth &amp; Death of JavaScript</a> with <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> turned on.
Scrolling through the capture, I see packet after packet being received successfully.</p>
<p>For example, a packet with sequence number 563,321 arrived.
Like all TCP packets, it had a "next sequence number", which is the number used for the following packet.
This packet's "next sequence number" was 564,753.
The next packet did, in fact, have sequence number 564,753, so everything was good.
This happens thousands of times per second once the connection gets up to speed.</p>
<p>Occasionally, my computer sends a message to the server saying, for example, "I've received all packets up to and including packet number 564,753."
That's an ACK, for <em>acknowledgement</em>: my computer acknowledges receipt of the server's packets.
On a new connection, the Linux kernel sends an ACK after every ten packets.
This is controlled by the <code>TCP_INIT_CWND</code> constant, which we can see <a href="http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.5/source/include/net/tcp.h#L220">defined</a> in the Linux kernel's source code.</p>
<p>(The <code>CWND</code> in <code>TCP_INIT_CWND</code> stands for <em>congestion window</em>: the amount of data allowed in flight at once.
If the network becomes <em>congested</em> – overloaded – then the window size will be reduced, slowing packet transmission.)</p>
<p>Ten packets is about 14 KB, so we're limited to 14 KB of data in flight at a time.
This is part of <em>TCP slow start</em>: connections begin with small congestion windows.
If no packets are lost, the receiver will continually increase the congestion window, allowing more packets in flight at once.</p>
<p>Eventually, a packet will be lost, so the receive window will be decreased, slowing transmission.
By automatically adjusting the congestion window, as well as some other parameters, the sender and receiver keep data moving as quickly as the network will allow, but no quicker.</p>
<p>This happens on both sides of the connection: each side ACKs the other side's messages, and each side maintains its own congestion window.
Asymmetric windows allow the protocol to take full advantage of network connections with asymmetric upstream and downstream bandwidth, like most residential and mobile Internet connections.</p>

    <p>Computers are unreliable; networks made of computers are extra unreliable.
On a large-scale network like the Internet, failure is a normal part of operation and must be accommodated.
In a packet network, this means <em>retransmission</em>: if the client receives packets number 1 and 3, but doesn't receive 2, then it needs to ask the server to re-send the missing packet.</p>
<p>When receiving thousands of packets per second, as in our 88.5 MB video download, mistakes are almost guaranteed.
To demonstrate that, let's return to my Wireshark capture of the download.
For thousands of packets, everything goes normally.
Each packet specifies a "next sequence number", followed by another packet with that number.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something goes wrong.
The 6,269th packet has a "next sequence number" of 7,208,745, but that packet never comes.
Instead, a packet with sequence number 7,211,609 arrives.
This is an out-of-order packet: something is missing.</p>
<p>We can't tell exactly what went wrong here.
Maybe one of the intermediate routers on the Internet was overloaded.
Maybe my local router was overloaded.
Maybe someone turned a microwave on, introducing electromagnetic interference and slowing my wireless connection.
In any case, the packet was lost and the only indication is the unexpected packet.</p>
<p>TCP has no special "I lost a packet!" message.
Instead, ACKs are cleverly reused to indicate loss.
Any out-of-order packet causes the receiver to re-ACK the last "good" packet – the last one in the correct order.
In effect, the receiver is saying "I received packet 5, which I'm ACKing. I also received something after that, but I know it wasn't packet 6 because it didn't match the next sequence number in packet 5."</p>
<p>If two packets simply got switched in transit, this will result in a single extra ACK and everything will continue normally after the out-of-order packet is received.
But if the packet was truly lost, unexpected packets will continue to arrive and the receiver will continue to send duplicate ACKs of the last good packet.
This can result in hundreds of duplicate ACKs.</p>
<p>When the sender sees three duplicate ACKs in a row, it assumes that the following packet was lost and retransmits it.
This is called <em>TCP fast retransmit</em> because it's faster than the older, timeout-based approach.
It's interesting to note that the protocol itself doesn't have any explicit way to say "please retransmit this immediately!"
Instead, multiple ACKs arising naturally from the protocol serve as the trigger.</p>
<p>(An interesting thought experiment: what happens if some of the duplicate ACKs are lost, never reaching the sender?)</p>
<p>Retransmission is common even in networks working normally.
In a capture of our 88.5 MB video download, I saw this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The congestion window quickly increases to about a megabyte due to continuing successful transmission.</li>
<li>A few thousand packets show up in order; everything is normal.</li>
<li>One packet comes out of order.</li>
<li>Data continues pouring in at megabytes per second, but the packet is still missing.</li>
<li>My machine sends dozens of duplicate ACKs of the last known-good packet, but the kernel also stores the pending out-of-order packets for later reassembly.</li>
<li>The server receives the duplicate ACKs and resends the missing packet.</li>
<li>My client ACKs both the previously-missing packet and the later ones that were already received due to out-of-order transmission.
This is done by simply ACKing the most recent packet, which implicitly ACKs all earlier ones as well.</li>
<li>The transfer continues, but with a reduced congestion window due to the lost packet.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is normal; it's happened in every capture of the full download that I've done.
TCP is so successful at its job that we don't even think of networks as being unreliable in our daily use, even though they fail routinely under normal conditions.</p>

    <p>All of this network data has to be transferred over physical media like copper, fiber optics, and wireless radio.
Of the physical layer protocols, Ethernet is the most well known.
Its popularity in the early days of the Internet led us to design other protocols to accommodate its limitations.</p>
<p>First, let's get the physical details out of the way.
Ethernet is most closely associated with RJ45 connectors, which look like bigger eight-pin versions of older four-pin phone jacks.
It's also associated with cat5 (or cat5e, or cat6, or cat7) cable, which contains eight total wires twisted into four pairs.
Other media exist, but these are the ones we're most likely to encounter at home: eight wires wrapped in a sheath connected to an eight-pin jack.</p>
<p>Ethernet is a <em>physical layer protocol</em>: it describes how the bits turn into electrical signals in a cable.
It's also a <em>link layer protocol</em>: it describes the direct connection of one node to another.
However, it's purely point-to-point and says nothing about how data is routed on a network.
There's no concept of a connection in the sense of a TCP connection, or of reassignable addresses in the sense of an IP address.</p>
<p>As a protocol, ethernet has two primary jobs.
First, each device needs to notice that it's connected to something, and some parameters like connection speed need to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Second, once link is established, Ethernet needs to carry data.
Like the higher-level protocols TCP and IP, Ethernet data is broken into packets.
The core of a packet is a <em>frame</em>, which has a 1,500 byte payload, plus another 22 bytes for header information like source and destination MAC address, payload length, and checksum.
These fields are familiar: programmers often deal with addresses and lengths and checksums, and we can imagine why they're necessary.</p>
<p>The frame is then wrapped in yet another layer of headers to form the full packet.
These headers are... weird.
They start to bump up against the underlying reality of analog electrical systems, so they look like nothing we would ever put in a software protocol.
A full Ethernet packet contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The preamble, which is 56 bits (7 bytes) of alternating 1s and 0s.
The devices use this to synchronize their clocks, sort of like when people count off "1-2-3-GO!"
Computers can't count past 1, so they synchronize by saying "10101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010".</li>
<li>An 8-bit (1 byte) start frame delimiter, which is the number 171 (10101011 in binary).
This marks the end of the preamble. Notice that it's "10" repeated again, until the end where there's a "11".</li>
<li>The frame itself, which contains the source and destination addresses, the payload, etc., as described above.</li>
<li>An interpacket gap of 96 bits (12 bytes) where the line is left idle.
Presumably, this is to let the devices rest because they are tired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting this all together: what we want is to transmit our 1,500 bytes of data.
We add 22 bytes to create a frame, which indicates the source, destination, size, and checksum.
We add another 20 bytes of extra data accommodating the hardware's needs, creating a full Ethernet packet.</p>
<p>You might think this is the bottom of the stack.
It's not, but things do get weirder because the analog world pokes through even more.</p>

    <p>Digital systems don't exist; everything is analog.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a 5-volt CMOS system.
(CMOS is a type of digital system; don't worry about it if you're not familiar.)
This means that a fully-on signal will be 5 volts, and a fully-off signal will be 0.
But nothing is ever fully on or fully off; the physical world doesn't work like that.
In reality, our 5-volt CMOS system will consider anything above 1.67 volts to be a 1, and anything below 1.67 to be 0.</p>
<p>(1.67 is 1/3 of 5. Let's not worry about why the threshold is 1/3.
If you want to dig, there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_level">wikipedia article</a>, of course!
Also, Ethernet isn't CMOS or even related to CMOS, but CMOS and its 1/3 cutoff make for a simple illustration.)</p>
<p>Our Ethernet packets have to go over a physical wire, which means changing the voltage across the wire.
Ethernet is a 5-volt system, so we naively expect each 1 bit in the Ethernet protocol to be 5 volts and each 0 bit to be 0 volts.
But there are two wrinkles: first, the voltage range is -2.5 V to +2.5 V.
Second, and more strangely, each set of 8 bits gets expanded into 10 bits before hitting the wire.</p>
<p>There are 256 possible 8-bit values and 1024 possible 10-bit values, so imagine this as a table mapping them.
Each 8-bit byte can be mapped to any of four different 10-bit patterns, each of which will be turned back into the same 8-bit byte on the receiving end.
For example, the 10-bit value 00.0000.0000 might map to the 8-bit value 0000.0000.
But maybe the 10-bit value 10.1010.1010 also maps to 0000.0000.
When an Ethernet device sees either 00.0000.0000 or 10.1010.1010, they'll be understood as the byte 0 (binary 0000.0000).</p>
<p>(Warning: there are going to be some electronics words now.)</p>
<p>This exists to serve an extremely analog need: balancing the voltage in the devices.
Suppose this 8-bit-to-10-bit encoding doesn't exist, and we send some data that happens to be all 1s.
Ethernet's voltage range is -2.5 to +2.5 volts, so we're holding the Ethernet cable's voltage at +2.5 V, continually pulling electrons from the other side.</p>
<p>Why do we care about one side pulling more electrons than the other?
Because the analog world is a mess and it will cause all kinds of undesirable effects.
To take one: it can charge the capacitors used in low-pass filters, creating an offset in the signal level itself, eventually causing bit errors.
Those errors would take time to accumulate, but we don't want our network devices to suddenly corrupt data after two years of uptime simply because we happened to send more binary 1s than 0s.</p>
<p>(Electronics words end here.)</p>
<p>By using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8b/10b_encoding">8b/10b encoding</a>, Ethernet can balance the number of 0s and 1s sent over the wire, even if we send data that's mostly 1s or mostly 0s.
The hardware tracks the ratio of 0s to 1s, mapping outgoing 8-bit bytes to different options from the 10-bit table to achieve electrical balance.
(Newer Ethernet standards, like 10 GB Ethernet, use different and more complex encoding systems.)</p>
<p>We'll stop here, because we're already beyond the scope of what can be considered programming, but there are many more protocol issues to accommodate the physical layer.
In many cases, the solutions to hardware problems lie in the software itself, as in the case of the 8b/10b coding used to correct DC offset.
This is perhaps a bit disconcerting to us as programmers: we like to pretend that our software lives in a perfect Platonic world, devoid of the vulgar imperfections of physicality.
In reality, everything is analog, and accommodating that complexity is everyone's job, including the software's.</p>

    <p>Internet protocols are best thought of as a stack of layers.
Ethernet provides physical data transfer and link between two point-to-point devices.
IP provides a layer of addressing, allowing routers and large-scale networks to exist, but it's connectionless.
Packets are fired into the ether, with no indication of whether they arrived or not.
TCP adds a layer of reliable transmission by using sequence numbers, acknowledgement, and retransmission.</p>
<p>Finally, application-level protocols like HTTP are layered on top of TCP.
At this level, we already have addressing and the illusion of reliable transmission and persistent connections.
IP and TCP save application developers from constantly reimplementing packet retransmission and addressing and so on.</p>
<p>The independence of these layers is important.
For example, when packets were lost during my 88.5 MB video transfer, the Internet's backbone routers didn't know; only my machine and the web server knew.
Dozens of duplicate ACKs from my computer were all dutifully routed over the same routing infrastructure that lost the original packet.
It's possible that the router responsible for dropping the lost packet was also the router carrying its replacement milliseconds later.
This is an important point for understanding the Internet: the routing infrastructure doesn't know about TCP; it only routes.
(There are exceptions to this, as always, but it's generally true.)</p>
<p>Layers of the protocol stack operate independently, but they weren't designed independently.
Higher-level protocols tend to be built on lower-level ones: HTTP is built on TCP is built on IP is built on Ethernet.
Design decisions in lower levels often influence decisions in higher levels, even decades later.</p>
<p>Ethernet is old and concerns the physical layer, so its needs set the base parameters.
An Ethernet payload is at most 1,500 bytes.</p>
<p>The IP packet needs to fit within an Ethernet frame.
IP has a minimum header size of 20 bytes, so the maximum payload of an IP packet is 1,500 - 20 = 1,480 bytes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the TCP packet needs to fit within the IP packet.
TCP also has a minimum header size of 20 bytes, leaving a maximum TCP payload of 1,480 - 20 = 1,460 bytes.
In practice, other headers and protocols can cause further reductions. 1,400 is a conservative TCP payload size.</p>
<p>The 1,400 byte limit influences modern protocols' designs.
For example, HTTP requests are generally small.
If we fit them into one packet instead of two, we reduce the probability of losing part of the request, with a correspondingly reduced likelihood of TCP retransmissions.
To squeeze every byte out of small requests, <a href="http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html">HTTP/2</a> specifies compression for headers, which are usually small.
Without context from TCP, IP, and Ethernet, this seems silly: why add compression to a protocol's headers to save only a few bytes?
Because, as the HTTP/2 spec says in the introduction to section 2, compression allows "many requests to be compressed into one packet".</p>
<p>HTTP/2 does header compression to meet the constraints of TCP, which come from constraints in IP, which come from constraints in Ethernet, which was developed in the 1970s, introduced commercially in 1980, and standardized in 1983.</p>
<p>One final question: why is the Ethernet payload size set at 1,500 bytes?
There's no deep reason; it's just a nice trade-off point.
There are 42 bytes of non-payload data needed for each frame.
If the payload maximum were only 100 bytes, only 70% (100/142) of time would be spent sending payload.
A payload of 1,500 bytes means about 97% (1500/1542) of time is spent sending payload, which is a nice level of efficiency.
Pushing the packet size higher would require larger buffers in the devices, which we can't justify simply to get another percent or two of efficiency.
In short: HTTP/2 has header compression because of the RAM limitations of networking devices in the late 1970s.</p>

							<p>Author: Dylan Duncan</p><p>A new phishing tactic utilizing Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) has hit the threat landscape and proven to be very successful at reaching intended targets. Google AMP is an open-source HTML framework used to build websites that are optimized for both browser and mobile use. The websites that we observed in these campaigns are hosted on Google.com or Google.co.uk, both of which are considered trusted domains to most users. This phishing campaign not only employs Google AMP URLs to evade security, but also incorporates a multitude of other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) known to be successful at bypassing email security infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Points&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>A new tactic employed by threat actors utilizes Google AMP URLs as links embedded within their phishing emails. These links are hosted on trusted domains and have proven to be successful at reaching enterprise-level employees.</li><li>Google AMP URLs used in phishing recently emerged during May of 2023 and have continued to be disseminated since the time of this writing, targeting employee login credentials.</li><li>The campaigns using this tactic have proven to be very evasive and are employing other TTPs known to bypass email security infrastructure. The following tactics have been observed by Cofense to be incorporated into the campaigns using Google AMP URLs:<ul><li><strong>Trusted domains</strong> are often used throughout each stage of the phishing campaigns, not just including the initial Google domain.</li><li><strong>URL redirection</strong> as part of the Google AMP URL as well as an additional stage has been seen throughout several campaigns using the Google AMP tactic. This adds an extra layer to disrupt analysis.</li><li><strong>Image-based phishing emails</strong> have been used. This allows the threat actor to disrupt analysis by replacing a normal text body with an encoded HTML image that contains the malicious embedded link, which is clickable by the recipient.</li><li><strong>Cloudflare CAPTCHA</strong> has been a commonly abused tactic in phishing campaigns, therefore it is no surprise they have appeared here. CAPTCHA services disrupt automated analysis and require each phishing campaign to be manually analyzed.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Google AMP – The Latest Legitimate Application to be Abused for Phishing</h2><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google AMP</a> is a web component framework that allows users to create web pages that are also optimized for mobile use. Google allows each web page to be viewable on Google Search and can use Google AMP Cache as well as Google Analytics, both of which provide users with additional features to track other user interactions on AMP pages. Another feature Google AMP offers is that the webpages are initially hosted on a Google AMP URL like the example in Figure 1. This means each URL is hosted on <strong>https://www.google.com/amp/s/</strong> or <strong>https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/</strong>. In the example below, the left half of the URL is the legitimate Google AMP pathing, and the right half would be the webpage setup by the Google AMP user. To visit this URL, a user can access the webpage link directly or through this extended version of the URL.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure1-1.png" alt="Figure 1: Example of a Google AMP URL.

Phishing threat actors have been seen hosting malicious web pages using the Google AMP URL path within their phishing emails seeking to steal email login credentials. This can be difficult for email security infrastructure to detect the malicious nature of the emails since these URLs are hosted on legitimate Google domains. The addition of Google Analytics also provides threat actors with a way to track user interactions within their phishing pages. Figure 2 shows a real example of a phishing URL hosted using Google AMP. The Google AMP URL acts very similar to a redirect by sending users from the initial URL to the URL found within the path. For this example, that is the URL hosted on the domain netbitsfibra[.]com.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure2-1.png" alt="Figure 2: Real Google AMP Phishing Example That Reached an Intended Target.

A phishing URL blocked before it reaches the intended target doesn’t pose a threat. For this campaign, the Google AMP URLs have proven to be very successful at reaching users in environments protected by secure email gateways (SEGs). Figure 3 below shows the weekly volume of phishing emails that contain Google AMP links that Cofense has observed inside of an intended target’s inbox. These emails have proven to be successful at reaching their targets for a variety of reasons, primarily due to the fast that these URLs are hosted on a legitimate Google domain. As of this report, these emails are largely seeking to steal employee email login credentials.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image.png" alt="Google AMP – The Newest of Evasive Phishing Tactic" width="1993" height="1168" srcset="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image.png 1993w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-300x176.png 300w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-1024x600.png 1024w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-768x450.png 768w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-1536x900.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1993px) 100vw, 1993px" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAB4AAAARlAQAAAABwuOfHAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAEdSURBVHja7cEBDQAAAMKg909tDwcUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJwbI1EAAa1aoPkAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image.png" data-srcset="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image.png 1993w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-300x176.png 300w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-1024x600.png 1024w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-768x450.png 768w, https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure3-Featured-Image-1536x900.png 1536w"></p><p><em>Figure 3: Weekly volume of phishing emails abusing Google AMP.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Phishing campaigns abusing the Google AMP services picked up during May and haven’t left the threat landscape since. Overall, we have seen the volume oscillate drastically throughout recent weeks, with the week of May 29th and July 10th showing new heights for the tactic. On June 15th, we saw a change in tactics that included the use of Google.co.uk within the Google AMP URLs. The tactic remains the same, but the URL is hosted on Google’s United Kingdom top-level-domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Out of all the Google AMP URLs we have observed, approximately 77% were hosted on the domain google.com and 23% were hosted on the domain google.co.uk. The URL pathing is a good indicator for this phishing campaign, but it is difficult to outright block “google.com/amp/s/” due to the legitimate uses. It is recommended organizations discuss the legitimate uses for this pathing for their users before outright blocking. Although blocking the path may be difficult, it could be a good opportunity to flag URLs with it.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure4-1.png" alt="Figure 4: Comparison between the domains used by phishing emails utilizing Google AMP.

This is likely due to the trusted status and legitimacy of the Google domains that each URL is hosted on. Although that reason may be sufficient, threat actors employing this new tactic have also incorporated the tried-and-true methods already known to contribute to the evasiveness of a phishing email. The following TTPs have been observed in a variety of phishing emails that are using Google AMP URLs as embedded links within phishing emails:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trusted Domains</strong> – The Google AMP tactic is effective because of the combination of hosting a URL on a trusted domain as well as the redirection-like process it takes going from the Google AMP URL to the phishing site. Trusted domains make automated analysis difficult, since you cannot simply outright block the legitimate parts of a malicious URL abusing the process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Image-based Phishing Emails</strong> – Several of the emails observed are image-based phishing emails. This means the emails do not contain a traditional email body, but rather they contain an HTML image. Emails of this nature are more difficult to detect compared to text-based emails. This is due to the image adding more noise within the email’s headers as well as obfuscating security solutions that involve scanning email text. The email shown in Figure 5 is a phishing email found in a user’s inbox that was using a Google AMP URL. The whole image is clickable and directs users to the next step of the phishing attack. The lures behind these emails have varied, but are primarily email notifications, requests, reminders, shared files, or are finance related.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure5-1.png" alt="Figure 5: Example of phishing email that used Google AMP with a clickable HTML image.

Having multiple redirects within a single phishing attack chain rather than a single malicious URL can make analysis difficult. The example in Figure 6 below was pulled from a user’s inbox and is a good example of both trusted domains and URL redirection used as a TTP within a phishing email. The redirection is not only redirecting to the Google AMP domain, but it is also hosted on Microsoft.com, which is another trusted domain. This adds an additional layer of false legitimacy to the campaign.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure6.png" alt="Figure 6: Phishing URL utilizing a Microsoft domain to redirect to a Google AMP phishing site.

Cloudflare is a legitimate domain security service used to keep websites secure from bots or other automated visitors. This has proven to be a very effective tactic at evading email security because the CAPTCHAs often come prior to any actual-malicious URLs. The use of a CAPTCHA requires a manual user to be present to reach the final malicious URL within the initial redirection or infection chain. Cloudflare services also allow the blocking of certain geo-locations through IP filtering, and IP proxying services which allow the threat actor to hide the domain’s original hosting provider.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cofense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Figure7.png" alt="Figure 7: Example of Cloudflare CAPTCHA pulled from Google AMP phishing campaign.

<p>I went on a small journey the last couple days to find the original Netscape
Navigator “meteors” animation. This one has a special place in my head and
heart because it is so clearly connected to my memories of discovering the
web as a kid. Here it is in its original 60×60 px glory:</p>
<figure>
  <p><a href="https://erynwells.me/blog/2023/08/netscape-meteors/netscape-meteors.gif">
        <img src="https://erynwells.me/blog/2023/08/netscape-meteors/netscape-meteors_huae8a0a30085130352d1b0206d5a3e841_36320_1280x1280_fit_box_1.gif" alt="Netscape Meteor Loading Animation" title="Netscape Meteor Loading Animation">
      </a>
  </p>
  
</figure>

<p>I started out doing some web searches that turned up several versions. One was
promising but far too big: 400×400 px. Worse, after some shoddy resize
attempts, the “pixels” had become rectangular.</p>
<figure>
  <p><a href="https://erynwells.me/blog/2023/08/netscape-meteors/rectangular-pixels.png">
        <img src="https://erynwells.me/blog/2023/08/netscape-meteors/rectangular-pixels_hue23d2b4bbf176de06a21db73d2777b14_799884_1280x1280_fit_box_3.png" alt="Rectangular Pixels" title="Rectangular Pixels">
      </a>
  </p>
  
</figure>

<p>This would not do.</p>
<p>I continued searching, hoping to find the original animations. I found someone’s
<a href="https://github.com/zii/netscape">mirror of Netscape 5.0 on Github</a>. Then I found some <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/source/">very old
versions of Mozilla</a> on a Mozilla FTP server. Sadly, the
animations had been stripped out of these archives. :(</p>
<p>Frustrated with hitting several deadends, I complained to <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/">Tess</a> and
wondered aloud if anyone might have the original images stashed away somewhere.
She quipped that if anyone did, it would be Jamie Zawinski.</p>
<p>A little later, I posted about it on Mastodon.</p>

<p>And wouldn’t you know it, a friend tagged <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jwz"><code>@jwz</code></a> asking if he had
it, and a few moments later I got a reply from <a href="https://www.jwz.org/">Jamie</a> himself.</p>

<p>If you don’t know, Jamie Zawinski is well-know for working on several important
software projects in the ’90s. He worked on Netscape Navigator, built and
maintains <a href="https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">Xscreensaver</a>, and several other things. Nowadays, he
owns and runs <a href="https://www.jwz.org/">DNA Lounge</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p>There are a lot of neat bits of web browser history on the page he linked –
totally worth a quick look over – but most important to the quest at hand, it
had that Netscape meteors loading animation.</p>
<p>The original one has some small artifacts on the left side of frame 10 that
render as red and orange pixels. These bothered me enough that I made a version
that replaces those pixels with ones that match the surrounding pixels. Here’s
the modified 60×60 one and a bigger 240×240 px one, for good
measure:</p>

<h3>from the <i>do-not-drm-the-web</i> dept</h3>

<p>The grand old enshittification curve strikes again. Remember, as stated by Cory Doctorow, the process of enshittification entails these steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Way too many companies go through this process, and it’s pretty typical. In the past, we’ve talked about how young tech companies innovate, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2007/05/16/sun-to-microsoft-real-companies-innovate-not-litigate/">whereas old ones litigate</a>. Basically, the underlying issue is that as companies become less innovative, rather than creating new useful things, they focus on extracting more value however they can, while simultaneously trying to stymie and hold off innovative upstarts.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which Google has clearly reached that stage in various aspects of its business. But, there’s been talk over the past few weeks of something that is truly problematic: Google toying with what is quite clearly DRM for the web, in a system called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md" target="_blank">Web Environment Integrity</a> that it is proposing to build into Chrome.</p>
<p>If you listened to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/25/techdirt-podcast-episode-359-red-team-blues-part-two-with-cory-doctorow/" target="_blank">my podcast discussion with Doctorow</a> just last week, while ostensibly about Cory’s latest novel, we spent a lot of time talking about enshittifcation, including a discussion on the idea that inspired the novel, when Microsoft first wanted to build it’s “trusted computing” system with a separate cordoned off chip to check what it was that your open computer itself was doing, so that it could make sure what you were doing was legit. Now there are pros and cons to this approach, but it fundamentally changes how computers work.</p>
<p>From the podcast, Cory summed it up this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So 20 years and eight months or so ago. A team from Microsoft came to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and presented us something called the Next Generation Secure Computing Base, which they also called Palladium, which today we call Trusted Computing. And the idea here, and again, I apologize in advance for how gnarly this is, the idea here, is that if you have a computer, because it is like a universal Turing machine that can run any program, it is impossible for anyone else to know which programs your computer is running.</em></p>
<p><em>And on the one hand, that means that you could always put, say some surveillance tools that you’re forced to run by your boss or by an abusive spouse or by your government. You could put them inside a virtual machine and they would never know it. They’d be a head in a jar. They’ve never know it.</em></p>
<p><em>You can also emulate old pieces of software inside a new piece of software. You can open up a browser window simulate a whole like Mac SE running system 7. In fact, you know, my little laptop computer, middle of the range laptop computer here, I can open up 15, 20 browser tabs and emulate 20 Mac SEs without breaking a sweat. My fan doesn’t even turn on.</em></p>
<p><em>And so there’s this like character of universality and it’s both a feature and a bug. And it’s a bug in some trivial ways, like it’s really hard for me to know. whether you and I are playing a video game in which you are truly not running any like aim hack software. It’s also a bug in that like I can’t run a server in the cloud and know for sure that the people who own that server aren’t siphoning off my data. And it’s also a bug in that I can’t ask you my trusted technical expert to remotely look at what my computer is doing and tell me whether it’s running any spyware. because the spyware can just present itself to you as a not spyware application.</em></p>
<p><em>And so this is the problem that Microsoft was setting out to solve. And the way that they were gonna solve it is they were gonna put another computer in your computer, right, a separate, fairly low powered, extremely kind of simple and easily audited computer that was gonna be sealed in epoxy, mounted to the board in a way that it couldn’t be removed without revealing that it had been removed. It was gonna have like, acid in an epoxy pouch on the top of the chip. So if you tried to decap it and fuzz it or, you know, put an electron tunneling microscope, it would dissolve, right?</em></p>
<p><em>And it was going to be this, like, tamper evident piece of hardware. And this hardware could observe all the things going on in the other computer, in the computer you interact with. And you could ask it, hey, take your observations about my computer, make a manifest about what my computer is doing, like the… bootloader and operating system and the applications and the extensions and what’s going on in the kernel and whatever and make a signed cryptographically signed manifest of that and send that to someone else who wants to validate what kind of computer I’m running. This is called remote attestation and it is like a genuinely new computing capability, one that we had historically lacked.</em></p>
<p><em>It is, I would argue, as powerful and as complicated and as difficult to get your head around, and it’s potentially troubling as like universal computing and, and networking, and strong encryption, which is to say working encryption. It is like a new power and maybe even a superpower for your computer to allow multiple people who don’t trust each other to nevertheless trust one another’s statements about how their computers are configured.</em></p>
<p><em>That is like a really powerful thing.</em></p>
<p><em>If you think about work from home. You know, I was just at a friend’s house yesterday who does a lot of commercially sensitive work and who has been targeted repeatedly by state actors and by private corporate espionage, as well as phishers. He says he gets new employees and as soon as it hits LinkedIn, that they’re on the network, those employees get phished.</em></p>
<p><em>People try to take over their home computers and during remote work, this was a huge problem because suddenly his corporate perimeter was drawn around devices in people’s houses. And there were like extremely powerful adversaries trying to break into those computers and steal the data and it was worth a lot of money. And so he wanted to be able to ask those computers how they were configured, not because he didn’t trust the employees, but because he didn’t trust those employees’ technical capabilities, right? He wanted to give them a backstop in which their own mistakes wouldn’t be fatal for their jobs and for the enterprise. Right.</em></p>
<p><em>So there’s some like beneficial, consensual ways to conceive of this.</em></p>
<p><em>So this is the thing Microsoft came and presented to us and we were like, wouldn’t this let you determine whether someone was using Open Office and stop them from opening a Word document or you know, iWork right? You know, Numbers, Pages and Keynote. They’re like, ‘oh yes, totally.’ And we were like, wouldn’t this let you distinguish between people running SMB and Samba and keep them off the network? And they were like that too, right? And they were like, ‘but maybe we could, you know, everyone in the enterprise could run a version of this that you trusted instead of one that we trusted.’ And some of those people, like one of them is a guy called Peter Biddle, who’s, actually an honorable fella who really did believe in this. But you know, Peter Biddle wasn’t the boss of Microsoft.</em></p>
<p><em>And you know, this gun on the mantelpiece in Act 1 had a severe chance of going off by Act 3. And so here we are at Act 3. And 20 years after fighting about this. And it’s got multiple guises, right? Digital rights management, trusted computing, UFE boot locking, the broadcast flag, which is back. I don’t know if you’re following this. There’s a new version of ATSC that’s got DRM in it. And the FCC is likely to green light it. And the whole broadcast thing is gonna be back again.</em></p>
<p><em>You know, there’ve been so many names for this over 20 years and they all boil down to this thing. </em><strong><em>Should your computer be able to be compelled to tell the truth, even when you would prefer that it lie on your behalf? Should there be a facility in your computer that you can’t control that other people can remotely trigger? Are the costs worth the benefits?</em></strong><em> Is there a way to mitigate those costs? What are we going to do about this? And as I say, this is an argument that I’ve been having with myself for 20 years that basically no one else has advanced.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, well, really, that’s about the best description I can come up with for what’s happening here with the Web Environment Integrity system. Here’s how Google describes the project, which reads differently if you just read (or heard) Doctorow’s explanation above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests key facts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that a user is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will be prevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.</em></p>
<p><em>Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system (platform) as a matter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multiple operating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration from existing native attestation signals such as </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server"><em>App Attest</em></a><em> and the </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity"><em>Play Integrity API</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts and high coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters or non-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge the significant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically available (e.g. holdouts).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, understandably, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-web-integrity-api-sounds-like-drm-for-the-web/" target="_blank">causing some controversy</a>. And it should. The most comprehensive and understandable argument for how troubling this is that I saw early on came from Alex Ivanovs, who pointed out that one “side effect” of this would be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/" target="_blank">enabling Google to effectively block ad-blocking</a>. And, of course, plenty of people will insist that that’s not a side-effect, that’s the end goal. As he notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A significant concern stemming from the tech community is the potential for monopolistic control. By controlling the “attesters” that verify client environments, Google, or any other big tech company, could potentially manipulate the trust scores, thereby deciding which websites are deemed trustworthy. This opens up a can of worms regarding the democratic nature of the web.</em></p>
<p><em>As one GitHub user commented, “This raises a red flag for the open nature of the web, potentially paving the way for a digital hierarchy dominated by a few tech giants.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a discussion broke out in the Github over all this, with Mozilla stepping up pretty quickly (in the Github) to highlight how <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/852#issuecomment-1648820747">this move was against the open web</a>, and Mozilla was against it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mechanisms that attempt to restrict these choices are harmful to the openness of the Web ecosystem and are not good for users.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, the use cases listed depend on the ability to “detect non-human traffic” which as described would likely obstruct many existing uses of the Web such as assistive technologies, automatic testing, and archiving &amp; search engine spiders. These depend on tools being able to receive content intended for humans, and then transform, test, index, and summarize that content for humans. The safeguards in the proposal (e.g., “holdback”, or randomly failing to produce an attestation) are unlikely to be effective, and are inadequate to address these concerns.</em></p>
<p><em>Detecting fraud and invalid traffic is a challenging problem that we’re interested in helping address. However this proposal does not explain how it will make practical progress on the listed use cases, and there are clear downsides to adopting it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This week, browser maker Brave also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/9-web-environment-integrity/" target="_blank">came out as opposed to the plan</a>, saying it wouldn’t ship with WEI enabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Brave strongly opposes Google’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md" target="_blank"><u>Web Environment Integrity</u></a>” (WEI) proposal. As with many of Google’s recent changes and proposals regarding the Web, “Web Environment Integrity” would move power away from users, and toward large websites, including the websites Google itself runs. Though Brave uses Chromium, Brave browsers do not (and will not) include WEI. Further, some browsers have introduced other features similar to, though more limited than, WEI (e.g., certain parts of WebAuthn and Privacy Keys); Brave is considering how to best restrict these features without breaking benign uses.</em></p>
<p><em>Google’s WEI proposal is frustrating, but it’s not surprising. WEI is simply the latest in Google’s ongoing efforts to prevent browser users from being in control of how they read, interact with, and use the Web. Google’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/3-web-bundles/" target="_blank"><u>WebBundles proposal</u></a> makes it more difficult for users to block or filter out unwanted page content, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/8-first-party-sets/" target="_blank"><u>Google’s First Party Sets feature</u></a> makes it more difficult for users to make decisions around which sites can track users, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening" target="_blank"><u>Google’s weakening of browser extensions</u></a> straightforwardly makes it harder for users to be in control of their Web experience by crippling top ad-and-tracker-blocking extensions such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank"><u>uBlock Origin</u></a>. This is unfortunately far from a complete list of recent, similar user-harming Web proposals from Google. Again, Brave <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-%28features-we-disable-or-remove%29" target="_blank"><u>disables or modifies</u></a> all of these features in Brave’s browsers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I’ve seen some conspiracy theories making the rounds about this, trying to argue that it’s not just a terrible, awful, dangerous, problematic idea, but that there are truly nefarious (think: government surveillance) reasons behind all this. And that’s… nonsense.</p>
<p>But it is bad. It’s very clearly opposed to the principles of an open web, the kind of thing that Google used to be at the forefront of fighting for. But, of course, as companies get older and lose that innovative edge, they look to extract more value out of users. And that leads down this path.</p>
<p>And, yes, there are real concerns about abuse that WEI claims to be addressing. As Cory discussed about Microsoft’s original plan 20 years ago, they’re presenting new capabilities that <em>can</em> be used to stop some very problematic things. But… the way that it’s being done fundamentally restructures the open internet to something that is not the same at all.</p>
<p>It goes against the most important values that we push for here at Techdirt, around pushing the power to the edges of the network, rather than centralizing them. Whether or not you believe Google’s motives in putting together WEI are benign, the use of such a tool will not remain so.</p>
<p>As Cory said, the gun on the mantle in Act 1 is very likely to go off by Act 3. The system can be abused, especially by big powerful companies like Google. And that means, at some point, it <em>will</em> be abused by big powerful companies like Google.</p>
<p>Supporting the open web requires saying no to WEI, and having Google say no as well. It’s not a good policy. It’s not a good idea. It’s a terrible idea that takes Google that much further down the enshittification curve. Even if you can think of good reasons to try to set up such a system, there is way too much danger that comes along with it, undermining the very principles of the open web.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise, of course, that Google would do this, but that doesn’t mean the internet-loving public should let them get away with it.</p>

		<p>By rights, settings in an app should only control the behaviour of that app. Settings for macOS behaviours should be controlled in System Settings, after all that’s what the name says. However, over the years Apple has hidden some away in its bundled apps, leaving users confused as to how these settings get changed without their control. Here’s a list of useful and important system settings you might otherwise struggle to find. For good measure, I’ve included some that, although placed logically, aren’t easy to remember.</p>
<p><strong>Default email reader</strong></p>
<p>This is set in the Mail app’s Settings &gt; General; third-party mail clients may also assist in checking this is set correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Default calendar app</strong></p>
<p>This is set in the Calendar app’s Settings &gt; General.</p>
<p><strong>Default for calls</strong> (default call handler)</p>
<p>This is set at the foot of the FaceTime app’s Settings &gt; General. It may be changed without warning by third-party apps like Skype, but they don’t offer the control in their own preferences, which can cause confusion.</p>

<p>This is set in Script Editor’s Settings &gt; General.</p>
<p><strong>Script menu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Show script menu in menu bar</strong> is also set in Script Editor’s Settings &gt; General.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Automatic Updates</strong></p>
<p>Although correctly placed, this can now be set <em>either</em> in the App Store app’s Settings, <em>or</em> in the <strong>Software Update</strong> settings with other update options.</p>
<p><strong>Shared with You</strong></p>
<p>This covers content shared in Messages which appears in other apps, and control over whether that sharing is automatic. This is set in the Messages app’s Settings &gt; Shared with You for all such shared content.</p>

<p><strong>iTunes authorisation</strong></p>
<p>This is controlled in the Music and TV apps’ menu Account &gt; Authorisations.</p>
<p><strong>Default web browser</strong></p>
<p>This is set in System Settings &gt; Desktop &amp; Dock; third-party browsers may offer to change this setting for you.</p>
<p><strong>Screenshot options</strong></p>
<p>To change the destination and other details for screenshots, press Command-Shift-5 for its floating panel with the Options menu.</p>
<p>There are, of course, several third-party apps that give more coherent and extensive access to these and other controls, but it’s frustrating that instead of rationalising them, System Settings doesn’t centralise them any better than System Preferences did.</p>
