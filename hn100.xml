Those with a more nationalist viewpoint see the program favoring foreign labor, while the big tech, medical and education sectors that dominate <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-final-rule-status-changes-update-2016211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the visa category</a> typically argue that foreigners offer skills they can't match with U.S. candidates.</p><p>Both President Trump and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elon-musk" data-sys="1">Elon Musk</a> have come out in favor of the H-1B system, a rare break with the MAGA movement that remains in stark opposition.</p><p>Jobs.Now targets a specific stage of the H-1B employment-based visa process: If an employer wants to sponsor an immigrant for a Green Card.</p><p>Known as the PERM process, H-1B holders can look to make their temporary visa permanent with a Green Card, but employers first have to test the market and see if they could, in fact, fill the role with a U.S. citizen or someone already in the country with legal resident status.</p><p>If they can prove that no American is suitable for the role, then the immigrant worker can move forward with their Green Card application.</p><p>"The underlying issue is that U.S. immigration policy requires most employers to do labor market testing at the PERM stage, when they are sponsoring a foreign worker for a Green Card, or permanent residence, not at the H-1B stage," Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor with an immigration focus at the University of North Florida, told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p><h2>What H-1B Positions Are Listed?</h2><p>Jobs.Now lists roles such as software engineers, database administrators, and VP-level positions for science, tech, and capital management firms. At time of publishing, companies with open roles included Spotify, Mastercard and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/uber" data-sys="1">Uber</a>.</p><p>One role, a trading job at <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bank-america" data-sys="1">Bank of America</a>, asks for a master's degree or equivalent, along with three years of experience in the field. One of the open Spotify roles seeking a software engineer asks for very specific qualifications related to different programming languages and practices.</p><p>"The PERM process was designed to allocate Green Cards to workers who had unique qualifications that were in shortage in America," Jobs.Now told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p><p>"The law's express purpose is to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.' As law-abiding U.S. citizens, we believe that companies should follow the law."</p><p>The Department of Labor requires the roles be listed publicly, including in at least two major Sunday newspapers, on a state workforce agency site and internally at the company itself. Employers also have to choose from two other advertising methods, such as job fairs or at college campuses.</p><figure><div>

</figcaption>  </figure><p>None of this is required when a company initially sets out to obtain an H-1B visa for a foreign worker, and there has long been skepticism around whether employers really put the effort into this process that they are required.</p><p>"At that point, most employers have identified a specific foreign worker already working for them on a H-1B visa they want to sponsor, and now they have to go test the labor market," Zavodny said.</p><p>"The employer has typically invested heavily in training that worker by this point. If the U.S. wants employers to do labor market testing before hiring a foreign worker, it would make more sense to do it earlier in the process, not at this late stage."</p><h2>Trump's 'America First' Agenda</h2><p>While supporting the H-1B system, the president has also made it clear that he wants to see American workers put first in the labor market. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in February that it would look to prosecute companies actively favoring foreign workers over citizens.</p><p>"The EEOC is putting employers and other covered entities on notice: if you are part of the pipeline contributing to our immigration crisis or abusing our legal immigration system via illegal preferences against American workers, you must stop," EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, in a February press release. "The law applies to you, and you are not above the law. The EEOC is here to protect all workers from unlawful national origin discrimination, including American workers."</p><figure><div>

</figcaption>  </figure><p>Companies have faced penalties in the past for being seen to favor foreign workers. A job listings website in 2023 was found to have posted roles which specifically said H-1B roles would be favored. Other employers have been fined large sums for only seeking out those who spoke Spanish as a first language or only come from particular countries.</p><p>Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs and policy at the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies, told <em>Newsweek </em>that regulations needed to be changed to stop employees' ability to use loopholes in order to bypass American workers.</p><p>"The first Trump administration attempted to make some changes to deal with unfair competition caused by H-1B workers, but those regulations did not survive the Biden administration," Jacobs said, adding that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress" data-sys="1">Congress</a> needs to act instead.</p><p>"The obstacle are two-fold right now, largely because the public largely sees the H-1B visa program and the PERM process as one that they assume does have adequate protections for American workers. Also, the way the system is designed, to have the quote-unquote best and brightest workers from abroad, are crowded out by just the sheer volume of petitions that are filed."</p><p>As for the roles listed on Jobs.Now, it may be that they are eventually filled with a U.S. citizen or an immigrant with legal permanent resident already. Its owners told <em>Newsweek</em> that they believe several thousand job applications have been generated by listings on its platform.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government’s gross <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/national-debt">national debt</a></span> has surpassed $37 trillion, a record number that highlights the accelerating debt on America’s balance sheet and increased cost pressures on taxpayers. </p><p>The $37 trillion update is found in the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Treasury Department report</a></span> issued Tuesday which logs the nation’s daily finances.</p><p>The national debt eclipsed $37 trillion years sooner than pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030. But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multi-year COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy, where the federal government borrowed heavily under then-President <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-washington-dc-takeover-race-39388597bad7e70085079888fe7fb57b">Donald Trump</a></span> and former President Joe Biden to stabilize the national economy and support a recovery.</p>
    
<p>And now, more government spending has been approved after Trump signed into law <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-republican-trump-tax-bill-f65be44e1050431a601320197322551b">Republicans’ tax cut and spending legislation</a></span> earlier this year. The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tax-cuts-food-stamps-6542e448a2f6ed7b93ab8f7fe84ac53a">law</a></span> set to add $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Office <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cbo-deficits-tax-cuts-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-64d7de49aef62ba07b7f6f45c1ca73d1">estimates</a></span>.</p>

<p>Chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Michael Peterson said in a statement that government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, “adding costs for everyone and reducing private sector investment. Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans’ tax law “means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going.” </p>
    
<p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.gao.gov/americas-fiscal-future/how-could-federal-debt-affect-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Government Accountability Office</a></span> outlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans — including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services. </p><p>Peterson points out how the trillion-dollar milestones are “piling up at a rapid rate.” </p><p>The U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024. “We are now adding a trillion more to the national debt every 5 months,” Peterson said. “That’s more than twice as fast as the average rate over the last 25 years.”</p><p>The Joint Economic Committee <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/debt-dashboard#:~:text=July%202025%20%7C%20Released%20July%2008,reached%20in%20approximately%20194%20days." target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a></span> at the current average daily rate of growth an increase of another trillion dollars to the debt would be reached in approximately 173 days.</p><p>Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in a statement that “hopefully this milestone is enough to wake up policymakers to the reality that we need to do something, and we need to do it quickly.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In this <em>opinion piece</em>, I will try to briefly share my encounter with
the language and list its advantages — organized into several sections
covering <em>the language itself</em>, its ecosystem, and its community. I
will also attempt to <em>debunk</em> some popular myths (or misconceptions)
found on the Internet. For the sake of transparency, it is important
to note that, at the time of writing, my <a href="https://tarides.com/">professional
work</a> <strong>involves working for and on the OCaml
ecosystem</strong>. However, readers who have followed me for several years
can attest that I was promoting the language long before I was paid to
work on the OCaml ecosystem, <em>sometimes rather immoderately</em>.</p>
<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>First, this article will explain why I <strong>personally</strong> believe that
OCaml is a relevant choice in many contexts. My goal is not
specifically to convince you—although that would be a very welcome
<em>side effect</em> — and it’s quite likely that many of the arguments I
present will also apply to other languages!</p>
<p>Also, very often, when I suggest OCaml to people who want to explore
new languages or try out solutions written in OCaml, I’m kindly told
that <em>I’m always promoting OCaml</em>. It’s amusing to notice that when
the suggestions involve languages adopted <em>by default</em>, like
JavaScript, or more recent ones like
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> or <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, they tend
to trigger fewer reactions. This is probably because people
<em>implicitly</em> assume that proposing a <em>lesser-known</em> language leans
toward irrationality and personal preference. From my point of view,
<strong>suggesting OCaml is, in many cases where fine-grained memory control
is not needed, just as relevant as suggesting Rust</strong> (and probably
more so).</p>
<p>To wrap up this preface, many people first encountered OCaml (or <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/caml-light/release.fr.html">Caml
Light</a>) during their
undergraduate studies or in preparatory classes, often using it in
contexts far removed from industry. As for me, I started getting
interested in OCaml much earlier, thanks to the <a href="http://sdz.tdct.org/">Site du
Zéro</a>, where a small community of functional
programming enthusiasts promoted less <em>mainstream</em> languages like
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, and
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. My interaction with OCaml at
university was <strong>just a bonus</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>
<p>I’m not the first to document the reasons for choosing OCaml. There
are many other resources that, in my opinion, are also worth checking
out, and they show that OCaml users are generally very satisfied — so
much so that they’re motivated to share <em>how and why</em> we chose the
language as our main technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/prologue.html#why-ocaml">"<strong>Why
OCaml?</strong>"</a>,
the prologue of the book <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/toc.html">Real World
OCaml</a>, which presents
factual advantages of using OCaml (and whose introduction includes a
timeline). While the book is excellent in many respects, I’ve gotten
into the habit of not recommending it because I find its usage
approach quite biased, suggesting libraries by default that aren’t
necessarily widely accepted in the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/intro/intro.html">"<strong>Better Programming Through
OCaml</strong>"</a>,
the prologue of the book (accompanied by videos) <a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html">OCaml Programming:
Correct + Efficient +
Beautiful</a>, which
mainly explains how learning OCaml can improve a developer’s skills
in other, more popular technologies. The book is fairly recent, and
it’s the one I <strong>now recommend as the go-to resource</strong> for getting
started with OCaml.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably other resources and testimonials, notably on the
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">official website</a>, which features both
<a href="https://ocaml.org/industrial-users">industrial</a> and
<a href="https://ocaml.org/academic-users">academic</a> case studies. There are
also articles expressing the frustration OCaml can cause. I’m aware
that OCaml is not perfect—nor do I believe any technology is
perfect. I’ll likely refer to some of these articles (implicitly or
explicitly) in the section on <em>myths</em> and in the conclusion, where
I’ll try to explain in which contexts I don’t find OCaml to be a
relevant choice.</p>
<h2 id="ocaml-as-a-language">OCaml as a language</h2>
<p>Before diving into the <strong>features</strong> offered by the language, I’d like
to start with a point that I believe is essential. OCaml is a
programming language that originated from
<a href="https://ocaml.org/about#history">research</a> and is used by <a href="https://ocaml.org/industrial-users">industrial
users</a>. This duality is important
because it provides the language with two key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Guidance on <em>desirable</em> features as interesting language concepts,
supported by advanced research. For example, to my knowledge, OCaml
is the first <em>mainstream</em> language to offer native support for
<a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/effects.html">user-defined effects</a>,
which is the result of cutting-edge research, illustrated by
numerous
<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sivaramakrishnan,+K">publications</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidance on <em>desirable</em> features as tools for industrialization,
also backed by research and motivated by practical use cases. For
instance, recently, <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>, a
major industrial OCaml user, proposed the integration of <em>affine
sessions</em>, enabling <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/search/?query=oxidizing">linear resource
management</a>
(somewhat <em>Rust-like</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This intertwining of industrial and academic motivations allows OCaml
to offer a collection of solid, useful, and well-defined features. In
other words, OCaml is a <strong>living</strong> language, and since I’ve been using
it, I’ve witnessed many developments and additions that I consider
highly desirable and that <em>debunk</em> a common assertion against OCaml:
<strong>the language is only useful for theory or for implementing
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq/Rocq</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Although this was historically true, the motivations provided by
industrial users justify the label "<em>An industrial-strength functional
programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety</em>."
The opening keynote of the <a href="https://ocaml.org/conferences/ocaml-workshop-2021">OCaml Workshop
2021</a> by <a href="https://xavierleroy.org/">Xavier
Leroy</a>, titled "<a href="https://watch.ocaml.org/w/tU8wR9EcAcyFHHVcX4GS46"><em>25 Years Of
OCaml</em></a>," presents
an exhaustive timeline of OCaml’s continuous design, showing the
various phases of evolution the language has undergone.</p>
<p>In broad terms, OCaml is a programming language from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML
family</a>,
<strong>high-level</strong> (here, meaning it features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">garbage
collection</a>),
<strong>statically typed</strong> (types are checked at compile time with no
implicit conversions), with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">type
inference</a></strong> (also
called <em>type synthesis</em>), allowing the compiler to deduce the type of
an expression in most cases. This enables programming in both
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"><strong>functional</strong></a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming"><strong>imperative</strong></a>
styles.</p>
<p>OCaml also provides an <strong>object-oriented programming model</strong> and a
very rich <strong>module system</strong>. The language has two compilation schemes:
<code>ocamlc</code>, which compiles to a <em>bytecode</em> executable by a <strong>virtual
machine</strong> (portable and efficient), and <code>ocamlopt</code>, which compiles to
<strong>native machine code</strong> (runnable on a wide <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml?tab=readme-ov-file#overview">variety of
architectures</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, OCaml allows <strong>conversion of its bytecode to JavaScript</strong>
using
<a href="https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">Js_of_ocaml</a>,
enabling <em>very fast</em> interoperability within the OCaml ecosystem
(which I use <em>extensively</em> on this website). The <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">same approach is
used to produce
WebAssembly</a>. For deeper
interoperability with the JavaScript ecosystem,
<a href="https://melange.re/">Melange</a> takes a somewhat different approach
than Js_of_ocaml to generate robust JavaScript.</p>
<p>OCaml is a <strong>highly versatile</strong> language, and I will now try to
present the features and strengths that make it — <em>for me</em> — an ideal
tool for building both personal and professional projects, starting
with a brief detour into static typing.</p>
<h3 id="on-static-type-checking">On static type checking</h3>
<p>When I was preparing, with <a href="https://twitter.com/bibear">Bruno</a>, the
episode of <a href="https://www.ifttd.io/liste-des-episodes">If This Then Dev</a>
dedicated to OCaml — which, in the end, was
<a href="https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/le-langage-de-tous-les-langages">recorded</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/d-plaindoux">Didier</a> — he asked me a question
that I found surprising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is it really worth bothering with types when working on a <em>personal
project</em> quickly?  Even though I can perfectly see the value for
<em>production</em> code, for a <em>personal project</em> it seems like a waste of
time to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there are two main angles to answer this. The first, and most
obvious, is that, <strong>in principle, I don’t see why a personal project
should be any less disciplined than a professional one</strong>. When I write
software <em>for myself</em>, I could indeed get away with ignoring the
<em>corner cases</em> of my implementation. Sure, that’s possible. But that’s
probably not what I actually want to do. So, if a language and its
compiler let me set up safety nets that force me to account for all
the cases in my software, <em>I take them</em> — just like writing <em>unit
tests</em> <strong>makes development easier</strong>, and I don’t see them as a
constraint.</p>
<p>But beyond considerations of hygiene in a personal project, I think
the negative reputation of static type checking usually stems from a
bad experience. Indeed, in languages like C or Java, types are
<strong>mostly a constraint</strong> that can be easily circumvented. In languages
that place a strong emphasis on typing — like
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>,
<a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>, <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, or
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> — <strong>types act as safeguards</strong>. More
importantly, in my view, <strong>types also serve as a tool for expressive
<em>design</em></strong>. Using them provides safety while also offering an
incredibly rich, versatile, and concise way to describe data.</p>
<p>From my experience, even though it’s common to move from a
<em>poorly-typed</em> (sorry, the temptation is too strong) to a <em>dynamically
typed</em> language — I, for instance, happily transitioned from Java to
Ruby — moving from a language with a rich type system, like OCaml or
Haskell, makes switching to a <em>dynamically typed</em> language much
harder. At present, <strong>I don’t know anyone who has seriously used
languages like OCaml or Haskell and was happy to return to languages
with less sophisticated type systems</strong> (though an interesting project
can sometimes justify such a technological regression).</p>
<p>This is <strong>not just a personal observation</strong>; static type checking is
central to the broader debate about the evolution of programming
languages. Historical languages evolve (or attempt to evolve) to
integrate more type checking. For instance,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, as early as the 1980s (before its
compiler source was released), experimented with <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/erlang/erlang.pdf">integrating a type
system</a>. Java,
version by version, enhances features aimed at improving static type
verification, such as incorporating <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/409">sealed
families</a>.</p>
<p>Many languages are experimenting with type systems: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/">Ruby with
RBS</a>,
<a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> (a statically typed language
heavily inspired by Ruby), <a href="https://mypy-lang.org/">Python with Mypy</a>,
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/_media/users/gduboc/elixir-types.pdf">Elixir</a>
(which revisits Erlang’s past experiments, offering a viable gradual
typing approach), and, of course,
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, which has become
<strong>widely adopted</strong> in the JavaScript community.</p>
<p>While all these initiatives are encouraging and clearly move in the
right direction, for now, they primarily <strong>add safeguards</strong> but do not
yet serve as expressive <strong>design tools</strong>.</p>
<p>When it comes to increasingly rich type systems, <strong>the White House</strong>
recently published a
<a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/">report</a>
emphasizing the importance of <em>memory safety</em> in software design and…
<em>endorsing</em> the use of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> language
(historically <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/understanding-how-the-rust-compiler-is-built/87237/7">written in
OCaml</a>
before becoming <em>self-hosted</em>) over C++, clearly showing that even
official bodies (often considered outdated) highlight the value of
rich type systems. Moreover, the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-03-07-a-time-for-change-our-response-to-the-white-house-cybersecurity-press-release/">response from
Tarides</a>,
the company I work for at the time of writing this article, also
presents compelling arguments in favor of using OCaml for building
critical systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, static type checking is really valuable and highly
recommended, and it’s worth exploring languages with sophisticated
type systems (like OCaml) and, why not, going even further by
increasingly delving into formal methods.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-language">Features of the <em>language</em></h3>
<p>Even though it’s very tempting to create a massive OCaml tutorial, the
goal of this section is to present what makes <strong>OCaml</strong>, <strong>for me</strong>, a
<strong>highly relevant</strong> choice for both learning and production. The
advantages will therefore be presented (and <em>defended</em>), but <strong>this is
not a tutorial</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="a-multi-paradigm-language">A <em>multi-paradigm</em> language</h4>
<p>Nowadays, talking about <strong>multi-paradigm</strong> languages might seem
unnecessary, since a large majority of programming languages <em>favored
by industry</em> are already multi-paradigm. However, OCaml is a
<strong>functional programming</strong> language that also supports <strong>imperative
programming</strong>, <strong>modular programming</strong>, <strong>object-oriented
programming</strong>, and, since version <code>5.0.0</code>, <strong>multi-core programming</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> is widely recognized in
the functional programming world, it’s often assumed that adding
imperative mechanisms to a language is a bad idea — especially if one
is convinced of the benefits of the functional style. From my
perspective, there are several perfectly legitimate reasons to use
imperative programming when the language allows it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Readability of an implementation.</strong> Sometimes, avoiding mutability
requires adding extra plumbing (for example, a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/State_Monad">State
Monad</a>), which can make
reading and understanding a program more cumbersome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance.</strong> Adding such plumbing can introduce overhead, making
the execution of implementations more costly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of use.</strong> A few years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/rtguillon">Arthur
Guillon</a> ceremoniously told me that
"<em>OCaml is a lambda calculus that trivially allows effects</em>," which
makes it very effective for tasks like debugging, where printing
messages to standard output is simple. While I acknowledge that this
is probably not the <em>best way</em> to implement logging, it undeniably
provides a comfortable user experience and enables rapid
prototyping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, OCaml's dual nature — both imperative and functional —
allows you to leverage the advantages of both paradigms in different
situations and, of course, to combine them. For example, hidding a
module's imperative nature behind a functional API.</p>
<h5 id="syntax-à-la-ml">Syntax <em>à la ML</em></h5>
<p>Although syntax is often considered a minor detail, languages in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML
family</a>
have a concise, expressive, and readable syntax. Even though <em>this
family of syntax</em> can be confusing when coming from more conventional,
C-inspired syntax, one gets used to it fairly quickly and can soon
realize that it is very consistent and relatively
unambiguous. However, if OCaml’s syntax is problematic for you, don’t
hesitate to look into <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a>, an
alternative syntax that uses braces.</p>

<p>OCaml is a language that originates from French research, as shown by
the <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/about/history.en.html">history of Caml</a>,
primarily designed to implement the proof assistant
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq/Rocq</a>. This origin — and the initial
motivations, implementing Coq while also serving as a programming
language taught in preparatory classes—creates a certain duality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The core features were not initially designed with industry in
mind. However, this assertion is no longer true, primarily because
OCaml <strong>has</strong> become a language used in industrial contexts. While
in the language’s genesis, there were more tools for building a
language itself (facilitating the teaching of compiler mechanisms)
than tools for building "enterprise" applications, projects from the
community motivated by industrial use have enriched the language and
its ecosystem, making it a versatile tool suitable for industry. For
example, creating a <em>binding</em> with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_%28software%29">Tk</a> library led to
the integration in the language of <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/lablexamples.html">named
arguments</a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/lablexamples.html#s%3Aoptional-arguments">optional
arguments</a>,
and <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/polyvariant.html">polymorphic
variants</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The set of paradigms and language features are <strong>carefully thought
out and well-theorized</strong>. Generally, the integration of a feature
(or collection of features) results from meticulous research, based
on solid theoretical foundations and reviewed by numerous experts in
the field (often
<a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/avec-xavier-leroy-linformatique-confirme-sa-presence-au-college-de-france">recognized</a>
by the scientific community). This rigor can sometimes slow the
introduction of new features but generally ensures their proper
functioning and theoretical stability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This theoretical rigor, stemming from OCaml’s undeniable closeness to
the research world, means that its various aspects are well
documented, illustrated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=ocaml&amp;searchtype=all&amp;source=header">a large number of
publications</a>,
and exhibit <strong>predictable behavior</strong>. From my point of view, this
makes OCaml a very wise choice for understanding these different
features <em>in depth</em>. For example, I believe OCaml has allowed me to
<strong>much better understand</strong> certain traits or paradigms of programming
languages.</p>
<p>Moreover, a great example of how meticulous and rigorous research can
support the integration of a language feature is OCaml’s
implementation of an <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/objectexamples.html">object
model</a>. Indeed, the
thesis of <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~vouillon/">Jérôme Vouillon</a>, <em><a href="https://www.irif.fr/~vouillon/publi/these.ps.gz">Design
and Implementation of an Extension of the ML Language with
Objects</a></em>, proposes
an innovative object model that integrates very well with type
inference by <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/book-ora144.html">separating the notions of inheritance and
subtyping</a>
— inheritance being a <strong>syntactic notion</strong> and subtyping a <strong>semantic
notion</strong> — using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_polymorphism">row
polymorphism</a> to
describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural subtyping
relationships</a>,
as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal
subtyping</a>, used by
Java, C#, and most popular OOP languages. OCaml’s object model fully
adheres to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principles</a>
without any <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">additional
ceremony</a>.</p>
<h4 id="algebraic-types">Algebraic types</h4>
<p>I’ve been quite expansive about the reasons why I value a language
with static type checking. However, in my experience, for a statically
typed language to be truly usable, the presence of <a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/data/algebraic_data_types.html">algebraic
types</a>
is necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Product types</strong>: These allow grouping values of heterogeneous
types (thus creating a <strong>conjunction</strong> of heterogeneous types). They
are generally present in all <em>mainstream</em> languages (for example,
<em>objects</em>, which introduce additional concepts, or tuples and
records).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sum types</strong>: These allow constructing a <strong>disjunction</strong> of
heterogeneous value types, with different <em>cases</em> indexed by
constructors. While some <em>special cases</em> of sums exist in mainstream
languages—like <em>booleans</em> (which are a disjunction of two cases:
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, i.e., two parameterless constructors) — support
for full sum types is often cumbersome in popular languages. For
example, Kotlin and Java (and <em>de facto</em> C#) use a construct
associated with inheritance relations called
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/sealed-classes-and-interfaces.html">sealing</a>. The
integration of <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/enums/adts.html">dedicated sum type
syntax</a>
also took some time in Scala, which, prior to recent versions,
relied on sealed families, making the expression of sums verbose
and, in my view, harder to reason about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exponential types</strong>: These allow describing functions that express
types for higher-order functions (functions that can be passed as
arguments or returned as results).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Coupled with <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/patterns.html">pattern
matching</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric
polymorphism</a>
(or <em>generics</em>), an algebraic type system is an incredibly expressive
tool for describing data structures, the state machine of a program,
or modeling a <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/">business
domain</a>
with an appropriate cardinality. Even in the 21st century, where
products and exponentials are common, when I use <em>very popular</em>
languages, I am often frustrated by the lack of sum types, which
forces me to use verbose encodings (increasing the domain’s
cardinality). This is particularly noticeable when working with
<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> and
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>.</p>
<p>The appeal of this triad is, in fact, probably one of the reasons
(combined with a very ergonomic ecosystem and toolchain) behind the
success of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. In short, if you intend
to build a new programming language with static type checking,
<em>please</em>, do not hesitate to include algebraic types!</p>
<p>Finally, there are aspects of OCaml's type system that I haven’t
covered, but which probably deserve dedicated articles. For example,
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/gadts-tutorial.html">generalized algebraic data types
(GADTs)</a>, which allow
expressing even more invariants.</p>
<h4 id="modular-programming-and-module-language">Modular programming and module language</h4>
<p>OCaml, through its ancestor <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-caml-light/">Caml
Light</a>, was among
the first languages to offer a module system, similar to <a href="https://smlfamily.github.io/">Standard
ML</a>, providing <strong>encapsulation and
abstraction</strong> while supporting <strong>separate compilation</strong>, in the style
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2">Modula-2</a>. OCaml’s module
system is a <strong>fundamental aspect</strong> of the language, although its
complexity can be intimidating. Indeed, in OCaml, it is possible to
clearly distinguish the interface (the <em>signature</em>) from the
implementation (the <em>structure</em>), thus facilitating encapsulation and
documentation, while also allowing <strong>function application within the
module language</strong>.</p>
<p>I find it particularly difficult to address the topic of modules
briefly (it’s a subject I’ve wanted to explore on my blog for
<em>years</em>). However, here is a list of advantages I see in OCaml’s
<em>highly modular</em> approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separate compilation</strong>: A key feature that allows efficient
compilation of large programs by identifying junction points to
optimize parallel and incremental compilation. This approach is
leveraged by <a href="https://dune.build/">dune</a>, the recommended build
system for OCaml.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systematic separation of implementation and interface</strong>: Offers
several significant advantages, including encapsulation and placing
documentation in the interface. In my programming workflow, I find
this very convenient because I can implement my <em>structure</em> (the
module’s implementation) while <em>being guided by type inference</em> and
specify its API in the <em>signature</em> (the module’s interface),
deciding on the display order and providing clear documentation that
doesn’t pollute the implementation space. Additionally,
encapsulation allows me to freely define intermediate types inside
the structure, for example, to represent a program’s state machine,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">without letting it
escape</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A powerful tool for describing data structures</strong>: By abstracting
types (hiding their implementation) and combining this with
encapsulation, it is possible to describe data structures that
<strong>maintain invariants</strong>. This is why it is common to have a
structure/signature pair for each data structure, hiding
implementation details through abstraction and encapsulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reusability and sharing</strong>: Just as it is possible to describe
types in the value language (as seen with algebraic types), it is
also possible to describe types in the module language, called
<strong>translucent signatures</strong>, which allow defining the type of a
signature without associating it with a structure. These signatures
are structurally typed, and coupled with
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/functors">functors</a> (functions in the module
language), it is possible to <em>share behavior</em> between modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced forms of polymorphism</strong>: Including <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/higher-kind-poly.html">Higher Kinded
Polymorphism</a>,
available in the module language. In broad terms, you can describe
"<em>generics parameterized by generics</em>". This limitation in languages
like F# or Java often motivates the use of <a href="https://github.com/yallop/higher?tab=readme-ov-file#implementations-in-other-languages">heavy
encodings</a>
to work around the lack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The theory behind module languages in ML-family languages is a vast
subject, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649818">still evolving</a>, and
very difficult to summarize in a single paragraph. However, the
introduction of <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/thesis/main.pdf">Derek Dreyer’s
thesis</a>,
<em>Understanding and Evolving the ML Module System</em>, provides an
excellent explanation of the purpose and use of modules, illustrated
with many examples. I hope to take the time in the coming weeks or
months to write more extensively about the module language than I have
<a href="https://xvw.lol/en/articles/modules-import.html">already attempted</a>, because it could
be very educational and, in my view, the topic is extremely
interesting!</p>
<h4 id="dependency-injection-and-inversion">Dependency injection and inversion</h4>
<p>Briefly touching on object-oriented programming in OCaml, I mentioned
that OCaml allows, through its language features, a straightforward
way to meet the prerequisites for writing <strong>SOLID</strong> code. The final
point I’d like to emphasize is the ease of dependency inversion,
achievable through <strong>language-provided features</strong>. In broad terms, the
principle of dependency inversion involves describing dependency
lattices using <strong>abstractions</strong> rather than <strong>implementations</strong>. This
way, dependencies can be <em>injected afterward</em> — making context
changes, for example in unit testing, trivially implementable.</p>
<p>OCaml provides (<em>at least</em>) two tools that facilitate this inversion,
each useful in different contexts. We will draw inspiration from the
very popular teletype example to show how to invert dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>program</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>What is your name?</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>read_line</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Hello </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Even if it might not seem obvious, this program depends on <strong>concrete
implementations</strong> — namely, interactions with standard input and
output.</p>
<h5 id="through-modules">Through modules</h5>
<p>The most straightforward approach is to use modules, either as
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/firstclassmodules.html">first-class values</a>
or by construction, using
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/functors">functors</a>. The duality between
signatures and structures makes dependency inversion obvious. For
example, to revisit our example, here’s how, using <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/firstclassmodules.html"><em>first-class
modules</em></a>, it becomes
<strong>very easy</strong> to depend on an abstract set of interactions. We start
by describing the abstract representation of possible interactions:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>IO</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>print_endline</span><span> : string -&gt; unit
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>read_line</span><span> : unit -&gt; string
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now expect our <code>program</code> function to take a module of type <code>IO</code>
as an argument (we’ll call this <em>a handler</em>) and use the functions
exported by the module, which in our example is named <code>Handler</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>program</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>IO</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>What is your name?</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>read_line</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Hello </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>For example, in the context of unit testing, it’s possible to provide
an implementation that logs all the operations called (and <em>mocks</em> the
<code>read_line</code> call to fix the returned result). This makes expressing
unit tests that <em>verify business logic</em> very easy to implement.</p>
<p>Passing a concrete implementation as an argument to our function
amounts to <strong>interpreting the program</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="through-user-defined-effects">Through <em>user-defined effects</em></h5>
<p>OCaml version 5 arrived with a host of new features. However, the
biggest advancement is the complete redesign of the OCaml <strong>runtime</strong>
to support multi-core execution. There are several ways to describe
concurrent algorithms — for example, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a> or
<a href="https://go101.org/article/channel.html">channels</a>. OCaml has chosen
to rely on
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-effects-tutorial">effects</a>,
which simplify the management of the program's <em>control flow</em>.  In
fact, OCaml allows users to define their own effects, logically called
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/effects.html">user-defined effects</a>. While
they are a powerful tool for describing concurrent programs, they also
make it easier to inject dependencies when you want to maintain
control, <em>at the handler level</em>, over the execution flow of a program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In my example, I am using an experimental syntax, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12309">just
merged</a> into the OCaml
main branch, which will likely be available in version <code>5.3.0</code> of
the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with our previous improvement, we first need to describe the set of
operations that can be performed. We use the <code>effect</code> construct:</p>
<pre><code><span>effect</span><span> </span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>unit</span><span>
</span><span>effect</span><span> </span><span>Read_line</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unit</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we can write our program in a direct style, by <em>producing
effects</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>program</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>What is your name?</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Read_line</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Hello </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is then possible to <strong>interpret our program afterward</strong>, using a
construction similar to pattern matching, to give a specific meaning
to each effect.</p>
<p>Currently, it should be noted that <strong>effect propagation is not tracked
by the type system</strong>. However, this is an experimental feature, which
is used extensively in the <a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml">new version of
YOCaml</a>. I am aware that resources
are being devoted to developing an <strong>efficient type system to track
effect propagation</strong>!</p>
<p>In general, when I don’t care about controlling the program’s flow, or
I don’t need to add effects <em>after the fact</em>, I use modules. But in
the case of YOCaml, the new effect system was leveraged to <a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml/commit/d78bb21077272ae86f7b6b3017509596de0a5a27">introduce
effects dedicated to unit
testing</a>,
allowing, for example, the <em>mocking of time passing</em>.</p>
<p>Once again, it’s really difficult not to go on at length about
<em>user-defined effects</em>, which are a brand-new and very exciting
feature of the language. I’ll conclude by simply sharing two articles
written by <a href="https://github.com/art-w">Arthur Wendling</a> that explain
the use of effects in a very pedagogical way, along with a
comprehensive bibliography on the literature related to effect
abstraction in functional programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackmd.io/@yF_ntUhmRvKUt15g7m1uGw/Bk-5NXh15">Scopes and effect
handlers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackmd.io/@yF_ntUhmRvKUt15g7m1uGw/BJBZ7TMeq">Roguelike with effect
handlers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yallop/effects-bibliography">Effect bibliography</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth noting that this inversion/injection could also be done
using <em>records</em> or <em>objects</em>. However, my experience with OCaml
suggests that approaches using modules or effects (when you want to
manipulate the program’s control flow) are often more straightforward
and easier to reason about.</p>
<h3 id="regarding-the-future">Regarding the future</h3>
<p>OCaml is a <em>constantly evolving</em> language that changes with each
version. In the section on dependency inversion, I briefly mentioned
the recent inclusion of effects in the language to describe a
<em>multi-core runtime</em>, reflecting the ongoing evolution of OCaml over
the years. One can also note the integration of <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/bindingops.html">binding
operators</a>, which make the
use of the triad
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor_%28functional_programming%29">Functors</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor">Applicative
Functors</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29">Monads</a>
more convenient — similar to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">computation
expressions</a>
in F#.</p>
<p>Currently, many very exciting projects are underway to further improve
the language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A deep work on the expression of effects, with a newly added syntax,
and a collection of research on the separation between <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12736">operations
and effects</a> and, of
course, on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11816">propagation of effects in the type
system</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a> proposed <a href="https://antonlorenzen.de/mode-inference.pdf">a
non-intrusive resource management
model</a>, inspired by
Rust, introducing <em>modalities</em> and <em>a bit of linearity</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A genuine <a href="https://clement.blaudeau.net/assets/pdf/blaudeau_ocaml_modules.pdf">foundational
work</a>
has been initiated on the module language, making the implementation
of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf">Modular
Implicits</a>
more smoothly achievable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also note the development of a <a href="https://xnning.github.io/papers/icfp23.pdf">hygienic macro
system</a>, the gradual
integration of a <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html">staged metaprogramming
system</a>, and the
implementation of an <a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/tag/flambda2/"><em>optimization
back-end</em></a>, reflecting
OCaml’s strong activity in the innovation sector and making its
development in the coming years very motivating and exciting!</p>
<h3 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Even though I’m convinced that OCaml is an <strong>excellent language</strong>,
claiming it is perfect would probably be <em>disingenuous</em> — after all,
<em>nothing is perfect</em>. Here are, in my opinion, a few points that cast
a shadow on OCaml as a language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">ad-hoc
polymorphism</a>.</strong>
Although it is possible to work around it, for example using local
module openings, the absence of <em>ad-hoc polymorphism</em> (via <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Classes_and_types">type
classes</a> —
as in Haskell, or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">traits</a>/<a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/implicit-parameters.html">implicit
objects</a>
— as in Rust and Scala, or <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/doc/v8.18/refman/language/extensions/canonical.html">canonical
structures</a>
— as in Coq) can sometimes make certain situations tricky. Even
though I tend to prefer explicit relationships, over the years I’ve
found several cases where this absence can be problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The inability to describe type parameter constraints on
polymorphic functions, leading to polymorphic equality and
comparison functions in the standard library, which has caused
<a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/the-perils-of-polymorphic-compare/">much
debate</a>
and, for example, required specialized versions of arithmetic
operators for different numeric representations (<code>int</code>, <code>int64</code>,
<code>float</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk of combinatorial explosion when describing many relationships
between modules. This is why the
<a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface">Preface</a> library proposes a
somewhat <a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface/blob/master/guides/option_instantiation.md">complex modular
decomposition</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even though the arrival of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf">implicit
modules</a>
is probably not in the short-term roadmap, recent work on the module
language, as discussed in the “future of OCaml” section, is
promising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cumbersome interaction between the module language and the value
language.</strong>  The module language is <strong>a different language</strong> with
its own type system. Whether this counts as a weakness is debatable,
but this distinction can be intimidating. It comes from the fact
that OCaml’s module system was a pioneer in module theory and
predates more recent innovations (e.g.,
<a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/1ml-extended.pdf">1ML</a>).
In practice, besides being <em>complex to grasp</em>, certain parts of the
language are hard to specify correctly, for example <a href="https://www.ocaml.org/manual/5.2/recursivemodules.html#s%3Arecursive-modules">recursive
modules</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A language comfortable for functional programming, but impure.</strong>
While I consider impurity <strong>a feature</strong>, importing idioms from
purely functional languages (e.g., Haskell) can cause difficulties
related to type inference, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_restriction"><em>value
restriction</em></a>.
Even though OCaml has
<a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-fiwflp04.pdf">relaxed</a>
this restriction, its implications on polymorphic function inference
can still be intimidating — for very good reasons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syntax.</strong> Personally, I really like OCaml’s syntax and believe
syntax should rarely be a major issue, but some choices can be
confusing. For instance, type parameters prefix the type name: a
list of <code>a</code> is written <code>'a list</code>. Many of these choices aim to
<em>reduce syntactic ambiguity</em>, and you get used to them
quickly. However, coming from another language, some of these
conventions may seem surprising.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these weaknesses are generally debatable (because they are
often justified), but I completely understand that they can be
unsettling. However, I believe they are not enough to make OCaml
unusable and <strong>should not be a major barrier to getting started with
OCaml</strong>! The benefit of having an <em>improvable</em> language is that it
constantly offers a range of potential improvements, motivating work
that can also benefit other languages. And, to be entirely honest,
being aware of these <em>rough edges</em>, I’ve more often found myself
frustrated by the absence of language features <strong>that exist in OCaml</strong>
in other languages, rather than complaining about these rough edges
while writing OCaml itself. For these rough edges, there are usually
workarounds (sometimes only partially satisfying, I admit) that allow
one to work calmly and effectively.</p>
<h3 id="to-conclude-on-language">To conclude on language</h3>
<p>I have, in very broad strokes, outlined <strong>reasons</strong> why, in my
opinion, learning OCaml is a <strong>very relevant</strong> choice. This language
allows one to <em>fundamentally understand</em> certain <em>very</em> popular
programming idioms (often poorly defined). Moreover, some aspects of
the language perfectly serve industrial purposes, making good
practices sometimes trivial to express! Much of this appeal can be
experimented with in other languages, but OCaml's <em>strongly
multi-paradigm</em> nature allows one to centralize this learning in a
single language. To my knowledge, in the jungle of <em>partially popular</em>
languages, only Scala seems to cover as many topics, although, from my
point of view, its object model is, essentially for interoperability
with other JVM languages, far less interesting.</p>
<p>Since the goal of this article is not to be a tutorial, I deliberately
skimmed over certain concepts,
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/modules">modules</a> and
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/ffects.html">effects</a>. I hardly mentioned
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/objects">objects</a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/polyvariant.html">polymorphic
variants</a>, or <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/gadts-tutorial.html">generalized
algebraic types</a>. If
these topics interest you, I encourage you to read in detail the
excellent <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/index.html">Using, Understanding, and Unraveling The OCaml
Language</a> by
<a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~remy/">Didier Rémy</a>, along with the books I
presented in the introduction, which is a goldmine for anyone wishing
to deepen their knowledge of OCaml.</p>
<p>In conclusion, OCaml offers a diverse and rich set of language-level
tools for learning programming, building industrial-grade programs
that follow standards, as well as implementing <a href="https://github.com/art-w/deque">complex data
structures</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface">category-theory-based
abstractions</a> such as a functional
core, imperative traits, a rich and expressive inferred type system
(allowing the expression of algebraic types and facilitating clear
domain modeling), a module system for abstraction, reusability, and
defining compilation units, an object model, the ability to express
effects that can be propagated and interpreted <em>a posteriori</em>, and
other advanced features. Even just to <em>grasp advanced programming
concepts</em>, OCaml is an <strong>excellent candidate</strong> — which is why OCaml
has been an obvious inspiration for many more recent languages, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/influences.html">with
Rust being a notable
example</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ocaml-as-an-ecosystem">OCaml as an ecosystem</h2>
<p>Having an expressive language is very beneficial for <em>building things</em>
(the phrasing is deliberately naive). However, in different contexts,
both professional and personal, this is not enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a professional context, it is obvious that if I want my team and
I to be productive, it is probably not very relevant to have to
build a whole tool stack before being able to start addressing the
problem we are tasked with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a personal context, even though one could <em>argue</em> that building
your technology stack is <strong>very educational</strong>, it changes the set of
skills you actually want to <em>develop</em>. If, to build a small web
application to get started with OCaml as a web language, I have to
build my entire HTTP stack, it is very likely that OCaml is not the
right choice. Rest assured, however, that OCaml has <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/is-ocaml-web-yet">a rich tooling
ecosystem</a> for building web
applications!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why the features offered by the language are not a sufficient
metric to describe its viability for building and maintaining
projects. The ecosystem is also a very important factor. It is for
these reasons that <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">.NET</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a>, through
relatively less expressive (but improving) languages like Java and C#,
are also so popular. To assess the relevance of an ecosystem, I think
it is important to consider several criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The relevance of the <em>runtime</em> (or compilation targets) for the
project. It’s likely that I wouldn’t recommend OCaml for embedding
in a tiny, exotic <em>hardware</em> — though, knowing nothing about
low-level programming (because it’s not my field at all), I could be
wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its <strong>platform</strong>. Is its entire <em>toolchain</em> complete and ergonomic?
From my point of view, this includes a package manager, a <em>build
system</em>, good <em>editor support</em> (agnostic as possible), a solid
documentation generator, and a collection of additional tools, such
as a <em>formatter</em> (and many others).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relevance of the <strong>available libraries</strong> (and their level of
maintenance and discoverability, which generally implies having a
package manager) with particular consideration for their
ergonomics. For example, if I don’t have any cryptography
primitives, I probably wouldn’t choose this technology to build a
<em>blockchain</em>. There is a whole class of problems that are <strong>very
difficult</strong> to <em>solve in isolation</em> or in a professional context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we will try to overview these different points to see
if the OCaml ecosystem lives up to the language. I want to clarify
that <strong>I am somewhat biased</strong> because I have been convinced of OCaml’s
relevance since 2012, back when the ecosystem was <strong>drastically
poorer</strong>. At that time, I tried to build projects by patching the
gaps, which probably created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship
bias</a>. Nowadays,
thanks in part to industrial users, the OCaml ecosystem is much richer
and more extensive, making it much easier to defend, although when
some gaps still exist, the bad faith <em>of the old user</em> can resurface.</p>
<h3 id="compilation-runtimes-and-additional-targets">Compilation, <em>runtimes</em>, and additional targets</h3>
<p>Since its inception, OCaml has had two compilation targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Native compilation, which produces highly efficient executables
compiled for a specific architecture (and supports a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml?tab=readme-ov-file#overview">large number
of
architectures</a>). Moreover,
whereas Windows was historically largely neglected, <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-05-22-launching-the-first-class-windows-project/">a special
effort</a>
has been made to support it (also note the <a href="https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-installer-ocaml">DkMl
project</a>, an
independent initiative).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compilation to <em>bytecode</em> (for a virtual machine), producing
portable executables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of a virtual machine enabled the development of the
venerable
<a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">Js_of_OCaml</a>,
which allows <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~vouillon/publi/js_of_ocaml.pdf">transforming OCaml bytecode into
JavaScript</a>,
making OCaml perfectly viable for developing applications in the
browser as well as in the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node</a> runtime, and
it is extensively used for this website. Using a similar approach,
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> support was made possible very
recently through the
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">Wasm_of_OCaml</a>
project. Supporting compilation to <em>WASM</em> for a language with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">garbage
collector</a>
was a <em>serious challenge</em>, but with the recent specification of
interaction between <em>WASM</em> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc"><em>garbage
collectors</em></a>, <strong>OCaml now has
perfectly decent WebAssembly compilation</strong> (and many ambitious web
projects, like <a href="https://ocsigen.org/">Ocsigen</a>, are beginning to
support <em>WASM</em> natively).</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href="https://melange.re/">Melange</a> project (historically
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-short-history-of-rescript-bucklescript/7222">BuckleScript</a>)
offers a way to <em>transpile</em> — mapping the OCaml <em>AST</em> to the
JavaScript <em>AST</em> — as an alternative for producing JavaScript. If I
were to compare
<a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">Js_of_OCaml</a>
and <a href="https://melange.re/">Melange</a>, beyond the different underlying
methods used to produce JavaScript (compiling to <em>bytecode</em> and then
transforming that <em>bytecode</em> into JavaScript versus syntactic
transformation from OCaml to JavaScript), I would say that
<strong>Js_of_OCaml</strong> integrates better with the OCaml ecosystem and is
therefore likely <strong>intended for OCaml developers</strong> who want to make
their projects accessible from a browser — indeed, interaction with
the existing JavaScript ecosystem can be more cumbersome. <strong>Melange</strong>
fits better with the JavaScript ecosystem (<code>npm</code> and co) and is
therefore likely <strong>intended for JavaScript developers</strong> seeking to
bring more safety to their JS projects (or an existing codebase).</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is common to find <em>multi-backend</em> languages like
<a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a> or
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. However, <em>at the time</em>, I was very
impressed that OCaml could, <em>from the moment I started using it</em>, also
compile to JavaScript. Back then, the only language I knew that
offered multiple compilation targets was <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a>,
which were so different (incidentally, Haxe is <a href="https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe">written in
OCaml</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, in 2024, producing JavaScript has become standard, but the
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/~balat/publications/2006mlworkshop-balat-ocsigen.pdf">first traces of Js_of_OCaml date back to
2006</a>,
making OCaml a pioneer in the field!</p>
<h4 id="a-quick-detour-via-mirageos">A quick detour via MirageOS</h4>
<p>In the <em>lattice formed by the different OCaml execution and
compilation contexts</em>, having libraries that work well in <em>the
majority of contexts</em> is a challenging task. Fortunately, the
<a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a> project — a set of libraries designed
to build an <strong>operating system dedicated to running only a single
application</strong> via virtualization (a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel"><em>unikernel</em></a>) — introduced a
true discipline for producing multi-context libraries.</p>
<p>In the <em>near future</em>, I would like to spend more time writing about
Mirage, a fascinating project that we are trying to integrate into our
projects, for example in <a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml">YOCaml</a>,
our static site generator. Moreover, in addition to providing a sound
approach to distributing <em>intelligently compartmentalized</em> libraries,
Mirage offers a solid foundation of libraries for building OCaml
projects, which I will discuss more <em>extensively</em> in the section
dedicated to libraries.</p>
<h3 id="the-ocaml-platform">The OCaml platform</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://ocaml.org/platform">OCaml platform</a> is a set of tools,
maintained within an explicit lifecycle (<code>active</code>, <code>incubating</code>,
<code>maintained</code>, and <code>deprecated</code>), designed to support the compiler with
a coherent toolchain for OCaml code production. It includes many tools
serving different purposes; however, in this section, I will focus
only on certain aspects of the platform, leaving you free to consult
its <a href="https://ocaml.org/platform">page</a> and
<a href="https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap">roadmap</a> for more detailed
information. In this section, we will look at, <em>in broad strokes</em>, 4
main specific points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package manager</li>
<li>The build system (<em>build-system</em>)</li>
<li>Editor support (including code formatting)</li>
<li>The documentation generator</li>
</ul>
<p>When using OCaml for some time, this is probably the most exciting
part of the article, because, in my opinion, it is the one that has
benefited the most from progress. And the
<a href="https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap">roadmap</a> is, in my view,
promising!</p>
<h4 id="opam-the-package-manager">OPAM, the package manager</h4>
<p>Even though <em>language-specific package managers</em> have become very
popular (if not essential) in reducing adoption friction for a
language, at the time OCaml was designed, they were rare. Indeed,
apart from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTAN">CTAN</a>, for
distributing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a> packages,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</a>, inspired by CTAN, for
distributing <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> packages, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEAR">PEAR</a> for
<a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, it would take until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems">Gems</a> for development
technologies to consider adopting a package manager as axiomatic for a
programming language.</p>
<p><a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a>, for <strong>O</strong>Caml <strong>Pa</strong>ckage <strong>M</strong>anager,
is a
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/30598a59c98554057ce2beda80f0d31474b94150/specs/roadmap.pdf">proposal</a>
from 2012 (the <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/about.html">official site <em>About</em>
page</a> presents a small
timeline). In addition to installing packages, OPAM allows you to
install different versions of OCaml and create <em>potentially sandboxed
environments</em>, called
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/opam-switch-introduction">switches</a>. You can
use the public resource repository, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">hosted on
GitHub</a>, but it is also
perfectly possible to create your own package index.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having already published several packages on OPAM, I must admit that
the <a href="https://check.ci.ocaml.org/">CI</a> for package addition
validation is incredibly efficient and user-friendly (each error
provides a Dockerfile to reproduce the issue locally), and that the
team of people who moderate and manage package additions/changes are
extraordinarily responsive and kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though, in the light of modern standards, one could point out several criticisms of OPAM, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminology that can be cumbersome to grasp (<em>switch</em>, <em>invariant</em>,
etc.)</li>
<li>duplication of all packages and compilers across multiple <em>switches</em>
(this is a known issue for which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JDSUCx-tPw">work has already been
done</a>)</li>
<li>and probably some ergonomic issues (notably the interaction with
<code>dune</code> could be smoother, for which <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-developer-preview-updates/15160">work is also currently
underway</a>)</li>
<li>some complications when managing packages in development,
referencing them from a source repository rather than from OPAM</li>
</ul>
<p>I must admit that coming from an era when OPAM did not exist, I have
learned to live with some of these minor pitfalls, and on a daily
basis, I have little reason to complain about the tool, which has
never really let me down in my everyday use. However, if you have
encountered usage issues, I encourage you to discuss them on <a href="https://ocaml.org/community">one of
the communication spaces</a> so that the
development team can take your feedback into account and guide you.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://esy.sh/">esy</a> as an alternative package
manager, which draws inspiration from <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> to
build a reusable <em>store</em>, in the same way it is possible to use Nix
with OCaml. However, being somewhat conventional, I am not really
familiar with these practices, and being satisfied with my <em>workflow</em>
with OPAM, I have, unfortunately, never taken the time to seriously
experiment with <strong>esy</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="dune-the-build-system">Dune, the <em>build-system</em></h4>
<p>As with package management, historically, OCaml had <strong>several</strong>
<em>build-systems</em>: the venerable
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild">ocamlbuild</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis">oasis</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-build">ocp-build</a>,
<a href="https://ocaml.org/p/jenga/latest">Jenga</a>, and other variations around
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>. However, since 2018, the
community has strongly adopted <a href="https://dune.build/">Dune</a>, a
<em>build-system</em> initially developed at
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Janestreet</a>.</p>
<p>In many aspects, Dune can be intimidating. Indeed, its
<a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a> is <strong>very
dense</strong> — but it has greatly improved in terms of structure over the
past few months. And, while many tools choose rule description
languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML">TOML</a>, or even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, Dune has opted for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expressions</a>. It is
also regrettable that Dune, <em>by default</em>, treats <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/comp.html#s%3Acomp-warnings">all
warnings</a> as
fatal.</p>
<p>Before explaining some of its choices (such as <strong>S-expressions</strong>), it
is very important to highlight the points that have made Dune a
standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune is <strong>very fast</strong> and offers a <strong>highly efficient</strong> execution
model</li>
<li>it builds the necessary artifacts for configuration <em>automatically</em></li>
<li>it generates some redundant files (such as OPAM description files)</li>
<li>it trivializes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression"><em>vendoring</em></a> of
libraries</li>
<li>it allows invoking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">read–eval–print
loops</a>
correctly provisioned by the context</li>
<li>one becomes familiar very quickly with <strong>S-expressions</strong>, which
allow rules to be described schematically and rapidly</li>
<li>it is relatively agnostic and can execute arbitrary tasks (similar
to <code>make</code>)</li>
<li>it is constantly evolving and improving from version to version</li>
<li>paired with <a href="https://github.com/tarides/dune-release">dune-release</a>,
it makes publishing packages on OPAM incredibly simple</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I’m biased, but in my opinion, Dune is one of the most generic
and pleasant <em>build-systems</em> I’ve ever used — even if, at first
glance, it can seem intimidating and some choices may be hard to
justify.</p>
<h5 id="on-the-choice-of-s-expressions">On the choice of S-expressions</h5>
<p>At first glance, using a <em>Lisp-like</em> syntax to describe binaries,
libraries, and projects may seem surprising. However, this decision
has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AST of <strong>S-expressions</strong> being <strong>drastically simple</strong>, parsing
is very straightforward and can be made highly efficient, which does
not penalize compilation speed.</li>
<li>The language has <em>termination</em>, making it easier to inspect in case
of errors (anyone who has tried to handle errors in large YAML files
will have faced this kind of problem).</li>
<li>The language is very easy to learn and to describe.</li>
<li>It allows describing <strong>real programs</strong>, making Dune relatively
generic and enabling additional tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from my point of view, the choice of <strong>S-expressions</strong> is
relevant: it allows describing complex, readable programs without
being too verbose, does not significantly slow down compilation, and
enables very concise descriptions of highly complex build rules. And
to be completely honest, you get used to it very quickly!</p>
<h5 id="contribution-to-the-state-of-the-art-selective-applicative-functor">Contribution to the state of the art: Selective Applicative Functor</h5>
<p>In addition to being a very pleasant <em>build-system</em>, Dune has
contributed to the state of the art in research by highlighting a new
construction <em>inspired by category theory</em>. Indeed, in 2018, <a href="https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/about/">Andrey
Mokhov</a>, <a href="https://ndmitchell.com/">Neil
Mitchell</a> and <a href="https://simon.peytonjones.org/">Simon Peyton
Jones</a> proposed, in the excellent
paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3236774">"<em>Build Systems à la
Carte</em>"</a>, a collection of
abstractions to re-implement — modularly — various
<em>build-systems</em>. However, for reasons related to <strong>static dependency
analysis</strong>, these models were not compatible with Dune. After several
investigations and experiments, a new construction, similar to an
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Control-Applicative.html">Applicative</a>,
a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341694">Selective Applicative
Functor</a>, capturing Dune's
prerequisites was proposed. This information may seem anecdotal, but,
in my view, it reinforces the value (and importance) of being at <strong>the
intersection of research and industry</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h5>
<p>Although widely adopted by the community, OCaml offers alternative
systems (sometimes using Dune <em>under the hood</em>), for example,
<a href="https://obazl.github.io/docs_obazl/">Obazl</a> which provides OCaml
rules for <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rizo/onix">Onix</a> which allows building projects
with <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, <a href="https://buck2.build/">Buck2</a> which is
an ambitious and generic project competing with Bazel, and
<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/drom">Drom</a> which offers an experience
similar to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/">Cargo</a>, unifying
package management and project building.</p>
<h4 id="lsp-and-merlin-for-editors">LSP and Merlin for editors</h4>
<p>In the previous sections, we saw how much OCaml has progressed in
areas necessary for industrialization. On the other hand, in terms of
editor support, OCaml has had excellent support for
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for over 10 years through
the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a> project, which provides
editor services enabling <strong>completion</strong>, <strong>diagnostics</strong>, <strong>code
navigation</strong> features, tools related to <strong>value deconstruction</strong>,
<strong>value construction</strong>, management (and navigation) of <strong>typed
holes</strong>, <strong>polarity-based search</strong>, precise information (with
verbosity control) on <strong>value types</strong>, <em><strong>jump-to-definition</strong></em>, etc.</p>
<p>In my opinion, IDE support via Merlin has been excellent in OCaml for
a very long time. Coupled with
<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent">ocp-indent</a>, which calculates
the cursor position after an action in the editor, and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat">OCamlformat</a>, which allows
on-the-fly (configurable) formatting of OCaml files, writing code in
Emacs or Vim is an absolute joy!</p>
<h5 id="the-advent-of-vscode-lsp-as-standard">The advent of VSCode, LSP as standard</h5>
<p>In 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio
Code</a> arrived,
introducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">Language Server
Protocol</a>,
which abstracts how editors interact with a language through a server,
following a uniform protocol. OCaml has a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp">very good LSP
server</a> that itself relies on
well-established libraries in the OCaml ecosystem, notably
Merlin. Since LSP has become <em>relatively standard</em> in the editor world
(Vim, Emacs, and, in fact, almost all free editors I know can interact
with an LSP server), the plan is to deprecate the Merlin server,
moving entirely to LSP, making Merlin a low-level library that
provides tooling used by LSP. This is one of the projects the <code>Editor</code>
team at <a href="https://tarides.com/">Tarides</a> (which I’m part of) is working
on: making <code>ocaml-lsp</code> feature-compatible with Merlin’s historic
server to reduce maintenance for alternative clients (Emacs and Vim),
only worrying about OCaml-specific requests and actions (which,
logically, are not part of the protocol).</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform">OCaml platform for Visual Studio
Code</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot">OCaml-eglot</a> are the two
canonical implementations (which extend the LSP protocol for OCaml),
respectively for VSCode and Emacs. We are currently considering the
implementation of a NeoVim plugin.</p>
<p>A bit like with Dune, in my opinion, the tooling state is excellent,
and the roadmap is motivating! However, since this is <strong>my work</strong>, I’m
probably biased.</p>
<h4 id="odoc-the-documentation-generator">Odoc, the documentation generator</h4>
<p>OCaml is distributed with a documentation generator, the venerable
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/ocamldoc.html">OCamldoc</a>; however, it is
no longer recommended by/for the community. Indeed, the tool being
promoted is <a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/">Odoc</a>, a new tool that
exists outside the compiler and offers several very interesting
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>rich markup</em> language, supporting cross-references</li>
<li>the ability to write "manual" pages, ephemeral, while still
benefiting from cross-references</li>
<li>very good integration with Dune</li>
<li>a type-based search bar (implemented via
<a href="https://doc.sherlocode.com/">Sherlodoc</a>)</li>
<li>inclusion of source code (written in the documentation or documented
modules)</li>
<li>implementation of <em>drivers</em> allowing the generation of large sets of
documentation (used to implement <a href="https://ocaml.org/packages">the documentation of all packages
on OPAM</a>)</li>
<li>support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest"><em>doctest</em></a> via
<a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx">mdx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the <em>look'n feel</em> of documentation generated by Odoc is,
in my view, <strong>far superior</strong> to that produced by OCamldoc, there is
still (once again, in my view) a bit of work needed on the UI for the
tool to be truly <strong>perfect</strong>!</p>
<p>I clearly have a certain fondness for the documentation of the
<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> language,
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/">HexDoc</a> (in terms of <em>design</em> and features), and
personally, I would like OCaml to move toward that example. However,
it must be acknowledged that the documentation generated by Odoc is
superior to that of many other languages. Moreover, due to the highly
modular nature of the language, a good documentation generator that
effectively supports <em>cross-references</em> is quite an achievement!</p>
<h3 id="available-libraries">Available libraries</h3>
<p>We have seen that the language is <em>cool</em>, and that it has tooling
which, although still evolving, is effective and pleasant to
use. Could its lack of popularity be due to a too limited set of
libraries? To be completely honest, <strong>I don’t know</strong>. What I do know
is that whenever I have had to write OCaml projects, both professional
and personal, I have often found everything I needed in the <a href="https://ocaml.org/packages">package
list</a>. I think the reasons why OCaml is
mature enough for many typical projects can be summarized in several
points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies like <a href="https://www.lexifi.com/">Lexifi</a> and
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Janestreet</a> have strongly contributed
to the ecosystem by releasing many libraries necessary for their
daily use.</li>
<li>Ambitious research projects, such as, in the case of the Web,
<a href="https://ocsigen.org/home/intro.html">Ocsigen</a>, used industrially in
the <a href="https://www.besport.com/">BeSport</a> project, have generated a
collection of useful libraries.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>, with its
<a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/all-about-unikernels-part-1-what-they-are"><em>Clean
Slate</em></a>
approach, naturally produced many robust libraries.</li>
<li>Like in popular languages such as JavaScript or Rust, motivated
contributors have provided excellent libraries.</li>
<li>The language is old and has been used industrially for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my part, I have sometimes <em>re-created</em> libraries for the
<strong>pleasure of reinventing the wheel</strong>, but also, at times, to offer an
alternative interface. Moreover, OCaml allows interfacing with, among
other languages, C, enabling the creation of <em>bindings</em> for a large
number of libraries and tools. However, if there is a library that you
find <em>objectively</em> missing, I encourage you to join <a href="https://ocaml.org/community">the
community</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that my use of OCaml has focused primarily on
three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web development</strong> (heavily driven by Mirage, Ocsigen, and
independent projects like <a href="https://aantron.github.io/dream/">Dream</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml">YOCaml</a>, and many
<a href="https://ocaml.org/packages/search?q=web">others</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain development</strong> and, by extension, the use of
cryptography libraries, provided once again by Mirage, as well as by
the <a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star">HACL*</a> project, a
formally verified library written in <a href="https://fstar-lang.org/">F*</a>
and extracted to OCaml</li>
<li><strong>Development of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a></strong> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp">OCaml-LSP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All these areas still require good testing tooling, and OCaml offers
several complementary libraries to implement robust test
suites. Indeed, within the OCaml ecosystem, you can find tools to
write <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx">doctests</a>, classic <a href="https://github.com/mirage/alcotest">unit
tests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck">property-based
tests</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/stedolan/crowbar">fuzzing</a>, as well as <a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#inline-expectation-tests">output
observation
tests</a>,
<a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#inline-tests">inline
tests</a>
(which allow testing, among other things, private components), and
<a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cram.html">cram
tests</a>.</p>
<p>I continue to find everything I need among the available packages, and
I’m still very impressed to see the number of packages and
alternatives grow <em>year after year</em>. Of course, there are some gaps,
but they have not invalidated my choice of OCaml.</p>
<h4 id="side-note-on-the-standard-library">Side note on the standard library</h4>
<p>A recurring criticism of OCaml is the <em>modesty</em> of its standard
library. Historically, it was designed only to implement the language
itself, so it didn’t include certain features useful for end
users. This situation has led to the emergence of alternative standard
libraries, the most popular of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included">Batteries</a>,
an alternative to the standard library that is somewhat
<em>dated</em>. Historically, it was a <em>fork</em> of
<a href="https://github.com/ygrek/ocaml-extlib">Extlib</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/base/">Base</a>, an alternative
developed by <a href="https://janestreet.com/">Janestreet</a>, used <em>quite
extensively</em> in the book <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/">Real World
OCaml</a>. The library enforces strong
conventions, such as <em>labeling</em> higher-order functions (typically
with the name <code>f</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/">Core</a> is an extension of
Base.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers">Containers</a> is an
extension of the standard library (in the sense that <code>open Containers</code> at the beginning of a module does not break code written
with the standard library).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these alternative standard libraries, there are
specialized libraries that address general problems, such as
<a href="https://github.com/dbuenzli/bos">Bos</a>, which provides tools to
interact with an operating system, and
<a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface">Preface</a> — <em>shameless plug</em> — which
allows you to <em>realize abstractions from category theory</em>.</p>
<p>The stance of the maintainers on the standard library has evolved over
the years, and it is now possible to consider extending it. However,
additions to the standard library are often subject to debate, and
adding new modules can sometimes take a long time. Personally, I would
have preferred that the standard library <strong>continue to serve only the
development of the language</strong> and that a library under the OCaml
community umbrella be published. This separation allows the releases
of the language and its standard library to be desynchronized and also
likely simplifies compatibility between the library and the language.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem-conclusion">Ecosystem Conclusion</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have the opportunity to cover all the tools of
the platform, nor the fundamental building blocks that make OCaml
enjoyable to use for personal projects as well as for industrial
projects (for example, the various existing
<a href="https://github.com/hackwaly/ocamlearlybird">debuggers</a>). However, I
hope I’ve been able to give an overview of some tools that form a
solid foundation for using OCaml.</p>
<p>In my use of the language, I’ve sometimes had to build my own library;
however, it’s not an exercise I regret. I think, unfortunately, that
if one decides never to use a language just because 100% of the
necessary libraries aren’t available, it feels—perhaps awkwardly—to me
like <strong>leveling down</strong>, trapping us behind languages backed by
<em>wealthy companies</em>, like Java or C#, and <strong>that’s a bit sad</strong>.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve used many different programming languages, I think
OCaml is the only one with which I’ve had strong community
interaction. So, I’m not fully aware of how things work in other
communities, which makes my feedback <em>somewhat irrelevant</em>. But from
my experience, I find that the OCaml community, besides being very
productive, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Very accessible</strong>: Like many other languages, OCaml has a <a href="https://ocaml.org/community">strong
online presence</a>. On these platforms,
you can find highly experienced contributors to the language and its
ecosystem and benefit from expert (or sometimes less technical)
advice. I’d like to give a special mention to <a href="http://gasche.info/">Gabriel
Scherer</a> and <a href="https://perso.quaesituri.org/florian.angeletti">Florian
Angeletti</a>, whose
answers are always thoughtful and interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very kind</strong>: I often need to ask for help, and I’ve always
received clear and precise answers, whether in private or in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very brilliant</strong>: OCaml is the product of work by <em>brilliant
researchers</em>, and having the chance to interact with them is
incredible (and potentially a bit intimidating). Being able to ask
questions directly to people behind some of the major discoveries in
language design is a fantastic opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude on the community aspect, even though I’m not fully aware
of how other communities interact, I find it a pleasure to be part of
the OCaml developer community. It’s a welcoming space, conducive to
sharing and learning.</p>
<h2 id="some-myths-about-ocaml">Some myths about OCaml</h2>
<p>I’m finally reaching the most fun part of this overly long article: I
get to <strong>debunk</strong> some persistent myths about OCaml. I still can’t
promise complete objectivity, but know that my intentions are good. On
the internet, you often see various criticisms or remarks about OCaml,
and I often find it tiresome to respond. However, what better way than
an article meant to share my enthusiasm for the language to take the
time to address some of these critiques and try to provide a response?</p>
<p>I’ve selected a few, but it’s likely that in the future I’ll write
somewhat longer articles—similar to the members of <a href="https://www.heyplzlookat.me/articles/critique-de-la-raison-pure.gmi">HeyPlzLookAtMe
(fr)</a>
— about articles I find unfair.</p>
<h3 id="ocaml-and-f">OCaml and F#</h3>
<p><a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> is a programming language <a href="https://fsharp.org/history/hopl-final/hopl-fsharp.pdf">historically very
inspired</a> by
OCaml that runs on the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET</a> platform
(and, de facto, integrates very well with C#). I find the language —
which I have professionally used at
<a href="https://derniercri.io/">DernierCri</a> and
<a href="https://www.d-edge.com/">D-Edge</a> — very pleasant. Historically, since
.NET was exclusively for Windows environments, OCaml didn’t suffer
much by comparison. However, since the arrival of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">.NET
Core</a>, a cross-platform implementation
of .NET, I increasingly see statements on the internet like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why continue using OCaml when you can have the same language, F#,
with the entire .NET ecosystem, more features, and a syntax that’s
more pleasant to use?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, I do think that having the .NET (Core) ecosystem is a huge
advantage. Regarding the syntax, I’m more reserved. Indeed, I find
that indentation-based syntax sometimes makes moving code around more
cumbersome, and even though there are criticisms of OCaml’s syntax, I
must admit it hasn’t let me down. The last point seems a bit more
insidious. Indeed, F# has been equipped with features not present in
OCaml, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">Computation
expressions</a>
(which are syntactically a more general form than <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/bindingops.html">binding
operators</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">Type
providers</a>
(which can, unfortunately, sometimes cause issues with .NET Core in
certain name/path resolution cases)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/active-patterns">Active
patterns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/generics/statically-resolved-type-parameters">Statically resolved type
parameters</a></li>
<li>The ability to assign methods to sums and products, which makes
sense for interoperability reasons but significantly breaks type
inference</li>
<li>And probably other features that I don’t know well (or are linked to
interoperability with the .NET platform, notably
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/attributes">reflection</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These evolutions arrived gradually in the language. It would be naive
to think that OCaml hasn’t evolved as well. Indeed, although
historically the two languages seemed very similar, from the very
beginning of F#’s proposal, certain features were missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The absence of a <strong>module language</strong>. Indeed, the <code>module</code> keyword
exists in F#, but it is only used to describe static classes (and it
integrates rather awkwardly with namespaces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>drastically different object model</strong> (for interoperability with
C#, of course).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two reasons alone would be enough to consider OCaml and F# as
<em>cousin</em> languages but <strong>very different</strong>, and in my opinion, strongly
justify preferring one over the other. In my case, OCaml over F# makes
the introductory sentence of this section moot. However, like F#,
OCaml has also evolved, and in addition to these two fundamental
differences, OCaml offers many features that are absent in F#:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local and generalized <code>open</code>s</strong>: In OCaml, you can open a module
locally within a scope, whereas in F# you can only open a module at
the <em>top-level</em>, which can be quite frustrating in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Row polymorphism</strong>: OCaml supports row polymorphism on products
(via objects) and sums (via <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polyvariant.html">polymorphic
variants</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs)</strong>: One of the most missed
features (after the module system) for expressing precise type
constraints.</li>
<li><strong>User-defined effects</strong>: OCaml allows defining custom effect
handlers, which can simplify complex control flow and concurrency
patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Open sums</strong>: Extensible variants allow for sum types that can be
extended, though similar behavior can sometimes be simulated using
objects and inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, even though F# is a really nice language and using it
brings many advantages (notably the .NET platform), it is <strong>not just a
better version of OCaml</strong>. The two languages are very different, and
from my point of view, OCaml has a more sophisticated type system,
which makes me prefer it over F#. In my opinion, saying that F# is
just a prettier OCaml is as reasonable as saying that
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> is nothing more than
<a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> with a lighter syntax.</p>
<h3 id="doubled-operators-for-floats">Doubled operators for floats</h3>
<p>The standard library contains the following arithmetic operators on
integers:</p>
<pre><code><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>But also arithmetic operators for floating point numbers:</p>
<pre><code><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>+.</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>-.</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>*.</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance, this may seem confusing. However, it makes perfect
sense. If we wanted to have generic operators, we would need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">ad-hoc
polymorphism</a>, like
in Haskell, for example, where arithmetic operators reside in the
<code>Num</code> type class:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span><span>  </span><span>Num</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>  </span><span>where</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>--</span><span> more code</span><span>
</span><span>  (+), (-), (*) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
</span><span>  </span><span>--</span><span> more code</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Without some form of ad-hoc polymorphism (via classes, traits, or
implicits) to describe a constraint on our operators, e.g., <code>op :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>, what can we do? A suggestion I’ve often seen online
is to use <em>the same trick</em> as with the <code>=</code> operator, whose type is
<code>val (=) : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool</code>. That doesn’t work, because while
we can hope that <em>everything is comparable</em> (at worst, we can return
<code>false</code>), how can we generalize something like addition?</p>
<p>Support for arithmetic operators is a tricky problem, which is
actually the original motivation behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type
classes</a> (and the reason for
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/generics/statically-resolved-type-parameters">statically resolved type
parameters</a>
in F#). From my perspective, <em>while waiting for <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf">modular
implicits</a></em>,
duplicating operators to work with integers and floats seems like a
<em>reasonable</em> approach. And if, for some strange reason, suffixing
operators with dots when using floats gives you hives, you can avoid
it using local opens by providing, for example, this module:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Arithmetic</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>sub</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>mul</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>div</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>end</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>P</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>sub</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>mul</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>div</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Which allows extending the <code>Int</code> and <code>Float</code> modules (which already
provide the functions <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>mul</code>, and <code>div</code>) by giving them
arithmetic operators:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Arithmetic</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>In broad terms, we create an <code>Int</code> module, include the previous <code>Int</code>
module so that our new <code>Int</code> module retains the entire API of the
original <code>Int</code> module, and then we define (and include) our arithmetic
operators. We can now repeat the same process with <code>Float</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Float</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Float</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Arithmetic</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Float</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>And now we can use a local <code>open</code> so that we don’t have to suffix our
operators with dots:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Float</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>1.3</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>2.5</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>3.1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>4.6</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>6.8</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>7.9</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>From my point of view, even if this can be confusing for those coming
from languages where this isn’t an issue, it’s a minor problem. The
lack of operator overloading seems like a rather weak argument for not
giving a language a chance — <em>but that’s just my humble opinion</em>.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-separation-between-ml-and-mli">On the separation between <code>ml</code> and <code>mli</code></h3>
<p>Another point that generates a lot of discussion (even
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/has-there-been-a-syntax-proposed-for-combining-mli-into-ml/15163">recently</a>)
concerns the <strong>separation between <code>ml</code> and <code>mli</code> files</strong>. Personally,
I find it great. Even if it can introduce a bit of repetition, it
allows me to focus on the API via module encapsulation in the <code>mli</code>
file while also adding documentation. I can organize the functions I
expose in any order I like, and naturally, I can abstract the types I
share as much as possible. Moreover, when I look at an implementation,
the <code>ml</code> code is rarely cluttered with documentation, making it easy
to navigate the different elements of the module. On top of that, it
enables separate compilation and prevents recompiling modules that
depend on other modules whose implementation alone was changed during
development (this is Dune’s default behavior in the <code>dev</code> profile).</p>
<p>However, tastes vary, and when exposing complex types or module types,
this repetition can be annoying. Fortunately, there is a <em>trick</em>,
presented in 2020 by <a href="https://www.craigfe.io/">Craig Ferguson</a>, that
helps mitigate this repetition: <a href="https://www.craigfe.io/posts/the-intf-trick">The <code>_intf_</code>
trick</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are small tricks based on the ability to pass
arbitrary module expressions to the <code>open</code> and <code>include</code> primitives,
which sometimes allow you to do without <code>mli</code>. I had already mentioned
this in the article <a href="https://xvw.lol/en/articles/modules-import.html">OCaml, modules and import
schemes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="encapsulation-without-mli">Encapsulation without <code>mli</code></h4>
<p>You can simply use <code>open struct (* private code *) end</code> to avoid
exporting parts of your code without needing interfaces. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>open</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>(*</span><span> Private API </span><span>*)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_some_private_stuff</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>(*</span><span> Public API </span><span>*)</span><span>
</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>
</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>11</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="expressing-the-interface-from-ml">Expressing the interface from <code>ml</code></h4>
<p>Another similar technique is to use <code>include (struct ... end : sig (* public API *) end)</code> to describe both the structure and the interface
in the same file. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>include</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_some_private_stuff</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> : int -&gt; t
</span><span>end</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This way, the signature and the structure live in the same file, while
still allowing precise control over encapsulation. Another approach
would be to put the signature in a dedicated <code>module type</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> : int -&gt; t
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_some_private_stuff</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is very similar to the first approach, except that the module
also exposes the module type <code>S</code>. A useful side effect of this <em>leak</em>
is that you can easily reference the module's signature using
<code>My_mod.S</code> instead of having to write <code>module type of My_mod</code>.</p>
<h4 id="to-conclude-on-separation">To conclude on separation</h4>
<p>I find this separation <strong>very desirable</strong>. However, since OCaml’s
module system is highly expressive, it is possible — through some
clever encoding — to work around this separation. From my point of
view, these approaches mainly serve to demonstrate this
<em>expressiveness</em>, because the downside of merging everything in one
file is the loss of separate compilation, which I consider <em>quite
unfortunate</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think I have <em>briefly</em> covered the points I wanted to discuss. From
my perspective, <strong>OCaml is an amazing language</strong>! It offers an
excellent balance between safety and expressiveness, thanks in
particular to its advanced type system, a rich module language,
objects, support for <em>row polymorphism</em> via objects and polymorphic
variants, and user-defined effects! Its intersection of research and
industry makes it, in my view, a language evolving in the right
direction, carefully integrating new features to stay modern without
suffering the pitfalls of too-rapid or untested adoption.</p>
<p>Even though for several years OCaml’s tooling might have seemed a bit…
<em>dusty</em>, recently, thanks in part to commercial support from certain
companies, the tooling has been drastically modernized and continues
to improve, as shown by <a href="https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap">the platform
roadmap</a>. Additionally, the
growing ecosystem of libraries makes it possible to use OCaml in a
wide range of contexts, notably thanks to its different compilation
targets (for example, the browser via
<a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml">js_of_ocaml</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">wasm_of_ocaml</a>).</p>
<p>By combining an expressive language with a versatile ecosystem and a
supportive, responsive community, OCaml becomes a very compelling
choice for both personal and professional projects. Clearly, migrating
an entire codebase to OCaml is probably not a pragmatic move, but if
you have small personal projects in mind and are curious and
entertained by programming languages, <strong>I seriously encourage you to
consider OCaml</strong>!</p>
<p>I hope I’ve managed to convey my enthusiasm for this language (and its
ecosystem). If you’d like to discuss it, find projects, or explore
contribution opportunities, I’d be happy to talk with you — or you can
reach out to the community through <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/">the
forum</a>, which is active, responsive, and

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a> attack where the attacker causes the browser to send a request to a target using the ambient authority of the user’s cookies or network position.<sup id="fnref:pna"><a href="#fn:pna">1</a></sup> For example, <code>attacker.example</code> can serve the following HTML to a victim</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action="https://example.com/send-money" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="to" value="filippo" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and the browser will send a POST request to <code>https://example.com/send-money</code> using the victim’s cookies.</p>
<p>Essentially all applications that use cookies for authentication need to protect against CSRF. Importantly, this is not about protecting against an attacker that can make arbitrary requests<sup id="fnref:api"><a href="#fn:api">2</a></sup> (as an attacker doesn’t know the user’s cookies), but about working with browsers to identify authenticated requests initiated from untrusted sources.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>, which is about <em>sharing responses</em> across origins, CSRF is about accepting state-changing requests, even if the attacker will not see the response. Defending against <a href="https://xsleaks.dev/">leaks</a> is significantly <a href="https://frederikbraun.de/modern-solutions-xsleaks.html">more complex and nuanced</a>, especially in the age of Spectre.</p>
<p>Why do browsers allow these requests in the first place? Like anything in the Web platform, primarily for legacy reasons: that’s how it used to work and changing it breaks things. Importantly, disabling these <em>third-party cookies</em> breaks important Single-Sign On (SSO) flows. All CSRF solutions need to support a bypass mechanism for those rare exceptions. (There are also complex intersections with cross-site tracking and privacy concerns, which are beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-same-site-vs-same-origin">Same site vs same site vs same origin</h2>
<p>To protect against CSRF, it’s important to first define what is a cross-site or cross-origin request, and which should be allowed.</p>
<p><code>https://app.example.com</code>, <code>https://marketing.example.com</code>, and even <code>http://app.example.com</code> (depending on the definition) are all same-site but not same-origin.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to declare the goal as ensuring requests are simply from the same site, but different origins in the same site can actually sit at very different trust levels: for example it might be much easier to get XSS into an old marketing blog than in the admin panel.</p>
<p>The starkest difference in trust though is between an HTTPS and an HTTP origin, since a network attacker can serve anything it wants on the latter. This is sometimes referred to as the MitM CSRF bypass, but really it’s just a special case of a <em>schemelessly</em> same-site cross-origin CSRF attack.</p>
<p>Some parts of the Web platform apply a <em>schemeful</em> definition of same-site, where <code>https://app.example.com</code> and <code>http://app.example.com</code> are <em>not</em> same-site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies in general apply the schemeless definition (HTTP = HTTPS). There is a proposal to address this, <a href="https://github.com/sbingler/Origin-Bound-Cookies">Origin-Bound-Cookies</a> (and specifically its lack of opt-out for scheme binding, which subsumes the earlier <a href="https://github.com/mikewest/scheming-cookies">Scheme-Bound Cookies</a> proposal), which however <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/4945698250293248">hasn’t shipped yet</a>.</li>
<li>The SameSite cookie attribute used to apply the schemeless definition (HTTP = HTTPS). Chrome changed that with <a href="https://web.dev/articles/schemeful-samesite">Schemeful Same-Site</a> in 2020, but <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651119">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/cookies/schemeful-same-site?label=master&amp;label=experimental&amp;aligned&amp;q=schemeful">Safari</a> never implemented it.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site#same-site">Sec-Fetch-Site</a> (and the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#sites">HTML and Fetch specifications</a> in general) apply the schemeful definition (HTTP ≠ HTTPS).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a>, if possible, is a potential mitigation for HTTP→HTTPS issues.</p>
<h2 id="countermeasures">Countermeasures</h2>
<p>There are a number of potential countermeasures to CSRF, some of which have been available only for a few years.</p>
<h3 id="double-submit-or-synchronized-tokens">Double submit or synchronized tokens</h3>
<p>The “classic” countermeasure is a CSRF <em>token</em>, a large random value submitted in the request (e.g. as a hidden <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>) and compared against a value stored in a cookie (<em>double-submit</em>) or in a stateful server-side session (<em>synchronized tokens</em>).</p>
<p>Normally, double-submit is not a same-origin countermeasure, because same-site origins <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-20#name-weak-integrity">can set cookies on each other</a> by “cookie tossing”. This can be mitigated with the <code>__Host-</code> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-20#name-the-__host-prefix">cookie prefix</a>, or by binding the token to the session/user with signed metadata. The former makes it impossible for the attacker to set the cookie, the latter ensures the attacker doesn’t know a valid value to set it to.</p>
<p>Note that signing the cookies or tokens is unnecessary and ineffectual, unless it is binding the token to a user: an attacker that’s cookie tossing can otherwise obtain a valid signed pair by logging into the website themselves and then use that for the attack.</p>
<p>This countermeasure turns a cross-origin forgery problem into a cross-origin leak problem: if the attacker can obtain a token from a cross-origin response, it can forge a valid request.</p>
<p>The token in the HTML body should be masked as a countermeasure against the <a href="https://www.breachattack.com/">BREACH compression attack</a>.</p>
<p>The primary issue with CSRF tokens is that they require developers to instrument all their forms and other POST requests.</p>

<p>Browsers send the source of a request in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin">Origin</a> header, so CSRF can be mitigated by rejecting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP">non-safe</a> requests from other origins.</p>
<p>The main issue is knowing the application’s own origin. One option obviously is asking the developer to configure it, but that’s friction and might not always be easy (such as for open source projects and proxied setups).</p>
<p>The closest readily available approximation of the application’s own origin is the Host header. This has two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>it may be different from the browser origin if a reverse proxy is involved;</li>
<li>it does not include the scheme, so there is no way to know if an <code>http://</code> Origin is a cross-origin HTTP→HTTPS request or a same-origin HTTP request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some older (pre-2020) browsers <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin#browser_compatibility">didn’t send the Origin header for POST requests</a>.</p>
<p>The value can be <code>null</code> in a variety of cases, such as due to <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer</code> or following cross-origin redirects. <code>null</code> must be treated as an indication of a cross-origin request.</p>
<p>Some privacy extensions remove the Origin header instead of setting it to <code>null</code>. This should be considered a security vulnerability introduced by the extension, since it removes any reliable indication of a browser cross-origin request.</p>
<h3 id="samesite-cookies">SameSite cookies</h3>
<p>If authentication cookies are <em>explicitly</em> set with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value">SameSite</a> attribute Lax or Strict, they will not be sent with non-safe cross-site requests.</p>
<p>This is, by design, not a cross-origin protection, and it can’t be fixed with the <code>__Host-</code> prefix (or Secure attribute), since that’s about who can set and read cookies, not about where the requests originate. (This difference is reflected in <a href="https://github.com/sbingler/schemeful-same-site#how-do-schemeful-same-site-and-scheme-bound-cookies-differ">the difference between Scheme-Bound Cookies and Schemeful Same-Site</a>.) The risk of same-site HTTP origins is still present, too, in browsers that don’t implement Schemeful Same-Site.</p>
<p>Note that the rollout of SameSite Lax by default has mostly failed due to widespread breakage, especially in SSO flows.  Some browsers now default to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-20#name-top-level-requests-with-uns">Lax-allowing-unsafe</a>, while others default(ed) to None for the first two minutes after the cookie was set. These defaults are not effective CSRF countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="non-simple-requests">Non-simple requests</h3>
<p>Although CORS is not designed to protect against CSRF, “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests">non-simple requests</a>” which for example set headers that a simple <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> couldn’t set are preflighted by an OPTIONS request.</p>
<p>An application could choose to allow only non-simple requests, but that is fairly limiting precisely because “simple requests” includes all the ones produced by <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-metadata">Fetch metadata</h3>
<p>To provide a reliable cross-origin signal to websites, browsers introduced <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata">Fetch metadata</a>. In particular, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site">Sec-Fetch-Site</a> header is set to <code>cross-site</code>/<code>same-site</code>/<code>same-origin</code>/<code>none</code><sup id="fnref:none"><a href="#fn:none">3</a></sup> and is now <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata#how_to_use_fetch_metadata_to_protect_against_cross-origin_attacks">the recommended method to mitigate CSRF</a>.</p>
<p>The header has been available in all major browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_sec-fetch-site">since 2023</a> (and earlier for all but Safari).</p>
<p>One limitation is that it is only sent to “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy">trustworthy origins</a>”, i.e. HTTPS and localhost. Note that this is not about the scheme of the initiator origin, but of the target, so it is sent for HTTP→HTTPS requests, but not for HTTPS→HTTP or HTTP→HTTP requests (except localhost→localhost). If Sec-Fetch-Site is missing, a lax fallback on Origin=Host is an option, since HTTP→HTTPS requests are not a concern.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-against-csrf-in-2025">Protecting against CSRF in 2025</h2>
<p>In summary, to protect against CSRF applications (or, rather, libraries and frameworks) should reject cross-origin non-safe browser requests. The most developer-friendly way to do so is using primarily Fetch metadata, which requires no extra instrumentation or configuration.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow all GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS requests.</p>
<p>These are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP">safe</a> methods, and are assumed not to change state at various layers of the stack already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Origin header matches an allow-list of trusted origins, allow the request.</p>
<p>Trusted origins should be configured as full origins (e.g. <code>https://example.com</code>) and compared by simple equality with the header value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Sec-Fetch-Site header is present:</p>
<ol>
<li>if its value is <code>same-origin</code> or <code>none</code>, allow the request;</li>
<li>otherwise, reject the request.</li>
</ol>
<p>This secures all major up-to-date browsers for sites hosted on trustworthy (HTTPS or localhost) origins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If neither the Sec-Fetch-Site nor the Origin headers are present, allow the request.</p>
<p>These requests are not from (post-2020) browsers, and can’t be affected by CSRF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Origin header’s host (including the port) matches the Host header, allow the request, otherwise reject it.</p>
<p>This is either a request to an HTTP origin, or by an out-of-date browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The only false positives (unnecessary blocking) of this algorithm are requests to non-trustworthy (plain HTTP) origins that go through a reverse proxy that changes the Host header. That edge case can be worked around by adding the origin to the allow-list.</p>
<p>There are no false negatives in modern browsers, but pre-2023 browsers will be vulnerable to HTTP→HTTPS requests, because the Origin fallback is scheme-agnostic. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HSTS</a> can be used to mitigate that (in post-2020 browsers), but note that out-of-date browsers are likely to have more pressing security issues.</p>
<p>Finally, there should be a tightly scoped bypass mechanism for e.g. SSO edge cases, with the appropriate <a href="https://saferack.com/posts/guide-hazmat-placards-un-numbers/">safety placards</a>. For example, it could be route-based, or require manual tagging of requests before the CSRF middleware.</p>
<p>Go 1.25 introduces a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http@go1.25rc2#CrossOriginProtection">CrossOriginProtection middleware</a> in <code>net/http</code> which <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.25rc2:src/net/http/csrf.go;l=122">implements this algorithm</a>. (This research was done as background for that proposal.)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-7028e4af784c74473cf3">
  <p>In this day and age of cybersecurity professionals crying out for roles, we're still seeing companies complain that there is a skills shortage and a lack of talent. A quick scan through your LinkedIn feed will show this is absolute nonsense: there is a mass of experienced, capable talent out there looking for roles. So what's the problem?</p><p>There are two main areas where companies are sabotaging the hiring pipeline:</p><p>1) Companies that are abusing the job boards and hiring process.</p><p>We've all seen these: job adverts asking for the moon on a stick with low pay, so the company can abuse the visa process. Companies lying to their employees about hiring more team members, when they have no intention of cutting into profit margins by actually responding to applications. And companies that are just data mining applicants, stupidly believing that a ghosted candidate is going to magically want to do business with them once they actually have a live role.</p><p>2) Companies that are just completely crap at actually hiring.</p><p>This is where I'm going to be looking at in this article. Despite years of being told (and shown!) how to change their hiring practices to land good cybersecurity talent, companies still persist in the same, broken, unworkable approaches.</p><p>So, for our Case Study of Crapness, please step forward: Canonical.</p><p>Canonical has been advertising for a Head of Security Operations role for almost a year now. You'd think the darling of the Linux world would have an endless stream of geeks eager to work for them. And yet: the role is still being advertised. Let's have a look at why they haven't been able to fill it.</p><h2>Red Flags from the Job Posting</h2><p>The biggest initial red flag is shitting up the job boards (LinkedIn and elsewhere) by posting <strong>exactly the same role</strong> for every single European country <strong>and</strong> US state they are hiring from. Sometimes, for multiple cities within a country (advertising a fully remote role for both Milan and Turin is my favourite here). Any normal person would say "EU-wide, remote role". But no, Canonical have clogged up everyone's searches with their spam.</p>
</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1755072229091_18750">
  <p>Head over to their LinkedIn homepage at https://www.linkedin.com/company/canonical/jobs/ and see for yourself.</p><p>Any serious candidate is going to have some finely tuned saved job searches, which are now rendered useless because Canonical has spammed 20 or so roles that get picked up by your search parameters. </p><p>"It makes the role more visible." "It increases the chances of a candidate seeing the role."</p><p>Does it, bollocks. What it does do is make it clear that Canonical doesn't care about anyone else's time or resources, and that their hiring team doesn't understand how to actually advertise a role: just spam away, the more postings the better!</p><p>Digging into the actual job advert, we can see a couple of other obvious red flags. The spelling mistakes are one: unforgivable in this age of AI tools plugged into literally everything. </p><p>"Experience with security posture management of corporate endpoitns" isn't just in the hundreds of spammed job postings - it's also in the role description on Canonical's actual recruiting website as well. Excellent job.</p><p>Also, there is no target salary or salary range. This is a red flag for a couple of reasons:</p><p>- It sends a message that the actual compensation is going to be rubbish.</p><p>- It sends a message (combined with the evidence from the advert spamming) that the hiring company will be paying different levels of compensation based on where the applicant lives.</p><p>That last one is particularly inexcusable. We call it a 'compensation package' for a reason: the employer is compensating the employee for using their expertise, time, and energy to make the employer money. It has nothing to do with the CoL where you live, and everything to do with how much the company values you in that role.</p><p>If my cost of living is 40% less in Italy than it is in London, and therefore I get paid 40% less, does that mean it's OK for me to give 40% less effort? If a company thinks they can pay different rates for the same skillset if you live in Milan instead of Frankfurt, they are demonstrating that they do not value the employee. They are a replaceable cog in their machine with a price tag. </p><p>Finally, there are some massive red flags in the actual requirements for the role. I'm going to call out one specifically:</p><p><em>An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university</em></p><p>What the hell is this? There is so little relevance from what was studied at school at 16 years old to a Head of Security Operations role that we'd have to invent entire new fields of science just to measure it. What utter rubbish. </p><p>I've written at length in other articles about how demanding a degree for cybersecurity roles is not just irrelevant, but it blocks some of the best candidates. But high school? Who got paid to write that? And why aren't they now unemployed?</p><h2>Initial Application Process</h2><p>Any company that uses Workday needs to fire their entire HR department. We all know why, we've all had to deal with it:</p><p>- "Upload your CV"</p><p>- "Now manually fill in 3-4 pages of *exactly the same information*, because we don't value your time"</p><p>- "Now enter some demographic information which has zero relevance to your application but gives us some stats so we can feel good about ourselves."</p><p>Canonical's application process is, unbelievably, even more shitty than this. Much like Satan himself, I have some genuine respect for anyone who can come up with something worse than Workday. If you head to their application page on Greenhouse.io, there's the usual "Upload your CV", "Give us your basic details" stuff.</p><p>Then we head off the rails of reasonableness and into the realm of madness.</p><p>Let's be clear: this is an initial application. Any reasonable candidate expects that this is the filtering process: what are we asking for, what's on your CV, does it match - yes, line up an interview.</p><p>The interview is where the actual questioning to dig into a candidate's knowledge happens, and (unless your company is crap at hiring) should be conducted by the line manager, or at the very least, a subject matter expert.</p><p>But no. Canonical is asking in-depth questions about experience that belong firmly in an interview.</p>
</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1755072229091_20697">
  <p>No. These are questions that have nuance and context that cannot be answered in a character-limited text field, and absolutely should not be reviewed by a hiring manager or member of the HR team. </p><p>Any actual competent candidate would look at nonsense like that, say "Stuff that, I'm out" and close their browser window. This is an absolutely cretinous thing to be asking at this stage of an application (the application! Not even an interview!).</p><p>Given this is a "Head of" role, reporting to senior leadership, anyone in that role with a pulse and at least two brain cells to rub together would understand how self-defeating asking these sorts of questions <em>in an application</em> is.</p><p>But it gets worse.</p><p>I was scathing about their requirement in the job advert for "an exceptional academic track record from both high school and university". Here, Canonical is doubling down on their idiocy.</p>
</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1755072229091_22108">
  <p>None of this - none of it at all - is remotely relevant to the actual day-to-day job of a Head of Security Operations. Again, these are questions that cannot be answered appropriately in character-capped text fields. But beyond that, these are questions that should not - ever - be used to screen applicants. Applicants for a role where these requirements are not even remotely relevant.</p><h2>How Their Interview Process Works</h2><p>Having waded through this nonsense, your application finally gets sent. As with many companies, Canonical sends a little follow-up email to let you know what the actual interview process will look like.</p><p>If the application process didn't put you off, then this will be the final nail in the coffin for your application.</p><p>First off, your application does not get reviewed by someone from HR, or a hiring manager, or even the line manager for the role. No.</p><p>"A senior team of managers and leaders from across the company form a virtual team of hiring leads to shepherd every application through our process. They are not recruiters"</p><p>Your application is going to be reviewed by a random group of people who have <strong>nothing whatsoever to do with the role</strong>, who will not have relevant expertise to judge what a "good" application looks like, and who are clearly hiring for clique-fit rather than competency.</p><p>Huge red flag: this hiring-by-committee approach never, ever approves of top candidates. Because a company where someone from a random department gets to review your application is a company that has mediocre chair warmers in senior positions, who want to ensure there are no pockets of excellence in the business that could show them up. Good leaders hire people better than themselves: committees hire mediocrity to cover their arses.</p><p>The biggest fail, though, the absolute discriminatory process that guarantees neuro-divergent or anyone with mental health issues will be weeded out, is the use of aptitude and personality tests.</p><p>"Our interview process starts with a written interview, which will be reviewed in an anonymized queue to reduce bias, and a standardised assessment of aptitude and personality, to provide a more objective initial application review."</p><p>Aptitude and personality tests have been snake oil since they were introduced, and they remain an incredibly stupid and ineffectual way to assess a candidate. There have been decades of research explaining why they suck, and why the people who use them are idiots. Don't just take my word for it, have a look through the detailed investigation the Harvard Business Review did on it - *over a decade ago*. https://archive.ph/p2Frg</p><p>The other major problem with aptitude and personality tests is that they also immediately disqualify anyone who is neuro-divergent, who are exactly the sort of people any sensible organisation would want to attract to a cybersecurity role. This is not just sabotage of the hiring process: this is demonstrable ignorance and incompetence from everyone involved in the hiring process.  </p><p>If you thought Canonical's statement on Diversity https://canonical.com/careers/company-culture/diversity was just another instance of cloying, corporate bullshit - well, now you have the evidence. </p><p>In this day and age of increasingly sophisticated phishing and fake hiring scams, it's also good to see that Canonical will openly enable scamming of applications by having a mish-mash of external companies involved:</p><p>"As you move through the process you will receive a series of communications from us. These will come directly from our Applicant Tracking System (Greenhouse), our partner providers (Thomas International and Devskiller) or as an email from your hiring lead here."</p><p>Why? Why would you do this? The only communication applicants should be getting is from the nominated HR person or hiring manager who is managing your application. Random emails from three external parties or a random employee are just begging for some social engineering. This is doubly obnoxious when you're trying to hire for a security role.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>You may think I'm being overly harsh to Canonical, and that I'm making some indefensible judgements. And you could be right - so don't take my word for it.</p><p>Something everyone should be doing before even thinking about applying for a role is heading over to Glassdoor, and looking at two things:</p><p>- what applicants are saying about the hiring process</p><p>- what employees are saying about the company</p><p>Glassdoor is a good barometer for company health because essentially the reviews break things down into three main areas:</p><p>- There's not enough information</p><p>If there are only 1 or 2 reviews (which we'd expect for a smaller company or a startup), it's hard to get a feel for the company. Someone might have been fired for taking a dump in the microwave, and left a scathing review. Or there might only be 12 employees, and only 1 person could be bothered to write up their thoughts.</p><p>- There are several reviews, and they're generally positive</p><p>Everyone likes to whine and complain, so there will always be some negative sentiment, but in general, what we want to see is several balanced reviews, with some positives and negatives, and some good reasons why. Companies with this sort of profile on Glassdoor are generally going to be OK, with nothing more serious than the usual everyday corporate nonsense we all have to endure.</p><p>- There are a load of very negative reviews, and a load of hugely positive reviews</p><p>These are the toxic hell-holes. The negative reviews come from the long stream of dissatisfied employees who are venting their frustrations at a toxic workplace. The hugely positive reviews come from the social media, marketing, and HR teams desperately trying to hide the fact that you'll be working for Satan, and spending your days kicking puppies.</p><p>Have a read through the reviews of working at Canonical here: https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Canonical-Reviews-E230560.htm</p><p>They are pretty damning, highlighting a clique-y and out-of-touch leadership team with a toxic workplace. There's a clear and consistent message about the company culture and the quality of the leadership team and management, and equally clearly, this feedback is being ignored. The reviews touch on many of the things that I've highlighted just by digging through the application process.</p><h2>It doesn't have to be this way</h2><p>Companies like Canonical are continuing to sabotage their efforts to hire security talent. The galling thing is that none of this is difficult to solve, and none of the solutions are cryptic, or secret esoteric knowledge senior cybersecurity people have been jealously guarding. We've all been talking about this for years.</p><p>- Stop asking for degrees. The only, ever, acceptable time to ask for a degree is for a senior position, where asking for "a cybersecurity degree, or equivalent professional experience" is the only right way to do it.</p><p>- Ask for certificates where they are relevant. CISSP for an entry-level analyst role? Do one. CISSP for a senior architect with 8-10 years of experience? Absolutely.</p><p>- The people responsible for managing the position should write the job description. They know what skills and experience matter.</p><p>- Keep the hiring pipeline short and simple. 3 interviews, max, run by people who will be managing the position and understand what is involved. Don't let people unrelated to managing the role do anything with the JD apart from adding some boilerplate fluff about how amazing your company is to work for.</p><p>- Interview candidates properly. None of this "yes/no" nonsense and questions that can easily be Googled. Use case studies, give the candidate a chance to show off their strengths, and have a conversation rather than an interrogation. And, above all, expect difficult questions from candidates, and actually answer them.</p><h2>In Closing</h2><p>No surprise why this role is unfilled almost a year after I first saw it posted. Normally, I'd look at a car crash like this and think "This is a company that isn't just not serious about hiring - they actively hate the sort of people who would apply."</p><p>But in reality, not only is this masterclass in how not to advertise a role, but this is an example of the current thinking and approach of too many companies. Companies that don't respect applicants, let alone their employees. Companies that don't value people's time. Companies that don't value the unique skills and expertise their employees bring to the table.</p><p>Ultimately, companies that are going to be in the news in the coming years for inexcusable and wholly avoidable security breaches.</p><p>I have nothing personally against Canonical - Ubuntu is mediocre but usable, they have had some major privacy slips, and Mark Shuttleworth is a dick - but their whole approach is a perfect example of everything that is currently wrong with hiring security talent.</p><p>I can only hope that sometime soon, as the breaches pile up, the idiots running companies like this will be held accountable.</p><p>Until then, have fun in your job hunting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>I didn’t <em>plan</em> to write this post. I was <em>going</em> to blog about <a target="_blank" href="https://biilmann.blog/articles/introducing-ax/">Agent Experience</a>, the new concept coined by my former boss, Matt Biilmann, CEO of Netlify (I think we are on great terms so I can write this haha). I opened up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify.com</a> to link it and took a huge doubletake.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738963425973/588336d4-9497-4973-82fe-1bfee230d3a8.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>See anything unusual?</p>
<p>Of course you don’t, you don’t watch Netlify like it’s your second biggest shareholding. Here, let me take you back a whole ass 30 days to the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/https://www.netlify.com/">start of 2025</a>:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738963562124/5933e970-7c6b-441d-acd2-39224a60c952.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>What’s different today?</p>
<p>No more Gartner banner. No more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/introducing-the-netlify-composable-web-platform/">Composable Web Platform</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/guide-to-composable-architecture/modern-enterprise-stack/rise-of-composable-architecture/">Composable Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Hmm. Weird. I remember being told Composable was the future. Let’s look over at Contentful, that other big presumptive winner of the Jamstack/Composable era.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738964650025/ef0e33b9-588c-4353-9b74-c521e460fc7e.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p><strong>OH.</strong></p>
<h2 id="heading-how-gartner-grift-works">How Gartner Grift Works</h2>
<p>The basic business model of Gartner is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>make up term as The Future</p>
</li>
<li><p>put a lot of marketing firepower behind it</p>
</li>
<li><p>make people pay to list on the magic quadrants</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This works only as long as CTOs, the dream ICPs of everyone trying to sell into the enterprise, put any credibility into the magic quadrants. Five years ago some “Distinguished VP Analyst” (they are all Distinguished, wow) at Gartner decided Composable was the future:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738965081604/b492bffc-a1a1-4948-b68f-cfb991f2119b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>and so the all the B2B SaaS/IaaS startups with no independent category creation traction suddenly became Composable:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738966343145/685db609-3af8-4b7a-908d-89d3bcb4b812.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>In order to capture the SEO keyword and become Leaders in that Quadrant. This of course feeds on itself - if your major competitor puts Composable all over their landing page, you are going to feel pressure to have it. It’s like that parable about 37 different brands of cereal and putting out a new cereal that is “asbestos-free” on it. Of course the other cereals are asbestos free, but you’re going to <em>wonder if they aren’t</em>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-accelerating-misses">Accelerating Misses</h2>
<p>I am no stranger to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer">category creation</a> and when done right I think it can be a very good harmonizing force for an industry (harmony being the best counter to entropy, which no one wants). But for a Gartner category to be adopted en masse in 2022 and be abandoned by 2024 is a very alarming miss — and it is not the only one.</p>
<p>More recently Databricks has, via Berkeley, tried to make “<a target="_blank" href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/">Compound AI Systems</a>” a thing:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738966902924/1fe8a664-b39a-45e3-94cc-2e726b825b6d.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>and though it is early days, I have already seen a very short wave of startups speedrun the cycle of wholesale adopting and then wholesale abandoning it. Gartner of course has its own term for it — <a target="_blank" href="https://opentools.ai/news/gartners-2024-ai-hype-cycle-turns-heads-towards-composite-ai">Composite AI</a> — and as far as I can tell it is going to flop — no real/serious AI player has even heard of it. In an age where we have like counts and subscriber counts and view counts for every itemized idea, the Gartner credibility machine no longer transfers and the idea needs to stand on its own merits.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738967279364/f2b27a6d-228b-4bc1-8b99-cd743412018b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, Gartner often gives this treatment to ideas it didn’t come up with — the first time it wrote about AI Engineering, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/swyx/status/1826296659317563581">having missed its entire first year</a>, it placed it at the peak of its famous hype cycle, despite multiple foundation model companies getting $100m seed rounds with no model and no product.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVhPFzbasAAVFV6?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image"></p>
<p>The most cited authorities in AI are not Gartner. The best claim to “new Gartner” now is Artificial Analysis (which <a target="_blank" href="https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-1162024-artificialanalysis-a-new-modelhost/">I first called out a year ago</a> and Gartner will probably acknowledge 5 years from now), which backs their analysis with live data because their founders and analysts are themselves engineers, not BA History majors given “Distinguished VP Analyst” titles. When the DeepSeek model dropped last month, Gartner had nothing to say, whereas Artificial Analysis was first out with comprehensive production tests and costing and the data/charts to back it up:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738967841107/519f65de-f826-41b0-be0a-182047b4bd0b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Boomer C-Suites who fancy themselves Enterprise Tech executives and are happy to throw humans at any problem were happy buying off the Gartner catalog and then hitting the golf course. Today, millennial CEOs and CTOs get their analysis and news sources from X, /r/LocalLlama, the All In Podcast, Semianalysis Substacks, any number of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swyxio/ai-notes/blob/main/Resources/Good%20AI%20Podcasts%20and%20Newsletters.md">YouTubes and Podcasts</a>. Meanwhile, Gartner’s home page is just an incessant amount of increasingly irrelevant Gartner Says:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738968085410/d96541db-3a28-4def-a3b6-820c41b99464.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Gideon Gartner started Gartner Inc in 1979 and it once provided an incredible important service when trusted C-suite buyer information was scarce and <a target="_blank" href="https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-openai-takes-on-geminis-deep-research/">Deep Research</a> wasn’t available for $200/month. Its greatest hits were the <a target="_blank" href="https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Gartner_Magic_Quadrant">Magic Quadrant</a> in 1994 and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner">Hype Cycle</a> in 1995. 30 years later, these simple, conveniently subjective and pay to play mental frameworks are showing their age. My college classmates and peers are now the next generation of leaders at {the big companies, VCs, and startups that you know} and none of them put any stock by Gartner.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when you can no longer manufacture credibility for the credulous?</strong></p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:41:55 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.nginx.org/blog/native-support-for-acme-protocol">https://blog.nginx.org/blog/native-support-for-acme-protocol</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44889941">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We are very excited to announce the preview release of <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx-acme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACME support in NGINX</a>. The implementation introduces a new module <code>ngx_http_acme_module</code> that provides built-in directives for requesting, installing, and renewing certificates directly from NGINX configuration. The ACME support leverages our <a href="https://github.com/nginx/ngx-rust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NGINX-Rust SDK</a>&nbsp;and is available as a Rust-based dynamic module&nbsp;for both NGINX Open Source users as well as enterprise NGINX One customers using NGINX Plus.</p>



<p>NGINX’s native support for ACME brings a variety&nbsp;of benefits that simplify and enhance the overall SSL/TLS certificate management process. Being able to <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_acme_module.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_acme_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">configure ACME directly using NGINX directives</a> drastically reduces manual errors and eliminates much of the ongoing overhead traditionally associated with managing SSL/TLS certificates. It also reduces reliance on external tools like Certbot, creating a more secure and streamlined workflow with fewer vulnerabilities and a smaller attack surface. Additionally, unlike existing external tools which can be prone to platform-specific limitations, a native implementation ensures greater portability and platform independence, making it a versatile and reliable solution for modern, evolving web infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is ACME?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACME protocol</a> (Automated Certificate Management Environment) is a communications protocol primarily designed to automate the process of issuing, validating, renewing, and revoking digital security certificates (e.g., SSL/TLS certificates). It allows clients to interact with a Certificate Authority (CA) without requiring manual intervention, simplifying the deployment of secure websites and other services that rely on HTTPS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ACME protocol was initially developed by the <strong>Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)</strong> as part of the <strong>Let’s Encrypt</strong> initiative in late 2015, offering free, automated SSL/TLS certificates. Before ACME, obtaining TLS certificates was often a manual, costly, and error-prone process. ACME revolutionized this by providing open-source, automated workflows for certificate management.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACMEv2</a> is an updated version of the original ACME protocol. It added support for new challenges, expanded authentication methods, wildcard certificates, and other enhancements to improve flexibility and security.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NGINX ACME Workflow&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The ACME workflow with NGINX can be broken into 4 steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Setting up the ACME Server</li>



<li>Allocating Shared Memory</li>



<li>Configuring Challenges</li>



<li>Certificate Issue and Renewal</li>
</ol>



<h3>Setting up the ACME Server</h3>



<p>To enable ACME functionality, the first (and the only mandatory step) is to specify the directory URL of the ACME server.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additional information regarding how to contact the client in case of certificate-related issues or where to store module data can also be provided, as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code><mark>acme_issuer</mark> <strong>letsencrypt</strong> {&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>uri</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # <mark>contact</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp; admin@example.test;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>state_path</mark>&nbsp; /var/cache/nginx/acme-letsencrypt;&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accept_terms_of_service;&nbsp;
}</code></pre>



<h3>Allocating Shared Memory&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The implementation also provides an optional directive <code>acme_shared_zone</code> to store certificates, private keys, and challenge data for all the configured certificate issuers. The zone has a default size of 256K, which can be increased as required.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code><mark>acme_shared_zone</mark> zone=acme_shared:1M;&nbsp;</code></pre>



<h3>Configuring Challenges&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The current preview implementation supports HTTP-01 challenges to verify the client’s domain ownership. It requires defining a listener on port 80 in the nginx configuration to process ACME HTTP-01 challenges:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code><mark>server</mark> {&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # listener on port 80 is required to process ACME HTTP-01 challenges&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>listen</mark> <mark>80</mark>;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>location</mark> / {&nbsp;

        #Serve a basic 404 response while listening for challenges&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark> return 404</mark>;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }&nbsp;
}</code></pre>



<p>Support for other challenges (TLS-ALPN, DNS -01) is planned in <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx-acme/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Certificate Issuance and Renewal</h3>



<p>Use the <code>acme_certificate</code> directive in the respective server block in your NGINX configuration to automate the issuance/renewal of TLS certificates. The directive requires the list of identifiers(domains) for which the certificates need to be dynamically issued. The list of identifiers can be defined using the <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>server_name</code></a> directive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The snippet below shows how to configure the server block for issuing/renewing SSL certificate for “.example.domain” domain using the previously defined <code>letsencrypt</code> ACME certificate issuer.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code><mark>server</mark> {&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>listen</mark> 443 ssl;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>server_name</mark>&nbsp; .example.com;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><mark>acme_certificate</mark> letsencrypt;&nbsp;</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>ssl_certificate</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $acme_certificate;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>ssl_certificate_key</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp; $acme_certificate_key;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <mark>ssl_certificate_cache</mark> max=2;&nbsp;
}</code></pre>



<p>Note that not all values accepted by <code><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server_name</a></code> directive are valid identifiers. Wildcards are not supported in this initial implementation. Regular expressions are not supported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Use the <code>$acme_certificate</code> and <code>$acme_certificate_key</code> variables in the module to pass the SSL certificate and key information for the associated domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why It All Matters?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The rapid rise of HTTPS adoption globally has been driven largely by ACME protocol, making secure web connections a standard expectation. ACME modernizes the way TLS/SSL certificates are issued, renewed, and managed by automating the entire process, eliminating manual effort and reducing costs associated with certificate lifecycle management. Beyond the web, the growth of IoT devices and edge computing positions ACME to play a critical role in automating security for APIs, devices, and edge compute infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NGINX’s native support for ACME underscores the protocol’s importance for the future of web security, automation, and scalability. ACME is expected to remain the backbone of certificate automation across the internet and beyond for foreseeable future. With security becoming a baseline for web standards, we’ll continue seeing requirements for evolving deployment models and security needs, pushing improvements in ACME.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, we are committed to evolving our implementation to align with the needs of our users and customers, meeting them where they are today and building capabilities for where they are headed in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's no secret that much of social media has become profoundly dysfunctional. Rather than bringing us together into one utopian public square and fostering a healthy exchange of ideas, these platforms too often create filter bubbles or echo chambers. A small number of high-profile users garner the lion's share of attention and influence, and the algorithms designed to maximize engagement end up merely amplifying outrage and conflict, ensuring the dominance of the loudest and most extreme users—thereby increasing polarization even more.</p>
<p>Numerous platform-level intervention strategies have been proposed to combat these issues, but according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03385">a preprint</a> posted to the physics arXiv, none of them are likely to be effective. And it's not the fault of much-hated algorithms, non-chronological feeds, or our human proclivity for seeking out negativity. Rather, the dynamics that give rise to all those negative outcomes are structurally embedded in the very architecture of social media. So we're probably doomed to endless toxic feedback loops unless someone hits upon a brilliant fundamental redesign that manages to change those dynamics.</p>
<p>Co-authors Petter Törnberg and Maik Larooij of the University of Amsterdam wanted to learn more about the mechanisms that give rise to the worst aspects of social media: the partisan echo chambers, the concentration of influence among a small group of elite users (attention inequality), and the amplification of the most extreme divisive voices. So they combined standard agent-based modeling with large language models (LLMs), essentially creating little AI personas to simulate online social media behavior. "What we found is that we didn't need to put any algorithms in, we didn't need to massage the model," Törnberg told Ars. "It just came out of the baseline model, all of these dynamics."</p>
<p>They then tested six different intervention strategies social scientists have been proposed to counter those effects: switching to chronological or randomized feeds; inverting engagement-optimization algorithms to reduce the visibility of highly reposted sensational content; boosting the diversity of viewpoints to broaden users' exposure to opposing political views; using "bridging algorithms" to elevate content that fosters mutual understanding rather than emotional provocation; hiding social statistics like reposts and follower accounts to reduce social influence cues; and removing biographies to limit exposure to identity-based signals.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The results were far from encouraging. Only some interventions showed modest improvements. None were able to fully disrupt the fundamental mechanisms producing the dysfunctional effects. In fact, some interventions actually made the problems worse. For example, chronological ordering had the strongest effect on reducing attention inequality, but there was a tradeoff: It also intensified the amplification of extreme content. Bridging algorithms significantly weakened the link between partisanship and engagement and modestly improved viewpoint diversity, but it also increased attention inequality. Boosting viewpoint diversity had no significant impact at all.</p>
<p>So is there any hope of finding effective intervention strategies to combat these problematic aspects of social media? Or should we nuke our social media accounts altogether and go live in caves? Ars caught up with Törnberg for an extended conversation to learn more about these troubling findings.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: What drove you to conduct this study?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: For the last 20 years or so, there has been a ton of research on how social media is reshaping politics in different ways, almost always using observational data. But in the last few years, there's been a growing appetite for moving beyond just complaining about these things and trying to see how we can be a bit more constructive. Can we identify how to improve social media and create online spaces that are actually living up to those early promises of providing a public sphere where we can deliberate and debate politics in a constructive way?</p>
<p>The problem with using observational data is that it's very hard to test counterfactuals to implement alternative solutions. So one kind of method that has existed in the field is agent-based simulations and social simulations: create a computer model of the system and then run experiments on that and test counterfactuals. It is useful for looking at the structure and emergence of network dynamics.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But at the same time, those models represent agents as simple rule followers or optimizers, and that doesn't capture anything of the cultural world or politics or human behavior. I've always been of the controversial opinion that those things actually matter, &nbsp;especially for online politics. We need to study both the structural dynamics of network formations and the patterns of cultural interaction.</p>


<p><strong>Ars Technica: So you developed this hybrid model that combines LLMs with agent-based modeling.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: That's the solution that we find to move beyond the problems of conventional agent-based modeling. Instead of having this simple rule of followers or optimizers, we use AI or LLMs. It's not a perfect solution—there's all kind of biases and limitations—but it does represent a step forward compared to a list of if/then rules. It does have something more of capturing human behavior in a more plausible way. We give them personas that we get from the American National Election Survey, which has very detailed questions about US voters and their hobbies and preferences. And then we turn that into a textual persona—your name is Bob, you're from Massachusetts, and you like fishing—just to give them something to talk about and a little bit richer representation.</p>
<p>And then they see the random news of the day, and they can choose to post the news, read posts from other users, repost them, or they can choose to follow users. If they choose to follow users, they look at their previous messages, look at their user profile.</p>
<p>Our idea was to start with the minimal bare-bones model and then add things to try to see if we could reproduce these problematic consequences. But to our surprise, we actually didn't have to add anything because these problematic consequences just came out of the bare bones model. This went against our expectations and also what I think the literature would say.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><strong>Ars Technica: I'm skeptical of AI in general, particularly in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/producing-more-but-understanding-less-the-risks-of-ai-for-scientific-research/">a research context</a>, but there are very specific instances where it can be extremely useful. This strikes me as one of them, largely because your basic model proved to be so robust. You got the same dynamics without introducing anything extra.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: Yes. It's been a big conversation in social science over the last two years or so. There's a ton of interest in using LLMs for social simulation, but no one has really figured out for what or how it's going to be helpful, or how we're going to get past these problems of validity and so on. The kind of approach that we take in this paper is building on a tradition of complex systems thinking. We imagine very simple models of the human world and try to capture very fundamental mechanisms. It's not really aiming to be realistic or a precise, complete model of human behavior.</p>
<p>I've been one of the more critical people of this method, to be honest. At the same time, it's hard to imagine any other way of studying these kinds of dynamics where we have cultural and structural aspects feeding back into each other. But I still have to take the findings with a grain of salt and realize that these are models, and they're capturing a kind of hypothetical world—a spherical cow in a vacuum. We can't predict what someone is going to have for lunch on Tuesday, but we can capture broader mechanisms, and we can see how robust those mechanisms are. We can see whether they're stable, unstable, which conditions they emerge in, and the general boundaries. And in this case, we found a mechanism that seems to be very robust, unfortunately.</p>


<p><strong>Ars Technica: The dream was that social media would help revitalize the public sphere and support the kind of constructive political dialogue that your paper deems "vital to democratic life." That largely hasn't happened. What are the primary negative unexpected consequences that have emerged from social media platforms?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: First, you have echo chambers or filter bubbles. The risk of broad agreement is that if you want to have a functioning political conversation, functioning deliberation, you do need to do that across the partisan divide. If you're only having a conversation with people who already agree with each other, that's not enough. There's debate on how widespread echo chambers are online, but it is quite established that there are a lot of spaces online that aren't very constructive because there's only people from one political side. So that's one ingredient that you need. You need to have a diversity of opinion, a diversity of perspective.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The second one is that the deliberation needs to be among equals; people need to have more or less the same influence in the conversation. It can't be completely controlled by a small, elite group of users. This is also something that people have pointed to on social media: It has a tendency of creating these influencers because attention attracts attention. And then you have a breakdown of conversation among equals.</p>
<p>The final one is what I call (based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Social-Media-Prism-Polarizing/dp/0691203423">Chris Bail's book</a>) the social media prism. The more extreme users tend to get more attention online. This is often discussed in relation to engagement algorithms, which tend to identify the type of content that most upsets us and then boost that content. I refer to it as a "trigger bubble" instead of the filter bubble. They're trying to trigger us as a way of making us engage more so they can extract our data and keep our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: Your conclusion is that there's something within the structural dynamics of the network itself that's to blame—something fundamental to the construction of social networks that makes these extremely difficult problems to solve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: Exactly. It comes from the fact that we're using these AI models to capture a richer representation of human behavior, which allows us to see something that wouldn't really be possible using conventional agent-based modeling. There have been previous models looking at the growth of social networks on social media. People choose to retweet or not, and we know that action tends to be very reactive. We tend to be very emotional in that choice. And it tends to be a highly partisan and polarized type of action. You hit retweet when you see someone being angry about something, or doing something horrific, and then you share that. It's well-known that this leads to toxic, more polarized content spreading more.</p>
<p>But what we find is that it's not just that this content spreads; it also shapes the network structures that are formed. So there's feedback between the effective emotional action of choosing to retweet something and the network structure that emerges. And then in turn, you have a network structure that feeds back what content you see, resulting in a toxic network. The definition of an online social network is that you have this kind of posting, reposting, and following dynamics. It's quite fundamental to it. That alone seems to be enough to drive these negative outcomes.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><strong>Ars Technica: I was frankly surprised at the ineffectiveness of the various intervention strategies you tested. But it does seem to explain the Bluesky conundrum. Bluesky has no algorithm, for example, yet the same dynamics still seem to emerge. I think Bluesky's founders genuinely want to avoid those dysfunctional issues, but they might not succeed, based on this paper. Why are such interventions so ineffective?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: We've been discussing whether these things are due to the platforms doing evil things with algorithms or whether we as users are choosing that we want a bad environment. What we're saying is that it doesn't have to be either of those. This is often the unintended outcomes from interactions based on underlying rules. It's not necessarily because the platforms are evil; it's not necessarily because people want to be in toxic, horrible environments. It just follows from the structure that we're providing.</p>
<p>We tested six different interventions. Google has been trying to make social media less toxic and recently released a newsfeed algorithm based on the content of the text. So that's one example. We're also trying to do more subtle interventions because often you can find a certain way of nudging the system so it switches over to healthier dynamics. Some of them have moderate or slightly positive effects on one of the attributes, but then they often have negative effects on another attribute, or they have no impact whatsoever.</p>
<p>I should say also that these are very extreme interventions in the sense that, if you depended on making money on your platform, you probably don't want to implement them because it probably makes it really boring to use. It's like showing the least influential users, the least retweeted messages on the platform. Even so, it doesn't really make a difference in changing the basic outcomes. What we take from that is that the mechanism producing these problematic outcomes is really robust and hard to resolve given the basic structure of these platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: So how might one go about building a successful social network that doesn't have these problems?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: There are several directions where you could imagine going, but there's also the constraint of what is popular use. Think back to the early Internet, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ">ICQ</a>. ICQ had this feature where you could just connect to a random person. I loved it when I was a kid. I would talk to random people all over the world. I was 12 in the countryside on a small island in Sweden, and I was talking to someone from Arizona, living a different life. I don't know how successful that would be these days, the Internet having become a lot less innocent than it was.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>For instance, we can focus on the question of inequality of attention, a very well-studied and robust feature of these networks. I personally thought we would be able to address it with our interventions, but attention draws attention, and this leads to a power law distribution, where 1 percent [of users] dominates the entire conversation. We know the conditions under which those power laws emerge. This is one of the main outcomes of social network dynamics: extreme inequality of attention.</p>
<p>But in social science, we always teach that everything is a normal distribution. The move from studying the conventional social world to studying the online social world means that you're moving from these nice normal distributions to these horrible power law distributions. Those are the outcomes of having social networks where the probability of connecting to someone depends on how many previous connections they have. If we want to get rid of that, we probably have to move away from the social network model and have some kind of spatial model or group-based model that makes things a little bit more local, a little bit less globally interconnected.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: It sounds like you'd want to avoid those big influential nodes that play such a central role in a large, complex global network.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: Exactly. I think that having those global networks and structures fundamentally undermines the possibility of the kind of conversations that political scientists and political theorists traditionally talked about when they were discussing in the public square. They were talking about social interaction in a coffee house or a tea house, or reading groups and so on. People thought the Internet was going to be precisely that. It's very much not that. The dynamics are fundamentally different because of those structural differences. We shouldn't expect to be able to get a coffee house deliberation structure when we have a global social network where everyone is connected to everyone. It is difficult to imagine a functional politics building on that.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p><strong>Ars Technica: I want to come back to your comment on the power law distribution, how 1 percent of people dominate the conversation, because I think that is something that most users routinely forget. The horrible things we see people say on the Internet are not necessarily indicative of the vast majority of people in the world.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: For sure. That is capturing two aspects. The first is the social media prism, where the perspective we get of politics when we see it through the lens of social media is fundamentally different from what politics actually is. It seems much more toxic, much more polarized. People seem a little bit crazier than they really are. It's a very well-documented aspect of the rise of polarization: People have a false perception of the other side. Most people have fairly reasonable and fairly similar opinions. The actual polarization is lower than the perceived polarization. And that arguably is a result of social media, how it misrepresents politics.</p>
<p>And then we see this very small group of users that become very influential who often become highly visible as a result of being a little bit crazy and outrageous. Social media creates an incentive structure that is really central to reshaping not just how we see politics but also what politics is, which politicians become powerful and influential, because it is controlling the distribution of what is arguably the most valuable form of capital of our era: attention. Especially for politicians, being able to control attention is the most important thing. And since social media creates the conditions of who gets attention or not, it creates an incentive structure where certain personalities work better in a way that's just fundamentally different from how it was in previous eras.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: There are those who have sworn off social media, but it seems like simply not participating isn't really a solution, either.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: No. First, even if you only read, say, The New York Times, that newspaper is still reshaped by what works on social media, the social media logic. I had a student who did a little project this last year showing that as social media became more influential, the headlines of The New York Times became more clickbaity and adapted to the style of what worked on social media. So conventional media and our very culture is being transformed.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But more than that, as I was just saying, it's the type of politicians, it's the type of people who are empowered—it's the entire culture. Those are the things that are being transformed by the power of the incentive structures of social media. It's not like, "This is things that are happening in social media and this is the rest of the world." It's all entangled, and somehow social media has become the cultural engine that is shaping our politics and society in very fundamental ways. Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: I usually like to say that technological tools are fundamentally neutral and can be used for good or ill, but this time I'm not so sure. Is there any hope of finding a way to take the toxic and turn it into a net positive?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Petter Törnberg</strong>: What I would say to that is that we are at a crisis point with the rise of LLMs and AI. I have a hard time seeing the contemporary model of social media continuing to exist under the weight of LLMs and their capacity to mass-produce false information or information that optimizes these social network dynamics. We already see a lot of actors—based on this monetization of platforms like X—that are using AI to produce content that just seeks to maximize attention. So misinformation, often highly polarized information—as AI models become more powerful, that content is going to take over. I have a hard time seeing the conventional social media models surviving that.</p>
<p>We've already seen the process of people retreating in part to credible brands and seeking to have gatekeepers. Young people, especially, are going into WhatsApp groups and other closed communities. Of course, there's misinformation from social media leaking into those chats also. But these kinds of crisis points at least have the hope that we'll see a changing situation. I wouldn't bet that it's a situation for the better. You wanted me to sound positive, so I tried my best. Maybe it's actually "good riddance."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Walking past a bus stop yesterday I saw an advert for Google’s AI search. The person in the ad had pointed their phone’s camera at a bowl of ramen, and the AI result explained how to reproduce it at home.</p>
<p>How does it know? Because it’s trained on all the ramen recipes that multiple recipe authors spent hours, weeks, <em>years</em> perfecting. Generative AI is a blender chewing up other people’s hard work, outputting a sad mush that kind of resembles what you’re looking for, but without any of the credibility or soul. Magic.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a lot of recipe websites via RSS, and look forward to new posts from some of my favourites like <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten Kitchen</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha">Meera Sodha</a> because I know they’re going to be excellent. I trust that the recipe is tried and tested, and the result will be delicious. ChatGPT will give you an approximation of a recipe made up from the average of lots of recipes, but they lack the personality of each individual recipe, which will be slightly different to reflect the experiences and tastes of the author.</p>
<p>There's a fair bit of talk about “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience">Google Zero</a>” at the moment: the day when website traffic referred from Google finally hits zero. If the AI search result tells you everything you need, why would you ever visit the actual website?</p>
<p>Well, I want you to visit my website. I want you to read an article from a search result, and then discover the other things I’ve written, the other people I link to, and explore the weird themes I’ve got. I want some of you to read my article then ask me to speak at your conferences. Many folks rely on ad impressions to support the high-quality content they’re putting out for free.</p>
<p>I write the content on this website for people, not robots. I’m sharing my opinions and experiences so that you might identify with them and learn from them. I’m writing about things I care about because I like sharing and I like teaching. I spend hours writing these posts and AI spends seconds summarising them.</p>
<p>I'd much rather people read the whole thing, take it in, digest it and have opinions right back at me. I love it when people connect with what I’m writing (and sometimes they email me to tell me that, which is really delightful).</p>
<p>I <em>don’t</em> write these posts for VC-funded LLMs to come along and gobble up and produce some shitty facsimile, or summarise what I’m saying with none of the nuance or context on someone else's website.</p>
<p>This website is for humans, and LLMs are not welcome here.</p>

Once inside the bladder, the TAR-200 slowly and consistently releases the gemcitabine into the organ for three weeks per treatment cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Traditionally, gemcitabine has been delivered to the bladder as a liquid solution that only stays in the bladder for a few hours, which had limited effect destroying the cancer, said Daneshmand, who is also a member of the </span><a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/services/cancer-care/norris-cancer-center/" target="_blank"><span><u>USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center</u></span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The theory behind this study was that the longer the medicine sits inside the bladder, the more deeply it would penetrate the bladder and the more cancer it would destroy,” he said. “And it appears that having the chemotherapy released slowly over weeks rather than in just a few hours is a much more effective approach.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>The patient population in the clinical trial&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The clinical trial, known as the SunRISe-1, was conducted at 144 locations globally, including at </span><a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/about/keck-hospital-of-usc/" target="_blank"><span><u>Keck Hospital of USC</u></span></a><span>. It included 85 patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is the most common form of bladder cancer. The disease is considered high risk when, depending on the type and location of the tumors, the cancer carries a higher chance of recurrence and/or spreading to the bladder muscles or other parts of the body.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The standard treatment for this type of bladder cancer is an immunotherapy drug, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, which may be ineffective in a percentage of patients. All the patients in the clinical trial had been previously treated with this drug, but their cancer had returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>“The standard treatment plan for these patients <span>was surgery to remove the bladder and surrounding tissue and organs, which has many health risks and may negatively impact patients’ quality of life,” said Daneshmand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To offer patients a better option, urologic oncologists treated patients with TAR-200 every three weeks for six months, and then four times a year for the next two years. In 70 out of 85 patients, the cancer disappeared and for almost half the patients, was still gone a year later. The treatment was well-tolerated, with minimal side effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The study also showed that administering TAR-200 along with another immunotherapy drug (cetrelimab) did not prove as effective as TAR-200 on its own and had more side effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While participants in the clinical trial will be followed for another year, the study is closed to new participants.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>The future of slow-release cancer drugs&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This clinical trial is one of several ongoing ones investigating the effect of TAR-200 and the slow release of cancer-fighting drugs into the bladder to fight cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We are at an exciting moment in history,” said Daneshmand, who has been researching this novel treatment since 2016. “Our mission is to deliver cancer-fighting medications into the bladder that will offer lasting remission from cancer, and it looks like we are well on our way toward that goal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted TAR-200 a New Drug Application Priority Review, which means the FDA plans to take quicker action on the application than other applications.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The health care corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson manufactures TAR-200.</span></p>    </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://abacusnoir.com/2025/08/12/coalton-playground-type-safe-lisp-in-your-browser/">https://abacusnoir.com/2025/08/12/coalton-playground-type-safe-lisp-in-your-browser/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44889359">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I wanted to share a side project I’ve been tinkering with for a while and finally got around to shipping:&nbsp;<strong>Coalton Playground</strong>&nbsp;– basically a web-based REPL for Coalton, which is this interesting statically-typed Lisp dialect.</p>



<h2>So What’s Coalton?</h2>



<p>If you haven’t heard of it, <a href="https://coalton-lang.github.io/">Coalton</a> is kind of a weird (<em>in a good way</em>) mashup – it takes Haskell’s type system and plants it right in the middle of Common Lisp. You get all the type safety stuff like algebraic data types and pattern matching, but it still plays nice with “regular” Lisp code.</p>



<p>Or, as the <a href="https://coalton-lang.github.io/about/">official site</a> puts it: “<em>Coalton is an efficient, statically typed functional programming language that supercharges Common Lisp</em>“</p>



<h2>Why I Built This</h2>



<p>I wanted to play with Coalton but setting up a Lisp environment felt like too much work. You need <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a>, then <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, then install Coalton… and by that point I’d usually get distracted by something else.</p>



<p>So I figured I’d make a playground where you can mess around with it right in the browser. </p>



<h2>Here’s What It Looks Like</h2>



<p>Pretty straightforward – you write Coalton code like this:</p>


<div><pre title="">(coalton-toplevel
  (declare fib (Integer -&gt; Integer))
  (define (fib n)
    (if (&lt;= n 1) n
        (+ (fib (- n 1))
           (fib (- n 2))))))

(cl:format cl:t "fib(10) = ~A~%" (coalton:coalton (fib 10)))
</pre></div>


<p>Hit run, and you get your output. Then, click on “<em>Generated Code</em>” to see equivalent Common Lisp.</p>



<p>A screenshot of one example:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5400" data-permalink="https://abacusnoir.com/2025/08/12/coalton-playground-type-safe-lisp-in-your-browser/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10-26-42-am/" data-orig-file="https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png" data-orig-size="2508,1546" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2025-08-12 at 10.26.42 AM" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=1024" width="1024" height="631" src="https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=1024 1024w, https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=2048 2048w, https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=150 150w, https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=300 300w, https://abacusnoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-12-at-10.26.42-am.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>The Fun Technical Bits</h2>



<p>Getting this to run fast enough was actually kind of interesting. Turns out you can <em>pre-build SBCL cores with Coalton already loaded</em>, which cuts the startup time from ~400ms to ~80ms. Small win, but it makes the whole thing feel snappier.</p>



<p>[<strong>Warning</strong>: not built for scale right now, subject to random errors, unavailability, etc]</p>



<h2>Want to Try It?</h2>



<p>If you’re curious about what statically-typed Lisp feels like, or you just want to procrastinate for a few minutes, go check it out. </p>



<p><a href="https://coalton.app/">https://coalton.app</a></p>



<p>I threw in some examples to get you started – basic stuff like factorial and fibonacci, plus some fancier things like monads if you’re into that.</p>



<hr>



<p>Anyway, that’s it.<em> Just wanted to share this thing I made</em>.</p>

But—by definition—most workers are not exceptional. Most workers, and most work days, are just drudgery. Answering emails. Writing up quarterly plans. Reviewing metrics. Building applications that do something with data.</p><p>A very large number of people dread Monday, and that's not because they show up Monday morning and bring all their creativity and brilliance. It's because it's clocking in and clocking out on a job they'd rather not be doing.</p><p>These are prime targets for AI replacement. And they are not the fringe. This isn't the bottom 5% of the workforce. This is the bottom 60-80%!</p><p>In other words, my read is that the replacement of jobs by AI isn't coming for the bottom few percent.</p><p>It's coming for all but the top few percent.

<p>Data brokers are required by California law to provide ways for consumers to request their data be deleted. But good luck finding them.</p>



<p>More than 30 of the companies, which collect and sell consumers’ personal information, hid their deletion instructions from Google, according to a review by The Markup and CalMatters of hundreds of broker websites. This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Many of the pages containing the instructions, listed in an official state registry, use code <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag" target="_blank">to tell search engines</a> to <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing" target="_blank">remove the page entirely</a> from search results. Popular tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/block-urls-from-bing-264e560a" target="_blank">Bing</a> respect the code by excluding pages when responding to users.</p>



<p>Data brokers nationwide must register in California under the state’s <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank">Consumer Privacy Act</a>, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold or that they get access to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reviewing the websites of all 499 data brokers <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/data_broker_registry/" target="_blank">registered</a> with the state, we found 35 had code to stop certain pages from showing up in searches.</p>



<p>While those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can’t find the page, according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports who studies the California law governing data brokers and other privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This sounds to me like a clever work around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said.</p>



<p>After The Markup and CalMatters contacted the data brokers, eight said they would review the code on their websites or remove it entirely, and another two said they had independently deleted the code before being contacted. The Markup and CalMatters confirmed nine of the ten companies removed the code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two companies said they added the code intentionally to avoid spam at the recommendation of experts and would not change it. The other 24 companies didn’t respond to a request for comment; however, three removed the code after The Markup and CalMatters contacted them.&nbsp;After publication, one company that did not previously respond,<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://uspeoplesearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USPeopleSearch.com</a>, said it had removed the code.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>This sounds to me like a clever work around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it.</p><cite>Matthew Schwartz, policy analyst, Consumer Reports</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Most of the companies that did respond said they were unaware the code was on their pages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The presence of the [code] on our opt-out page was indeed an oversight and not intentional,” May Haddad, a spokesperson for data company FourthWall, said in an emailed response. “Our team promptly rectified the issue upon being informed. As a standard practice, all critical pages—including opt-out and privacy pages—are intended to be indexed by default to ensure maximum visibility and accessibility.” The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.</p>



<p>Some companies that hid their privacy instructions from search engines included a small link at the bottom of their homepage. Accessing it often required scrolling multiple screens, dismissing pop-ups for cookie permissions and newsletter sign-ups and then finding a link that was a fraction the size of other text on the page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So consumers still faced a serious hurdle when trying to get their information deleted.</p>



<p>Take the <a href="https://ipapi.co/donotsell/" target="_blank">simple opt-out form</a> for <a href="https://ipapi.co/" target="_blank">ipapi</a>, a service offered by Kloudend, Inc that finds the physical locations of internet visitors based on their IP addresses. People can go to the company’s website to request that the company “Do Not Sell” their personal data or to invoke their “Right to Delete” it — but they would have had trouble finding the form, since it contained code excluding it from search results. A spokesperson for Kloudend described the code as an “oversight” and said the page had been changed to be visible to search engines; The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.</p>



<p>Telesign, a company that advertises fraud-prevention services for businesses, offers <a href="https://www.telesign.com/privacy-requests" target="_blank">a simple form</a> for “Data Deletion” and “Opt Out / Do Not Sell”. But that form is hidden from search engines and other automated systems, and isn’t linked on its homepage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, consumers must search about 7,000 words into a privacy policy filled with legalese to find a link to the page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Telesign didn’t respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Five of the pages listed in the California registry not only aren’t indexed for search, but don’t exist. For example, a company called BrightCheck, which offers “AI-driven identity verification,” lists <a href="https://www.brightcheck.com/opt-out-preferences" target="_blank">a privacy instructions page</a> on the California registry. But when The Markup and CalMatters visited the page in late July, we found a notice that the page no longer exists. The page was there on March 18 when The Markup and CalMatters first scanned the site, and the Wayback Machine has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250214110043/https://brightcheck.com/opt-out-preferences/" target="_blank">an archive of the page</a> from February 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BrightCheck didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>





<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect in 2020, governing companies that make most of their revenue from selling consumer data, or who make more than $25 million per year or handle the data of more than 100,000 people in the state. With no comprehensive federal privacy law, the law is among the few regulations data brokers must comply with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>California’s most recent broker database lists nearly 500 companies, most of which consumers have likely never heard of. They include businesses with zippy start-up names like StatSocial and UpLead, and offer everything from email marketing tools to contact directories. CalMatters <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/04/data-broker-registry/" target="_blank">last year published a guide with information</a> on how consumers can exercise their rights using the database or third-party tools and on how they can request deletion of their children’ s information.</p>



<p>Tom Kemp, executive director of the entity tasked with enforcing the privacy law, the California Privacy Protection Agency, said in an interview that the agency had reproduced The Markup and CalMatters’ findings. While he declined to comment on any particular company’s practices, he pointed to <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/pdf/enfadvisory202402.pdf" target="_blank">an enforcement advisory</a> from the agency on “dark patterns,” which are design choices that have “the substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer’s autonomy, decisionmaking, or choice.”</p>



  



<p>If a company makes it much more difficult to choose to remove their personal data than to contribute it, or includes excessive jargon or other hurdles for consumers to jump through to remove it, according to the advisory, they might be violating the law.</p>



<p>This year, the privacy agency has taken enforcement action against companies including Todd Snyder and Honda for, among other violations, making it too difficult to choose to not have their data used. Todd Snyder <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2025/20250506.html" target="_blank">paid a nearly $350,000 fine</a> this year, while <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2025/20250312.html" target="_blank">Honda agreed to pay</a> more than $630,000. Both agreed to overhaul their privacy practices.</p>



<p>Kemp said that, when determining whether a company has violated the privacy act, it’s important to determine whether there’s a pattern of activity making it difficult for consumers to exercise their rights. Hiding a privacy instructions page could be the first “thread” in determining whether a company is shirking their obligations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past, other companies have been criticized for hiding important web pages from search engines. In 2019, ProPublica revealed how the company behind tax filing service TurboTax added code to effectively <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines" target="_blank">hide an option</a> for users to file their taxes for free. A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/hospitals-hide-pricing-data-from-search-results-11616405402?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">2021 report from the Wall Street Journal</a> found that hospitals were hiding prices they <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/hospitals-hide-pricing-data-from-search-results-11616405402?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">were required to post</a> under federal transparency rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing that most Californians have never heard of the hundreds of companies in the data broker registry, lawmakers in California recently passed the Delete Act. The law will create a system called <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2025/20250425.html?mkt_tok=MTM4LUVaTS0wNDIAAAGaMVgznJg32zTAsJRxKpzEZZ5Xs-p2vLqiOROyN3TxNS78RqBIYrYcQIqLKDfothgogRmA7v_bJ6k6wl_djyZBbYGV9zXHyud_c13vzwHwtjh0" target="_blank">the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform</a>, or DROP, which will allow consumers in California to send a single, legally binding request to all data brokers on the registry at one time. The privacy protection agency intends to launch it next year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><div><p><img loading="lazy" width="1256" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_fill,w_1920,h_917,g_auto/f_auto/q_auto/v1/DSCF_7311_bf93d282fc?_a=BAVAZGDX0 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_fill,w_3840,h_1834,g_auto/f_auto/q_auto/v1/DSCF_7311_bf93d282fc?_a=BAVAZGDX0 2x" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_fill,w_3840,h_1834,g_auto/f_auto/q_auto/v1/DSCF_7311_bf93d282fc?_a=BAVAZGDX0"></p></div><div><p>A common source of confusion that I experience when posting my artwork on social media is: <em>why?</em> Why use a plotter when you could use a printer? It's slower. Less exact. More expensive. It fails, far too often. Inkjet printers became ubiquitous in the 1980s because they solved nearly all of these problems. So why are artists obsessed with pen plotters?</p>
<p>I'll be upfront, I'm going to list all of the reasons that I love pen plotters in this article. That's not to say that they're superior, though. Like any tool, they have their place amongst many different printing technologies and come with their own benefits and drawbacks.</p></div><div><p><strong>Pen plotters</strong> are somewhat like 3D printers. They move in X/Y space and typically have a pen lift mechanism. Attached to their arm can be any number of drawing instruments, from pens to pencils, brushes to pastels, and even drill bits to scratch glass.</p>
<p><strong>Printers</strong> (we'll focus on inkjet for this article) blast tiny ink particles into paper and can seamlessly mix them to create a range of visually distinct hues and tones. In the art world, they're commonly used to make Giclée prints, which are essentially just archival, fine art prints.</p>
<h2>Original Art vs. a Reproduction</h2>
<p>Professional quality inkjet printers can do a fantastic job reproducing what an artist sees on screen. Artists like <a href="http://zach.li/">Zach Liberman</a> use them to create beautiful reproductions of digitally native artworks.</p>
<p>The keyword here, though, is <strong>reproduction</strong>. A printer isn't capable of mixing pigments the same way an artist mixes paints on a palette. It turns out, computers aren't very good at it either. Computer scientists and artists have been attempting to replicate the physical properties of color mixing through approaches such as the theoretical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubelka%E2%80%93Munk_theory">Kubelka-Munk</a> equation for some time now, with limited applicable results for digital artists and creators.</p>
<p>I say this not to bash the RGB model that most digital artists are familiar with, hell, I use it all of the time myself when creating art for screens. It's just, when you're going for realism in color, nothing quite beats the real thing.</p>
<p><em>Check out <a href="https://github.com/rvanwijnen/spectral.js/">spectral.js </a>for the best code-based implementation of the K-M equations that I've encountered.</em></p></div><div><figure><figcaption>extruded blob #1 - Zach Liberman (Giclée Print)</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Bottom line, when a print is produced, there is no emergence of color occurring; it's just an approximation of the pixel coloration in a digital file. Under the hood, your inkjet printer is using a sophisticated technique of subtractive color mixing to trick your eyes into seeing a spectrum of colors with only CMYK pigments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, It's beholden to whether the source material is a scan, a photograph, a digital painting, or an HTML canvas to get physically accurate results. If the source is a digital file, the chances that the colors are in any way physically accurate are unlikely. And maybe that's fine, depending on the artist's intent.</p>
<p>Plotters do not force an artist to use a specific color space or inkjet type. In fact, it's a non-factor. They only accept instructions in G-code. There's no raster source to pull pixel colors from. Instead, you, as the artist, must choose what drawing instrument to equip the plotter with. You can blend paints with watercolor, smear pastels together, and overlap inks to watch them subtly mix. The results are often unpredictable, and plotter artists may not know what they're going to create until it's finished.</p></div><div><figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.eyesofpanda.com/"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="942" height="1296" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1080/f_auto/q_auto/v1/licia_plot_2_d8c233a2a3?_a=BAVAZGDX0 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1920/f_auto/q_auto/v1/licia_plot_2_d8c233a2a3?_a=BAVAZGDX0 2x" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1920/f_auto/q_auto/v1/licia_plot_2_d8c233a2a3?_a=BAVAZGDX0"></a></p><p>Watercolor plotter painting by Licia He</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.andeecollard.com/"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="942" height="1296" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1080/f_auto/q_auto/v1/acollard_plot_4a52cea94e?_a=BAVAZGDX0 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1920/f_auto/q_auto/v1/acollard_plot_4a52cea94e?_a=BAVAZGDX0 2x" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1920/f_auto/q_auto/v1/acollard_plot_4a52cea94e?_a=BAVAZGDX0"></a></p><p>Acrylic plotter painting by Andee Collard</p></div></div></figure></div><div><h2>Limitations with white ink</h2>
<p>Most Inkjet printers aren't equipped with white ink. Printing numerous images with a black background will be pretty expensive because the printer is going to lay down copious amounts of black pigment on a piece of white paper.</p>
<p>With a pen plotter, it's as simple as buying some black paper and a white gel pen.</p></div><div><figure><a href="https://www.v3ga.net/"><img loading="lazy" width="628" height="837" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_640/f_auto/q_auto/v1/Julien_Gachadoat_85328133bf?_a=BAVAZGDX0 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1920/f_auto/q_auto/v1/Julien_Gachadoat_85328133bf?_a=BAVAZGDX0 2x" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtz3cezyb/image/upload/c_limit,w_1920/f_auto/q_auto/v1/Julien_Gachadoat_85328133bf?_a=BAVAZGDX0"></a><figcaption>Plots by Julien Gachadoat</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Options other than inks</h2>
<p>I tend to focus on using pens with archival inks, but unlike printers, that's certainly not the only thing pen plotters can draw with. <strong>Mechanical pencils</strong> with hard lead, auto-feeds, and auto rotations (like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Uni-Kuru-Toga-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/706">Kuro Toga</a> system) work well with pen plotters.</p>
<p>Downward pressure is an essential consideration for achieving dark lines with pencils, and the newer Bantam Tools machines have this solved with springs that exert proper force. The <a href="https://bantamtools.com/collections/artframe">Artframe</a>, in particular, can even vary this over a single drawing, giving artists the ability to dial in specific motifs.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>A pencil loaded up in an Axidraw V3/A3</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Media Size</h2>
<p>Both large-format inkjet printers and pen plotters can get rather costly. In terms of cost-to-size ratios, though, I'd have to give the edge to my <a href="https://bantamtools.com/products/bantam-tools-nextdraw-2234">Nextdraw 2234</a>, which can create artworks up to 22"x34". Without adjustments, it can also draw on tiny areas, business cards, or smaller.</p></div><div><p>Space matters, and printers have a minor advantage here, though, as large-format machines have a smaller footprint than plotters. They often take up entire tables due to their unwieldy arm.</p>
<p>Vintage plotters do exist in this standing format, and artists have restored them to create modern works of art.</p>
<h2>A nice fit for generative workflows</h2>
<p>Both printers and plotters are fully capable of producing generative art. Subjectively speaking, though, it is something special to make generative drawings. The imperfections present in pen-to-paper works complement the randomness inherent in the art. Staying in a vector art context, stripped down to purely linework, is an interesting artistic constraint.</p>
<p>I often iterate on a new artwork by drawing it on cheap printer paper or in sketchbooks. I'm looking for how the work feels when I see it, and I'm also making sure that it doesn't hit material limitations, like ripping through a sheet of paper because a pen glides over the same point too many times. I then go back to my IDE and make some code tweaks.</p></div><div><h2>Frankly, it's really fun.</h2>
<p>Obviously, everyone will have a different opinion on this. I know artists who love to nerd out at digital print studios, refining their colors to get results that look stunning to the naked eye. They experiment with the balance of CMYK values, printing swatches, and tests until they achieve outstanding fine art prints.</p>
<p>The same goes for the admittedly smaller subset of digital artists who create <a href="https://sarahridgley.com/">risographs</a>, screen prints, intaglio, thermal printers, and other less common processes. (Okay, this sounds amazingly fun too!)</p>
<p>It wasn't until I got my first pen plotter in 2019 that I began to bond with the physicality of art making. The nuances of different inks and paper types. How much cotton was present? What about the texture? Hot or cold press? My art practices always revolved around a screen, and the pen plotter gave me an entirely new world of variables to explore. This was a breath of fresh air to my practice. I began going to as many art supply shops as I could find, and sought out ones wherever I traveled. Framing became an important consideration, and I revised my vision of the artwork to how it would appear mounted on a gallery wall. I began hoarding inks and swatching them for reference, looking for interesting characteristics such as sheening and shading. Since I now had all of these pens and inks, I started writing more, which has improved my mental health and given fresh life to my withered handwriting skills.</p></div><div><h2>The drawbacks</h2>
<p>I'd be remiss not to mention some of the drawbacks of pen plotters. There are many good reasons that nearly every commercial printing studio, design house, and architecture firm has abandoned the pen plotter as their tool of choice.</p>
<h3>It's relatively slow, comparatively.</h3>
<p>In a race vs. a human hand, the plotter has an edge in both speed and precision. Against even a basic Inkjet printer, though, a pen plotter is many orders of magnitude slower. I routinely create artworks that take 12+ hours to draw via the machine. The slow process severely limits the sizes of my editions - I simply can't do unlimited runs of artworks.</p>
<h3>Multi-color processes aren't trivial.</h3>
<p>Plotting something with multiple colors is tricky. If using pens, you must change inks. If using paint, you must clean and resaturate brushes. For example, I love the bold pop of Posca markers, but since they must be occasionally primed by shaking the body, there isn't a great workflow for plotter art.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, addressing these limitations is a manual process. Other issues arise, too. Removing items from the plotter arm is likely to cause misalignments, which will be apparent in the artwork.</p>
<p>I ended up designing a 3D printed holder to address my alignment issues, but I still have to manually switch pens for each pass of a color in a drawing.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the chance to compare a plotted version of my artwork to a professional-quality print from a reputable shop, and I was frankly blown away at the quality of the print. The printed resolution was exceptional, and details were sharp down to the sub-millimeter. The color was excellent, better than I could have imagined.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>BUSY - James Merrill (2025)</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I offer both original drawings and printed reproductions of digital artworks to collectors because each medium has its benefits and drawbacks. My pen plotter studio simply can't compete with the volume of a professional print studio, and that's okay. I like the slower, more thoughtful workflow for many of the artworks I chose to produce.</p></div></main><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/13/uk_expands_police_facial_recognition/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/13/uk_expands_police_facial_recognition/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44887373">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A fresh expansion of UK crimefighters' access to live facial recognition (LFR) technology is being described by officials as "an excellent opportunity for policing." Privacy campaigners disagree.</p>
<p>The Home Office said today that more police forces across England will gain LFR capabilities thanks to ten new "cutting edge" vans being wheeled out, adding to those <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/25/uk_police_lfr_tender/">already in use</a> by London's Metropolitan Police and forces in South Wales.</p>
<p>Seven forces will gain access to LFR vans as part of the latest expansion. These are: Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey and Sussex (jointly), and Thames Valley and Hampshire (jointly).</p>

    

<p>The UK government insists LFR vans, which are strongly opposed by privacy campaigners, are effective policing tools and are used only in targeted cases informed by firm intelligence.</p>

        


        

<p>In essence, they are not simply plonked into high-footfall areas and activated in the hope of catching someone on a wanted list somewhere.</p>
<p>Various privacy considerations are made with each <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/27/uk_facial_recognition/">LFR deployment</a> in the UK, the cops say. These include notifying the public about when, where, and for how long LFR will be used in a given area, allowing them to exercise their right not to be captured by the technology.</p>

        

<p>However, the College of Policing's <a href="https://www.college.police.uk/app/live-facial-recognition" rel="nofollow">guidance</a> states that in cases of a critical threat or where there is insufficient time to alert the public, police may still deploy LFR without warning.</p>
<p>The government also insists the tech is independently tested at the National Physical Laboratory, which found the underlying algorithm to be accurate and free of age, gender, or <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/25/facial_recognition_system_used_by/">ethnicity-related bias</a>.</p>
<p>South Wales Police say they have not seen a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/05/facial_recognition_cameras_london_police/">false alert</a> since August 2019, and claim LFR has never led to a wrongful arrest.</p>

        

<p>Existing deployments in London and South Wales have resulted in 580 arrests over the past 12 months, the Home Office said. It said the types of offenders it has helped capture include rapists, domestic abusers, violent criminals, and 52 registered sex offenders breaching their conditions.</p>
<p>The new vans will hit the streets in the coming weeks, and it will be up to each force to determine how they are deployed. Each will have to follow the College of Policing's guidance and be monitored, with the findings feeding into a government consultation – also announced today – which will inform a new legal framework.</p>
<p>Lindsey Chiswick, who heads up all things LFR at the National Police Chief's Council, said the technology supports effective policing and allows officers to locate suspects quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>"The increased access to Live Facial Recognition vehicles to forces that previously did not have the capability is an excellent opportunity for policing. Each Live Facial Recognition deployment will be targeted, intelligence-led, within a set geographical location and for a defined period of time, ensuring deployments are proportionate, lawful, and necessary.</p>
<p>"Live Facial Recognition has already been used in policing to great success, locating thousands of wanted offenders, or others breaching their bail conditions.</p>
<p>"I am confident that the increased use of this technology will continue to support the safety of communities across the country moving forward."</p>
<h3>'A significant expansion of the surveillance state'</h3>
<p>Silkie Carlo, head of privacy group Big Brother Watch (BBW) and a stout opposer of LFR, said the ten new vans amount to doubling the police's LFR capability. She added that previous deployments have led to misidentifications.</p>
<p>The campaign group has an ongoing legal battle with the Met, which centers around <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxg8v74d8jo">Shaun Thompson</a>, an anti-knife crime community worker at Street Fathers, who was wrongly stopped by LFR-assisted officers last year and questioned for almost half an hour.</p>
<p>In BBW's response to today's news, it described the new vans as a "frightening expansion of the technology," and that it was "worrying for our democracy."</p>
<p>"Live facial recognition turns every passerby into a walking barcode and treats us all as a nation of suspects," said Rebecca Vincent, interim director at BBW.</p>
<p>"Police have interpreted the absence of any legislative basis authorizing the use of this intrusive technology as carte blanche to continue to roll it out unfettered, despite the fact that a crucial judicial review on the matter is pending.</p>
<p>"This move is not only worrying for our privacy rights, it is worrying for our democracy. The Home Office must scrap its plans to roll out further live facial recognition capacity until robust legislative safeguards are established."</p>
<h3>Secret databases</h3>
<p>It is the second time in recent days that the UK's approach to facial recognition has angered privacy advocates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BBW and Privacy International <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/08/uk_secretly_allows_facial_recognition/">claimed last week</a> that the UK government had made photos from its passport and immigration databases available to police facial recognition systems, allowing them to scan against these images regardless of whether the individuals are on a police watchlist.</p>
<p>UK police are typically only able to use LFR for specific investigations and can only scan crowds for faces on a police watchlist, which is populated by around 20 million images.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/08/uk_secretly_allows_facial_recognition/">UK secretly allows facial recognition scans of passport, immigration databases</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/03/tsa_facial_recognition_audit/">TSA's airport facial-recog tech faces audit probe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>BBW and Privacy International claimed the images made available to facial recognition systems via the additional databases raised this number by around 150 million.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information requests made by the pro-privacy pair revealed a surge in police scans against these databases, with 31 forces involved.</p>
<p>They said the number of searches against the passport database had risen from two in 2020 to 417 by 2023, and regarding the immigration database, scans rose from 16 in 2023 to 102 the following year.</p>
<p>The Home Office countered by saying these databases are only called upon by officers using Retrospective Facial Recognition (RFR) systems, which are used when a crime has definitely been committed and police are looking for a specific culprit.</p>
<p>It added that these databases are not reached by LFR systems, and police must request its approval before scanning them. ®</p>

      <p>The police's use of facial recognition technology is to be significantly expanded in an attempt to catch more offenders, ministers have announced.</p><p>Under the plans, 10 live facial recognition (LFR) vans will be used by seven forces across England to help identify "sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes", according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-starmer-labour-badenoch-small-boats-farage-12593360" target="_blank"><strong>Politics Hub: Follow latest updates and analysis</strong></a></p><p>The tech, which has been trialled in London and south Wales, will be subject to strict rules, the Home Office said, but human rights groups have warned it is "dangerous and discriminatory".</p><p>Amnesty International UK said the plans should be "immediately scrapped", with facial recognition proven to be "discriminatory against communities of colour".</p>
<p>"It has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest," said Alba Kapoor, the charity's racial justice lead, "and it's also known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour."</p><p>The Home Office said the LFR vans will only be deployed when there is "specific intelligence", and will be operated by trained officers who will check every match made by the cameras.</p><p>The vehicles will also only be used against bespoke watch lists, compiled for each use under guidelines set by the College of Policing.</p><p>The vans will be operated by police forces in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey and Sussex (jointly), and Thames Valley and Hampshire (jointly).</p>

<p><strong>'The most serious offenders'</strong></p><p>Ms Cooper has said ministers are focused on making sure "there are proper safeguards in place".</p><p>As part of the plans, the home secretary has announced she will be launching a consultation on how and when the cameras should be used, and with what safeguards, which the government will use to draw up a new legal framework for the use of the cameras.</p><p>Ms Cooper said the tech had been used in London and South Wales "in a targeted way", and helped catch "the most serious offenders, including people wanted for violent assaults or for sex offences".</p><p><a href="http://news.sky.com/story/met-police-release-footage-as-more-than-1-000-arrests-made-using-live-facial-recognition-technology-13391999" target="_blank"><strong>According to the Metropolitan Police</strong></a>, the tech has led to 580 arrests for offences such as rape, domestic crime and knife crime in the space of 12 months.</p><p>The government has pointed to independent testing by the National Physical Laboratory, which it said found the tech was "accurate" and showed "no bias for ethnicity, age, or gender".</p><p><strong>Read more politics news:</strong><br><strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/is-keir-starmer-falling-into-a-small-boats-trap-13410676" target="_blank">Is Keir Starmer falling into booby trap?</a></strong><br><strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-former-minister-tulip-siddiq-on-trial-for-in-bangladesh-13288115" target="_blank">What is ex-minister Tulip Siddiq on trial for?</a></strong></p>     
<p>Liberty has welcomed the government's decision to create a statutory framework for using facial recognition, but said that should be in place before the tech is rolled out.</p><p>"There's no reasonable excuse to be putting even more cameras on our streets before the public have had their say and legislation is brought in to protect all of us," said a statement.</p><p>The civil liberties charity cited how more than 1.6 million people have had their faces scanned in South Wales, mostly on football match days in Cardiff city centre.</p><p>But Lindsey Chiswick, from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), has said the expansion "is an excellent opportunity for policing", and will help officers locate suspects "quickly and accurately".</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Claude CLI version: <code>1.0.51 (Claude Code)</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Bug Description</h2>
<p dir="auto">Claude is way too sycophantic, saying "You're absolutely right!" (or correct) on a sizeable fraction of responses.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Expected Behavior</h2>
<p dir="auto">The model should be RL'd (or the system prompt updated) to make it less sycophantic, or the phrases "You're absolutely right!" and "You're absolutely correct!" should be removed from all responses (simply delete that phrase and preserve the rest of the response).</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Actual Behavior (slightly redacted with ...)</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this particularly egregious case, Claude asked me whether to proceed with removing an unnecessary code path, I said "Yes please.", and it told me "You're absolutely right!", despite the fact that I never actually made a statement of fact that even <em>could</em> be right.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  Should we simplify this and remove the &quot;approve_only&quot; case ... ?

> Yes please.

⏺ You're absolutely right! Since ... there's no scenario where we'd auto-approve ... with
  &quot;approve only&quot; ... Let me simplify this:"><pre><code>  Should we simplify this and remove the "approve_only" case ... ?

&gt; Yes please.

⏺ You're absolutely right! Since ... there's no scenario where we'd auto-approve ... with

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This behavior is so egregious and well-known that it's become the butt of online jokes like <a href="https://x.com/iannuttall/status/1942943832519446785" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/iannuttall/status/1942943832519446785</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

            Reddit.com; The OSA has made it impossible to do my subreddit moderation work: I need to be able to review a user's profile if they submit a post/comments to any of the subreddits I moderate. Any profile marked as "18+", which DOES NOT imply pornographic content, is now blocked from view when accessing Reddit from the UK. I refuse outright to scan my face into a dodgy third-party site, so I HAVE to use a VPN to continue moderating my (medical professional) subreddits. It's insane.

            Janitor AI is a chatbot platform where users can create and interact with AI characters for personalized role-playing and conversations. It was launched in 2023 and quickly gained popularity, especially among those interested in engaging with AI in an immersive and emotional way. The platform allows for customisation of character personalities, appearances, and dialogue settings, and supports different Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The site is of 18+ maturity and is only advertised for adults. The website is based outside of the UK.

Janitor ai also has a large creative community akin to fanficton sites like Ao3 or Wattpad. Many people use this site for creative expression and connecting with other users who also enjoy the fandoms and original characters that are created on the site.

            Itch.io blocks certain pages due to the OSA. However, directly accessing the pages allows you to view content anyway. The content may or may not even be "adult".

Example: Pages on itch are organised by domain with the name of an author. The main index at https://elajo.itch.io Gives a message about the OSA. But pages within can be accessed if you already know the exact path name.

I write real-life sex stories and occasional horny fiction.

So I would rather not waste more time talking to a brick wall.

<div><p>F-droid are thoroughly understaffed and yet incredibly ambitious and shrewd around their goals - they want to build all the apps in a reproducible manner. There’s lots of friction around deviating from builds that fit within their model. The system is also slow, takes a long while before a build shows up. I think f-droid could benefit immensely from more funding, saying that as someone who has never seen f-droid’s side, but have worked on an app that was published there.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="44885300"><td></td></tr><tr id="44884865"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_44884865" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44884865&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D44884709"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>&gt; please keep in mind F-Droid is a volunteer-run community project.</p><p>To, me, that's the worrying part.</p><p>Not that it's ran by volunteers. But that all there's left between a full-on "tech monopoly" or hegemony, and a free internet, is small bands of underfunded volunteers.</p><p>Opposition to market dominance and monopolies by multibillion multinationals shouldn't just come from a few volunteers. If that's the case, just roll over and give up; the cause is lost. (As I've done, hence my defaitism)</p><p>Aside from that: it being "a volunteer ran community" shouldn't be put as an excuse for why it's in trouble/has poor UX/is hard to use/is behind/etc. It should be a killer feature.
