Salesforce promoted that its CDP can process large amounts of customer data in "real-time," meaning in "milliseconds," the lawsuit says.</p><p>One benefit to real-time data processing that Salesforce advertises, for example, is when a hospital may need the most up-to-date information on a patient regarding urgent healthcare needs.</p><p>"When milliseconds matter most, your healthcare provider can deliver proactive guidance and care recommendations with access to your real-time patient data," <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/09/what-is-salesforce-genie.html#genie-business-impact" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">the company wrote</a>.</p><p>Salesforce unveiled its CDP software, Genie, to the public on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-dreamforce-acquisitions-growth-margins-revenue-target-2022-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">September 20, 2022</a>. In a keynote slide attached to the court documents, the company repeats the term "real-time" four times.</p><p>According to the court documents, Salesforce said it was the "biggest announcement" it had made since the founders started the company.</p><p>But "it was all a lie," the lawsuit says.</p><p>The court documents say the software does not operate as fast as the term "real-time" suggests, and "in fact many of its processes took several hours."</p><p>"While it was able to execute some functions such as information collection in real time, other operations such as the processing and organizing of that data took hours to complete," the lawsuit says.</p><p>On <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/09/what-is-salesforce-genie.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Salesforce's website about Genie</a>, the company says the software "collects and unifies data in milliseconds."</p><p>For example, "a personalized offer on a website you're browsing changes instantly because of something you just clicked in a marketing email," the company writes. "Because the company uses Marketing Cloud Genie, that offer changes immediately into something that is more relevant to you than the one you'd otherwise be looking at. This convinces you to go ahead and make a purchase."</p><p>Wirth recommended that Salesforce pursue this software capability in late 2021 or early 2022, according to court documents, but it became clear to the Customer Data Platform (CDP) team that it could not "develop the technology in time" for Salesforce's announcement in September 2022.</p><p>The lawsuit also claimed that the CDP team "wanted to redefine the meaning of 'real-time,' so that it could falsely claim that the CDP operated in real-time."</p><p>"Plaintiff reasonably believed that publicly claiming the CDP operated in 'real-time' without actually having (or even intending to have in the near future) such a capability would be fraudulent, and likely violate numerous provisions of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders, as well as rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission," the lawsuit stated.</p><p>Wirth then decided to act as a whistleblower and brought up his concerns to the CDP team and other "key executives," the lawsuit said.</p><p>In addition, he approached his direct supervisor, Lidiane Jones, now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-lidiane-jones-the-new-slack-ceo-succeeding-stewart-butterfield-2022-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">CEO of Slack Technologies</a>, about his concerns. The lawsuit says Jones then began a "deceitful campaign to diminish" Wirth's reputation at the company.</p><p>One of Wirth's last "whistleblowing activities" was a one-on-one meeting with Saleseforce's CTO, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parker-harris-salesforce-cofounder-profile-2015-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Parker Harris</a>, during which he brought up his concerns about the CDP team and Jones's "use of false criticisms."</p><p>Wirth was fired hours later, the lawsuit says.</p><p>Harris and spokespersons for Slack and Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.</p><p>Wirth is seeking monetary damages due to what the lawsuit calls Salesforces' "whistleblower retaliation."</p><p>His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in
engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these
primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact.
Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource
requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this
approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative
physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide
a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
<br>At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated
fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling
from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic
oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear
systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix
determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions,
we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to
digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms
exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration,
highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields,
and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.

<h2>What is VirGL?<a href="#what-is-virgl" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>VirGL is a virtual 3D GPU for use inside QEMU virtual machines, that
allows the guest operating system to use the capabilities of the host GPU
to accelerate 3D rendering. The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully
independent of the host GPU.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-exactly-does-it-entail">
<h2>What exactly does it entail?<a href="#what-exactly-does-it-entail" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project entails creating a virtual 3D capable graphics card for
virtual machines running inside QEMU. The design of this card is based
around the concepts of Gallium3D to make writing Mesa and (eventually)
Direct3D drivers for it easy. The card natively uses the Gallium TGSI
intermediate representation for its shaders. The implementation of
rendering for the card is done in the host system as part of QEMU and is
implemented purely on OpenGL so you can get accelerated rendering on any
sufficiently capable card/driver combination.</p>
<p>The project also consists of a complete Linux guest stack, composed of a
Linux kernel KMS driver, X.org 2D DDX driver and Mesa 3D driver.</p>

<h2>Current status<a href="#current-status" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Many pieces are now upstreamed in various projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel Linux 4.2 contains the modesetting only drivers. Linux 4.4
contains the 3D supported pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Mesa main contains the VirGL 3D driver.</p></li>
<li><p>QEMU 2.4 contained the initial virtio-gpu with no acceleration
support. QEMU 2.5 contains 3D support only with the GTK3 frontend with
GL enabled.</p></li>

<p>Ode to the M1</p><hr>


<p>It is not often I am blown away by a piece of hardware. My Hall of Fame features the 1991 Super Nintendo, the 1995 3dfx1, and the 2010 Intel's Serie 520 SSD<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This past month my 2021 MacBook Pro M1<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> joined the club.</p>


<p>My problem</p><hr><p>Much has been written about the performance and the battery life of the M1. I won't elaborate on that. Even though these alone would warrant much praise, it is for my peculiar usecase that the machine shines.</p>

<p>I spend my time either writing code or articles. Linux is perfect for that. But every once in a while that OS eats my time. Spending time figuring out why fractional scaling broke after an update, why that Thunderbolt SSD won't mount<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, or why it won't print is nerve wrecking. These rare, yet ragging, moments make me miss MacOS X.</p>

<p>As a retro-gamimg enthusiast, I may need to use an emulator to study a game's internals. Inevitably, I end up needing to run Windows.</p>

<p>Missed connection</p><hr><p>I attempted to solve my problem via KVM on a beloved Thinkpad Carbon Gen 9. It took me forever to get something running. Dealing with Windows 11 TPM requirements was a nightmare. And I never managed to have something stable. Not to mention the battery life was abysmal.</p>

<p>UTM</p><hr><p><a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> works. It was painless to set up both Ubuntu and Windows 11 with a few clicks. I spent 1mn creating both VMs<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. It allows me to have all three OSes a simple swipe motion away. Both Ubuntu and Windows run at native speed since they are virtualized instead of emulated.</p>


<video width="1240" height="1920" poster="https://fabiensanglard.net/m1/poster.webp" controls="">
  <source src="https://fabiensanglard.net/m1/magic1080.mov" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>The ability to share files in <code>rw</code> mode made writing and testing cross-platform mDNS software<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> something almost enjoyable. At the very least it gave me the satisfaction of iterating at maximum speed.</p>


<p>Concerns</p><hr><p>At this point, the M1 is a dream hypervisor. I wish I could freeze time on this setup. I have only two concerns.</p>

<h2>Software engineers</h2>
<p>For every extra cycle an hardware engineer can squeeze out of silicon, you will find a programmer adding one hundred cycles to their program<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. In other terms, I fear that once devs figure out how powerful the M1 is, they will throw more "features" at it.</p>

<h2>Enterprising</h2>
<p>UTM is simple, lightweight, and easy to set up. It is gorgeous and a pleasure to use. Just browse their website<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, see the clean gallery<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, and read the useful setup guide. My fear is that something purchases them and we end up with a confusing mess of Enterprise flavors a la VMWare.</p>

      <p dir="auto">This is the crux of the issue, and I can't agree with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Going into an effort to stabilise Flakes with the understanding that we can't actually change it very much would make a mockery of the RFC process as a whole.  It would establish a precedent that following the RFC process is optional, and that if you don't want to follow it (and you're one of the privileged set of committers to the appropriate repository) you can work around it encouraging adoption of your "experimental" work until it gets to the point that "we can't make big changes" any more.  Maybe the Flakes design is good enough that we wouldn't <em>need</em> to make huge drastic changes, but it still sets the same precedent if we go into it having accepted that we <em>can't</em>.</p>

      <p dir="auto">I think Flakes 2.0 may not necessary be new features.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/alyssais/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/alyssais">@alyssais</a> I agree Flakes was advertised much more heavily than, say, Rust experimental features, which does make the whole process very dodgy. But I have also long since given up on trying to influence Flakes. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/edolstra/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/edolstra">@edolstra</a> and others have a very specific vision on what UX they want for them, and I think a fine compromise is that they can basically do whatever they want with that <em>so long as</em> there remains a "rest of Nix" that is still fully functional and not an afterthought with huge gaps.</p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, I would <em>personally</em> work very hard to make sure the first two round of stabilizations under the plan yield a good result, making requests for some small tweak dyed-in-the-whole Flakers find baffling or boring. But then for the 3rd round, I would largely bow out, having gotten the things I wanted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, I am by no means demanding that persons besides myself do the same; there is still a 3rd round of stabilization for those interested in Flakes to voice their thoughts. But I gather a lot of the tensions around Flakes is predicated on a fear that Flakes will be the only way forward, with the non-Flakes functionality legacy stuff or otherwise left to rot. I think by making sure that the non-Flakes stuff is still good, or at least leaving room for that (e.g. we can rename <code>nix search</code> to <code>nix flake search</code> leaving room for the future re-emergence of Flake-agnostic searching) we can lower the temperature a lot in the room not only for people like me, but also for people that still care about Flakes being good (in their eyes) but can rest easier with there being a "plan B".</p>

      <p dir="auto">I would say that pushing flakes through an imitation RFC process without properly addressing the criticism would damage RFC process without really adding anything to flakes (hard to get extra credibility from the process that just lost its credibility).</p>
<p dir="auto">I guess with incremental stabilisation of Flakes we could reach a state where some things can neither be stabilised via an RFC nor removed via an RFC? I don't like this outcome too much, but maybe this would at least reduce the splash damage…</p>

Saying "flakes are widely used, so we can't break interfaces even if they're not declared stable" is flawed reasoning. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/tomberek/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/tomberek">@tomberek</a> recently pointed out to me that leading figures have been encouraging users to adopt flakes since NixCon 2019. And it still happens in side channels all the time, new users being introduced with <em>literally</em> saying "it's fine, just enable experimental features, it's the right way to do things" or "it's strongly encouraged" – by whom?</p>
<p dir="auto">These are people's opinions, they are free to have them, and others are free to believe them, but the manual and the guards in the code clearly state: this interface is subject to change.</p>
<p dir="auto">Don't rely on experimental features in production, unless you know what you're doing and know how to get yourself out of a mess. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yXPQdZh8o7c?feature=share&amp;t=958" rel="nofollow">There is no deadline on stabilising the new CLI or flakes, because we don't want to get stuck with what we may end up regretting.</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not in the position to conclusively judge and not willing to opine whether the new CLI design or the flakes paradigm of organising Nix projects are the right way forward and whether the improvements in user experience are worth the sunk cost. But I'm confident with stating that the kind of signaling and narrative we have observed</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Confuses beginners, produces uncertainty, and associates these negative emotions with the project, which tend to stick due to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect#Primacy_effect" rel="nofollow">primacy effect</a></li>
<li>Reinforces distrust in Nix maintainers among new users, who we can expect soon to be the overwhelming majority</li>
<li>Exerts needless constraints and pressure on maintainers where the whole point of experimental features is, well, to be able to experiment, and therefore having the freedom to make breaking changes.</li>

          <p dir="auto">Thanks for fleshing this out (and sorry for taking that long to answer).</p>
<p dir="auto">I agree with the broad idea of stabilizing stuff incrementally. There's a huge pile of experimental stuff, ranging from “experimental on the paper, but too widely used to be changed” to “actually experimental, we might drop it tomorrow”.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem that makes this whole thing much more complex is that Flakes and the new CLI are strongly tied together:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>On the one hand, the CLI is built around Flakes as the primary interface to Nix expressions. Which means that I'm quite anxious at the idea of trying to stabilize the CLI without flakes as it would be very hard to provide something nice and consistent.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a large part of the design of Flakes is here to provide a good user interface. Being able to just run <code>nix run nixpkgs#hello</code> is magical, and that's to a large part tied to the design of flakes. Which means that inverting the order to stabilize flakes first and the CLI after would also be weird.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All that being said, I think I'd favour trying to stabilize Flakes first for consistency reasons: A Nix with Flakes but not the new CLI would be a Nix with a not-so-obviously-good feature hidden somewhere within the language (under <code>builting.getFlake</code>). However, a Nix with the new CLI but no Flakes is a Nix where the primary user interface has a huge blind spot, which is frankly bad.</p>

I still don't see any reason we cannot stabilize the parts that are not directly tied to Flakes first.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">It is perfectly OK if the CLI without Flakes isn't <em>nice</em>!</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">That full unstable CLI is still there, and we can make sure it is <em>consistent</em> with or without Flakes.</p>

<p dir="auto">OK, so the CLI without Flakes will not have <code>nix run</code>. Simple!</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Which means that inverting the order to stabilize flakes first and the CLI after would also be weird.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I don't think it is hard to stabilize <code>nix show-derivation</code> and <code>nix eval</code> without <code>nix run</code>. <code>nix run</code> doesn't affect the design of those first two plumbing commands, does it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">However, a Nix with the new CLI but no Flakes is a Nix where the primary user interface has a huge blind spot, which is frankly bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We'd be just stabilizing the plumbing commands. Blind spots are completely acceptable and expected.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">I am guessing this is a simple understanding where you thought by "stabilize flakes" I meant just the file format; I mean the file format <em>and</em> the CLI commands that are tied to it. They go together, and the value of one <em>does</em> depend on the other. Trying to stabilize those in isolation would mean we are unable to judge the merits of either properly.</p>
<p dir="auto">I do think some of those Flakes commands (like <code>nix search</code>) could be made Flakes agnostic, but as I hoped to make clear I do <em>not</em> want to block the stabilizing of anything on making them Flakes agnostic. At most, I would advocate renaming things like <code>nix flakes run</code> and <code>nix flakes search</code> to "make room" for future generalized variants.</p>

      <p dir="auto">I also disagree with that proposal. The transition from regular nix to flakes nix is not always easy and can't be done all at once. Being able to use the same store and switch back-and-forth between using flakes and not is critical to prevent splitting the userbase.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, I think this RFC opens the door to creating one or multiple experimental flake-based frontends based on the lower-level Nix Store and Nix Language. So you can still make breaking changes, but they are scoped and more experimentation is possible.</p>

I think the scope of the RFC is ok expanded, but what I would do is I would keep this RFC as a "plan" and then do RFCs separated for every step, which would go into more detail. In my view, it is ok to have an RFC that presents the context, history, reasons for the plan, and what the plan is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having something too big in scope for what we would like is inevitable at this point, as this is basically the RFC process "catching up" on years of work "outside of the process".</p>
<p dir="auto">On a different note. I fully support the plan to separate cli from core in your comments above, but I also understand if it does not happen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of container technology, Podman’s latest version, v4.6.0, includes a feature that promises to be a game-changer for system administrators: Podmansh. A login shell that leverages Podman’s robust container management capabilities. Podmansh is set to redefine the way users interact with systems, while ensuring maximum security and control for administrators.</p>







<h2>Why Podmansh?</h2>



<p>Managing access to resources is a crucial task for system administrators. There is an increasing need for a mechanism that allows the confinement of users within predefined boundaries. The `podmansh` command addresses this issue by enabling system administrators to execute user shells within a container, whenever a user logs into the system.</p>







<h2>How It Works</h2>



<p>Administrators configure users on their system to use the `/usr/bin/podmansh` command rather than a normal shell command like `/bin/bash`. When a user logs into a system setup in this manner, the Podmansh command will exec the user’s session in a rootless&nbsp; container named `podmansh`. The Podman container `podmansh` is automatically started by systemd when the user session starts, and continues running until all user sessions exit.</p>



<p>Containers that users log in are defined via <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2021/10/12/quadlet-an-easier-way-to-run-system-containers/">Quadlet</a> files. Administrators can control the visibility of the host system in the container via volumes – specified for them in a Quadlet file. Administrators can also limit the access, security privileges, as well as resource constraints of the logged in users via the Quadlet settings.</p>



<p>Administrators create Quadlet files in the /etc/containers/systemd/users directory. Systemd will then initialize it for all users upon login. For instance, an administrator can create a specific Quadlet named `Podmansh` and enable users to use the login shell /usr/bin/podmansh. These user login shells will automatically execute within the Podmansh container via Podman.</p>



<p>For more granular control, administrators can place Quadlet files in the /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID} directory for each user. Consequently, only the specified USER_ID will execute these Quadlet services when that user logs in.</p>







<h2>Setup</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, create a user login session using useradd while running as root, followed by creation of a Quadlet file in /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}.</p>



<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Fully locked down container, no access to host OS.</p>



<figure><div># useradd -s /usr/bin/podmansh lockedu# grep lockedu /etc/passwd<br>lockedu:x:4008:4008::/home/lockedu:/usr/bin/podmansh# USER_ID=$(id -u lockedu)<br># mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}<br># cat &gt; /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}/podmansh.container &lt;&lt; _EOF<br>[Unit]<br>Description=The Podmansh container<br>After=local-fs.target<p>[Container]<br>Image=registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora<br>ContainerName=podmansh<br>RemapUsers=keep-id<br>RunInit=yes<br>DropCapability=all<br>NoNewPrivileges=true</p><p>Exec=sleep infinity</p><p>[Install]<br>RequiredBy=default.target<br>_EOF</p></div></figure>



<p>Notice a few fields in the Quadlet file under the [Container] section.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Image=registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora</strong><br>This option tells Podman to download the fedora image to run the container within.&nbsp; Administrators can pick specific container images to launch users in, which could be different than the host system.</li>



<li><strong>ContainerName=podmansh<br></strong>The container name must be `podmansh` as /usr/bin/podmansh always does a `podman exec` into the `podmansh` container.</li>



<li><strong>RemapUsers=keep-id<br></strong>This option will map the user’s USER_ID as itself within the container. Without this field, the user would login as root of the user namespace.</li>



<li><strong>RunInit=yes<br></strong>This tells podman to launch an init process within the container which will cleanup any zombie processes inside of the container</li>



<li><strong>DropCapability=all</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>This option tells Podman to drop all capabilities inside of the container and prevents the container process from ever getting any capabilities on the system, even if it figured out a way to escape the container.</p>



<ol start="6">
<li><strong>NoNewPrivileges=true<br></strong>This option goes a step further and prevents the container from ever getting any new privileges in addition to capabilities.</li>



<li><strong>Exec=sleep infinity</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The last field to look at is the Exec command. Most of the time we recommend that the user’s session just goes to sleep in a Podmansh container. This prevents the session from using resources on the system.&nbsp; Since user sessions are execed into the container, they would be running the default /bin/sh inside of the container image.</p>



<p>If you really want to lock the user into the container, you could even add a flag like</p>



<p>Network=none. This option would remove all network access from the processes within the container. Meaning the container process can not reach other nodes via the network, from its point of view there is no network on the box. You could also set up the container to be ReadOnly=true, which would prevent the user from writing anywhere but on tmpfs directories in `/run` and `/tmp`.</p>



<p>Quadlet containers are removed from the system when the user’s session is exited, meaning anything that the user wrote to the container image will be removed when the user sessions terminate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next example will allow a user to save content in his home directory.</p>



<p>Example 2: Alternatively, while running as root, create a Quadlet where the user is allowed to become root within the user namespace. They can also permanently read/write content from their home directory which is a volume mounted from the actual host’s users account, rather than being inside of the container.</p>



<figure><div># useradd -s /usr/bin/podmansh confinedu<br># grep confinedu /etc/passwd<br>confinedu:x:4009:4009::/home/confinedu:/usr/bin/podmansh<br># USER_ID=$(id -u confinedu)<br># mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}<br># cat &gt; /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}/podmansh.container &lt;&lt; _EOF<br>[Unit]<br>Description=The Podmansh container<br>After=local-fs.target<p>[Container]<br>Image=registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora<br>ContainerName=podmansh<br>RemapUsers=keep-id<br>RunInit=yes</p><p>Volume=%h/data:%h:Z<br>Exec=sleep infinity</p><p>[Service]<br>ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p %h/data</p><p>[Install]<br>RequiredBy=default.target<br>_EOF</p></div></figure>



<p>Notice in this example the first four fields in the [Container] structure are the same as the previous example. And the Exec command is still `sleep infinity`. But we removed the security lockdowns of DropCapabilties and NoNewPrivileges. Without these restrictions the user session can become root within his user namespace and could do certain privileged activities like installing packages (even though they currently will not persist). Realize that this is a rootless container, which means the user processes are not really root (uid=0) on the host system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of additional lines have been added to the Quadlet.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Volume=%h/data:%h:Z<br></strong>This line tells Podman to volume mount the data directory in the users homedir into the container onto his homedir. The :Z tells SELinux systems to label the data directory to match the containers label. %h tells systemd to expand this field into the user’s homedir when calling Podman. Since the `data` directory is volume mounted into the container it will survive outside of the container for use the next time the users logs into the system.</li>



<li><strong>[Service]<br>ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p %h/data</strong><br>This section tells systemd to precreate the data directory in the user’s home directory on the host before launching the container.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Alternatively, while running as root, create a Quadlet where the user is allowed to become root within the user namespace. They can also permanently read/write content from their home directory which is volume mounted from the actual host’s user’s account, rather than being inside of the container.</p>



<figure><div># useradd -s /usr/bin/podmansh volumeu<br># grep volumeu /etc/passwd<br>volumeu:x:4010:4010::/home/volumeu:/usr/bin/podmansh<br># USER_ID=$(id -u volumeu)<br># mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}<br># cat &gt; /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}/podmansh.container &lt;&lt; _EOF<br>[Unit]<br>Description=The Podmansh container<br>After=local-fs.target<p>[Container]<br>Image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9<br>ContainerName=podmansh<br>RemapUsers=keep-id<br>RunInit=yes</p><p>Device=/dev/nvidia123Volume=/secret/data:/secret:ro<br>Exec=sleep infinity</p><p>[Install]<br>RequiredBy=default.target<br>_EOF</p></div></figure>



<p>Notice in this last example that two fields were added to allow read-only access to a specific volume on the host, and an nVidia device was added to the container. The image was changed to ubi9 to highlight the fact that you can have multiple Podmansh Quadlets, one for each user, and these Quadlets can use different images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of additional lines have been added to the Quadlet.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Device=/dev/nvidia123</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The device line will add this device to the container to be used by the user session</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>&nbsp;Volume=/secret/data:/secret:ro<br></strong>This line tells Podman to volume mount the /secret/data directory as /secret inside of the container as a read only mount. The idea here would be to allow apps within the container image to use the device to process data in the /secret directory.</li>
</ol>



<p>This last example would allow administrators to expose different parts of the system to different users depending on their security level.</p>



<h2>Security &amp; Confidentiality</h2>



<p>Users are confined to their container environment with all the security mechanisms in place, including SELinux. Any system information that becomes available within the container is strictly limited to volumes leaked into the container, ensuring a high level of security and isolation.<br></p>



<h2>Seamless Operation</h2>



<p>Once a user session starts, systemd automatically creates the associated container. As all connections to the user session are removed, systemd takes down the container. This means users can log into the system multiple times, with each session connecting to the same container, providing a seamless user experience.</p>



<p>Moreover, administrators have the power to expose specific host data from the host system to the user through volumes. This can be done without exposing the user to other parts of the system, maintaining the integrity and security of the overall system.<br></p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>In conclusion, Podman v4.6’s new feature, Podmansh, is set to revolutionize how system administrators manage user access and control, all while maintaining an impressive level of security and confidentiality. It’s a groundbreaking step in the world of container technology, providing a new way for users to interact with systems.</p>

<section>
<p>After learning a little bit more about web accessibility last year I had been exploring some of the less common <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements, and making changes to this website, like wrapping the text of the posts on this blog in <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags and adding a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag in the website’s layout templates (this website is built using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a>).</p>
<p>I had previously done some work to make sure that <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> elements were layed out nicely for images with associated captions, and I had been impressed with various <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurser’s</a> implementation of footnotes or sidenotes<sub id="footnote-1-link"><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/#footnote-1">1</a></sub>, and have been thinking it would be interesting to see what other interesting layouts were possible with just HTML.</p>
<p>I could, element by element, continue to add support (mostly by making <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> updates for each element to fit in with the rest of my style choices) as I came across specific needs for them, but not one to shy away from an exhaustive exploration, I decided to write this post and attempt to use every element.</p>
<p>A goal of the post, was to avoid delaying other future posts with CSS updates on a previously unused element, but in reality it took a year and a half to make all the updates for just this post! I am using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs list of HTML elements</a> as a reference which has more than 100 tags divided into a few categories, which I will also use in this post. Many of the tags like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> don’t make sense to include in the text of a blog post, but if you’re viewing this post on <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/">patrickweaver.net</a>, then every one of the elements is used somewhere on this page.</p>

<h2>The Elements</h2>
<section id="main-root">
<h3>Main Root</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t have to make any changes to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag for this post, but one thing I don’t always remember to include is the <code>lang</code> property (in this case <code>lang="en"</code>).</p>
</section>
<section id="document-metadata">
<h3>Document Metadata</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base"><code>&lt;base&gt;</code></a></li>

<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta"><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a></li>

<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn’t familiar with the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag before writing this post, though I’ve now added one with relative links to my layout templates. This caused a few issues with things like local development, and relative links, though they were easily resolved. The rest of the metadata tags are familiar and were already here.</p>

<p>Like the Document metadata tags, in the layout, though it was interesting to read the documentation and learn about attributes, like <code>onbeforeprint</code> that provides functionality I’ve used more hacky methods to accomplish previously, and <code>onblur</code>, whose primary utility seems to be annoying popups.</p>

</ul>
<p>When I first looked at the list I assumed that <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> would be designed exclusively for mailing addresses, but was surprised to see that it can be used for email addresses, and even links. I updated the email address on the About page of site site, but I’ll add an <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> below also:</p>
<address>
    <p>Email Patrick:</p>
    <a href="mailto:hello.patrickw@gmail.com">hello.patrickw@gmail.com</a>
</address>
<p>As I mentioned above, I updated the blog post page template to use the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, but reading the documentation, I’m now wondering if it would fit on every page of the site.</p>
<p>I’m now using <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> elements, which represent, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside">a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document’s main content</q>, to wrap around my footnotes at the bottom of this page (though I may try to style them as sidenotes in the future). The current design of this website doesn’t have a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, but I’ve added one to this blog post, and while I had a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element on the page header previously, I now know that more than one is acceptable so there is one around the header section of each blog posts as well.</p>
<h4>Heading elements</h4>
<p>As part of the style update and cleanup of this site that inspired this post I realized I was often using headers with incorrect hierarchy, which I cleaned up. Though I never reached 6 levels of headers, the closest I got was <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> in some of the blog posts with multiple sections and subsections.</p>
<h5>How to use top level headings</h5>
<p>It is a little bit unclear how to use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags in a post like this from just the MDN documentation. This <a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/Use_h1_for_Title">tip from the W3C</a> suggests different implementations for pages with standalone, or collection content, which would make it difficult to use the same templates and styles for different pages on this site.</p>
<h6>How I decided to handle it</h6>
<p>Before writing this post I had updated the site to use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the name of the site (my name) at the top, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the section name, for this page, “Blog”, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for the title of what would be the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> on a page. However, after reading the documentation and the tip above, I decided to update the hierarchy and use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for different things on different pages, and use classes for styles, which is probably more in line with the separation of concerns of HTML and CSS (which means this paragraph is below an <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Sometime between when I started this experiment in early 2022 and when I published it in Summer 2023 <code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> were added to the MDN documentation (which I realize is not the official spec). I’ve added an <code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code> around the heading of this section, with a subtitle <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> is a semantic element that indicates that an input can be used for search, not for search results (with the exception of quick results that populate within a form ). While a <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> element that contains a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> works without HTML on a website that can generate search results on a server, because this website is statically generated the example below requires JavaScript. I haven’t seen a <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> element anywhere else, neither MDN’s header search, or google.com use it in 2023.</p>

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD013 -->
<p>The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element was one of the initial curiosities that led me down the path of reading about and implementing every element, though it wasn’t until I read through the MDN list that I added a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element around the menu at the top of this page. I’ve added <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements to this post, but I’m not sure how often I will use them elsewhere. One reason is that it makes it harder to mix and match HTML and markdown with visually clear nesting in the <a href="https://github.com/patrickweaver/pw20/blob/main/build/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element.md">document where I am writing this post</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>I had previously used <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> for embedding tweets into blog posts, but for this post I decided to add styles for standalone quotes. I didn’t know about the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> <code>cite</code> property or <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element until reading the docs more closely:</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote#attributes">
        <h4><code>cite</code></h4>
        <p>A URL that designates a source document or message for the information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining the context or the reference for the quote.</p>
    <figcaption><cite>MDN</cite> on <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></figcaption>
</blockquote></figure>
<p><code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> are elements that, after finding out about them when first looking into more obscure HTML elements, I was very surprised to have not known about sooner. Although, it’s unclear from the documentation whether lists like the links on the current version of my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220628123804/https://www.patrickweaver.net/portfolio/">portfolio page</a> should use <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> (I’m currently using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>). I am curious how <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> became part of almost every “Intro to HTML” class, but <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> is relatively obscure. It’s also strange that <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> have default margins, but for <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> the margin is on <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4>HTML list elements</h4>
<dl>
    <dt><code>dl</code></dt><dd>Description list</dd>
    <dt><code>ol</code></dt><dd>Ordered list</dd>
    <dt><code>ul</code></dt><dd>Unordered list</dd>
</dl>
<p><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has acquired a bad reputation on the modern web due to overuse, so I was surprised to be using relatively few <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, though once I started using elements that I wanted to style together, I ended up with around 20. It shows how unnecessary most <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s probably are, though this site has minimal generic “sections”.</p>
<p>Among the first more obscure elements that I added to this site were <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>. I was adding some blog posts that had originally been published on Medium, and wanted to add captions below images in a web-semantically correct way. Though after reading the documentation, which says <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> can be used for, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure#usage_notes">image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc.,</q> I realized that there are a lot of places where I currently have code blocks that I could be using them.</p>
<p>I have always liked <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> elements a lot, but I’m never sure when to use them. The documentation says, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr#try_it">While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS</q> which made me revisit the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> styles on this site and I decided to include an emoji in an <code>hr:after</code> rule, though I should check how that works on a screen reader.</p>
<p>The items in the (inline styled) lists of elements on this page are of course <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements, though I had never looked at the documentation until now. It’s interesting that the same <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is used in both <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> lists, with quirks like <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#attributes">The value attribute has no meaning for unordered lists</q>, but is not used to wrap the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> elements in a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I had not encountered <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> before writing this post, and I was initially surprised that it survived to HTML 5 (while <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menuitem"><code>&lt;menuitem&gt;</code></a> didn’t) because modern browsers treat it as essentially a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. Researching further <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Basic_text">on Wikipedia</a> I read:</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Basic_text">MENU existed in HTML Tags, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; deprecated in HTML 4.0 Transitional; invalid in HTML 4.0 Strict; then redefined in HTML5, but removed in HTML 5.2,</blockquote>
</figure>and now I don’t know what to think, but here’s a <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code>:

<p><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> are some of the HTML elements I used in my earliest web pages, and more recently I try to use <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with CSS in places that are semantically lists, but might not be styled like a traditional list.</p>
<p>I was surprised not to find more guidance on using <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p">the MDN docs</a>, something I wonder often when adding non long form text to a website is, “is this really a paragraph?” But, it seems like as far as HTML is concerned, if it’s not a heading, then probably!</p>
<p>Before reading the documentation I had really only considered using <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags along with <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags for code blocks, but the example used on MDN is used to show how <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> can display meaningful whitespace for things like:</p>
<figure><pre role="img" aria-label="An ASCII picture of a house with the label, 'in this house we write semantic HTML'">  ┏┓
  ┃┃╱╲ in
  ┃╱╱╲╲ this
  ╱╱╭╮╲╲house

<p>As with other very common tags I was curious to get to the documentation for <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> to see if there was anything I was unaware of, or had been using incorrectly. I was surprised to discover that <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> links to the top of the page after years as just using it as a placeholder when I didn’t know the URL yet.</p>
<p><code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> seems likely to be the least used tag, especially because the MDN documentation doesn’t make a great case for it <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr#default_styling">the purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author.</q></p>
<p>The distinction between <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, as the docs have it, is not what I had previously thought (that <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> was the HTML5 replacement for <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>). I think the distinction is more nuanced and overlapping than the technical nature of the documentation is really able to convey. The way I will probably explain it to other people in the future is that, for the most part, you should use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for <b>single words</b> (or compound words), <strong>and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for whole sentences or phrases</strong>. This is more a rule of thumb and bypasses the actual distinction. The documentation reads:</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote>
        The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element is for content that is of greater importance, while the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it’s more important.
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>
        <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong#b_vs._strong">MDN on “<code>&lt;b&gt;</code> vs. <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>”</a></cite>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But I can’t think of many instances where I would want to draw attention to a word, where that word is not more important than other words. The recommendation seems to be from a reality where, for the most part, all words are of equal importance, but deserve different amounts of attention, which doesn’t seem very common.</p>
<p>I’ll probably think of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> from now on as the HTML tag with a similar effect as the quotation marks used for “emphasis” you might see on signage that can cause intergenerational confusion.</p>
<p><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> is a tag for a concept that I hadn’t considered until now, text whose direction might (or might not) differ from the direction of the surrounding text. The examples on the documentation are all names, but could stand in for any user inputted text. In the future I will probably try to wrap any tags, like the ones controlled by the input below, that might contain arbitrary user inputted unicode characters in a <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> tag just to be safe.</p>

<p>Hello, <bdi id="bdi-name-display">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</bdi>, thanks for reading!</p>



<p><code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> I will probably use less often because I don’t work with RTL languages often, but it is still good to know how to handle small amounts of RTL text, like this link to the page for HTML on the Farsi Wikipedia: <a href="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%DA%86%E2%80%8C%D8%AA%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%85%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%84" target="_blank"><bdo dir="rtl">اچ‌تی‌ام‌ال</bdo></a>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is interesting to me, because for a time (a long time ago) it seemed to be as misused as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has been recently, but, as CSS has gotten more robust that is probably less often the case; though I wonder if it is still taught early in HTML classes. It’s interesting that the example use case in the docs is poetry because it makes me wonder how the grey area between a paragraph and a standalone line was considered in creating the HTML spec. It also seems like a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag might be a better fit in some cases.</p>
<p><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> are interesting because they try to add HTML semantic elements for meaning that is also conveyed by visible punctuation in most languages. It’s the kind of redundancy that underscores repetitiousness of working with computers (the default style for <cite>cite</cite> uses italics while <q cite="this is not really a quotation">q</q> adds quotation marks not in the text.).</p>
<p>I’ve clearly used many <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements in this post so far, but reading the documentation made me wonder whether the recently released Markdown support in Google Docs uses <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> for text, but on inspecting the HTML of a Doc, I remembered that <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is used to render the document now.</p>
<p>Occasionally the MDN documentation examples are difficult to mentally translate to real-world use cases. <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> is one of these, where the ony examples show a <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> element with a <code>value</code> property with product IDs wrapped around product names In that case the IDs seem either, user facing, in which case it would probably be better to display them to the user, or non user facing, in which case, I’m not sure who the “data” is for. Interestingly, <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> doesn’t seem to appear in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/">W3C HTML5 specification</a>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> is another strange element because it seems like it is misnamed, as it wraps, not the definition of a term, but instead that term within the definition. It does <a href="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">only seem to have been part of the never officially adopted HTML 2.0 proposal</a>, and it exemplifies the academic nature of the early web. The <a href="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">HTML Tags: Past, Present, Proposed</a> page on martinrinehart.com defines <dfn title="Hyper Text Markup Language 2.0">HTML 2.0</dfn> as <q cite="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">There never was an HTML 2.0 standard, but these all shaped browser development in the late 20th century</q> with references to several RFC documents.</p>
<p><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> bring up similar usage questions as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, but in my opinion with even more nuance, especially, as the documentation notes, with other more specific tags like <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> that also by default italicize text in most browsers. The rule of thumb from above also for the most part fits here, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for single words, and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for sentences or phrases, though the examples in the documentation seem to mostly use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for drawing attention to potential confusion, as in, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em#i_vs._em">The word <i>the</i> is an article</q>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> is another tag that makes me wonder about the conceptual boundaries of the usage of the tag. It is intended for specifying keys on a computer keyboard, for example: to type the <code>&lt;</code> character used for (the non escaped) version of the tags in this post, I press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> (the styles here on <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> are applied through custom CSS). But I’m curious if it would also be appropriate to put a <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> around something like <i>Right click</i> (in this case I used <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> instead).</p>
<p><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> is interesting because it suggests a 2-way authoring web that was originally envisioned, but failed to come to fruition, with usage notes like, <q>Think of this like using a <mark>highlighter pen</mark> in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.</q> The yellow here is the default style in all major browsers.</p>
<p><code>&lt;rp&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code> all relate to rendering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate_(typography)">“ruby” or “agate” fonts</a>, which are the smallest legible text used in print. They are used in HTML to, <q>provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography.</q> Because I don’t read any East Asian languages, I’ll use the same example as the MDN docs do below. Interestingly, <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> is used to hide parentheses characters, which are included in the source. It’s surprising to me that there is an element to hide these characters in a very rare instance, but we still rely on CSS to <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html#hiding-content-visually">hide content visually</a> (but still show it to screen readers).</p>
<ruby>
漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>kan</rt><rp>)</rp>
字 <rp>(</rp><rt>ji</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>
<p><code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is the strikethrough element, which should be used to indicate text that is not accurate or relevant, but was previously. Along with <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> it is one of two elements (or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u#usage_notes">according to MDN 3 with <code>&lt;u&gt;</code></a>) that were <a href="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">deprecated in HTML 4.01, and un-deprecated and redefined in HTML5</a>. The redefinition changes the use of the tag from presentational, which should now be achieved with CSS, to relevant to the context of the text. However, some screen readers don’t announce the strikethrough, which seems potentially confusing. I’ve added the CSS recommended by the MDN docs to my website, so the strikethrough should be announced here.</p>
<ul>
  <li><s>HTML 3.0: <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is used for presentation</s></li>
  <li>HTML 5: <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is used for removed text</li>
</ul>
<p><code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> is another element I wasn’t aware of before reading the MDN docs. It is used for rendering the output of a computer program, which I had previously just used <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> for (I just updated my <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/how-to-raspberry-pi-server/">Raspberry Pi blog post</a> to use <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code>). Another example is below:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>A “Hello, World” program in JavaScript:</figcaption>
<code>
console.log("Hello, World")
</code>
<p>
<samp>
Hello, World
</samp></p></figure>
<p><code>&lt;small&gt;</code> is used to render smaller text, which is something I would usually have done with CSS. The MDN docs don’t provide much clarity about which strategy to use: <q>Authors are encouraged to use their best judgement when determining whether to use <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> or CSS.</q>. <small>I will probably continue to use CSS for the most part since the effect seems to be presentational for the most part.</small></p>
<p><code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is a very familiar element, but reading the documentation made me wonder for the first time why HTML and CSS allow contradictory element styles like a </p><p><code>&lt;div style="display: inline" /&gt;</code></p><p> or a <span><code>&lt;span style="display: block" /&gt;</code></span>. Though the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> breaks the parent <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, while the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> does not.</p>
<p><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> (used for footnotes here) and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> (used in the equation below) are more elements I probably have used the CSS implementations of previously (though it is appropriate for presentation only super or subscript.)</p>
<p><code>&lt;time&gt;</code> seems like a helpful element for creating semantic HTML, but even Google doesn’t seem to use it in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patrick+Weaver%22+%22HTML%22">search results</a>. I’ve updated the dates on my blog posts to use it.</p>
<p><code>&lt;u&gt;</code> has probably my favorite quote from the MDN docs, <q>Most of the time, you actually don’t want to use <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>.</q> Their strongest recommendation seems to be indicating <u>spellling</u> errors.</p>
<p><code>&lt;var&gt;</code> is a way to indicate semantically that a string is a variable for either math or programming. For example, rendering the pythagorean theorem uses both <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>: <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> was also a new element until now, but it solves a problem I have hit many times before, breaking long “words” at certain points, specifically URLs. If I put a <code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> element at clear break points in this URL: <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/averylongurlwithoutanypunctuationbutstillmadeupofwords/">https://www.patrickweaver.net<wbr>/pages<wbr>/a<wbr>very<wbr>long<wbr>url<wbr>without<wbr>any<wbr>punctuation<wbr>but<wbr>still<wbr>made<wbr>up<wbr>of<wbr>words/</a> then it will break at clear points at different screen widths, which is is more readable compared to the same link without the <code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> elements:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/averylongurlwithoutanypunctuationbutstillmadeupofwords/">https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/averylongurlwithoutanypunctuationbutstillmadeupofwords/</a></p>
<p>Though including hyphen characters in the URL also creates clear breakpoints in modern browsers. I did have to wrap the URL above in a special scrollable <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to prevent it from breaking the layout of the rest of the page.</p>

<p><code>&lt;area&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> are elements that I hadn’t been familiar with previously, even though I had made a few image map type websites in the days before CSS 3. It seems like an indication of how seldom they are used these days that the tools for debugging the boundaries of <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> elements are hard to use. One <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> border at a time will display while using tab focus, but styling the elements does not work (unless there is a <code>display</code> hack I couldn’t figure out). It’s also somewhat strange that <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> is essentially an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> with a shape.</p>
<p>Here’s a <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> (with <code>&lt;area&gt;</code>s on each tag linking to MDN) of a handwritten HTML document I made for June 3rd’s <a href="https://html.energy/events.html">HTML Day Freewrite</a> in SF.</p>

<p><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> is one of the classic multimedia HTML 5 tags so I’ve used it before, but thinking about it now, it’s surprising I don’t see them more often in the 2020s. I would guess that there are more in use than I thought, for example, the <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> player uses a hidden <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element even though the UI is a custom mix of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s inside a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> oddly enough.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>A recording of me reading the paragraph above. (Excuse my scratchy late night voice)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is of course one of the first elements I used, but I was curious what properties could be used with it that I might not have heard of. <code>srcset</code>, used for specifying multiple sizes of the same image to load at different screen resolutions, was one of those. I’ve created a demo below, which goes against the spirit of <code>srcset</code>.</p>
<p>The image below has 3 images provided to its <code>srcset</code> property:</p>
<ol>
<li>A yellow background and a monospace font that is 300 pixels wide and should render when the page is less than 520 pixels wide</li>
<li>A blue background and a serifed font that should render when the page is between 520 and 800 pixels wide</li>
<li>A green background and a script font that should render when the page is greater than 800 pixels wide.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-700.png" srcset="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-300.png 300w, https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-500.png 500w, https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-700.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 300px, (max-width: 800px) 500px, 700px" alt="A demo of the srcset property of the HTML <img> tag that loads different images at different sizes" id="image-with-srcset"></p>
<p>I have tested it, and it does work, but it takes a lot of forethought to make sure that you will be able to load the correct image. Things like the browser’s cache, and scaled displays will change the behavior. If you want to see the effect you will probably need to load the page in a private window on a non scaled or “retina” display.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that while both <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> are less widely used than <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> even after their introduction in HTML 5, the distribution of videos online seems to be centralized, mostly on YouTube, while audio is more decentralized, with people serving individual files when distributing things like podcasts, even though the audio player that is often used is not on the web.</p>

</figure>
<p>One reason for this may be that there are still some quirks with <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements. For example, there is a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> accompanying the video above, but when I initially tried creating the element with a self closing tag it did not render. Also, as I’m writing this, Safari does not support the video at all, likely because of the development server I am using not supporting the “Range” request header. I am curious to find out whether the hosted version of the site (on GitHub pages) will support playing the video in Safari. I thought that I might have a similar issue with <code>&lt;track&gt;</code>, but that just turned out to be me not setting up my <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> build correctly for <code>.vtt</code> files.</p>

<h3>Embedded Content</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed"><code>&lt;embed&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a></li>

<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source"><code>&lt;source&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is somewhat surprising that <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> have not been deprecated since most of their uses have been superseded by specific tags like <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. Maybe eventually they will be, or they will just live on in the name of backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>Speaking of <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> it’s also interesting that the very 90s name “iframe” (“inline frame”, not “iPod Frame” or something, and I was surprised to learn does render <code>display: inline</code>) has survived while <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> was deprecated in HTML 5. I thought that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> might be a way to force the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <code>srcset</code> example above to render the smaller images on a high DPI display, but even at 150px wide on my device the large image still renders:</p>
<figure>

<p><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> is a tag that is, with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> actually intended for layout tricks like the <code>srcset</code> experiment I tried above, rendering different versions of an image in different situations. The image below should show an icon of a computer when used with a mouse/trackpad, or an icon of a phone when used with a touch screen (using the <code>pointer</code> media query to determine), and should fall back to an image of a red circle with a line through it when neither media query is appropriate. The responsive design developer tools in your browser should trick it, though interestingly, not when inspecting an element.</p>

<p><code>&lt;portal&gt;</code> is one of the more mysterious sounding elements, and seems intended for the iPad-style link previews that I’ve seen implemented on some websites on hover, <a href="https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/">but also come with SPA-like performance benefits</a>. It unfortunately is still an experimental feature and isn’t (as of 2023) enabled by default in any browsers. It seems that it <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/portals-in-chrome-going-on-a-test-drive-66b16971fb19">used to be an available experimental flag in Chrome</a>, but today in 2023 it is not available at <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a>. I’ll include one below in case it works for future readers! I did try it in an very old Chromium version I still had installed. <code>&lt;portal&gt;</code> doesn’t seem to be part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/">HTML 5 Spec</a>, I’m not sure why it’s included in the MDN documentation.</p>

<p>This is an interesting section of the documentation because it pairs one of the most ubiquitous elements with one of the most obscure. <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements are everywhere, especially that tools like Figma and Sketch have made them easy to prototype and export. Pairing them with <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> in the documentation evokes a more artisanal, hand-crafted <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> that is relatively uncommon these days. I’ve gone hand-crafted here and drawn some <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> circles.</p>

<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="white" fill="white" width="200"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="49" fill="red"></circle><circle cx="47" cy="50" r="42" fill="orange"></circle><circle cx="50" cy="53" r="35" fill="yellow"></circle><circle cx="55" cy="52" r="28" fill="green"></circle><circle cx="52" cy="48" r="21" fill="indigo"></circle><circle cx="54" cy="50" r="14" fill="blue"></circle><circle cx="52" cy="55" r="7" fill="violet"></circle></svg>

<p><code>&lt;math&gt;</code> is really a wrapper element for other non HTML elements from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/" target="_blank">MathML</a> namespace, so I guess I don’t have to include every possible child element here. I’ll stick to something simple: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></math>

</ul>
<p>I did a deep dive into <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, specifically <a href="https://doodles.patrickweaver.net/canvas-lines/">drawing crisp lines</a> in 2020 while I was at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>. One thing I wasn’t familiar with before reading the MDN docs though, was that there is a maximum size for a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element in each browser (though all modern browsers it is about 32 thousand pixels in each dimension). Below is a re-implementation of <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> (and <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><label for="toggleMarqueeButton">Start or Stop the fake <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>:</label>
</p>


<p>There were a lot of tags that I expected to feel a little out of date when I started this post, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> wasn’t one of them, but now that I have written most of the post, and have created a few <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, I’m realizing how little I use them now. For most of the code that I write, even though most of it is JavaScript, all of the “scripting” gets put into on <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag by build tools and it ends up feeling more like boilerplate than a “markup” tag.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for most of the interactive websites I’ve made, I’ve rarely included a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag with the exception of those minified and compiled single page apps where the user would likely get a blank page if it weren’t for the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag (and even then, probably less often than I should have, though I’ve made sure to include one with every <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag here).</p>

<p>It’s not a new insight that <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements were overused for layout purposes on the early web, but an irony that I’m only realizing now is that recently, as the web has gotten more and more populated by data, that <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements have become rarely used, probably mostly due to their clunky default design, but probably also because one main goal of creating a web UI for the data that is otherwise probably stored in database tables, is to create a <i>different</i> view of the same data.</p>
<p>I don’t have any tabular data as this is an exclusively <em>document</em> based blog post, but below I’ve added a table with some custom CSS and “data” on emoji that is likely only accurate for the Apple emoji set in 2023. I wasn’t familiar with <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> before, but I don’t know that there are many cases where I would use them rather than a more custom, non <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> design.</p>

<h3>Interactive Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details"><code>&lt;details&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog"><code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary"><code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> combination is probably the most common, “You don’t need JavaScript to…” element (another <a href="https://catskull.net/html.html" target="_blank">popular blog</a> post making this point prompted me to finally finish this one). Making this kind of expand/collapse interactive view was one of the first things I used JavaScript for (it was probably jQuery). I remember it being somewhat confusing at the time (2006?), so it’s funny to me to see it so easy with just a couple HTML tags.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Speculation about <code>&lt;details&gt;</code></summary>
  <p>I do wonder if <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> were being considered for the HTML spec today, if they would be withdrawn in favor of a similar effect using CSS.</p>
</details>
<p>I wasn’t aware of the HTML only <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> before using it here. It requires JavaScript to be useful beyond just its stylistic impact, but it’s an interesting way to create interactions that are more custom than <code>alert()</code>, but still simple, because while <code>alert()</code> is styled by the browser <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> can be styled with CSS.</p>

<h3>Web Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot"><code>&lt;slot&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Web components had been on a (long) list of “things I should learn more about” for a while, so I was glad to get to this section of the MDN documentation. I was surprised that JavaScript (and <code>Class</code> syntax at that) was necessary to get web components to render, but after reading more about the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM">Shadow DOM</a>, it makes sense, because HTML has no built in way to encapsulate styles, though it does seem to be somewhat similar conceptually to <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p>I’ve used web components below to create a table of contents for this post below, though I’m not making the best use of them. One thing I couldn’t quickly figure out how to do, when compared to components from frontend frameworks, is pass in properties that are themselves used as properties of elements in the child template, so in the list below I have to pass a full <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element into each child (which renders the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>), to be able to set the correct <code>href</code> property. Someday after finishing this post I will read more about web components and maybe figure out something I’m missing now.</p>

<p>There are of course a few <big>deprecated</big> <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> elements, so why not <span color="#2FCF6F" face="times" size="5">include</span> them here at the end.</p>
<p>Everyone’s favorite is of course,</p>
<center><code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code></center>
<p><marquee>Hello!</marquee></p>
<p>Many of the elements, like <code>&lt;big&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;acronym&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> (used above), <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strike&gt;</code> are examples of layout related functionality that has been moved to CSS rather than <strike>have HTML handle it</strike>. The narrow box below has an example of <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code>:</p>
<div id="nobr-box">
    <nobr>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code>.</nobr>
    <p>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> with <code>style="white-space: nowrap;"</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>There are some other strange ones as well though. I couldn’t implement <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;shadow&gt;</code> here because they were never fully implemented part of the web components spec. I’ll add some below anyway though.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>And <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code> is a very <i>webserver</i> version of <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> for listing directories. Since my Eleventy static site generator does use directories here’s a list:</p>
<dir>
    <li><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog">/blog</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/portfolio">/portfolio</a></li>
</dir>
<p>Some of deprecated elements won’t render without some extra work, for example <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> are designed to be used instead of a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, for I guess some kind of collage web page made up of other pages. I’ve ironically only been able to use them inside of an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> below.</p>
<figure>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>I expected that <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> wouldn’t work since the MDN documentation says:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/image">
    This does not appear to have been part of any formal specification. It was mentioned in HTML+ Discussion Document - Dave Raggett, November 8, 1993 (Section 5.9 - Images), but was not part of the first revision of HyperText Markup Language Specification - 2.0 in 1994.
</blockquote>
<p>But it does seem to work in some browsers in 2023, though this might be just a fallback for potential confusion with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/fax.png" width="100">An icon of a fax machine</p>
<p>One of the more interesting browser compatibility stories of the deprecated elements is <code>&lt;menuitem&gt;</code>, which supposedly was <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=menuitem">partially supported in Firefox versions 8 - 84</a>, but I couldn’t get <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_menuitem">an example</a> to work in any of the older versions I installed locally (even with editing <code>about:config</code>). The examples imply that the <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> (of <code>type=context</code>) and child <code>&lt;menuitem&gt;</code> elements shouldn’t render until the element whose <code>contextmenu</code> property is right clicked, but as you can see below, the items always render:</p>


<p>It’s surprising that <code>&lt;noembed&gt;</code>, essentially a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> style fallback, was deprecated while <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> was kept in the spec. Here’s my <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> from above, but this time with a <code>&lt;noembed&gt;</code> child. There is also <code>&lt;noframes&gt;</code> which I included above with the <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> element.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>An <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;noembed&gt;</code> tag child.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s unclear why <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> ever existed instead of just using attributes on the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element. When I started this blog post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220330125752/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">it was listed in the “Embedding Content” section</a>, but by the time I finished it was deprecated. Here is one below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>An <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> tag child.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>&lt;plaintext&gt;</code> is another weird one, and notable among the deprecated elements in that it works. It is another one I am going to have to wrap in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> because otherwise the rest of the page would be rendered as the source code:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>An embed of a <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/plaintext-element/" target="_blank">page</a> with a <code>&lt;plaintext&gt;</code> element.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, <code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code>, used in a similar way, have closing tags </p><xmp><span id="xmp-element">
so they can be used here for displaying source code
</span></xmp> or text in a monospace font<tt>
<span id="tt-element">as it would be shown on a teletype</span>
</tt> without an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.
<p>A few of the deprecated elements have just been replaced by newer additions to the spec. <code>&lt;rb&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;rtc&gt;</code> were used for displaying pronunciation of East Asian characters, but it seems like the spec was simplified. Here is the example from MDN:</p>
<p><ruby xml:lang="zh-Hant"><rbc><rb>馬</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>mǎ</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>來</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>lái</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>西</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>xī</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>亞</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>yà</rt><rp>)</rp></rbc><rtc xml:lang="en"><rp>(</rp><rt>Malaysia</rt><rp>)</rp></rtc></ruby></p>
</section>
<section id="other-elements">
<h3>Other Elements</h3>
<p>I consulted a few other lists of HTML tags after realizing that the <code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code> tag wasn’t in my list from MDN (there’s one below this paragraph)</p>
<!-- The only reference to HTML comments on MDN seems to be in the web APIs section: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Comment -->
<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520111045/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">older list from MDN in 2013</a> has elements like <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>, and for accessibility reasons, <q cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520111045/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">almost all browsers currently ignore this element.</q> I’ll add one hidden below if you can find a very old browser that supports it:</p>


<p>Also on the list is <code>&lt;spacer&gt;</code>, which doesn’t work in modern browsers and,</p>

<p>would now be done</p>

<p>with CSS.</p>
<p>Then there’s others like <code>&lt;bgsound&gt;</code> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004002320/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bgsound" target="_blank">2013 docs</a>) that seems to have never been implemented (except maybe in Netscape?), but alludes to a vision for a much more <em>multimedia</em> enabled web documents, and <code>&lt;isindex&gt;</code> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916195848/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/isindex" target="_blank">2013 docs</a>) which seems like it is from a world where JavaScript doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Another attempt at <code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> was</p>
<listing><span id="listing-child">listing</span></listing>
<p>I’m surprised it seems to still work!</p>
<p>And of course <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>, but I’m not even going to try with that one.</p>

    <p>Listening to Daft Punk every now and then is a never aging event for me. Their albums have a variety of musical diversity, and you can always enjoy their fairly repetitive songs on boring household activities. ‘One more time, we’re gonna celebrateh! Oh yeah, Don’t stop the washing!’ Well, one of the most influential electronic duos of the millennium had plenty of tricks in their bag to put into their music. Today, I will try to introduce three of them with examples.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-psychoacoustics">
  What is Psychoacoustics?
  <a href="#what-is-psychoacoustics">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Psychoacoustics is an area that includes sound perception and audiology. The area studies psychological responses to auditory events, and the field is as extensive as acoustics, psychology, sound and electronic engineering, physics, and biology. The human auditory system is a complex system that starts from our pinna (your visible ear) and continues to the ear canal, membrane, auditory ossicles, cochlea, lateral superior olive, and medial superior olivary and travels in your brain to hear what is vibrating over the air. Everything we experience has a processing time of milliseconds. Perhaps that shows how fast and strong the human brain is. Although we have such a capable auditory system, scientists have shown that our perception may play some tricks when it comes to audio recognition. And by that, I don’t mean the physical mechanism but psychologically induced ones. Those findings show that hearing is also cultural; different cultures may hear differently.</p>
<h3 id="continuity-effect--phonemic-restoration-effect">
  Continuity Effect &amp; Phonemic restoration effect
  <a href="#continuity-effect--phonemic-restoration-effect">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>If a sound is interrupted by a noise with enough loudness in a short interval, we tend to hear the sound continuously. One can create gaps less than 200ms in a tone and fill those gaps with a particular noise which will hide the gaps for you. The shortness of duration combined with the noise, our brains tend to hear a continuous sound signal. Phonemic restoration slightly differs from the continuity effect. This time our brain “fills” the gaps of missing sounds. Our brain acts meddlesome in favor of increased intelligibility, even though the sound lacks information. We observe this phenomenon in the popular Daft Punk song: “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” If you start listening around 2:20, you will experience the various cuts. (most noticeable around 2:50)</p>

<h3 id="the-octave-illusion-deutschs-octave-illusion">
  The Octave Illusion (Deutsch’s Octave Illusion)
  <a href="#the-octave-illusion-deutschs-octave-illusion">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>The Octave Illusion is one of the most interesting psychoacoustic illusions, first discovered by Diana Deutsch in 1973. The illusion works as follows: Two tones, one with higher and one with lower pitch, play in our ears in an alternating fashion visualized as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ugu.rs/images/alternating.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is one octave between the tones. If the alternation is short enough, you will hear the higher tone in one ear and the lower in the other. Your handedness plays a role here. Right-handed people tend to hear the higher pitch in the right ear. If you are left-handed or ambidexter your perception may vary. For this illusion, our example comes from the Discovery album. Open the song Aerodynamic and fast-forward to 2:28, start listening to the passage. I hear the higher pitch on my right and the lower one on my left ear. What about you?</p>

<h3 id="talking-piano">
  Talking Piano
  <a href="#talking-piano">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>This effect is the art of making the piano (or another instrument) speak! There are a number of examples of it, where people approximate human speech by converting it into fundamental frequencies and then playing the piano notes to reconstruct the atomic structures of speech. An interesting example you can find is <a href="https://ablinger.mur.at/docu11.html">here</a>. Even though the effect is named a talking piano, other instruments can speak as well. In their song “Robot Rock”, you can hear the guitar chords talking, as if they are singing the lyrics, ehm, Robot Rock!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a href="#conclusion">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>There are more than three auditory illusions to present (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVsMiSrlSSc">maybe more than 40</a>) and Daft Punk may have created songs including those illusions. It is evident that hearing is not just physical but also psychological. Speaking of psychology, does anyone know how do our feelings connect to music? Listening to Instant Crush, Veridis Quo, or Something About Us, you will most likely fall into a brown study. That is a phenomenon I can’t explain myself either.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

    <p>This is part two of a two-part series. Read part one <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/border-immigration/2023/08/09/tijuana-is-crumbling-under-the-weight-of-its-population-growth" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">here.</a></p>


</div><p>Parque Baja California should be the ideal community park. Mature trees provide shade and benches give visitors a comfortable place to sit and feel the ocean breeze.</p><p>But running through the middle of the park is a drainage culvert with water flowing year round.</p><p>Martin Acosta recalls seeing a couple of kids jump into the water to retrieve a soccer ball there earlier this year. One of the kids said the water “smelled like doo-doo,” said Acosta, who is an architect and environmental activist.</p><p>“The kid was right, because that’s exactly what it is,” he said.</p><p>The sewer water in Parque Baja California is a microcosm of Tijuana’s failing infrastructure — an ongoing crisis with grave impacts on economies, quality of life and public health on both sides of the border.</p><p>Cross-border sewage is among the most critical issues facing the Tijuana-San Diego region. On the U.S. side, the problem is particularly acute in San Diego’s South Bay. The Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/environment/2023/01/30/federal-funding-approved-to-fix-san-diegos-cross-border-pollution-problem" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>a $630 million blueprint</u></a> for eliminating 95% of the contaminated cross-border flows.</p><p>While funding remains a question mark, the federal appropriations bill signed last December cleared the way for the EPA to transfer $300 million to the International Boundary and Water Commission for infrastructure projects.</p><p>The main sources of cross-border sewage are overburdened sewage treatment facilities prone to leaks and runoff from the Tijuana River after heavy rains.</p><p>Then there’s the type of contamination found at Parque Baja California. It doesn’t receive nearly as much attention as the other two, but it is in many respects the most difficult to control.</p><p>“People connect their sewer lines to the storm drain and we end up with wastewater running through those storm drain pipes,” said Carmen Romo, an environmental activist with the group Tijuana Calidad de Vida.</p><h3>A problem in plain sight</h3><p>It’s common to see — and smell — brown liquid coming from the city’s storm drain pipes. Even when it isn’t raining, Romo said. Much of that waste from homes and businesses flows directly into the Pacific Ocean and has contributed to Imperial Beach’s coastline being closed for 500 consecutive days over the past two years.</p><p>The problem is in plain sight in the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood, where dozens of storm drain pipes empty into the ocean. These pipes should be dry when it isn’t raining, but flow year-round.</p><p>“This is something that happens on a regular basis,” Romo said. “And through the coast, if you walk along, you’ll see several storm drains just pouring out sewage.”</p><p>Within the city, it is the poorest residents who are most impacted. In the Los Laureles neighborhood of Tijuana, trash and other debris block storm drain pipes leading to the Tijuana River. The result is pools of wastewater in the middle of residential neighborhoods.</p><p>This contamination exposes residents to a host of health problems, according to Rosario Zagarai, an activist with WildCoast. “They get skin infections, respiratory illnesses and gastrointestinal viruses,” she said.</p><p>Zagarai, Romo and other activists blame the lax regulatory environment. Part of the reason nothing gets done, they said, is that Tijuana runs the storm drain system while the state of Baja California manages the sewage system.</p><p>Whenever someone complains, the two governments point fingers at each other and nothing gets done, Romo said.</p><p>“It gets kind of complicated,” she said.</p><p>Consider that the state will only connect homes to the sewage system if property owners have official deeds. However, an estimated 40% of new construction in Tijuana is built without permits, which means the flow of sewage will continue to increase into the foreseeable future.</p><p>The Baja California state agency tasked with managing the wastewater system did not respond to questions. Tijuana officials, meanwhile, told KPBS they’re doing their part.</p><p>“We report each instance to the state agency and they inspect them,” said Juan Enrique Bautista Corona, director of Tijuana’s Urban Development Department.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Four years from now, if all goes well, a nuclear-powered rocket engine will launch into space for the first time. The rocket itself will be conventional, but the payload boosted into orbit will be a different matter.</p>
<p>NASA announced Wednesday that it is partnering with the US Department of Defense to launch a nuclear-powered rocket engine into space as early as 2027. The US space agency will invest about $300 million in the project to develop a next-generation propulsion system for in-space transportation.</p>
<p>"NASA is looking to go to Mars with this system," said Anthony Calomino, an engineer at NASA who is leading the agency's space nuclear propulsion technology program. "And this test is really going to give us that foundation."</p>
<h2>Back to the future</h2>
<p>Traditional chemical propulsion is great for blasting rockets off the surface of the Earth, but such machines are terribly inefficient for moving around the Solar System. They don't sip fuel; they guzzle it. To go as far as Mars would require a huge amount of propellant and liquid oxidizer and take at least six months. For humans to truly become a spacefaring species, there needs to be a better way.</p>
<p>Wernher von Braun, the German engineer who defected to the United States after World War II, recognized the potential of nuclear thermal propulsion even before his Saturn V rocket landed humans on the Moon with chemical propulsion. Eventually, this led to a project called NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application). It was eventually canceled to help pay for the Space Shuttle.</p>
<p>The basic idea is straightforward: A nuclear reactor rapidly heats up a propellant, probably liquid hydrogen, and then this gas expands and is passed out a nozzle, creating thrust. But engineering all of this for in-space propulsion is challenging, and then there is the regulatory difficulty of building a nuclear reactor and safely launching it into space.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>And so nuclear thermal propulsion technology sat on the shelf for a long, long time. Finally, in 2020, the curious folks at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/the-us-military-is-getting-serious-about-nuclear-thermal-propulsion/">said they wanted to test</a> a flyable nuclear thermal propulsion system. This planted the seed for a program called the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO). The military was interested in efficiently moving payloads around Earth and the Moon—hence the inclusion of cislunar.</p>

<p>NASA later joined in, with the goal of developing similar technology for a Mars mission. The reason is obvious: A lot of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/report-nasas-only-realistic-path-for-humans-on-mars-is-nuclear-propulsion/">scientists and engineers believe</a> that the only sustainable way to develop a Mars exploration program is through the use of nuclear propulsion.</p>
<h2>The plan forward</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, NASA and DARPA announced they had selected Lockheed Martin to serve as the primary contractor to assemble the experimental nuclear thermal reactor vehicle (X-NTRV) and its engine. BWX Technologies will be one of Lockheed Martin’s partners, and it will develop the nuclear reactor and fabricate the high-assay low-enriched uranium fuel to power the reactor.</p>
<p>The value of the award is $499 million, said Tabitha Dodson, program manager for the effort at DARPA, in a teleconference with reporters.</p>
<p>NASA will take the lead on developing the nuclear engine, and DARPA will oversee a host of other issues, from the nuclear regulatory requirements to the mission's operations and all analyses of the vehicle's safety. The nuclear reactor will launch in "cold" mode for safety reasons and will not be turned on until it reaches a sufficiently high orbit.</p>
<p>This final orbit has yet to be determined, but it is likely to be 700 to 2,000 km above the surface of the Earth, such that the vehicle's reentry into the planet's atmosphere will take place hundreds of years after any nuclear reactions occur.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The nuclear-powered vehicle will launch within the payload fairing of a Falcon 9 or Vulcan rocket, Dodson said, and look much the same as the upper stage of a conventional rocket. It will consist of a large hydrogen fuel tank, a nuclear reactor, a supporting spacecraft structure, and a nozzle. Once it reaches a safe orbit, the reactor will be turned on. The liquid hydrogen will then be heated from 20 Kelvin—just 20° Celsius above absolute zero—to 2,700 Kelvin in less than a second.</p>
<p>And then? Well, we'll see. There are some unknowns about the performance of a reactor and its uranium fuel in zero gravity.</p>
<p>"It's important to keep in mind that this is a demonstration engine," Dodson said. "And just like any other test of a rocket engine, NASA may need to do a series of follow-on engine development work in order to get closer to their perfect operational engine."</p>
<h2>Don’t forget about the hydrogen</h2>
<p>This experiment is exciting beyond just the testing of the nuclear engine. While plenty of new technology will go into developing a nuclear reactor that can operate in microgravity, a lot of effort will also go into managing the vehicle's liquid hydrogen propellant.</p>
<p>Until now, liquid hydrogen has only been successfully stored in space for days since it boils above the extremely cold temperature of 20 Kelvin. Dodson said this mission would attempt to store liquid hydrogen in its ultra-cold state for a couple of months, allowing enough time for multiple tests of the nuclear thermal engine.</p>
<p>After the propellant runs out, the engine will no longer be able to operate, even though mission controllers on the ground will still retain communication with the spacecraft. The mission could be extended if it could be robotically refueled, and Dodson said the spacecraft designers are attempting to allow for this possibility.</p>
<p>Perhaps NASA and DARPA will have learned enough by then, however, to move into the development of an operational engine that will fly somewhere.</p>

<p>The Intel 8086 processor started the x86 architecture that is still extensively used today.
The 8086 has some quirky characteristics: it is little-endian, has a parity flag, and uses explicit I/O instructions
instead of just memory-mapped I/O.
It has four 16-bit registers that can be split into 8-bit registers, but only one that
can be used for memory indexing.
Surprisingly, the reason for these characteristics and more
is compatibility with a computer dating back before the creation of the microprocessor:
the Datapoint 2200, a minicomputer with a processor built out of TTL chips.
In this blog post, I'll look in detail at how the Datapoint 2200 led to the architecture of Intel's modern processors, step by step through the 8008, 8080, and 8086 processors.</p>
<!--
Some questions about the x86 architecture can be answered by looking at the historical roots of the 8086.
For instance, why is the 8086 little-endian?
Why does the 8086 have a parity flag?
Why does the 8086 provide explicit I/O instructions instead of just using memory-mapped I/O?
Why does the 8086 have four 16-bit registers that can be split into 8-bit registers?
Why does the 8086 use the BX register for memory indexing, but not AX, CX, or DX?
The answers to these questions can be found in a computer dating back before the creation of the microprocessor:
the Datapoint 2200, a minicomputer with a processor built out of TTL chips.
In this blog post, I'll look in detail at how the Datapoint 2200 led to the architecture of Intel's modern processors.
-->


<p>In the late 1960s, 80-column IBM punch cards were the primary way of entering data into computers, although
CRT terminals were growing in popularity.
The Datapoint 2200 was designed as a low-cost terminal that could replace a keypunch, with a squat CRT display
the size of a punch card.
By putting some processing power into the Datapoint 2200, it could perform data validation and other tasks,
making data entry more efficient.
Even though the Datapoint 2200 was typically used as an
<a href="https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Electronics/70s/70/Electronics-1970-08-31.pdf#page=116">intelligent terminal</a>,
it was really a desktop
<a href="https://archive.org/details/computerworld6197unse50/page/n12/mode/1up">minicomputer</a> with a "unique combination of powerful computer, display, and dual cassette drives."
Although now mostly forgotten, the Datapoint 2200 was the origin of the 8-bit microprocessor, as I'll explain below.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/datapoint2200.jpg"><img alt="The Datapoint 2200 computer (Version II)." height="366" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/datapoint2200-w500.jpg" title="The Datapoint 2200 computer (Version II)." width="500"></a></p><p>The Datapoint 2200 computer (Version II).</p>
<p>The memory storage of the Datapoint 2200 had a large impact on its architecture and thus the architecture of today's computers.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, magnetic core memory was the dominant form of computer storage.
It consisted of tiny ferrite rings, threaded into grids, with each ring storing one bit.
Magnetic core storage was bulky and relatively expensive, though.
Semiconductor RAM was new and very expensive; Intel's first product in 1969 was a RAM chip called the 3101, which held
just 64 bits and cost $99.50. 
To minimize storage costs, the Datapoint 2200 used an alternative: MOS shift-register memory.
The Intel 1405 shift-register memory chip provided much more storage than RAM chips at a much lower cost (512 bits for $13.30).<span id="fnref:shift-register"><a href="#fn:shift-register">1</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/intel1405.jpg"><img alt="Intel 1405 shift-register memory chips in metal cans, in the Datapoint 2200." height="373" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/intel1405-w500.jpg" title="Intel 1405 shift-register memory chips in metal cans, in the Datapoint 2200." width="500"></a></p><p>Intel 1405 shift-register memory chips in metal cans, in the Datapoint 2200.</p>
<p>The big problem with shift-register memory is that it is sequential: the bits come out one at a time, in the same order you put them in.
This wasn't a problem when executing instructions sequentially, since the memory provided each instruction as it was needed.
For a random access, though, you need to wait until the bits circulate around and you get the one you want, which is very slow.
To minimize the number of memory accesses, the Datapoint 2200 had seven registers, a relatively large number of registers for the time.<span id="fnref:registers"><a href="#fn:registers">2</a></span>
The registers were called A, B, C, D, E, H, and L, and these names had a lasting impact on Intel processors.</p>
<p>Another consequence of shift-register memory was that the Datapoint 2200 was a serial computer, operating on one bit
at a time as the shift-register memory provided it, using a 1-bit ALU.
To handle arithmetic operations, the ALU needed to start with the lowest bit so it could process carries.
Likewise, a 16-bit value (such as a jump target) needed to start with the lowest bit.
This resulted in a little-endian architecture, with the low byte first.
The little-endian architecture has remained in Intel processors to the present.</p>
<p>Since the Datapoint 2200 was designed before the creation of the microprocessor, its processor was built from a board of TTL chips (as was typical for minicomputers at the time).
The diagram below shows the processor board with the chips categorized by function.
The board has a separate chip for each 8-bit register (<code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, etc.) and separate chips for control flags (<code>Z</code>, carry, etc.).
The Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU) takes about 18 chips, while instruction decoding is another 18 chips.
Because every feature required more chips, the designers of the Datapoint 2200 were strongly motivated to make
the instruction set as simple as possible.
This was necessary since 
the Datapoint 2200 was a low-cost device, renting for just <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_computerworld_1971-07-14_5_28/page/18/mode/1up">$148</a> a month.
In contrast, the popular PDP-8 minicomputer rented for <a href="http://bitsavers.org/magazines/Computers_And_Automation/197101.pdf#page=55">$500 a month</a>.</p>

<p>One way that the Datapoint 2200 simplified the hardware was by
creating a large set of instructions by combining simpler pieces in an orthogonal way.
For instance, the Datapoint 2200 has 64 ALU instructions that apply one of eight ALU operations to one of the eight registers.
This requires a small amount of hardware—eight ALU circuits and a circuit to select the register—but
provides a large number of instructions.
Another example is the register-to-register move instructions. Specifying one of eight source registers and one of
eight destination registers provides a large, flexible set of instructions to move data.</p>
<p>The Datapoint 2200's instruction format was designed around this principle, with groups of three bits specifying a
register. A common TTL chip could decode the group of three bits and activate the desired circuit.<span id="fnref:decoder"><a href="#fn:decoder">3</a></span>
For instance, a data move instruction had the bit pattern <code>11DDDSSS</code> to move a byte from the specified source (SSS) to the specified destination (DDD).
(Note that this bit pattern maps onto three octal digits very nicely since the source and destination are separate digits.<span id="fnref:octal"><a href="#fn:octal">4</a></span>)</p>
<p>One unusual feature of the Datapoint instruction set is that a memory access was just like a register access.
That is, an instruction could specify one of the seven physical registers or could specify a memory access (<code>M</code>),
using the identical instruction format.
One consequence of this is that you couldn't include a memory address in an instruction.
Instead, memory could only be accessed by first loading the address into the <code>H</code> and <code>L</code> registers, which held the high and
low byte of the address respectively.<span id="fnref:hl"><a href="#fn:hl">5</a></span>
This is very unusual and inconvenient, since a memory access took three instructions: two to load the <code>H</code> and <code>L</code> registers and one to access memory as the <code>M</code> "register".
The advantage was that it simplified the instruction set and the decoding logic, saving chips and thus reducing
the system cost.
This decision also had lasting impact on Intel processors and how they access memory.</p>
<p>The table below shows the Datapoint 2200's instruction set in an octal table showing the 256 potential opcodes.<span id="fnref:octaltable"><a href="#fn:octaltable">6</a></span>
I have roughly classified the instructions as arithmetic/logic (purple), control-flow (blue), data movement (green),
input/output (orange), and miscellaneous (yellow).
Note how the orthogonal instruction format produces large blocks of related instructions.
The instructions in the lower right (green) load (<code>L</code>) a value from a source to a destination.
(The no-operation <code>NOP</code> and <code>HALT</code> instructions are special cases.<span id="fnref:nop"><a href="#fn:nop">7</a></span>)
In the upper-left are Load operations (<code>LA</code>, etc.) that use an "immediate" byte, a data byte that follows the instruction.
They use the same <code>DDD</code> code to specify the destination register, reusing that circuitry.</p>

<p>The lower-left quadrant (purple) has the bulk of the ALU instructions.
These instructions have a regular, orthogonal structure making the instructions easy to decode: each row specifies the operation while each column
specifies the source.
This is due to the instruction structure:
eight bits in the pattern <code>10AAASSS</code>, where the <code>AAA</code> bits specified the
ALU operation and the <code>SSS</code> bits specified the register source.
The three-bit ALU code specifies the operations
Add, Add with Carry, Subtract, Subtract with Borrow, logical AND, logical XOR, logical OR,
and Compare.
This list is important because it defined the fundamental ALU operations for later Intel processors.<span id="fnref:alu"><a href="#fn:alu">8</a></span>
In the upper-left are ALU operations that use an "immediate" byte.
These instructions use the same <code>AAA</code> bit pattern to select the ALU operation, reusing the decoding hardware.
Finally, the shift instructions <code>SLC</code> and <code>SRC</code> are implemented as special cases outside the pattern.</p>
<p>The upper columns contain conditional instructions in blue—Return, Jump, and Call.
The eight conditions test the four status flags (Carry, Zero, Sign, and Parity) for either True or False.
(For example, <code>JFZ</code> Jumps if the Zero flag is False.)
A 3-bit field selects the condition, allowing it to be easily decoded in hardware.
The parity flag is somewhat unusual because parity is surprisingly expensive to compute in hardware,
but because the Datapoint 2200 operated as a terminal, parity computation was important.</p>
<p>The Datapoint 2200 has an input instruction as well as many output instructions for a variety of specific hardware tasks 
(orange, labeled <code>EX</code> for external).
Typical operations are <code>STATUS</code> to get I/O status, <code>BEEP</code> and <code>CLICK</code> to make sound, and <code>REWIND</code> to rewind the tape.
As a result of this decision to use separate I/O instructions, Intel processors still use I/O instructions operating in
an I/O space, different from processors such as the MOS 6502 and the Motorola 68000 that used memory-mapped I/O.</p>
<p>To summarize, the Datapoint 2200 has a fairly large number of instructions, but they are generated from about a dozen simple patterns that are easy to decode.<span id="fnref:risc"><a href="#fn:risc">9</a></span>
By combining orthogonal bit fields (e.g. 8 ALU opererations multiplied by 8 source registers), 64 instructions
can be generated from one underlying pattern.</p>
<h2>Intel 8008</h2>
<p>The Intel 8008 was created as a clone of the Datapoint 2200 processor.<span id="fnref:4004"><a href="#fn:4004">10</a></span>
Around the end of 1969, the Datapoint company talked with
Intel and Texas Instruments about the possibility of replacing the processor board with a single chip.
Even though the microprocessor didn't exist at this point, both companies said they could create such a chip.
Texas Instruments was first with a chip called the TMX 1795 that they <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_ElectronicignV19N1219710610_71671761/page/n37/mode/2up">advertised</a> as a "CPU on a chip".
Slightly later, Intel produced the 8008 microprocessor.
Both chips copied the Datapoint 2200's instruction set architecture with minor changes.</p>

<p>By the time the chips were completed, however, the Datapoint corporation had lost interest in the chips. They were designing a much faster
version of the Datapoint 2200 with improved TTL chips (including the well-known <a href="https://www.righto.com/2017/01/die-photos-and-reverse-engineering.html">74181 ALU chip</a>).
Even the original Datapoint 2200 model was faster than the Intel 8008 processor, and the Version II was over 5 times faster,<span id="fnref:version2"><a href="#fn:version2">11</a></span>
so moving to a single-chip processor would be a step backward.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments unsuccessfully tried to find a customer for their TMX 1795 chip and ended up abandoning the chip.
Intel, however, marketed the 8008 as an 8-bit microprocessor, essentially creating the microprocessor industry.
In my view, Intel's biggest innovation with the microprocessor wasn't creating a single-chip CPU, 
but creating the microprocessor as a product category: a general-purpose processor along with everything customers
needed to take advantage of it.
Intel put an enormous amount of effort into making microprocessors a success:
from documentation and customer training to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellec">Intellec</a> development systems,
from support chips to software tools such as assemblers, compilers, and operating systems.</p>
<p>The table below shows the opcodes of the 8008.
For the most part, the 8008 copies the Datapoint 2200, with identical instructions that have identical opcodes (in color).
There are a few additional instructions (shown in white), though.
Intel Designer Ted Hoff realized that increment and decrement instructions (<code>IN</code> and <code>DC</code>) would be very useful for loops.
There are two additional bit rotate instructions (RAL and RAL) as well as the "missing" LMI (Load Immediate to Memory)
instruction.
The <code>RST</code> (restart) instructions act as short call instructions to fixed addresses for 
interrupt handling.
Finally, the 8008 turned the Datapoint 2200's device-specific I/O instructions into 32 generic I/O instructions.</p>

<h2>Intel 8080</h2>
<p>The 8080 improved the 8008 in many ways, focusing on speed and ease of use, and resolving customer issues with the 8008.<span id="fnref:faggin"><a href="#fn:faggin">12</a></span>
Customers had criticized the 8008 for its small memory capacity, low speed, and difficult hardware interfacing.
The 8080 increased memory capacity from 16K to 64K and
was over an order of magnitude faster than the 8008.
The 8080 also moved to a 40-pin package that made interfacing easier, but the 8080 still required a large number of
support chips to build a working system.</p>
<p>Although the 8080 was widely used in embedded systems, it is more famous for its use in
the first generation of home computers, boxes such as the Altair and IMSAI.
Famed chip designer Federico Faggin <a href="https://arct hive.org/details/byte-magazine-1992-03/page/n175/mode/2up">said</a> that the
8080 really created the microprocessor; the 4004 and 8008 suggested it, but the 8080 made it real.<span id="fnref:usable"><a href="#fn:usable">13</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/Altair_8800.jpg"><img alt="Altair 8800 computer on display at the Smithsonian.

<p>The table below shows the instruction set for the 8080.
The 8080 was designed to be compatible with 8008 assembly programs after a simple translation process;
the instructions have been shifted around and the names have changed.<span id="fnref:8080-shift"><a href="#fn:8080-shift">15</a></span>
The instructions from the Datapoint 2200 (colored) form the majority of the 8080's instruction set.
The instruction set was expanded by adding some 16-bit support, allowing register pairs (<code>BC</code>, <code>DE</code>, <code>HL</code>) to be used as 16-bit registers for
double add, 16-bit increment and decrement, and 16-bit memory transfers.
Many of the new instructions in the 8080 may seem like contrived special cases—
for example, <code>SPHL</code> (Load <code>SP</code> from <code>HL</code>) and <code>XCHG</code> (Exchange <code>DE</code> and <code>HL</code>)—
but they made accesses to memory easier.
The I/O instructions from the 8008 have been condensed to just IN and OUT, opening up room for new instructions.</p>

<p>The 8080 also moved the stack to external memory, rather than using an internal fixed special-purpose stack as in the 8008 and
Datapoint 2200.
This allowed <code>PUSH</code> and <code>POP</code> instructions to put register data on the stack.
Interrupt handling was also improved by adding
the Enable Interrupt and Disable Interrupt instructions (EI and DI).<span id="fnref:mos"><a href="#fn:mos">14</a></span></p>
<h2>Intel 8085</h2>
<p>The Intel 8085 was designed as a "mid-life kicker" for the 8080, providing incremental improvements while maintaining compatibility.
From the hardware perspective, the 8085 was much easier to use than the 8080.
While the 8080 required three voltages, the 8085 required a single 5-volt power supply (represented by the "5" in the part number).
Moreover, the 8085 eliminated most of the support chips required with the 8080; a working 8085 computer could be built with
just three chips.
Finally, the 8085 provided additional hardware functionality: better interrupt support and serial I/O.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/8085.jpg"><img alt="The Intel 8085, like the 8080 and the 8086, was packaged in a 40-pin DIP.

<p>On the software side, the 8085 is curious: 12 instructions were added to the instruction set (finally using every opcode), but all but two were hidden
and left undocumented.<span id="fnref:8085-undoc"><a href="#fn:8085-undoc">16</a></span>
Moreover, the 8085 added two new condition codes, but these were also hidden.
This situation occurred because the 8086 project started up in 1976, near the release of the 8085 chip.
Intel wanted the 8086 to be compatible (to some extent) with the 8080 and 8085, but providing new instructions in the 8085
would make compatibility harder.
It was too late to remove the instructions from the 8085 chip, so Intel did the next best thing and removed them
from the documentation. These instructions are shown in red in the table below.
Only the new SIM and RIM instructions were supported, necessary in order to use
the 8085's new interrupt and serial I/O features.</p>

<h2>Intel 8086</h2>
<p>Following the 8080, Intel intended to revolutionize microprocessors with a 32-bit "micro-mainframe", the iAPX 432.
This extremely complex processor implemented objects, memory management, interprocess communication, and fine-grained memory
protection in hardware.
The iAPX 432 was too ambitious and the project fell behind schedule, leaving Intel vulnerable against
competitors such as Motorola and Zilog.
Intel quickly threw together a 16-bit processor as a stopgap until the iAPX 432 was ready; to show its continuity with the 8-bit processor line,
this processor was called the 8086.
The iAPX 432 ended up being <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/04/biztech/articles/05merced.html">one of the great disaster stories of modern computing</a> and quietly disappeared.</p>
<p>The "stopgap" 8086 processor, however, started the x86 architecture that changed the history of Intel.
The 8086's victory was powered by the IBM PC,
designed in 1981 around the Intel 8088, a variant of the 8086 with a cheaper 8-bit bus.
The IBM PC was a rousing success, defining the modern computer and making Intel's fortune.
Intel produced a succession of more powerful chips that extended the 8086: 286, 386, 486, Pentium, and so on,
leading to the current x86 architecture.</p>

<p>The 8086 was a major change from the 8080/8085, jumping from an 8-bit architecture to a 16-bit architecture
and expanding from 64K of memory to 1 megabyte.
Nonetheless, the 8086's architecture is closely related to the 8080.
The designers of the 8086 wanted it to be compatible with the 8080/8085, but the difference was too wide
for binary compatibility or even assembly-language compatibility.
Instead, the 8086 was designed so a program could translate 8080 assembly language to 8086 assembly language.<span id="fnref:conv86"><a href="#fn:conv86">17</a></span>
To accomplish this, each 8080 register had a corresponding 8086 register and most
8080 instructions had corresponding 8086 instructions.</p>
<p>The 8086's instruction set was designed with a new concept, the "ModR/M" byte, which usually follows the
opcode byte.
The ModR/M byte specifies the memory addressing mode
and the register (or registers) to use, allowing that information to be moved out of the opcode.
For instance, where the 8080 had a quadrant of 64 instructions to move from register to register, the 8086 has a
single move instruction, with the ModR/M byte specifying the particular instruction.
(The move instruction, however, has variants to handle byte vs. word operations, moves to or from memory,
and so forth, so the 8086 ends up with a few move opcodes.)
The ModR/M byte preserves the Datapoint 2200's concept of using the same instruction for memory and register
operations, but allows a memory address to be provided in the instruction.</p>
<p>The 8086 also cleans up some of the historical baggage in the instruction set, freeing up space in the precious
256 opcodes for new instructions.
The conditional call and return instructions were eliminated, while the conditional jumps were expanded.
The 8008's <code>RST</code> (Restart) instructions were eliminated, replaced by interrupt vectors.</p>
<p>The 8086 extended its registers to 16 bits and added several new registers.
An Intel patent (below) shows that the 8086's registers were originally called <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>H</code>, and <code>L</code>,
matching the Datapoint 2200.
The <code>A</code> register was extended to the 16-bit <code>XA</code> register, while the
<code>BC</code>, <code>DE</code>, and <code>HL</code> registers were used unchanged.
When the 8086 was released, these registers were renamed to <code>AX</code>, <code>CX</code>, <code>DX</code>, and <code>BX</code> respectively.<span id="fnref:bx"><a href="#fn:bx">18</a></span>
In particular, the <code>HL</code> register was renamed to <code>BX</code>; this is why <code>BX</code> can specify a memory address in the ModR/M byte, but
<code>AX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> can't.</p>

<!--
The 8086's instructions have other similarities with the earlier processors.
The instructions have the same octal format, with fields of 3 bits specifying registers or ALU operations.
The eight core ALU operations are the same as the previous processors, going back to the Datapoint 2200.
-->

<p>The table below shows the 8086's instruction set, with "b", "w", and "i" indicating byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), and immediate
instructions.
The Datapoint 2200 instructions (colored) are all still supported.
The number of Datapoint instructions looks small
because the ModR/M byte collapses groups of old opcodes into a single new one.
This opened up space in the opcode table, though, allowing the 8086 to have many new instructions as well as
16-bit instructions.<span id="fnref:8086-instructions"><a href="#fn:8086-instructions">19</a></span></p>

<p>The 8086 has a 16-bit flags register, shown below, but the low byte remained compatible with the 8080.
The four highlighted flags (sign, zero, parity, and carry) are the ones originating in the Datapoint 2200.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/8086-flags.jpg"><img alt="The flag word of the 8086 contains the original Datapoint 2200 registers." height="66" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/8086-flags-w700.jpg" title="The flag word of the 8086 contains the original Datapoint 2200 registers." width="700"></a></p><p>The flag word of the 8086 contains the original Datapoint 2200 registers.</p>
<h2>Modern x86 and x86-64</h2>
<p>The modern x86 architecture has extended the 8086 to a 32-bit architecture (IA-32) and a 64-bit architecture (x86-64<span id="fnref:ia64"><a href="#fn:ia64">20</a></span>), but the Datapoint features remain.
At startup, an x86 processor runs in "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode">real mode</a>", which operates
like the original 8086.
More interesting is 64-bit mode, which has some major architectural changes.
In 64-bit mode, the 8086's general-purpose registers are extended to sixteen 64-bit registers
(and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/advanced-performance-extensions-apx.html">soon</a> to be 32 registers).
However, the original Datapoint registers are special and can still be accessed as byte registers within the
corresponding 64-bit register; these are highlighted in the table below.<span id="fnref:aliasing"><a href="#fn:aliasing">21</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/64-bit-regs.jpg"><img alt="General purpose registers in x86-64. From Intel Software Developer's Manual." height="145" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/64-bit-regs-w700.jpg" title="General purpose registers in x86-64. From Intel Software Developer's Manual." width="700"></a></p>
<p>The flag register of the 8086 was extended to 32 bits or 64 bits in x86. As the diagram below shows,
the original Datapoint 2200 status flags are still there (highlighted in yellow).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/64-bit-flags.jpg"><img alt="The 32-bit and 64-bit flags of x86 contain the original Datapoint 2200 registers. From Intel Software Developer's Manual." height="335" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-datapoint/64-bit-flags-w500.jpg" title="The 32-bit and 64-bit flags of x86 contain the original Datapoint 2200 registers. From Intel Software Developer's Manual." width="500"></a></p>
<p>The instruction set in x86 has been extended from the 8086, mostly through prefixes, but
the instructions from the Datapoint 2200 are still there.
The ModR/M byte was changed in 32-bit mode so the <code>BX</code> (originally <code>HL</code>) register is no longer special
when accessing memory (although it's still special with 16-bit addressing, until Intel removes that in the
upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#x86-S">x86-S</a> simplification.)
I/O ports still exist in x86, although they are viewed as more of a legacy feature: modern I/O devices
typically use memory-mapped I/O instead of I/O ports.
To summarize, fifty years later, x86-64 is slowly moving away from some of the Datapoint 2200 features, but they are still there.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The modern x86 architecture is descended from the Datapoint 2200's architecture.
Because there is backward-compatibility at each step, you should theoretically be able to take a Datapoint 2200 binary, disassemble it to 8008 assembly, automatically translate it
to 8080 assembly, automatically convert it to 8086 assembly, and then run it on a modern x86 processor.
(The I/O devices would be different and cause trouble, of course.)</p>
<p>The Datapoint 2200's complete instruction set, its flags, and its little-endian architecture have persisted into current
processors.
This shows the critical importance of backward compatibility to customers.
While Intel keeps attempting to create new architectures (iAPX 432, i960, i860, Itanium), customers would rather
stay on a compatible architecture.
Remarkably, Intel has managed to move from 8-bit computers to 16, 32, and 64 bits, while keeping systems mostly compatible.
As a result, design decisions made for the Datapoint 2200 over 50 years ago are still impacting modern computers.
Will processors still have the features of the Datapoint 2200 another fifty years from now? I wouldn't be surprised.<span id="fnref:refs"><a href="#fn:refs">22</a></span></p>
<!--
The x86 architecture has changed dramatically over the years, expanded to 32-bit and now 64-bit operation.
The architecture provides modes for compatibility with the 8086, including the features derived from the Datapoint 2200.
In 64-bit mode, some features have been generalized; for instance, the BX register (formerly HL register) is no longer
special for memory accesses.
Although the registers are now 64 bits, the original Datapoint 2200 8-bit registers are still accessible as pieces
of the larger registers.

She was unhappy with the outlet’s reporting on how </span><a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/media_ejected_at_open_forum_+5446forum+4d6564696120656a6563746564206174206f70656e20666f72756d20" rel="">she kicked out reporters</a><span> from a recent event at her establishment with US Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS) and subsequent research they were conducting. The cops responded in kind, seizing cell phones, computers, and other devices necessary for publishing the paper after receving a signed search warrant from a judge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What has remained unreported until now is that, prior to the raids, the newspaper had been actively investigating Gideon Cody, Chief of Police for the city of Marion. They’d received multiple tips alleging he’d retired from his previous job to avoid demotion and punishment over alleged sexual misconduct charges.</strong></p><p><span>The news of the multiple raids was reported Friday by both </span><a href="https://marionrecord.com/" rel="">the paper itself</a><span> and by nonprofit news service </span><em><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/08/11/police-stage-chilling-raid-on-marion-county-newspaper-seizing-computers-records-and-cellphones/" rel="">Kansas Reflector</a></em><span>. After receiving an alert from the Kansas Press Association, </span><em>Reflector </em><span>Editor-in-Chief Sherman Smith said he quickly understood the gravity of the situation. “My immediate reaction: This is an attack on all journalists, and we have to respond,” Sherman told The Handbasket in an email Friday night. “My staff and I stopped what we were doing and directed our attention to reporting this story.”</span></p><p><span>I reached out to Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the</span><em> Marion County Record</em><span>, late Friday evening to get his reaction to the unprecedented raids and to learn about any new updates in the case. Below is our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</span></p><p><strong>Marisa Kabas: I wanted to check in and see if there had been any updates since the raids yesterday.</strong></p><p>Eric Meyer: We’ve pieced together enough equipment so that we'll probably be able to put out our paper. Our big question is how to get the material for it, which we don't have any of. I mean, I'm gonna have to go hunting to find the name plate for the front page. </p><p>But other than that, we're doing ok. Been in lots of talks with lots of lawyers. That's pretty much the long and short of it, I guess for now. Just getting started on rebuilding everything. So, we've got a bit of work to do with that.</p><p><strong>MK: And what are the lawyers telling you right now?</strong></p><p><span>EM: That</span><strong> </strong><span>the people who did this are going to learn a very expensive lesson. Their real question was, from a legal standpoint, was it more important that we get it [the newspaper’s equipment] back right now, or is it more important that we—for lack of a better word—stick it to them? We’re able to survive now, and I don't really want to stick it to anybody, but we need to have something that's big enough to convince somebody that you really don't do this. Not in America. This is not something that you do here. So, we'll be working in that direction.</span></p><p><strong>MK: When the raids happened, were you at the office or were you at your home?</strong></p><p>EM: I was at my home. I stay here with my 98-year-old mother and she was actually waiting for her meal to arrive from Meals on Wheels. And I thought when I heard the knocking, that was a meal person. I know they normally just leave it outside and no, it was a couple of police officers.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I immediately tried to call the newspaper and I couldn't get through to the newspaper because they had raided them at the same time and forced them to go outside. So, although I did have a landline here—the advantage of living with a 98 year old woman is you've got a landline!—they couldn't answer at the </span><em>Record</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At the newspaper office, they'd been forced to leave the office. We weren't forced to leave the house here. But my mother is very upset about having police in her house for several hours. They stood here for a long time. </p><p>I got in the car and left to go down to the newspaper office. And actually along the way had to stop because I couldn't find phone numbers [since all his devices had been seized]. I wanted to call the attorney we normally use from the open government coalition that usually provides initial consulting for us, and I didn't have his phone number. So I actually stopped at somebody's house along the way and said, can I borrow your tablet to look up a phone number and then borrow your phone to make a call?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: So when the police arrived at your door, what was initially running through your head?</strong></p><p><span>EM: I had no idea what they were doing there. They said “we’re here to execute a search warrant.” And at that point, I kind of figured out what it was, because of the blustering that I'd heard from Kari earlier in the week. But, yeah, I didn't know quite what they wanted to do. I said, “guys, you're really making a very serious mistake here.”</span><strong> </strong><span>But what ran through my head was the old saying that when the police say something, you've got to do it. There's time to object to it later. Don't object to it then, or they can charge you with interfering with law enforcement.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So I just told them that I thought they were making a serious mistake and they said they're just doing their jobs. And being a small enough town, I knew who they were. One of them was a part-time officer and he was wearing his bulletproof vest on the outside, and I know the new uniform requirements in the city, where they're supposed to wear it on the inside of their shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>My mother got very, very, very, very upset about this and about that time her lunch did arrive, and she never did eat it yesterday. She refused to eat it. In fact, she refused to eat anything. She refused to go to bed last night. She sat up all night. She was very upset about this. They came into her home. She did nothing wrong.</p><p><strong>MK: That's very upsetting, I can imagine. And what has it been like having all this attention all of a sudden?</strong></p><p>EM: It's not wanted attention, let's put it that way. </p><p>It is kind of heartwarming: One of the things that I just noticed was we got this incredible swelling of people buying subscriptions to the paper off of our website. We got a lot of them, including some—I'm not gonna say who they're from—but one of them is an extremely famous movie producer and screenwriter who came in and subscribed to the paper all of a sudden. I mean, it's like, why are people from Poughkeepsie, New York and Los Angeles, California and Seattle, Washington and, you know, all these different places subscribing to the paper?</p><p>But a lot of people seem to want to help, and we've had people calling, asking “where can I send money to help you?” And, well, we don't need money right now. We just are gonna have a long weekend of work to do. But we'll catch up.</p><p><span>[</span><em>At this point, Meyer explained the backstory as reported by his paper and the Kansas Reflector: He and his reporter Phyllis Zorn were kicked out of an August 2nd meeting at a local establishment with US Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS) by the City of Marion Police Chief after restaurant owner Kari Newell demanded they leave. Meyer and Zorn published a subsequent story about the hostile encounter, which infuriated Newell and prompted angry Facebook posts.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The paper then received a tip about Newell having her license suspended in 2008 after a DUI, checked it out, decided not to publish it, and ultimately shared it with the local police because they believed it might’ve been shared with them as part of Newell’s ongoing divorce battle. The police then told Newell what the newspaper shared, and she attended Monday’s City Council meeting to make outrageous claims about the newspaper and one of the council members (who had also obtained the letter) violating her rights. She also called Meyer later that evening and erroneously accused him of identity theft. Not even four days later, police arrived at the newspaper office, Meyer’s home and the council member’s home with search warrants signed by a judge.</em><span>]</span></p><p>EM: So the backstory that we haven't told, because we don't wanna get in trouble, is that we've been investigating the police chief [Gideon Cody]. When he was named Chief just two months ago, we got an outpouring of calls from his former co-workers making a wide array of allegations against him saying that he was about to be demoted at his previous job and that he retired to avoid demotion and punishment over sexual misconduct charges and other things.&nbsp;</p><p>We had half a dozen or more different anonymous sources calling in about that. Well, we never ran that because we never could get any of them to go on the record, and we never could get his personnel file. But the allegations—including the identities of who made the allegations—were on one of the computers that got seized. I may be paranoid that this has anything to do with it, but when people come and seize your computer, you tend to be a little paranoid.</p><p><strong>MK: I just wanna make sure I'm 100% clear: so you haven't reported on this before?</strong></p><p>EM: We've gathered a lot of information. Deb, one of our reporters, has worked for weeks on this story. And we kind of didn't get anywhere with it. We tried to alert the city through backdoor channels that they needed to really look at his employment record. They said, “oh, we have,” and we talked to the Kansas City, Missouri Police where he was from, and the Human Resources Department said, “no, nobody's ever looked at his record.” Then two days later, somebody did look at it after they'd already told us they'd done so. </p><p>But the Kansas City Missouri Police HR Department told us, they [the city of Marion] asked specifically for only those things in which he [Cody] had been convicted and disciplinary action had been taken. And so that's all they gave him. This action wasn't completed. So that was where we kind of had to leave the story. They went ahead and hired him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: So you feel comfortable publicly saying that you would have been investigating the police chief?</strong></p><p>EM: I wouldn't feel comfortable printing individual allegations, but it is true that we were investigating him and we had decided not to run anything at this point. We're not making any allegations against him, but we had investigated allegations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: Have you heard from Congressman LaTurner since the police raids?</strong></p><p><span>EM: No, we have not. But again, it is so hard to reach us right now. Unless you have this landline [</span><em>Ed note: we were speaking via his home landline that he’d provided via email</em><span>] and I happen to be there, or the other landline [at the office] and I happen to be there. I haven't seen any email from them, nor have I received any calls from them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>MK: With all the national attention, what should people outside Kansas know about Marion?</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>EM: It’s a very small rural community. I worked at the </span><em>Milwaukee Journal</em><span> for 20 years and then taught at the University of Illinois. And they'd say, where are you from? And I'd say I'm from Kansas. And they’d say where in Kansas? And I'd say, if you've heard of any place in Kansas, it’s 60 miles from there. It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere. We are on the boundary of an area code. We're on the boundary of three zip codes. We're on the boundary between two TV markets. It's a farming community that also has some resort activities. We have a couple of lakes which in Kansas is kind of unusual. But mostly it's a farming community.</span></p><p>But other than that, it's like a lot of small towns. We are unusual in that running the paper isn't my livelihood. I mean, I retired from the University of Illinois. I still have a pension from the Milwaukee Journal. I haven't even taken my social security yet. And I don't take a salary, unless I take a bonus at the end of the year if we made any money from the newspaper. So I don't get regularly paid, and it's not my livelihood.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm doing this because I believe that newspapers still have a place in the world and that the worst thing that a newspaper could do was shrink its reporting staff, stop reporting, fill itself with non-news when there's still news out there. And if you do a good job of providing news, you will get readers.&nbsp;</p><p>We try to be aggressive with the news and we try to be fearless with the news because as I say, we're doing this because we care about the community. And that's one of the points I've tried to make, is that it's really hard to commit journalism properly with people who don't care about the community they're serving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: I just wanted to end with one last question: What do you think this raid on your paper and on your home says about the state of journalism in the country right now?</strong></p><p><span>EM: I haven't been able to see enough of the outpouring from the people </span><em>in</em><span> this town. We've been getting incredible support from people outside this town. People in this town have been very supportive, but not publicly. And I talked to one person who said, “Oh, are you sure It's ok that I can talk to you because they might come and seize my computer?” They're afraid. They're really afraid that the police power is unchecked, and that they can be punished like this. And I think that's why I think it's important for us to fight this as much as we can, because it is destroying everything we're trying to do with democracy, which is to get people more involved.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We've been trying to get people involved because people are afraid that if they step up—in a small town particularly—they will get squashed. Someone will knife them in the back. They will tell all their friends to stop doing business with them, or they will shun them, or they won't take them to the country club.</p><p>It’s a way to dispirit people from becoming involved in government by making them think that if you do, there's gonna be consequences and they're going to be negative. And in a community that's largely a lot of older people, a lot of them have said, you know, I've fought all the battles. I don't want to have a new battle that I'm dealing with. So they'll all complain about something, but they'll do it very quietly. We won't hear about it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tips?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linux kernel is often mentioned as a overwhelmingly large open source software. As of this writing, the latest version is v6.5-rc5, which consists of 36M lines of code. Needless to say, Linux is a fruit of hard work of many contributors over the decades.</p>
<p>However, the first version of Linux, v0.01 was pretty small. It consisted of only 10239 lines of code. Excluding comments and blank lines, it was only 8,670 lines. It's small enough to understand and is a good starting point to learn about the internals of UNIX-like operating system kernels.</p>
<p>Reading v0.01 was really fun for me. It was like visiting Computer History Museum in Mountain View - finally I witnessed <em>tales</em> are indeed true! I wrote this post to share this exciting experience with you. Let's dive in!</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Obviously I'm not the author of Linux v0.01. If you find any mistakes in this post, please let me know!</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-system-calls-look-like">How do system calls look like?</h2>
<p>v0.01 has 66 system calls. Here's the list of them:</p>
<pre><code><span>access acct alarm break brk chdir chmod
</span><span>chown chroot close creat dup dup2 execve
</span><span>exit fcntl fork fstat ftime getegid geteuid
</span><span>getgid getpgrp setsid getpid getppid
</span><span>getuid gtty ioctl kill link lock lseek
</span><span>mkdir mknod mount mpx nice open pause
</span><span>phys pipe prof ptrace read rename rmdir
</span><span>setgid setpgid setuid setup signal stat
</span><span>stime stty sync time times ulimit umask
</span><span>umount uname unlink ustat utime waitpid write
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>It supports reading, writing, creating, and deleting files and directories. Also, other fundamental concepts like <code>chmod(2)</code> (permission), <code>chown(2)</code> (owner), and <code>pipe(2)</code> (inter-process communication) are also supported.</li>
<li><code>fork(2)</code> and <code>execve(2)</code> were there. Only <code>a.out</code> executable format was supported.</li>
<li>The concept of sockets was not implemented. Thus, no network support.</li>
<li>Some features like <code>mount(2)</code> was not implemented: they just return <code>ENOSYS</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>sys_mount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
</span><span><span>{</span>
</span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>-</span>ENOSYS<span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="deeply-hardcoded-for-intel-386-architecture">Deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 architecture</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html">a very famous debate</a> Linus had a debate with Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of MINIX, about the design of operating systems: monolithic vs. microkernel, which is better design?</p>
<p>Tanenbaum <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html#:~:text=LINUX%20is%20tied%20fairly%20closely%20to%20the%2080x86">pointed out that</a> Linux is (or <em>was</em>) not portable because it was deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 (i386):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MINIX was designed to be reasonably portable, and has been ported from the Intel line to the 680x0 (Atari, Amiga, Macintosh), SPARC, and NS32016. LINUX is tied fairly closely to the 80x86.  Not the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's indeed true. Linux v0.01 was deeply hardcoded for o386. Here's the implementation of <code>strcpy</code> in <code>include/string.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>extern</span> <span>inline</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span> <span>strcpy</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span> dest<span>,</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>src<span>)</span>
</span><span><span>{</span>
</span><span><span>__asm__</span><span>(</span><span>"cld\n"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"1:\tlodsb\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"stosb\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"testb %%al,%%al\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"jne 1b"</span>
</span><span>	<span>::</span><span>"S"</span> <span>(</span>src<span>)</span><span>,</span><span>"D"</span> <span>(</span>dest<span>)</span><span>:</span><span>"si"</span><span>,</span><span>"di"</span><span>,</span><span>"ax"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>return</span> dest<span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>It's written in assembly with string instructions of i386. Yes it can be found in today's portable implementations of <code>strcpy</code>, but it's in <code>include/string.h</code> - not in somewhere like <code>include/i386/string.h</code>. Moreover, no <code>#ifdef</code> to switch the implementation for different architectures. It's just hardcoded for Intel 386.</p>
<p>Also, supported devices are for PC/AT compatible machines, here's the list of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/CMOS">CMOS</a>: Real-time clock (<code>init/main.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer">Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)</a>: Timer (<code>kernel/sched.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/ATA_PIO_Mode">ATA (PIO)</a>: Hard disk (<code>kernel/hd.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware">VGA (text mode)</a>: Display (<code>kernel/console.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/%228042%22_PS/2_Controller">Intel 8042</a>: PS/2 Keyboard (<code>kernel/keyboard.s</code>). Yes it's completely written in assembly!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may noticed, they're not in <code>drivers</code> directory as in today's Linux. They're hardcoded in core subsystems.</p>
<h2 id="freax">"FREAX"</h2>
<p>I've read in somewhere that Linus originally named his kernel "FREAX". Makefile in <em>Linux</em> v0.01 still had the following comment:</p>
<pre><code><span># Makefile for the FREAX-kernel.
</span></code></pre>
<p>It was indeed FREAX!</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-file-system-supported-in-v001">What's the file system supported in v0.01?</h2>
<p>Today, Linux supports a variety of file systems such as ext4, Btrfs, and XFS. What about v0.01? ext2? Nope, here's a hint from <code>include/linux/fs.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span><span>define</span> <span>SUPER_MAGIC</span> <span><span>0x137F</span></span></span>

<p><code>i</code> and <code>p</code> hold the task's index in the task table (not PID!) and the pointer to <code>task_struct</code> respectively. The key variable is <code>counter</code> in <code>task_struct</code> (<code>(*p)-&gt;counter</code>). The scheduler picks up the task with the largest <code>counter</code> value and switches to it. If all runnable tasks have counter value of 0, it updates each task's <code>counter</code> value by <code>counter = (counter &gt;&gt; 1) + priority</code> and restarts the loop. Note that <code>counter &gt;&gt; 1</code> is a faster way to divide by 2.</p>
<p>The key point would be the counter update. It also updates the counter value of non-runnable tasks. This means that if a task is waiting for I/O for a <em>long time</em>, and its priority is higher than 2, counter value will monotonically increase when counter is updated. This is just my guess, but I think this is for prioritizing rarely-runnable-but-latency-sensitive tasks like shell, which would waits for keyboard typing in most of the life.</p>
<p>Lastly, <code>switch_to(next)</code> is a macro which switches the CPU context to the picked task. It's well described in <a href="https://www.maizure.org/projects/evolution_x86_context_switch_linux/">here</a>. In short, it was based on a x86-specific feature called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment">Task State Segment (TSS)</a>, which is no longer used for task management in x86-64 architecture.</p>
<p>By the way, there's an interesting comment about the scheduler:</p>
<pre><code><span> *  'schedule()' is the scheduler function. This is GOOD CODE! There
</span><span> * probably won't be any reason to change this, as it should work well
</span><span> * in all circumstances (ie gives IO-bound processes good response etc).
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes it's indeed good code. Unfortunately (or fortunately), this prophecy is false. Linux became one of most practical and performant kernel which has introduced many new scheduling improvements and algorithms over the years, like Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).</p>

<p>It calls each subsystem's initialization functions. Pretty straightforward. But there's something interesting: it calls <code>fork(2)</code> in kernel's <code>main()</code>. Also, <code>init()</code> looks like an ordinary implementation in user space, but it's hardcoded in the kernel code!</p>
<p>It looks as if it's fork(2)-ing in the kernel space, but it's actually not. The trick is in <code>move_to_user_mode()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span><span>define</span> <span>move_to_user_mode</span><span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </span><span>\</span>

<p>You don't need to fully understand the assembly code above. What it does is to switch to the user mode using <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_to_Ring_3#iret_method">IRET instruction</a> but continue executing the following lines in the kernel code with the current stack pointer! Thus, the following <code>if (!fork())</code> is executed in user mode and <code>fork(2)</code> is actually a system call.</p>
<h2 id="linus-didnt-have-a-machine-with-8mb-ram">Linus didn't have a machine with 8MB RAM</h2>
<pre><code><span> * For those with more memory than 8 Mb - tough luck. I've
</span><span> * not got it, why should you :-) The source is here. Change
</span><span> * it. (Seriously - it shouldn't be too difficult. ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Today, machines with 8GB RAM are very common. Furthermore, 8GB is not enough at all for software engineers ;)</p>

<p>Lastly, I tried to compile the kernel with modern toolchains but failed to do so. I thought GCC (or C itself) has good backward compatibility, but it's not sufficient. Even with older standard <code>-std=gnu90</code> caused compile errors that are not trivial to fix.</p>
<p>One fun fact is Linux had used his own GCC with a feature named <code>-mstring-insns</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># If you don't have '-mstring-insns' in your gcc (and nobody but me has :-)
</span><span># remove them from the CFLAGS defines.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be a feature to support (or optimize?) <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs301/lecture/10_06_string_inst.html">x86 string instructions</a>.</p>
<p>If you managed to compile the kernel with modern toolchains, write an article and send me a link :D</p>
<h2 id="read-yourself">Read Yourself!</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading the source code of Linux v0.01 as much as I did. If you're interested in v0.01, download <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/linux-0.01.tar.gz">the tarball of v0.01 from kernel.org</a>. Reading the code is not so hard especially if you've read <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">xv6</a> before. Linux v0.01 is minimalistic but is very well written.</p></div></div>]]></description>
