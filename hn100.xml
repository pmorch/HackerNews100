<p>This document contains various resources and quick definition of a lot of background information behind distributed systems. It is not complete, even though it is kinda sorta detailed. I had written it some time in 2019 when coworkers at the time had asked for a list of references, and I put together what I thought was a decent overview of the basics of distributed systems literature and concepts.</p>

<p>Since I was asked for resources again recently, I decided to pop this text into my blog. I have verified the links again and replaced those that broke with archive links or other ones, but have not sought alternative sources when the old links worked, nor taken the time to add any extra content for new material that may have been published since then.</p>

<p>It is meant to be used as a quick reference to understand various distsys discussions, and to discover the overall space and possibilities that are around this environment.</p>

<h3>Foundational theory</h3>


<p>This is information providing the basics of all the distsys theory. Most of the papers or resources you read will make references to some of these concepts, so explaining them makes sense.</p>

<h4>Models</h4>


<h5>In a Nutshell</h5>


<p>There are three model types used by computer scientists doing distributed system theory:</p>

<ol>
<li>synchronous models</li>
<li>semi-synchronous models</li>
<li>asynchronous models</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>synchronous model</strong> means that each message sent within the system has a known <em>upper bound</em> on communications (max delay between a message being sent and received) and the processing speed between nodes or agents. This means that you can <em>know</em> for sure that after a period of time, a message was missed. This model is applicable in rare cases, such as hardware signals, and is mostly beginner mode for distributed system proofs.</p>

<p>An <strong>asynchronous model</strong> means that you have no upper bound. It is legit for agents and nodes to process and delay things indefinitely. You can never assume that a "lost" message you haven't seen for the last 15 years won't just happen to be delivered tomorrow. The other node can also be stuck in a GC loop that lasts 500 centuries, that's good.</p>

<p>Proving something works on asynchronous model means it works with all other types. This is expert mode for proofs and is even trickier than real world implementations to make work in most cases.</p>

<p>The <strong>Semi-synchronous models</strong> are the cheat mode for real world. There <em>are</em> upper-bounds to the communication mechanisms and nodes everywhere, but they are often configurable and unspecified. This is what lets a protocol designer go "you know what, we're gonna stick a <em>ping</em> message in there, and if you miss too many of them we consider you're dead."</p>

<p>You can't assume all messages are delivered reliably, but you give yourself a chance to say "now that's enough, I won't wait here forever."</p>

<p>Protocols like Raft, Paxos, and ZAB (quorum protocols behind etcd, Chubby, and ZooKeeper respectively) all fit this category.</p>

<h4>Theoretical Failure Modes</h4>


<p>The way failures happen and are detected is important to a bunch of algorithms. The following are the most commonly used ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fail-stop failures</li>
<li>Crash failures</li>
<li>Omission failures</li>
<li>Performance failures</li>
<li>Byzantine failures</li>
</ol>
<p>First, <strong>Fail-stop failures</strong> mean that if a node encounters a problem, everyone can know about it and detect it, and can restore state from stable storage. This is easy mode for theory and protocols, but super hard to achieve in practice (and in some cases impossible)</p>

<p><strong>Crash failures</strong> mean that if a node or agent has a problem, it crashes and then never comes back. You are either correct or late forever. This is actually easier to design around than fail-stop in theory (but a huge pain to operate because redundancy is the name of the game, forever).</p>

<p><strong>Omission failures</strong> imply that you give correct results that respect the protocol or never answer.</p>

<p><strong>Performance failures</strong> assumes that while you respect the protocol in terms of the content of messages you send, you will also possibly send results late.</p>

<p><strong>Byzantine failures</strong> means that anything can go wrong (including people willingly trying to break you protocol with bad software pretending to be good software). There's a special class of <strong>authentication-detectable byzantine failures</strong> which at least put the constraint that you can't forge other messages from other nodes, but that is an optional thing. Byzantine modes <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/thesaddestmoment.pdf">are the worst</a>.</p>

<p>By default, most distributed system theory assumes that there are no bad actors or agents that are corrupted and willingly trying to break stuff, and byzantine failures are left up to blockchains and some forms of package management.</p>

<p>Most modern papers and stuff will try and stick with either crash or fail-stop failures since they tend to be practical.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://ti.tuwien.ac.at/cps/teaching/courses/dependable_systems-ss08/dcs_slides/dcs-2007-p5.pdf">this typical distsys intro slide deck</a> for more details.</p>

<h4>Consensus</h4>


<p>This is one of the core problems in distributed systems: how can all the nodes or agents in a system agree on one value? The reason it's so important is that if you can agree on <em>just one value</em>, you can then do a lot of things.</p>

<p>The most common example of picking a single very useful value is <em>the name of an elected leader</em> that enforces decisions, just so you can stop having to build more consensuses because holy crap consensuses are painful.</p>

<p>Variations exist on what exactly is a consensus, including does everyone agree fully? (strong) or just a majority? (t-resilient) and asking the same question in various synchronicity or failure models.</p>

<p>Note that while classic protocols like Paxos use a leader to ensure consistency and speed up execution while remaining consistent, a bunch of systems will forgo these requirements.</p>

<h4>FLP Result</h4>


<h5>In A Nutshell</h5>


<p>Stands for <em>Fischer-Lynch-Patterson</em>, the authors of a 1985 paper that states that proper consensus where <em>all</em> participants agree on a value is unsolvable in a purely asynchronous model (even though it is in a synchronous model) as long as any kind of failure is possible, even if they're just delays.</p>

<p>It's one of the most influential papers in the arena because it triggered a lot of other work for other academics to define what exactly is going on in distributed systems.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Fault Detection</h4>


<p>Following FLP results, which showed that failure detection was kind of super-critical to making things work, a lot of computer science folks started working on what exactly it means to detect failures.</p>

<p>This stuff is hard and often much less impressive than we'd hope for it to be. There are <em>strong</em> and <em>weak</em> fault detectors. The former implies all faulty processes are eventually identified by all non-faulty ones, and the latter that only some non-faulty processes find out about faulty ones.</p>

<p>Then there are degrees of accuracy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody who has not crashed is suspected of being crashed</li>
<li>It's possible that a non-faulty process is never suspected at all</li>
<li>You can be confused because there's chaos but at some point non-faulty processes stop being suspected of being bad</li>
<li>At some point there's at least one non-faulty process that is not suspected</li>
</ol>
<p>You can possibly realize that a strong and fully accurate detector (said to be <em>perfect</em>) kind of implies that you get a consensus, and since consensus is not really doable in a fully asynchronous system model with failures, then there are hard limits to things you can detect reliably.</p>

<p>This is often why <em>semi-synchronous</em> system models make sense: if you treat delays greater than <em>T</em> to be a failure, then you can start doing adequate failure detection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ds/slides1415/failure.pdf">See this slide deck for a decent intro</a></p>

<h4>CAP Theorem</h4>


<p>The CAP theorem was for a long while just a conjecture, but has been proven in the early 2000s, leading to a lot of eventually consistent databases.</p>

<h5>In A Nutshell</h5>


<p>There are three properties to a distributed system:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>onsistency: any time you write to a system and read back from it, you get the value you wrote or a fresher one back.</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>vailability: every request results in a response (including both reads and writes)</li>
<li><strong>P</strong>artition tolerance: the network can lose messages</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, you can get a system that is both available and consistent, but only under synchronous models on a perfect network. Those don't really exist so in practice <strong>P</strong> is always there.</p>

<p>What the CAP theorem states is essentially that <em>given</em> <strong>P</strong>, you have to choose either <strong>A</strong> (keep accepting writes and potentially corrupt data) <em>or</em> <strong>C</strong> (stop accepting writes to save the data, and go down).</p>

<h5>Refinements</h5>


<p>CAP is a bit strict in what you get in practice. Not all partitions in a network are equivalent, and not all consistency levels are the same.</p>

<p>Two of the most common approaches to add some flexibility to the CAP theorem are the <em>Yield/Harvest</em> models and <em>PACELC</em>.</p>

<p><em>Yield/Harvest</em> essentially says that you can think of the system differently: <em>yield</em> is your ability to fulfill requests (as in uptime), and <em>harvest</em> is the fraction of all the potential data you can actually return. Search engines are a common example here, where they will increase their <em>yield</em> and answer more often by reducing their <em>harvest</em> when they ignore some search results to respond faster if at all.</p>

<p><em>PACELC</em> adds the idea that eventually-consistent databases are overly strict. In case of network <strong>P</strong>artitioning you have to choose between <strong>A</strong>vailability or <strong>C</strong>onsistency, but <strong>E</strong>lse --when the system is running normally--one has to choose between <strong>L</strong>atency and <strong>C</strong>onsistency. The idea is that you can decide to degrade your consistency for availability (but only when you really need to), or you could decide to always forego consistency because you gotta go fast.</p>

<p>It is important to note that you <em>cannot</em> beat the CAP theorem (as long as you respect the models under which it was proven), and anyone claiming to do so is often a snake oil salesman.</p>

</ul>
<p>There's been countless rehashes of the CAP theorem and various discussions over the years; the results are mathematically proven even if many keep trying to make the argument that they're so reliable it doesn't matter.</p>

<h4>Message Passing Definitions</h4>


<p>Messages can be sent zero or more times, in various orderings. Some terms are introduced to define what they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>unicast</em> means that the message is sent to one entity only</li>
<li><em>anycast</em> means that the message is sent to any valid entity</li>
<li><em>broadcast</em> means that a message is sent to all valid entities</li>
<li><em>atomic broadcast</em> or <em>total order broadcast</em> means that all the non-faulty actors in a system receive the same messages in the same order, whichever that order is</li>
<li><em>gossip</em> stands for the family of protocols where messages are forwarded between peers with the hope that eventually everyone gets all the messages</li>
<li><em>at least once delivery</em> means that each message will be sent once or more; listeners are to expect to see all messages, but possibly more than once</li>
<li><em>at most once delivery</em> means that each sender will only send the message one time. It's possible that listeners never see it.</li>
<li><em>exactly once delivery</em> means that each message is guaranteed to be sent and seen only once. This is a nice theoretical objective but quite impossible in real systems. It ends up being simulated through other means (combining <em>atomic broadcast</em> with specific flags and ordering guarantees, for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding ordering:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>total order</em> means that all messages have just one strict ordering and way to compare them, much like 3 is always greater than 2.</li>
<li><em>partial order</em> means that some messages can compare with some messages, but not necessarily all of them. For example, I could decide that all the updates to the key <code>k1</code> can be in a total order regarding each other, but independent from updates to the key <code>k2</code>. There is therefore a <em>partial</em> order between all updates across all keys, since <code>k1</code> updates bear no information relative to the <code>k2</code> updates.</li>
<li><em>causal order</em> means that all messages that depend on other messages are received after these (you can't learn of a user's avatar before you learn about that user). It is a specific type of partial order.</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't a "best" ordering, each provides different possibilities and comes with different costs, optimizations, and related failure modes.</p>

<h5>Idempotence</h5>


<p>Idempotence is important enough to warrant its own entry. Idempotence means that when messages are seen more than once, resent or replayed, they don't impact the system differently than if they were sent just once.</p>

<p>Common strategies is for each message to be able to refer to previously seen messages so that you define an ordering that will prevent replaying older messages, setting unique IDs (such as transaction IDs) coupled with a store that will prevent replaying transactions, and so on.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2187821">Idempotence is not a medical condition</a> for a great read on it, with various related strategies.</p>

<h4>State Machine Replication</h4>


<p>This is a theoretical model by which, given the same sequences of states and the same operations applied to them (disregarding all kinds of non-determinism), all state machines will end up with the same result.</p>

<p>This model ends up being critical to most reliable systems out there, which tend to all try to replay all events to all subsystems in the same order, ensuring predictable data sets in all places.</p>

<p>This is generally done by picking a leader; all writes are done through the leader, and all the followers get a consistent replicated state of the system, allowing them to eventually become leaders or to fan-out their state to other actors.</p>

<h4>State-Based Replication</h4>


<p>State-based replication can be conceptually simpler to state-machine replication, with the idea that if you only replicate the state, you get the state at the end!</p>

<p>The problem is that it is extremely hard to make this fast and efficient. If your state is terabytes large, you don't want to re-send it on every operation. Common approaches will include splitting, hashing, and bucketing of data to detect changes and only send the changed bits (think of <code>rsync</code>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle trees</a> to detect changes, or the idea of a <code>patch</code> to source code.</p>

<h3>Practical Matters</h3>


<p>Here are a bunch of resources worth digging into for various system design elements.</p>

<h4>End-to-End Argument in System Design</h4>


<p>Foundational practical aspect of system design for distributed systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>a message that is sent is not a message that is necessarily received by the other party</li>
<li>a message that is received by the other party is not necessarily a message that is actually read by the other party</li>
<li>a message that is read by the other party is not necessarily a message that has been acted on by the other party</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion is that if you want anything to be reliable, you <em>need</em> an end-to-end acknowledgement, usually written by the application layer.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2014/11/14/end-to-end-arguments-in-system-design/">Overview by the morning paper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf">Actual paper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">Wikipedia page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are behind the design of TCP as a protocol, but the authors also note that it wouldn't be sufficient to leave it at the protocol, the application layer must be involved.</p>

<h4>Fallacies of Distributed Computing</h4>


<p>The fallacies are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network is reliable</li>
<li>Latency is zero</li>
<li>Bandwidth is infinite</li>
<li>The network is secure</li>
<li>Topology doesn't change</li>
<li>There is one administrator</li>
<li>Transport cost is zero</li>
<li>The network is homogeneous</li>
</ul>
<p>Partial explanations on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">Wiki page</a> or full ones in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322500050_Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing_Explained">the paper</a>.</p>

<h4>Common Practical Failure Modes</h4>


<p>In practice, when you switch from Computer Science to Engineering, the types of faults you will find are a bit more varied, but can map to any of the theoretical models.</p>

<p>This section is an informal list of common sources of issues in a system. See also <a href="https://ferd.ca/beating-the-cap-theorem-checklist.html">the CAP theorem checklist</a> for other common cases.</p>

<h5>Netsplit</h5>


<p>Some nodes can talk to each other, but some nodes are unreachable to others. A common example is that a US-based network can communicate fine internally, and so could a EU-based network, but both would be unable to speak to each-other</p>

<h5>Asymmetric Netsplit</h5>


<p>Communication between groups of nodes is not symmetric. For example, imagine that the US network can send messages to the EU network, but the EU network cannot respond back.</p>

<p>This is a rarer mode when using TCP (although it has happened before), and a potentially common one when using UDP.</p>

<h5>Split Brain</h5>


<p>The way a lot of systems deal with failures is to keep a majority going. A split brain is what happens when both sides of a netsplit think they are the leader, and starts making conflicting decisions.</p>

<h5>Timeouts</h5>


<p>Timeouts are particularly tricky because they are non-deterministic. They can only be <em>observed</em> from one end, and you never know if a timeout that is ultimately interpreted as a failure was actually a failure, or just a delay due to networking, hardware, or GC pauses.</p>

<p>There are times where retransmissions are not safe if the message has already been seen (i.e. it is not idempotent), and timeouts essentially make it impossible to know if retransmission is safe to try: was the message acted on, dropped, or is it still in transit or in a buffer somewhere?</p>

<h5>Missing Messages due to Ordering</h5>


<p>Generally, using TCP and crashes will tend to mean that few messages get missed across systems, but frequent cases can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The node has gone down (or the software crashed) for a few seconds during which it missed a message that won't be repeated</li>
<li><p>The updates are received transitively across various nodes. For example, a message published by service <code>A</code> on a bus (whether Kafka or RMQ) can end up read, transformed or acted on and re-published by service <code>B</code>, and there is a possibility that service <code>C</code> will read <code>B</code>'s update before <code>A</code>'s, causing issues in causality</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>Clock Drift</h5>


<p>Not all clocks on all systems are synchronized properly (even using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a>) and will go at different speeds.</p>

<p>Using a timestamp to sort through events is almost guaranteed to be a source of bugs, even moreso if the timestamps come from multiple computers.</p>

<h5>The Client is Part of the System</h5>


<p>A very common pitfall is to forget that the client that participates in a distributed system is part of it. Consistency on the server-side will not necessarily be worth much if the client can't make sense of the events or data it receives.</p>

<p>This is particularly insidious for database clients that do a non-idempotent transactions, time out, and have no way to know if they can try it again.</p>

<h5>Restoring from multiple backups</h5>


<p>A single backup is kind of easy to handle. Multiple backups run into a problem called <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5414/2010fa/publications/BM93.pdf">consistent cuts</a> (<a href="https://blog.mattchung.me/2021/02/13/distributed-system-snapshots-consistent-vs-inconsistent-cuts/">high level view</a>) and distributed snapshots, which means that not all the backups are taken at the same time, and this introduces inconsistencies that can be construed as corrupting data.</p>

<p>The good news is there's no great solution and everyone suffers the same.</p>

<h4>Consistency Models</h4>


<p>There are dozens different levels of consistency, all of which are documented on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model">Wikipedia</a>, by <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p181-bailis.pdf">Peter Bailis' paper on the topic</a>, or overviewed by <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models">Kyle Kingsbury post on them</a></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Linearizability</em> means each operation appears atomic and could not have been impacted by another one, as if they all ran just one at a time. The order is known and deterministic, and a read that started after a given write had started will be able to see that data.</li>
<li><em>Serializability</em> means that while all operations appear to be atomic, it makes no guarantee about <em>which</em> order they would have happened in. It means that some operations <em>might</em> start after another one and complete before it, and as long as the isolation is well-maintained, that isn't a problem.</li>
<li><em>Sequential consistency</em> means that even if operations might have taken place out-of-order, they will appear as if they all happened in order</li>
<li><em>Causal Consistency</em> means that only operations that have a logical dependency on each other need to be ordered amongst each other</li>
<li><em>Read-committed</em> consistency means that any operation that has been committed is available for further reads in the system</li>
<li><em>Repeatable reads</em> means that within a transaction, reading the same value multiple times always yields the same result</li>
<li><em>Read-your-writes</em> consistency means that any write you have completed must be readable <em>by the same client</em> subsequently</li>
<li><em>Eventual Consistency</em> is a kind of special family of consistency measures that say that the system can be inconsistent as long as it eventually becomes consistent again. <em>Causal consistency</em> is an example of eventual consistency.</li>
<li><em>Strong Eventual Consistency</em> is like <em>eventual consistency</em> but demands that no conflicts can happen between concurrent updates. This is usually the land of <em>CRDTs</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while these definitions have clear semantics that academics tend to respect, they are not adopted uniformly or respected in various projects' or vendors' documentation in the industry.</p>

<h4>Database Transaction Scopes</h4>


<p>By default, most people assume database transactions are linearizable, and they tend not to be because that's way too slow as a default.</p>

<p>Each database might have different semantics, so the following links may cover the most major ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/transaction-iso.html">PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html">MySQL</a> (depends on the storage engine used)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">Transact-SQL</a> (most of Microsoft's products)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E25178_01/server.1111/e25789/consist.htm">Oracle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that while the PostgreSQL documentation is likely the clearest and most easy to understand one to introduce the topic, various vendors can assign different meanings to the same standard transaction scopes.</p>

<h4>Logical Clocks</h4>


<p>Those are data structures that allow to create either total or partial orderings between messages or state transitions.</p>

<p>Most common ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps">Lamport timestamps</a>, which are just a counter. They allow the silent undetected crushing of conflicting data</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">Vector Clocks</a>, which contain a counter per node, incremented on each message seen. They can detect conflicts in data and on operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector">Version Vectors</a> are like vector clocks, but only change the counters on state variations rather than all event seens</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ricardobcl/Dotted-Version-Vectors">Dotted Version Vectors</a> are fancy version vectors that allow tracking conflicts that would be perceived by the client talking to a server.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ricardobcl/Interval-Tree-Clocks">Interval Tree Clocks</a> attempts to fix the issues of other clock types by requiring less space to store node-specific information and allowing a kind of built-in garbage collection. It also has <a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/itc2008.pdf">one of the nicest papers ever</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>CRDTs</h4>


<p>CRDTs essentially are data structures that restrict operations that can be done such that they can never conflict, no matter which order they are done in or how concurrently this takes place.</p>

<p>Think of it as the specification on how someone would write a distributed redis that was never wrong, but only left maths behind.</p>

<p>This is still an active area of research and countless papers and variations are always coming out.</p>

Be advised however that everyone I know who absolutely loves this book are people who had a good foundation in distributed systems from reading a bunch of papers, and greatly appreciated having it all put in one place. Most people I've seen read it in book clubs with the aim get better at distributed systems still found it challenging and confusing at times, and benefitted from having someone around to whom they could ask questions in order to bridge some gaps. It is still the clearest source I can imagine for everything in one place.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>Mozilla Corp., which manages the open-source Firefox browser, announced today that Mitchell Baker is stepping down as CEO to focus on AI and internet safety as chair of the nonprofit foundation. Laura Chambers, a Mozilla board member and entrepreneur with experience at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/airbnb/" target="_blank" rel="">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/paypal-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="">PayPal</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/ebay/" target="_blank" rel="">eBay</a>, will step in as interim CEO to run operations until a permanent replacement is found.</p><div>



<p>Baker, a Silicon Valley pioneer who co-founded the Mozilla Project, says it was her decision to step down as CEO, adding that the move is motivated by a sense of urgency over the current state of the internet and public trust. “We want to offer an alternative for people to have better products,” says Baker, who wants to draw more attention to policies, products and processes to challenge business models built on fueling outrage. “What are the connections between this global malaise and how humans are engaging with each other and technology?”</p>



<p>Chambers says she plans to focus on building out new products that address growing privacy concerns while actively looking for a full-time CEO. Prior to being recruited to the Mozilla board three years ago, Chambers says she was feeling “pretty disillusioned” about society because of the influence of money in politics and the growing power of the tech giants. “I was confused about what to do and this felt like a genuine way to make an impact.”</p>



<p>Chambers says she won’t be seeking a permanent CEO role because she plans to move back to Australia later this year for family reasons.&nbsp; “I think this is an example of Mozilla doing the right role modelling in how to manage a succession,” says Chambers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move comes at a time when Mozilla has no choice but to reimagine its role in a world dominated by Big Tech and AI. Firefox, which launched 20 years ago to challenge the dominance of Internet Explorer and once accounted for more than 30% of the global browser market, has shrunk to low single digits in a world dominated by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="">Google</a> Chrome. Mozilla now makes most of its almost $600 million in annual revenue from promoting Chrome as the default search engine on its home page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But AI has given the nonprofit foundation and its cofounder Baker a fresh sense of mission in creating alternatives to tackle deepfakes, data privacy issues and the power of big tech. It launched&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/" target="_self" rel="">a Mozilla.ai startup</a>&nbsp;last year and Mozilla Corp. is focused on product extensions like Mozilla Monitor that wipe subscribers’ data off the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Baker, success is about influencing the conversation and giving consumers, as well as developers, a meaningful choice in how they operate online. “Our goal is to build something different,” she says, “business models with some societal purpose and public benefit” that give users meaningful control over their data. “The qualities of online life can be improved.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive navigate the changing needs of the workplace. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/chro-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=chro_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2024/02/08/police-intelligence-services-unlawfully-spied-whole-population-groups">https://nltimes.nl/2024/02/08/police-intelligence-services-unlawfully-spied-whole-population-groups</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39301830">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The police intelligence services unlawfully monitored entire population groups, the Supervisory Committee of the Intelligence and Security Services (CTIVD) said. In the four-month period between February 23 and July 1, 2022, they crossed that line three times, <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2508037-inlichtingendiensten-onderzochten-onrechtmatig-hele-bevolkingsgroepen">NOS</a> reports.</p>

<p>All police units throughout the Netherlands have their own intelligence service. They work with the general intelligence service AIVD and monitor people who could pose a threat to national security. According to the CTIVD, these intelligence services sometimes receive a signal “about a person or a few persons” and then decide to investigate an entire community based on that. </p>

<p>There are strict requirements in Dutch law for monitoring an entire community due to the massive invasion of privacy that entails. The intelligence service must first look into obtaining information about suspects in a different way and carefully consider whether such a broad investigation is a proportionate matter.</p>

<p>Between February 2023 and July 1, 2022, that did not happen in three investigations, the CTIVD said. The supervisory body did not say which communities were involved but did explain that by “community,” it means a population group “based, for example, on ethnicity, religious belief, or occupational group.” So, theoretically, the police intelligence services may have been spying on visitors to a certain mosque or protesting farmers. The CTIVD did tell the “Stiekem Committee” - the parliamentary committee that supervises the CTIVD - which communities were involved.</p>

<p>Harm Trip of the CTIVD told NOS that the police intelligence services monitor communities more often, but in these three cases, they did not give proper substantiation for why they needed to do so. </p>

<p>Responsible Minister Hugo de Jonge (Home Affairs) said the police need to properly justify why they monitor entire communities. But he added: “I would like to emphasize that the approach of the investigations in all cases is focused on a threat perspective.” And then it may be necessary to get a picture of an entire community, which is allowed under certain conditions, he said. “It is inevitable that the ethnic background of people who are part of a particular community will be taken into account, but it is not the purpose of the investigation,” he said. </p>

<p>In response to the CTIVD revelation, D66 parliamentarian Joost Sneller demanded a broader debate in parliament about better supervision of the intelligence and security services. SP parliamentarian Michel van Nispen is also critical. “We already knew that individuals have been followed in a sloppy manner, but it is even worse for entire communities,” he said. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Electric Toothbrushes" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2024/02/06/electric-toothbrushes.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p><em>Update added below with Fortinet's&nbsp;statement confirming our reporting.</em></p>
<p>A widely reported story that 3 million electric toothbrushes were hacked with malware to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is likely a hypothetical scenario instead of an actual attack.</p>
<p>Last week, Swiss news site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/wirtschaft/kriminalitaet-die-zahnbuersten-greifen-an-das-sind-die-aktuellen-cybergefahren-und-so-koennen-sie-sich-schuetzen-ld.2569480?reduced=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aargauer Zeitung</a>&nbsp;published a story stating that an employee of cybersecurity firm Fortinet said 3 million electric toothbrushes had been infected with Java malware to conduct DDoS attacks against a Swiss company.</p>
<p>"The electric toothbrush is programmed with Java, and criminals have unnoticed installed malware on it - like on 3 million other toothbrushes," reads the article.</p>
<p>"One command is enough and the remote-controlled toothbrushes simultaneously access the website of a Swiss company. The site collapses and is paralyzed for four hours. Millions of dollars in damage is caused."</p>
<p>The story is dramatic and definitely newsworthy, if accurate, and began sweeping through other technology news sites yesterday, with numerous publications covering the alleged attack without verifying the story.</p>
<p>However, there is one problem with the story—there is no record that this attack ever happened.</p>
<p>Fortinet, who was attributed as the source of the article, has not published any information about this attack and has not responded to repeated requests for comment from BleepingComputer since the "toothbrush botnet" story went viral yesterday.</p>
<p>A DDoS attack is when an attacker sends enough requests or data at a website to overwhelm its resources or bandwidth so that it can no longer accept requests from legitimate visitors, effectively making the site unusable.</p>
<p>This type of attack has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-ddos-attacks-are-taking-down-even-the-largest-tech-companies/" target="_blank">increasingly used by hacktivists</a>&nbsp;to protest a country's or business's activities or by threat actors who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/" target="_blank">use them to extort businesses</a>.</p>
<p>To conduct these attacks, routers, servers, and IoT devices are hacked by brute forcing or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/15-percent-of-all-iot-device-owners-dont-change-default-passwords/" target="_blank">using default passwords</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mirai-ddos-malware-variant-expands-targets-with-13-router-exploits/" target="_blank">exploiting vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Once a device is compromised, malware is installed to enlist it as part of their DDoS botnet and use it on attacks. These devices are then collectively used to launch powerful attacks against a specified target.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1194682/iot-connected-devices-vertically/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Statista</a>, approximately 17 billion IoT devices connected to the internet are expected to be connected to the internet by the end of 2024, offering a massive footprint of devices that could potentially be recruited into DDoS botnets.</p>
<p>However, it is doubtful that 3 million electric toothbrushes would be exposed to the internet so that they could be infected with malware.</p>
<p>Instead, this was likely a hypothetical scenario shared by Fortinet with the newspaper that was misunderstood or taken out of context to create a story that is widely disputed by security experts.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1755059487663067489" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Rob tweet" height="350" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/attacks/t/toothbrush-ddos/rob2.jpg" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, electric toothbrushes do not connect directly to the internet but instead use Bluetooth to connect to mobile apps that then upload your data to web-based platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that a massive hack like this could only have been achieved through a supply chain attack that pushed down malicious firmware to the devices.</p>
<p>However, there is no record of this happening. If it did, it would be a much bigger story than a DDoS attack.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata/status/1755051642032964024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Remy Tweet" height="233" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/attacks/t/toothbrush-ddos/remy.jpg" width="500"></a></p>
<p>While a story of a toothbrush DDoS botnet taking down a site is amusing (and almost definitely untrue), it’s still a good reminder that threat actors would target any Internet-exposed device.</p>
<p>This includes routers, servers, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), printers, and web cameras.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential for any device exposed to the internet to have the latest security updates and strong passwords to prevent them from being recruited into DDoS botnets.<br>
The good news is that it likely won't be your toothbrush, so keep brushing.</p>
<p><em>Update 2/7/24 5:45 PM ET:&nbsp;</em>As expected, Fortinet told BleepingComputer that this was a hypothetical scenario and not a real attack.</p>
<p>"To clarify, the topic of toothbrushes being used for DDoS attacks was presented during an interview as an illustration of a given type of attack, and it is not based on research from Fortinet or FortiGuard Labs. It appears that due to translations the narrative on this topic has been stretched to the point where hypothetical and actual scenarios are blurred." - Fortinet.</p>
<p>FortiGuard Labs has also told BleepingComputer that they have not observed any IoT botnets targeting toothbrushes or similar embedded devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past few months we have been working hard to provide a fast, reliable and secure KVM backend for VirtualBox. VirtualBox is a multi-platform Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) with a great feature set, support for a wide variety of guest operating systems, and a consistent user interface across different host operating systems.</p><p>Cyberus Technology’s KVM backend allows VirtualBox to run virtual machines utilizing the Linux KVM hypervisor instead of the custom kernel module used by standard VirtualBox. Using KVM comes with a number of benefits.</p><p>Our customers use virtualization to isolate different security domains from each other. They rely on further hardening of the host system for additional security. This kind of hardening is needed to get certification from government bodies and as a result a hard requirements for our customers.</p><p>In client scenarios, Windows is often the guest system of choice. A lot of the security features that get built into Windows rely on virtualization. In cases where Windows is already virtualized, additional support from the Hypervisor is needed to enable those features. KVM provides a lot of the needed support to improve Windows’ security in virtualized environments.</p><p>In addition, modern hardware comes with many features that enhance virtualization performance, such as interrupt virtualization. All of the use cases above are currently difficult to support with the stock VirtualBox kernel module. However, the open-source KVM module, which is included in the Linux kernel by default, supports these use cases easily.</p><p>Furthermore, it is now possible to use VirtualBox and QEMU in parallel and we can even throw Cloud Hypervisor in the mix, just for the fun of it! This opens up some interesting use cases, as each of these frontends comes with a different set of priorities, benefits, and drawbacks. Isolating security critical services in a Cloud Hypervisor VM while the user-visible Windows guest runs in a VirtualBox VM could provide an improved security / user-experience trade-off.</p><p><img alt="VirtualBox and Qemu running in parallel on a Linux host" decoding="async" height="1200" loading="lazy" src="https://cyberus-technology.de/_astro/vbox_qemu_sidebyside.mBjM0HZX_UMnKI.webp" width="1920"></p><p>As a result of our work, our customers can enjoy faster virtual machines, better security, and broader support for hardware and guest use cases.</p><h2 id="open-source-release">Open-Source Release</h2><p>Since we care about open-source, we are also releasing our changes under an open-source license on <a href="https://github.com/cyberus-technology/virtualbox-kvm">GitHub</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/02/07/production-engineering/simple-precision-time-protocol-sptp-meta/">https://engineering.fb.com/2024/02/07/production-engineering/simple-precision-time-protocol-sptp-meta/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39298652">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>While deploying Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at Meta, we’ve developed a simplified version of the protocol (Simple Precision Time Protocol – SPTP), that can offer the same level of clock synchronization as unicast PTPv2 more reliably and with fewer resources.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In our own tests, SPTP boasts comparable performance to PTP, but with significant improvements in CPU, memory, and network utilization.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We’ve made the source code for the SPTP client and server available on</span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/time"> <span>GitHub</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We’ve previously spoken in great detail about</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/"> <span>how Precision Time Protocol is being deployed at Meta</span></a><span>, including </span><span>the protocol itself and Meta’s precision time architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>As we deployed PTP into one of our data centers, we were also evaluating and testing alternative PTP clients. In doing so, we soon realized that we could eliminate a lot of complexity in the PTP protocol itself that we experienced during data center deployments while still maintaining complete hardware compatibility with our existing equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>This is how the idea of Simple Precision Time Protocol (SPTP) was born.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But before we dive under the hood of SPTP we should explore why the IEEE 1588</span><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8265.1/en"> <span>G8265.1</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8275.2/en"> <span>G8275.2</span></a><span> unicast profiles (here, we just call them PTP) weren’t a perfect fit for our data center deployment.</span></p>
<h2><span>PTP and its limitations</span></h2>
<h3><span>Excessive network communication</span></h3>
<p><span>A typical IEEE 1588-2019 two-step PTPv2 unicast UDP flow consists of the following exchange:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_20920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20920"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=916,503 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=96,53 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=192,105 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20920">Figure 1: Typical two-step PTPv2 exchange.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>This sequence repeats either in full or in part depending on the negotiation result. The exchange shown is one of many possible combinations. It may involve additional steps such as grant cancellation, grand cancellation acknowledgements, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>The frequency of these messages may vary depending on the implementation and configuration. After completing negotiation, the frequency of some messages can change dynamically.</span></p>
<p><span>This design allows for a lot of flexibility, especially for less powerful equipment where resources are limited. In combination with multicast, it allows us to support a relatively large number of clients using either very old or embedded devices. For example, a PTP server can reject the request or confirm a less frequent exchange if the resources are exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span>This design, however, leads to excessive network communication, which is particularly visible on a</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/11/open-source/time-appliance/"> <span>time appliance</span></a><span> serving a large number of clients.</span></p>
<h3><span>State machine</span></h3>
<p><span>Due to the “subscription” model, both the PTP client and the server have to keep the state in memory. This approach comes with the tradeoffs such as:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Excessive usage of resources such as memory and CPU.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Strict capacity limits that mean multicast support is required for large numbers of clients.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Code complexity.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fragile state transitions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These issues can manifest, for example, in so-called abandoned syncs – situations where the work of a PTP client is interrupted (either forcefully stopped or crashed). Because the PTP server didn’t receive a cancellation signaling message it will keep sending sync and followup packets until the subscription expires (which may take hours). This leads to additional complexity and fragility in the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There are additional protocol design side effects such as:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An almost infinite Denial of Service Attack (DoS) amplification factor.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Server-driven communication with little control by the client.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Complete trust in the validity of server timestamps.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Asynchronous path delay calculations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In data centers, where communication is typically driven by hundreds of thousands of clients and multicast is not supported, these tradeoffs are very limiting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>SPTP</span></h2>
<p><span>True to its name, SPTP significantly reduces the number of exchanges between a server and client, allowing for much more efficient network communication.</span></p>
<h3><span>Exchange</span></h3>
<figure id="attachment_20921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20921"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg 1080w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=916,916 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=1024,1024 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=192,192 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20921">Figure 2: Typical SPTP exchange.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In a typical SPTP exchange:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The client sends a delay request.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The server responds with a sync.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The server sends a followup/announce.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The number of network exchanges is drastically reduced. Instead of 11 different network exchanges as shown on Figure 1 and the requirement for client and server state machines for the duration of the subscription, there are only three packets exchanged and no state needs to be preserved on either side. In the simplified exchange, every packet has an important role:</span></p>
<h4><span>Delay request</span></h4>
<p><span>A delay request initiates the SPTP exchange. It’s interpreted by a server not only as a standard delay request containing the correction field (CF1) of the transparent clock, but also as a signal to respond with sync and followup packets. Just like in a two-step PTPv2 exchange, it generates T3 upon departure from the client side and T4 upon arrival on the server side.</span></p>
<p><span>To distinguish between a PTPv2 delay request and a SPTP delay request, the PTP profile Specific 1 flag must be set by the client.</span></p>
<h4><span>Sync</span></h4>
<p><span>In response to a delay request, a sync packet would be sent containing the T4 generated at an earlier stage. Just like in a regular two-step PTPv2 exchange, a sync packet will generate a T1 upon departure from the server side. While in transit, the correction field of the packet (CF2) is populated by the network equipment.</span></p>
<h4><span>Followup/announce</span></h4>
<p><span>Following the sync packet, an announce packet is immediately sent containing T1 generated at a previous stage. In addition, the correction filed from the Delay Request field is populated by the CF1 value collected at an earlier stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The announce packet also contains typical PTPv2 information such as clock class, clock accuracy, and so on. On the client side, the arrival of the packet generates the T2 timestamp.</span></p>
<p><span>After a successful SPTP exchange, default two-step PTPv2 formulas for mean path delay and clock offset must be applied:</span></p>
<p><em><span>mean_path_delay = ((T4 – T3) + (T2-T1) – CF1 -CF2)/2</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>clock_offset = T2 – T1 – mean_path_delay</span></em></p>
<p><span>After every exchange the client has access to the announce message attributes such as time source, clock quality, etc., as well as the path delay and a calculated clock offset after every exchange with every server. And, because the exchange is client-driven, the offsets could be calculated at the exact same time. This avoids a situation where a client is following a faulty server and has no chance of detecting it.</span></p>

<h3><span>Reliability</span></h3>
<p><span>We can also provide stronger reliability guarantees by using multi-clock reliance.</span></p>
<p><span>In our implementation for precision time synchronization, we provide time as well as a window of uncertainty (WOU) to the consumer application via the fbclock API. As we described in a previous blog post on</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/"> <span>how PTP is being deployed at Meta</span></a><span> the WOU is based on the observation of time sync errors for the minimum duration to have stationarity of the state of the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, we’ve established a method based on a collection of clocks that each client can access for timing information that we call a </span><i><span>clock ensemble</span></i><span>. The clock ensemble operates in two modes, steady state and transient; where steady state is during normal operation and transient is in the case of holdover.</span></p>
<p><span>However, with a pool of N clocks, C, forming the clock ensemble, the question becomes which clocks to select for determining robustness and accurate timing information. Clocks that are not accurate are rejected (C_reject) and, thus, our ensemble size falls to N = C_total –&nbsp; C_reject. We employ two stages, one that is based on each individual clock, and the second that acts on the collection of valid clocks in the ensemble.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first stage observes the previous measurements of each individual clock, where the main criteria is to reject outliers in the previous states of the clock. Once this criterion threshold is exceeded, the entire clock is rejected from the valid clock ensemble pool. This is based off</span><a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/chauvenets-criterion/"> <span>Chauvenet’s criterion</span></a><span>, where the criterion is a probability band that is centered on the mean of the clock outputs (assuming a normal distribution during steady state). Based on the stationarity tests, we use a sample size of 400 previous clock outputs and calculate a maximum allowable deviation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example:</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D%5Cge%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CC%20-%20%5Cbar%7BC%7D%7C%7D%7BS_%7Bc%7D%7D">, where <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20C"> is the current clock output, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%5Coverline%20C">&nbsp;</span><span>is the clock sample mean, and <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20S_%7Bc%7D"> </span><span>is the clock set standard deviation.</span></p>
<p><span>We find the probability that the current clock output is in disagreement with the previous 400 samples:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%7BP_%7Bz%7D%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%28400%29%7D%20%5Capprox%200.9993%7D"></p>
<p><span>Based on a window size of 400 previous samples, the maximum allowed deviation is:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D%20%3D%203.2272"></p>
<p><span>Now, the clock outputs are tested against this value. If they exceed the <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D">&nbsp;</span><span>they are rejected, an alert is raised, and a threshold counter is incremented. Once the rejection threshold is reached for an individual clock, this clock is entirely rejected.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we enter the second stage of verifying the clock ensemble composed of the valid clocks. The second stage forms a weighted average of the non-rejected clocks in the valid clock ensemble, where each clock in the ensemble is reported as its sample size, mean, and variance. The average of the clocks’ means is the weighted average, where the weights are inversely proportional to the mean absolute deviations reported by each clock after applying Chauvenet’s criterion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now we can report the mean and variance of the clock ensemble, ensuring the clocks contained therewith are valid and not providing erroneous values. The confidence interval is scaled with the number of good clocks in the ensemble, where the higher the number of valid clocks out of the total clocks provides greater reliability.</span></p>
<p><span>For a number of hosts, we show that the distribution of clocks falls within the following heatmap:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_20923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20923"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png 640w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png?resize=96,72 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png?resize=192,144 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20923">Figure 4: Offset distribution overlay of multiple clocks.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>We calculate the variance, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20v_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, of each individual clock’s observations, then we calculate a weighted mean, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, taking into consideration the reciprocal of each clock’s variance as the weight.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bv%7D%7Bk%7D%7D%7D%2C%20C%20%3D%20%5B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bv_%7Bk%7D%7D%5D%5E%7B-1%7D"></p>
<p><span>Due to independence of clocks, the variance of the weighted sum, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, is:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Csum_%7B%7D%5E%7B%7D%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D_%7Bk%7D%5E%7B2%7Dv_%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7B%7D%5E%7B%7DC%5E%7B2%7D%20%3D%20N_%7Bw%7DC%5E%7B2%7D"></p>
<p><span>In summary, we collect samples from a number of clock sources that form our clock ensemble. The overall precision and reliability of the provided data by SPTP is a function of the number of reliable and in distribution clocks forming the clock ensemble.</span></p>
<p><span>A future post will focus on this specifically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>SPTP’s performance</span></h2>
<p><span>Let’s explore performance of the SPTP versus PTP.</span></p>
<p><span>Initial deployments to a single client confirmed no regression in the precision of the synchronization:</span></p>

<p><span>With large-scale deployment of our implementations, we can confirm resource utilization improvements.</span></p>
<p><span>We noticed that due to the difference in multi-server support, the performance gains vary significantly depending on the number of tracked time servers.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, with just a single time appliance serving the entire network there are significant improvements across the board. Most notably over 40 percent CPU, 70 percent memory, and 50 percent network utilization improvements:</span></p>

<h2><span>The next steps for SPTP at Meta</span></h2>
<p><span>Since SPTP can offer the exact same level of synchronization with a lot fewer resources consumed, we think it’s a reasonable alternative to the existing unicast PTP profiles.</span></p>
<p><span>In a large-scale data center deployment, it can help to combat frequently changing network paths and create savings in terms of network traffic, memory usage, and number of CPU cycles.</span></p>
<p><span>It will also eliminate a lot of complexity inherited from multicast PTP profiles, which is not necessarily useful in the trusted networks of the modern data centers.</span></p>
<p><span>It should be noted that SPTP may not be suitable for systems that still require subscription and authentication. But this could be solved by using PTP TLVs (type-length-value).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, by removing the need for subscriptions, it’s possible to observe multiple clocks – which allows us to provide higher reliability by comparing the time sync from multiple sources at the end node.</span></p>
<p><span>SPTP can offer significantly simpler, faster, and more reliable synchronization. Similar to G.8265.1 and G.8275.2 it provides excellent synchronization quality using a different set of parameters. Simplification comes with certain tradeoffs, such as missing signaling messages, that users need to be aware of and decide which profile is the best for them.</span></p>
<p><span>Having it standardized and assigned a unicast profile identifier will encourage wider support, adoption, and popularization of PTP as a default precise time synchronization protocol.</span></p>
<p><span>The source code for the SPTP client and the server can be accessed on our</span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/time"> <span>GitHub page</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<!-- Dealing with failure in complex computer systems mostly comes down to following your
human intuition. If a website is unavailable, what do you usually do? Just wait a bit and
try again. Still can't open it? Wait a bit more, maybe try again tomorrow. This approach
somewhat describes [exponential backoff], a popular technique used by libraries to re-try
failed HTTP requests.

Humans are great at dealing with failure. We have been growing up in the real world where
everything can go wrong, and our brains will easily pattern match the most effective way
of recovery to a specific failure. -->
<p>When it comes to computer systems, The <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> programming platform has an
interesting approach to failure handling. It's also widely known under the name "let it
crash". The core idea behind it has to do with the fact that modern applications have a
huge number of states that they can find themselves in. The more complex your application
is, the more variables you need to keep track of everything. Eventually it becomes
impossible for developers to predict all combinations of state that these variables will
form. Once your app gets into an undesirable state, the best thing you can do is to reset
it and start from a fresh, well known and correct state.</p>
<p>This works amazingly well together with Erlang's property that each process has a separate
memory space. Allowing us to selectively reset only parts of our application, while
keeping the system as a whole running. Then we can divide the application into a tree-like
structure and keep restarting parts of it until we reach the root and are forced to
restart the whole thing. This concept is also known as <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ">supervision trees</a>.</p>
<p>If you take a closer look at Erlang's approach, this is exactly what a human would do. If
your phone gets stuck playing a video, you will try restarting the app, and if this
doesn't fix it, you might end up restarting your phone. Or even the router of your home
internet connection. You intuitively know that propagating the failure through your home
will eventually bring all devices into a state that resembles the one when you first set
everything up and everything was working.</p>
<span>
Even sometimes Erlang's claims around resilience and fault tolerance are a bit
<b><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26447543" target="_blank">overblown</a></b>, I
still think that it's a very powerful way to deal with failure.</span> If my web app
breaks, the first thing I do is to restart the server. In the majority of cases this
immediately fixes the issue, while I dive deeper into the logs trying to figure out what
went wrong. Having this automatic restarting capability at every level of abstraction in
your app, will definitely help you sleep better.
<p>However, resetting the state is almost never enough. In the phone example, once the phone
starts up again, you still need to get back into the state where you stopped. This usually
means finding the video again and jumping back to the right point on the timeline. We are
partially reconstructing the state where we stopped, but ignoring all the other state
where things might have gone wrong, like our home internet connection being broken.</p>
<p>For humans, it's easy to approximately remember where we stopped watching a video, but for
an application it's impossible to reconstruct the state without the developer explicitly
keeping track of it. In Erlang, this would mean that we have one process as part of our
supervision tree that, for example, every second writes down how far the video got. Once
it's restarted as part of a parent supervisor, it will know how to restore the state from
disk.</p>
<h3 id="durable-execution">Durable Execution</h3>
<p>This brings me to a recent discovery I made, another approach to dealing with failure that
completely blew my mind 🤯. It's commonly known under the name durable execution, and is
so new that most developers never have heard of it. It's an elegant solution to the
"keeping track of the execution" problem, and perfectly complements Erlang's approach.</p>
<p>The simplest way of thinking of it is as <span>a database for compute
progression</span>. It stores the minimal amount of data to be able to reconstruct your
application's sate at any time. It makes your local variables indestructible, and for many
scenarios you will not even require a traditional database anymore.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could just start an arbitrary computation and the system guarantees that
it will run until completion and all the operations will be performed <strong>exactly once</strong>.
Even if your app needs to be restarted in the middle. Or even if you need to stop the
computation, move it to a different machine and continue. <span> Your
running code suddenly becomes this tangible thing, that you can look at, move and play
with.</span></p>
<p>All this intrigued me so much that I started working on my own engine for durable
execution called <strong><a href="https://flawless.dev/">flawless</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>
For structuring your page, you can use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element inside of the body.
It will be automatically centered on the page, with a maximum width of 640px, like the page you are reading right now.
</p>
<p>
To isolate the title of your page, and make it bigger, you can use the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element.
You can see an example at the top of this page.
</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element to separate between the different sections.
The section will simply be given some bottom padding.
</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element will center the text inside of it.
You can see an example at the bottom of this page.

          <div itemprop="text" id="post_1">
              <p>It is with great sadness that we announce John’s death on Friday, February 2, 2024. He was born in Maryland, USA to William and Bertha Walker, who preceded him in death. John is survived by his wife Roxie Walker and a brother, Bill Walker of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Declining to follow in his family tradition of becoming a medical doctor, John attended Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to pursue a future in astronomy. However, after he discovered the brave new world of computers, he never looked back. John worked at the university’s Project Chi (X) computing center where he studied computer science and earned a degree in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>John met Roxie on Thanksgiving Day in 1972, and they married the following year. Roxie and John drove cross-country a few months later for John’s new job in California. Eventually he left that first job and worked at various others in the bay area. In late 1976, John designed his own circuit board based on the then-new Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor. This venture became Marinchip Systems, and eventually led to Autodesk.</p>
<p>The beginnings of Autodesk are well documented by John himself in <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/">The Autodesk File</a> and from there John’s story is best told by John himself in his prodigious work, which is all methodically organized and available to the public at his website <a href="https://fourmilab.ch/">Fourmilab</a>.</p>

              <p>Former Ricochet/Ratburger member 10Cents writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First off, I suppose I should say I don’t feel up to the task to write a tribute for John Walker. I am sure others are more able. That is true, but here is my Dime’s worth.</p>
<p>I got to know John Walker on the <a href="http://ricochet.com/">ricochet.com</a> audio meet-ups (AMUs). He was a regular caller. Someone recently said that he was on those for over ten years. The AMU started at Ricochet but after I left there I started various ones which John joined. First at BallDiamondBall, then Ratburger which became the Scanalyst AMU without me. My guess he spent at least five hours a week since there were two or three calls per week. The AMUs were started by Curious John then through attrition I was left in charge. Now CTlaw is Mr. AMU.</p>
<p>I admired John for kindness in explaining things to almost anyone. I also appreciated his off-beat humor and stories. I learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>I don’t know about others, but I felt unbelievably surprised that someone like John would spend time with me. For me it was like going to the candy store but instead of candy it was insights and ideas. He brought so much to the table.</p>
<p>John was easy to take for granted because he was always there. He was a fixture in our lives. That fixture is gone. It is a struggle to think of life without him. It is hard not to cry at times.</p>
<p>I don’t know why John enjoyed our company but he did. I remember he teasing me when I came on a call. “There goes the neighborhood.” One of the last calls he invited me to “The Cheap Seats”. This was a part of his site where public domain movies could be seen. I am glad that the Ratburger experience showed him the way to start a forum site. He loved interacting with people on Scanalyst. And didn’t have the frustration of Wordpress there.</p>
<p>For those of us who got a lot of John’s time there are unending memories. For those of us who got a lot of John’s time, we struggle without the voice and wit we relied upon. I for one bow my head and humbly say thanks. I do wish I could have had a little bit more though.</p>
<p>I remember that John gave to this community day in and day out for years, first at Ratburger then at Scanalyst. He didn’t get a break. I calculate it was about six years. I am writing this post to fulfill my debt of gratitude to a kind man</p>

    </div><p>Repeat concussions, also referred to as repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, some people who experience repetitive mild traumatic brain injury never develop major disease.</p>

                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                    <p>Onder Albayram and colleagues investigated the role of a protein known as p17 in protecting brains from long-term pathologies. In stressed neurons, p17 initiates production of C18-Ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid that acts as a label of damaged <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mitochondria/" rel="tag">mitochondria</a> in neuronal axons. The study is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae018/7601436">published</a> in the journal <i>PNAS Nexus</i>.</p>
<p>Labeled mitochondria are then detected and removed by autophagosomes. The authors knocked out p17 in mice. Some p17-knockout mice underwent a new experimental model of repetitive concussive <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+injury/" rel="tag">brain injury</a>, known as the repetitive less-than-mild closed head injury (rlmTBI) paradigm.</p>
<p>These mice developed significant sensorimotor deficits after three months. By six months, the mice had cognitive deficits. Control mice showed no behavioral impairments.</p>
<p>In the rlmTBI p17-knockout mice's brains, the authors found compromised and disarranged membranes in axonal mitochondria. In normal mice, these mitochondria would have been destroyed, but since that process was interrupted, the dysfunctional organelles persisted, and caused <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/axonal+degeneration/" rel="tag">axonal degeneration</a>, which in turn led to pathological outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors developed a mitochondrial targeted pyridinium-ceramide analog drug, LCL768, which accumulates in damaged mitochondria and restores the process by which these organelles are removed.</p>
<p>In mice, treatment with LCL768 prevented the development of secondary axonal degeneration and led to improved functional outcomes compared to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag">mice</a> who received a placebo.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors examined <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+tissue/" rel="tag">human tissue</a> from six neuropathologically verified CTE cases with a history of repetitive traumatic brain injury. The CTE-positive samples exhibited less p17 expression and less mitochondrial C18-Ceramide than six age- and sex-matched healthy control samples.</p>
<p>According to the authors, drugs that ensure a healthy pool of axonal mitochondria in the brain could be candidates for use as prophylactic treatments after a concussion.</p>

When I heard that the United States could not produce sufficient 155 mm artillery shells to supply Ukraine, I thought it sounded odd. I knew essentially nothing about artillery save I would want to be on the other end of one. I was generally aware </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47751" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the industrial base for the defense industry had either atrophied or specialized or both</a><span>, depending on your perspective. Maybe this was just over-specialization? A dependency on a single part? Maybe it is a reliance on something exotic? Surely, there must be an explanation, something that would help me understand why we are so ill-prepared. Maybe there is some new technology that could be applied? This is a record of what I learned for the benefit of a more-educated citizenry and to save time for anyone else investigating the issue.</span></p><p>I approached this first to understand and second to know if-and-how I could help. My understanding is far from perfect—I went for breadth more than depth, often sacrificing detailed measurements in order to go fast. This is the short version.</p><ul><li><p>There is a shortage because our lone factory’s maximum capacity is 28,000 units (i.e. 24 ku) per month in the face of Ukraine asking for 600,000 units (600 ku) per month.</p></li><li><p><span>The major shortage is with producing </span><strong>steel casings</strong><span> for the artillery shells.</span></p><ul><li><p>The materials required to make these shells are relatively plentiful.</p></li><li><p>If you were to remove the casings bottleneck, other bottlenecks are possible. However, the next step (filling shells with explosive materials) is simpler to optimize vs. moving and precisely shaping a hundred pounds of steel at 2000°F.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There is no technological shortcut to producing more of these.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>3D printing is not viable. The metal itself is too precise to be printable with current technology, and the size of the shells would pose an issue.</p></li><li><p>Existing facilities use automation, but newer facilities will integrate more automation to improve quality and throughput.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Producing shells requires specific machine tools to accommodate the weight/heat and specially forming the nozzle. The tools themselves are fairly common, especially the furnaces; however, a factory optimized for building shells won’t be effective at building much else.</p></li><li><p>The existing production facility is part of a national landmark district, complicating expanding the existing facility.</p></li><li><p>The Department of Defense’s (DOD) current primary path forward is building a new facility in Garland, TX with modern automation and inspection equipment. Assuming it is contributing to the goal of scaling to 100ku per month of production by early 2025, it will have taken 3 years since hostilities started and 2 years since a contract was awarded for it to be online.</p></li><li><p>Building additional capacity is largely in DOD’s hands, as defense contractors are unwilling to build facilities without long-term (15 year) contracts. Today, the DOD typically awards 3-4 year contracts.</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, I am left with the impression that the US’ solution to problems that require building things is to avoid it at all costs. Congress is loathe to fund munition supplies that are never used, and defense contractors are loathe to build factories that sit idle (and despite what Hollywood may portray, everyone wants deterrence, not actual conflict). Though Congress and DOD are funding a new facility, 3-4 years will have passed before it produces a shell, which is entirely unhelpful in a present conflict. Instead, the DOD is attempting to plug the Ukraine-sized hole with shells from allied nations including Canada, South Korea, Finland, and Germany—places where it’s still possible to build new things.</p><p>I believe in alliances, especially when it is the free people of the world standing against aggression from authoritarians. What troubles me here, though, is that the US is pursuing that option because the domestic defense industrial base, inclusive of DOD and its contractors, is sclerotic. It treats time like it’s free. It does not respond quickly. It does not build or innovate around current problems, because of a combination of disincentives from DOD’s own structure and the pervasive challenges of trying to run a manufacturing business in the US. These are largely own goals. If the DOD would write longer term contracts. If we did not declare essential production facilities to be historic landmarks, strangling expansion. I did not even want to get into why GOCOs exist or the labyrinth of DOD procurement, but it is sufficient to say they both pose challenges to doing anything new or different. My solace is that in a real conflict, all of that red tape would be put to the side and people can get about building things. There will be a multi-year lag between when that crisis happens and how fast the factories can return, and I hope we can weather that storm.</p><p>Could an entrepreneur change this equation? Anduril’s success is a testament that with the right application of influence and creativity, new companies can compete effectively against the prime contractors. I am less certain that is a possibility here for a few reasons. The primary concern is getting an ROI in 3-4 years on the capital required to build such a facility. You either need a technological edge that dramatically reduces the capital expense, or you need to be able to blend production with other commercial goods (i.e. dual use). For the former, I do not see a dramatically cheaper option unless there is some arbitrage on cheaper electric arc furnaces and presses. For the latter, 3D printing could be an answer, if the material properties existed. However, metal 3D printing companies are struggling with sales as-is, reflecting a lack of commercial demand for commercial 3D printed metal parts. Therefore, even with the steel needed, I am confident it would be a battle to keep them full the rest of the time. This only gets harder without a technological edge like 3D printing, as it would be a sub-scale, commodity steel mill likely optimized for an application with only one real customer. </p><p>The rest of the post is specific research questions I had with the best quality of answers I could find and cited. Questions include:</p><ul><li><p><em>What is the 155 mm artillery shell?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How big is the gap between what we can produce and what is needed?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What does the supply chain for 155 mm shells look like?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Where’s the shortage?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How are casings made?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Can 3D printing help?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What kind of tools are used in the existing process?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What is the maximum capacity for the existing infrastructure?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What’s the yield among existing producers? Can it be improved?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Can they expand existing facilities?</em></p></li><li><p><em>If they’re going to get to 100ku per month by 2025, how are they going to do it?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How long does it take to set up a new plant? Why?</em></p></li><li><p><em>The need for 155 mm shells is unique to European wars. Why worry about this if the risk is a war in the Pacific?</em></p></li><li><p><em>In a direct conflict, what would we do?</em></p></li></ul><p>If you see anything incorrect or do additional research, please let me know.</p><p>Throughout the war in Ukraine, the 155mm shell has been a weapon of choice. Without air superiority, the 155 mm shell combines range, lethality, fire rate, and mobility to project force up to 20 miles. With small, cheap drones spotting for them, the army of Ukraine was able to consistently halt quantitatively superior Russian advances.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png" width="574" height="375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:574,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Base bleed variant of a M795 155 mm artillery, shown for its diagram of a M795 shell.

The basic requirements of an artillery shell are that it must withstand great force to be launched, before another explosion breaks the shell into fragments. The first force—launch—requires a high yield strength, such that the metal won’t deform (yield) under that pressure. In the vernacular, yield strength = yeet distance, while the fragmentation characteristics of the metal relate to the lethality. HF-1 was selected because of how predictable it shatters while maintaining a high yield strength. Everything you could ever want to know about this steel and its competitors is available in a report that Bethlehem Steel put together in 1973: Producibility of Artillery Shells Made from HF-1 Steel available here: </span><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0763988.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AD0763988.pdf (dtic.mil)</a></p><p>Additionally, Military Times visited the factory and put together a good video of the process, minus the technical details but plus a lot of the operational details: </p><div id="youtube2-3vbyoz6ETPc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3vbyoz6ETPc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3vbyoz6ETPc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Roughly, the process is:</p><ol><li><p>Precisely cutting 20’ lengths of steel scrap into billets</p></li><li><p>Billets are heated to 2000 °F</p></li><li><p>Billets are pressed into shape</p></li><li><p>Billets are cooled and shot-blasted</p></li><li><p>Billets are polished</p></li><li><p>Copper bands are added</p></li><li><p>The billet’s nose is heated and formed to shape&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Metal is heat-treated again before an oil bath</p></li><li><p>Casings are polished and washed again</p></li><li><p>Casings are given threads to fit fuses and rifling of the barrels</p></li><li><p>Casings are treated with phosphate, painted, and set aside for transport</p></li></ol><p>Given my experience in the 3D printing industry, this question was top of mind. A core problem for DOD and the defense contractors is that they have to build custom production lines to surge demand. But if there’s no conflict in Europe, these machines are mostly idle. 3D printing is essentially a line designed to be changed much faster, as you can make many different shapes. In theory, with a fleet of metal printers, you could be making war components when necessary and making commercial parts in peacetime. They would almost certainly be more expensive than a dedicated production line, but if the US doesn’t want to pay the capital for it, at least this would be an option. Unfortunately, the short answer is no, 3D printing can’t help here, at least not with today’s technology.&nbsp;</p><p>I am not aware of any metal 3D printer capable of making HF-1 steel or any other high-silicon, high-carbon steel. Metal 3D printing is still pretty limited with some vendors offering questionable material properties that are not attempting to touch high-performance steels. It makes sense the machine vendors wouldn’t prioritize a metal without much commercial appeal.</p><p>The other operative question is if a shell casing would fit in the build volume of a current 3D printer. Given the shells are 858 mm in length and 155 mm in diameter, they fit in the build chamber of Velo3D’s 1MZ printers (315x1000 mm and 600x1000 mm), though it looks like they exceed the existing build plate options. In that orientation, they would also have an extremely long print time.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.jmc.army.mil/Installations.aspx?id=ScrantonOverview" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Army overview page</a><span> for the facility lists the following:</span></p><ul><li><p>Multiple long stroke vertical hydraulic forge press lines</p></li><li><p>Capability to produce large mortar projectiles</p></li><li><p>In house metallurgical testingIn house metallurgical testing</p></li><li><p>Over 120 hydraulic tracer and CNC lathes</p></li><li><p>Machining capability exceeding current ammunition manufacturing requirements</p></li><li><p>In house end-to-end production processes, no outsourcing requirements&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Multiple automated paint lines&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Multiple heat treat furnaces that austenitize, quench, and temper</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png" width="1076" height="840" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:840,&quot;width&quot;:1076,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><span>From a 2017 brochure covering SCAAP’s capabilities: </span><a href="https://www.jmc.army.mil/thumbnails/pdfs/Scranton%20brochure%202017%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Scranton brochure 2017 Final.pdf (army.mil)</a></em></p><p><span>In February 2023, the US Army released some information about SCAAP: SCAAP is a leading producer of large-caliber artillery metal parts and components and can effectively and efficiently manufacture runs from small batch quantities to </span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263789/secretary_of_the_army_discusses_modernization_efforts_during_scaap_visit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">more than one million annually</a><span>”. 1mu annually would be a little over 83ku per month. Of course, in PR speak, they didn’t say they could make 83ku 155 mm shells per month—presumably they can make 83ku of something, maybe a mix of things, if all their lines were running flat out.</span></p><p><span>Given the US was flatout at the end of 2024 at 24ku per month with existing infrastructure, I assume all of that was coming from Scranton AAP. In 2022, the US government authorized an additional $243 million to “</span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263789/secretary_of_the_army_discusses_modernization_efforts_during_scaap_visit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">help ramp up production lines and help put in some new equipment that will allow the plant to be able to produce more shells at a higher rate</a><span>”. I assume some of that money went to scale production from 14ku to 24ku per month, but I can only guess how much remains to be added.</span></p><p>If you ask in the right rooms, the answer you get is there is room for improvement. Allegedly, the site’s structure as a GOCO disincentivizes optimizing yield. The contractor gets paid the same for operating it as-is, and if the government wants to fix it up, they would have to put in the time and energy.</p><p>Beyond the existing retrofits, you must be willing to let go of some history. Scranton AAP started life in 1908 as a steam locomotive erecting and repair facility. With trains on the decline, it was established as an army ammunition plant in 1953 but sits in a larger national historic district and is listed on the National Registry of Historical Places. I imagine it is a spectacular testament to when we used to build stuff.</p><p><span>Build a new facility somewhere else.

We have many of the machines required in the US; these would need to be co-located to be dedicated to a war effort. The permitting issues would evaporate, and the DOD would award contracts of whatever length to justify the facilities. With the tools and raw materials, the next question is having the right mix of people and automation to operate the tools. In a crunch like this, you would likely have more people initially while you quickly automated what you could. Training those workers would be key.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will <a href="https://www.epa.govt.nz/news-and-alerts/latest-news/epa-bans-forever-chemicals-in-cosmetic-products/">ban the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in cosmetic products</a> starting in 2027. This will make the country one of the first in the world to take this step on PFAS to protect people and the environment.</p>
<p>PFAS are sometimes used in products such as nail polish, shaving cream, foundation, lipstick and mascara. They are added to smooth the skin, or to make cosmetic products more durable, spreadable and water resistant. In the announcement on 30 January, the EPA said that although research suggests that PFAS are only found in a small number of products it was taking a ‘precautionary approach’ to the potential risks.</p>
<p>‘Banning these chemicals in cosmetics is part of our ongoing response, which includes phasing out all PFAS-firefighting foams and testing for background levels of PFAS in the New Zealand environment,’ said Shaun Presow, hazardous substances reassessments manager at the EPA.</p>
<p>The decision on PFAS is one of a number of updates that have been made to the Cosmetic Products Group Standard, to ensure cosmetic products are safe.</p>

During periods of low production, the weight is released and used to power a turbine as it drops.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Disused mines have the potential to store vast amounts of electricity using gravity batteries</p><p> (iStock/ Getty Images)</p></figcaption></figure><p>The gravity battery system has been developed by Scottish firm Gravitricity, which plans to use the Finnish mine as a full-scale prototype to demonstrate the technology.</p><p>“This project will demonstrate at full scale how our technology can offer reliable long-life energy storage that can capture and store energy during periods of low demand and release it rapidly when required,” said Martin Wright, an executive chairman at Gravitricity.</p><p>“This full-scale project will provide a pathway to other commercial projects and allow our solution to be embedded into mine decommissioning activities, offering a potential future for mines approaching the end of their original service life.”</p><figure><figcaption><p>A schematic of how the Underground Gravity Energy Storage system would work</p><p> (IIASA)</p></figcaption></figure><p>A study last year by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) estimated that gravity <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/batteries">batteries</a> in abandoned underground mines could store up to 70TWh of energy – enough to meet global electricity demands.</p><p>The repurposed mines could also provide economic benefits to the communities that previously relied on the mine for their livelihoods.</p><p>The IIASA analysts noted that mines already have the basic infrastructure for such an endeavour, while also being connected to the power grid.</p><p>“This significantly reduces the cost and facilities for the implementation of Underground Gravity Energy Storage (UGES) plants,” the study noted.</p><p>The Pyhäsalmi Mine was decommissioned in 2022, with Graviticity claiming that 600 direct and indirect jobs were impacted. Other initiatives being explored for the site include a solar farm.</p><p>“As the world generates more electricity from intermittent renewable energy sources, there is a growing need for technologies which can capture and store energy during periods of low demand and release it rapidly when required” Gravitricity’s website states.</p><p>“We are developing innovative, long-life, underground technologies which store energy safely and deliver it on demand at a lower lifetime cost than current alternatives.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In many ways, the “Grace” CG100 server processor created by Nvidia – its first true server CPU and a very useful adjunct for extending the memory space of its “Hopper” GH100 GPU accelerators – was designed perfectly for HPC simulation and modeling workloads. And several major supercomputing labs are putting the Grace CPU through the HPC paces and we are seeing some interesting early results.</p>
<p>The Grace CPU has a relatively high core count and a relatively low thermal footprint, and it has banks of low-power DDR5 (LPDDR5) memory – the kind used in laptops but gussied up with error correction to be server class – of sufficient capacity to be useful for HPC systems, which typically have 256 GB or 512 GB per node these days and sometimes less.</p>
<p>Put two Grace CPUs together into a Grace-Grace superchip, a tightly coupled package using NVLink chip-to-chip interconnects that provide memory coherence across the LPDDR5 memory banks and that consumes only around 500 watts, and it gets plenty interesting for the HPC crowd. That yields a total of 144 Arm Neoverse “Demeter” V2 cores with the Armv9 architecture, and 1 TB of physical memory with 1.1 TB/sec of peak theoretical bandwidth. For some reason, probably relating to yield on the LPDDR5 memory, only 960 GB of that memory capacity and only 1 TB/sec of that memory bandwidth is actually available. If Nvidia wanted to do it, it could create a four-way Grace compute module that would be coherent across 288 cores and 1.9 TB of memory with 2 TB/sec of aggregate bandwidth. Such a quad might give an <em>N-1</em> or <em>N-2</em> generation GPU a run for the money. . . .</p>
<p>For reference, we did <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/03/25/nvidias-grace-arm-server-chip-is-a-game-changer/">our initial analysis on the Grace chip</a> at launch back in March 2022, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/08/29/details-emerge-on-nvidias-grace-arm-cpu/">drilled down into the architecture of the Grace chip</a> in August 2022 (when no one was sure what Arm core Nvidia was using as yet), and <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/09/13/other-than-nvidia-who-will-use-arms-neoverse-v2-core/">went deep into the Demeter V2 core</a> in September 2023 when Arm released details on the architecture. We are not going to get into the architecture all over again but we will remind you that the Arm V2 core that Nvidia adopted for Grace (rather than design its own core) has four 128-bit SVE2 vector engines, making it comparable to the pair of AVX-512 vector engines in an Intel Xeon SP architecture and therefore able to run classic HPC workloads as well as certain AI inference workloads (those that aren’t too fat) and maybe even the retraining of modestly sized AI models.</p>
<p>The data recently published out of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the State University of New York campuses in Stony Brook and Buffalo certainly bear this out. Both groups published some benchmark results pitting Grace-Hopper and Grace-Grace superchips on a wide variety of HPC and AI benchmarks, and it shows what we already surmised: if you look at thermals and probably cost, the Grace CPU is going to be able to pull its weight in HPC.</p>
<p>Both organizations published papers out of the <a href="https://sighpc.ipsj.or.jp/HPCAsia2024/">HPC Asia 2024 conference</a> held in Nagoya, Japan last week. The one that came out of BSC is called <em>Nvidia Grace Superchip Early Evaluation for HPC Applications</em>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3636480.3637284">which you can read here</a>, and the one from the Stony Brook and Buffalo researchers is called <em>First Impressions of the Nvidia Grace CPU Superchip and Nvidia Grace Hopper Superchip for Scientific Workloads</em>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3636480.3637097">which you can read here</a>. Together, the papers present a realistic view of how key HPC applications perform on Grace-Grace and Grace-Hopper superchips. The paper from the SUNY researchers is more useful perhaps because it brings together performance figures from multiple HPC centers and one cloud builder. To be specific, the data from the second paper draws on performance data from Stony Brook, AWS, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Texas Advanced Computing Center, and Purdue University.</p>
<p>BSC compared the performance of the Nvidia Grace-Grace and Grace-Hopper superchips, which are part of the experimental cluster portion of its <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/06/16/atos-wins-marenostrum-5-deal-at-barcelona-supercomputing-center/">MareNostrum 5 system</a>, against the X86 CPU nodes of the prior MareNostrum 4 supercomputer, which was based on nodes comprised of a pair of 24-core “Skylake” Xeon SP-8160 Platinum processors running at 2.1 GHz. Here is a handy dandy block diagram of the MareNostrum 4 nodes compared to the Grace-Hopper and Grace-Grace nodes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143604"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper.jpg" alt="" width="1130" height="240" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper.jpg 1130w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-768x163.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-600x127.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1130px) 100vw, 1130px"></a></p>
<p>On the Grace-Hopper nodes, BSC only tested various HPC applications on the CPU portion of the superchip. (The Stony Brook team tested the CPU-CPU pair and the CPU-GPU pair in its evaluation of the early adopter Nvidia systems.)</p>
<p>Here is another handy dandy table that BSC put together comparing the architectures of the three systems tested:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143605"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="414" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients.jpg 541w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px"></a></p>
<p>BSC says that the early access versions of the Grace processor had CPUs that were geared down to 3.2 GHz and that the memory bandwidth was also geared down from what Nvidia expected that full production units would have. The exact amount was not quantified, but the unit tested had a clock speed of around 3.2 GHz on the Grace CPU.</p>
<p>As for applications, BSC ran its homegrown Alya computational mechanics code as well as the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics, the NEMO oceanic climate model, the LAMMPS molecular dynamics model, and the PhysiCell multicellular simulation framework on the three types of nodes. Here is the rundown on how the Grace-Grace nodes compared to the MareNostrum 4 nodes. We are ignoring the Grace-Hopper nodes since the GPUs were not used and since it should be roughly half the performance of the Grace-Grace nodes. Take a look at these speedups when the same number of cores are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Alya application, Grace-Grace was 1.67X faster to 1.81X.</li>
<li>On OpenFOAM, the speedup with Grace-Grace was 4.49X.</li>
<li>On NEMO, the speedup was 2.78X.</li>
<li>On LAMMPS, the speedup was 2.1X to 2.9X for the same number of cores, varying from 1 to 288.</li>
<li>On PhysiCell, the speedup was 3.24X for the same 48 cores on each node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the Grace-Grace unit has three times as many cores, so the node-to-node performance should be in proportion to this.</p>
<p>The Stony Brook paper also did a bunch of benchmarks and collected results from other machines, as we pointed out above. Here is the table showing the relative performance of the various nodes running the HPC Challenge (HPCC) benchmark, with the Matrix, LINPACK and FFT elements pulled out separately:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143607"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc.jpg" alt="" width="1121" height="380" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc.jpg 1121w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc-768x260.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc-600x203.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px"></a></p>
<p>It has been a long time since we have seen benchmark data with error bars, which are obviously always present because of the difficulty of making readings and which most tests do not include. Anyway, at the socket level, the Grace-Grace superchip performance somewhere between an Intel “Ice Lake” and “Skylake” Xeon SP and somewhere higher than a “Milan” and “Rome” AMD Epyc. (Beautiful tables, but the way. <em>Thank you</em>.)</p>
<p>On the much tougher High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) test, which stresses the balance between compute and memory bandwidth and which often makes supercomputers look pathetic, here is how the Grace-Grace superchip stacked up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143608"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="206" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg.jpg 1014w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg-768x211.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg-600x165.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p>
<p>Here is how Grace-Grace stacked up on OpenFOAM, using the MotoBikeQ simulation with 11 million cells across all machines:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143609"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="158" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam.jpg 1014w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam-768x162.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam-600x127.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p>
<p>We would have expected for the Grace-Grace unit to do better here. <em>Hmmm.</em></p>
<p>And finally, here is how the Gromacs molecular dynamics benchmark lined up on the various nodes, with both CPU-GPU and CPU-only variations:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143606"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="397" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs.jpg 897w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs-600x367.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></a></p>
<p>We have a winner! Look at how well that Grace-Hopper combination does. But any CPU paired with the same Hopper GPU would probably do as well. On the CPU-only Grace-Grace unit, the Gromacs performance is almost as potent as a pair of “Sapphire Rapids” Xeon Max Series CPUs. It is noteworthy that the HBM memory on this chip doesn’t help that much for Gromacs. <em>Hmmmm</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is some food for thought about the Grace CPU and HPC workloads. There are other benchmarks in the Stony Brook paper, so be sure to check them out.</p>

    <a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6">A Conspiracy To Kill IE6</a>
  </h2>
	<p>The bittersweet consequence of YouTube’s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it.</p>

<p>I do not recall the exact triggering event that led to our web development team laying out plans to kill IE6 over lunch in the YouTube cafeteria. Perhaps it was the time I pushed out a CSS stylesheet that included an attribute selector on a semi-supported HTML element. Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE. Under very specific conditions, an attribute selector on an unsupported HTML element in IE would create an internal recursion that would at best, cause the browser to crash and at worst, trigger a blue screen of death. Or perhaps it was the hundredth time one of our software engineers had innocently pushed out an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with an empty src attribute. Nobody joining the team could be expected to know that in early versions of IE, the browser would load the root path “/” for empty src attributes. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag would suddenly behave like an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, loading our homepage and all of its dependent resources in what could become an exponentially expanding recursive loop. Whenever an empty image tag found its way on to the homepage, it was all-hands-on-deck emergency to locate and replace the offending code before we melted our servers into paperweights.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever the event at that time was, it had been brutal and it had been IE6 related. IE6 had been the bane of our web development team’s existence. At least one to two weeks every major sprint cycle had to be dedicated to fixing new UI that was breaking in IE6. Despite this pain, we were told we had to continue supporting IE6 because our users might be unable to upgrade or might be working at companies that were locked in. IE6 users represented around 18% of our user base at that point. We understood that we could not just drop support for it. However, sitting in that cafeteria, having only slept about a few hours each in the previous days, our compassion for these users had completely eroded away. We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers? We openly daydreamed about cubicle workers around the world suddenly inventing creative “business” reasons for needing upgraded browsers. Grandparents would hold their technically savvy grand-kids hostage, demanding they fix their “YouTubes”. What had begun as a team therapy session started to materialize into an actual plan, a plan we quickly realized we were uniquely positioned to execute on. </p>

<p>The plan was very simple. We would put a small banner above the video player that would only show up for IE6 users. It would read “We will be phasing out support for your browser soon. Please upgrade to one of these more modern browsers.” Next to the text would be links to the current versions of the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, IE8 and eventually, Opera. The text was intentionally vague and the timeline left completely undefined. We hoped that it was threatening enough to motivate end users to upgrade without forcing us to commit to any actual deprecation plan. Users would have the ability to close out this warning if they wanted to ignore it or deal with it later. The code was designed to be as subtle as possible so that it would not catch the attention of anyone monitoring our checkins. Nobody except the web development team used IE6 with any real regularity, so we knew it was unlikely anyone would notice our banner appear in the staging environment. We even delayed having the text translated for international users so that a translator asking for additional context could not inadvertently surface what we were doing. Next, we just needed a way to slip the code into production without anyone catching on.</p>

<p><img src="https://cz.imgix.net/youtube-ie6-highlight.png?fm=pjpg&amp;w=800&amp;border=1000" alt="YouTube IE6 Deprecation Banner"></p>

<p>The IE6 Deprecation Banner on YouTube in 2009</p>

<p>It turned out that a handful of us had entered YouTube at an interesting time… several months after YouTube had been acquired by Google but before Google had begun deeply integrating YouTube into their larger organization. The early YouTube engineers were rightfully territorial and initially hesitant to adapt to Google’s infrastructure and norms. With their penchants for gray-hat hacking, fast cars, and hard whiskey and an uncommon number of piercings, tattoos, and minor arrest records, many had been rejected during previous Google interviews. Ending up at YouTube instead, they found themselves breaking their backs to stay ahead of exponentially growing traffic while having to constantly defend against critics explaining how Google Video would imminently kill them. By the time they were acquired into Google, many of these engineers had come to view their outcast identity as a critical component of their eventual success. </p>

<p>To cement their authority over the YouTube codebase during the integration into Google, the early engineers created a specialized permission set called “OldTuber”. OldTuber granted you the ability to completely bypass the new Google-oriented code enforcement policies, enabling anyone holding it to commit code directly to the YouTube codebase, with only the most glancing of code reviews from anyone. No need for code readability. No need for exhaustive tests. No need for maintaining code coverage. If you broke the site by improperly wielding OldTuber status, it was on your head and you would lose the privilege immediately, if not your job. So you just had to be a good citizen and never break the site. Our boss, an early YouTube engineer himself, had gone out of his way to ingratiate the web development team with the rest of the early YouTube engineers. Through his efforts, a couple of us eventually found ourselves in possession of OldTuber status, despite never having been a part of the original team. It was like we were just walking down the street when someone mistook us for valets and handed us the keys to their Ferrari. For better or for worse, we were not exactly the types to just hand the keys back and walk away. We saw an opportunity in front of us to permanently cripple IE6 that we might never get again. If this went at all wrong, a number of us would surely be fired. Our most renegade web developer, an otherwise soft-spoken Croatian guy, insisted on checking in the code under his name, as a badge of personal honor, and the rest of us leveraged our OldTuber status to approve the code review. The code merged into production and our banner went live a few days later.</p>

<p>The first person to come by our desks was the PR team lead. He was a smart, dapper man who was always bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Except this time. This time he was uncharacteristically prickly. He had come in on an otherwise normal day to find email from every major tech news publication asking why the second largest website on the planet was threatening to cut off access to nearly a fifth of its user base. Fortunately for us, the publications had already settled on a narrative that this was a major benefit to the Internet. By their call, YouTube was leading the charge towards making the web a faster, safer experience for all of its users. The entire PR team had Macs running Chrome and could not even see what we had done, let alone issue comments to the press on any of it. They were caught completely unaware. We eagerly told them everything about what we had launched and helped them craft the necessary talking points to expand on the narrative already established by the media. Satisfied that he could get back in front of the story, the PR team lead turned and warned us to never do anything like this without telling him first. He did not want to let great public relations opportunities like this slip by ever again.</p>

<p>Next came the lawyers. Two senior lawyers sprinted over to our desks in a state of buttoned-down panic. They immediately demanded that we remove the banner. We explained how we would need the SREs to do an emergency push and that it would take at least a few hours to do. Frustrated, one of the lawyers  asked “Why did you have to put Chrome first?” Confused, I explained that we did not give any priority to Chrome. Our boss, in on the conspiracy with us, had thoughtfully recommended that we randomize the order of the browsers listed and then cookie the random seed for each visitor so that the UI would not jump around between pages, which we had done. As luck would have it, these two lawyers still used IE6 to access certain legacy systems and had both ended up with random seeds that placed Chrome in the first position. Their fear was that by showing preferential treatment to Chrome, we might prick the ears of European regulators already on the lookout for any anti-competitive behavior. While the lawyers conceded that nothing we had done would have likely risen to that level of offense, it had happened on their watch and they did not appreciate that. I repeatedly cleared the cookies in my copy of IE6 and showed the browsers reshuffling with each refresh. Content with the demonstration, the lawyers quickly retreated back to their desks without any further concerns.</p>

<p>I expected the next people to be the engineering managers and that they would be the angriest given how clearly we had abused our OldTuber status. Suspiciously, nobody came by that day. The next day, a handful of engineers stopped by to congratulate us on the launch of the banner after reading articles around the Internet, but that was it. I asked my boss if he was getting any blowback and he shrugged, indicating that nobody had pulled him aside yet. It seemed that for the moment we were in the clear. Surprised and unable to make sense of this, I probed one of the managers about what he thought about the banner launching. He responded “Oh, I just figured you guys copied the banner that Google Docs had put up.” I was confused. How could Google Docs have beaten us to the punch on this? I opened up Google Docs in IE6 and sure enough, a banner very much like ours was showing at the top. It implored their users to upgrade to avoid breaking features in terms similarly vague to ours.</p>

<p>I had met a few engineers on the Google Docs team while working on some shared Javascript libraries. I reached out to one and asked how they had arrived at the decision to launch their own banner. He explained to me that they had been wanting to deprecate IE6 support for a long time but their managers would not let them for the same reasons we had always heard. One of their engineers testing in IE6 had noticed the YouTube banner pretty shortly after it went live and immediately took it to their manager as evidence as to why they should do the same. Shortly thereafter, the Google Docs engineers whipped up their own IE6 banner and pushed it into production, presumably under the mistaken assumption that we had done our diligence and had received all of the necessary approvals. The first time many Googlers heard chatter about IE6 banners was from email threads where other teams had begun asking if they could deprecate IE6 like Google Docs had. Luck would have it that this had included many of our managers. Amazingly, we had somehow bypassed detection as the originators of the IE6 banner inside of Google.</p>

<p>Eventually the YouTube engineering management did ask themselves how the decision to deprecate IE6 was ultimately made, given it happened so quickly and seemed conspicuously premature for a media site of our scale and with such a wide user base. Once they realized what had happened, they cornered our boss for details, grappled with the consequences of our actions and begrudgingly arrived at the conclusion that the ends had justified the means. Between YouTube, Google Docs, and several other Google properties posting IE6 banners, Google had given permission to every other site on the web to add their own. IE6 banners suddenly started appearing everywhere. Within one month, our YouTube IE6 user base was cut in half and over 10% of global IE6 traffic had dropped off while all other browsers increased in corresponding amounts. The results were better than our web development team had ever intended. </p>

<p>We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/bzzzzzz-youtube-gets-a-vuvuzela-button-seriously/">and never snuck anything into production again.</a></p>

   <p>It was the first day of spring break in 1992 in Phoenix,  and 12-year-old Heather Smith was excited for her family's upcoming ski trip.</p>   <p>But before Smith and her family had even packed their snow pants, she realized she didn't feel good. "I woke up feeling just a little bit nauseous, and I wasn't sure why. Throughout the course of the day, I started to feel worse and worse and started to develop pain in the abdomen," she says. </p>   <p>By about midafternoon, her father took her to urgent care. She ended up getting emergency surgery to have her appendix out.  </p>   
   <p>Smith still has a small scar from the appendectomy. And after the surgery, she found herself intrigued by the part of her body she had so suddenly lost. "It inspired me to wonder: Why do we have this weird little organ in the first place? What does it do? Why does it get inflamed?"</p>   <p><a href="https://facultyprofiles.midwestern.edu/55-heather-f-smith">Smith</a> grew up to be a professor of anatomy at Midwestern University and editor-in-chief of a journal called <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/19328494"><em>The Anatomical Record</em></a><em>.</em> And all these decades later, Smith has made a mark in the field by studying the very organ that threw off her family's vacation plans in 1992. </p>   <p>She acknowledges that the appendix has a bad rap as a useless organ that can cause you pain and require emergency surgery. "But it turns out recent research shows it does have functions that can help us," she says.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave">NPR's <em>Short Wave</em> </a>spoke to Smith about what the appendix is good for and how a future where appendicitis can be prevented or treated without emergency surgery could be on the way.</p>   <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>   <p><strong>What and where is the appendix?</strong></p>   <p>The type of appendix that humans and some primates and rodents have looks like a little worm. It's about the size of your pinky finger, and it projects off the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. </p>   
   <p>You can identify the location based on a landmark called McBurney's point. So if you draw a line between your bellybutton and the part of your pelvis that sticks out [on the right], two thirds of the way down, that's about where the appendix is.</p>   <p><strong>How did scientists get the idea that the appendix was useless?</strong></p>   <p>There had been a lot of discussion about what the appendix might do as a function, whether it served a function, prior to [Charles] Darwin's time. The [fact] that we can live without it does provide some support for the idea that it's vestigial and it doesn't really do anything. And so Darwin's interpretation of it as a vestige was reasonable at the time, given the information that he had. </p>   <p>But now with modern technology, we can see things like the microanatomy and the biofilms in the appendix, and we have a better understanding of what it is and what it's doing.</p>   <p><strong>How has the appendix evolved over time? </strong></p>   <p>If you map the distribution of appendices across a phylogeny — a tree of mammal life — you can interpret that the appendix has actually <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/22/10/1984/7324393">evolved independently</a>. It has appeared independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution. So that is evidence that it must serve some adaptive function. It's unlikely that the same type of structure would keep appearing if it wasn't serving some beneficial role.</p>   <p><strong>So what are the appendix's beneficial roles? </strong></p>   <p>It turns out that the appendix appears to have two related functions. The first function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things in the gut. </p>   <p>The second function that it serves is what we refer to as the safe house. So this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936308/">Duke University in 2007</a>. And they argued that the appendix may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have. </p>   
   <p>During times of gastrointestinal distress — you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system — the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea is it's safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good bacteria throughout the rest of the gut. </p>   <p>So the appendix is kind of helping us in two ways, both within the gut: It's helping to fight off invading pathogens, but also to repopulate the gut with this beneficial bacteria after gastrointestinal issues.</p>   <p><strong>Why do some people get appendicitis?</strong></p>   <p>Appendicitis is predominantly happening in the industrialized nations of the world — areas where fiber content of the diet tends to be lower. So one hypothesis is that, with the lower fiber content, we're more likely to get little pieces of food that's being digested stuck [inside] the appendix and cut off blood supply and cause this inflammation. </p>   <p>The other hypothesis that doesn't seem like it's quite as plausible these days has to do with an old idea called the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that these days we do so much oversanitization, with all of our antibacterials and all our antibiotics that we take, that our immune systems are not developing properly because they don't have exposure to the full range of pathogens that we would otherwise. And so the immune system overreacts and panics. And because the appendix has so much immune tissue, it's one of the areas where this manifests.  </p>   <p><strong>Could this new understanding lead to new treatments?</strong></p>   <p>I think there's some promising treatments out there. People are looking into antibiotics and other ways of treating appendicitis without completely removing it, given the evidence that is accumulating that it is in fact helpful for your health to have an appendix. Studies have shown that infections with the really bad, nasty bacteria <em>C. diff</em> tend to be higher in people who have had their appendix removed. </p>   
   <p>So there are health benefits to retaining the appendix. In an ideal world, we would have a future where we wouldn't have to always remove it.</p>   <p><strong>What have you gained from studying this "weird little organ"?</strong></p>   <p>I think this study has shown me the importance of looking into small anatomical details. Anatomy is just the study of the body, so you'd think that it's a dead science. You'd think we know everything about the body, especially the human body. </p>   <p>But it turns out that there's actually a lot more variation and function and microanatomical adaptations that haven't been fully realized. So doing just descriptive studies of exotic animals that have never been described or looking at small parts of our own bodies that haven't been well documented are absolutely worthwhile.</p>

      <p>Last September I hopped on board with <a href="https://www.wallapop.com/">Wallapop</a> as a Search Data Scientist and since then part of my work has been working with <a href="https://solr.apache.org/">Solr</a>, an open source search engine based on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>. I’ve got the basics of how a search engine works, but I had this itch to understand it even better. So, I rolled up my sleeves and decided to build one from scratch.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk goals. Ever heard of the “<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/">Small Website Discoverability Crisis</a>”? The problem it’s basically that small websites, ones like this one, are impossible to be found using Google or any other search engine. My mission? Making those tiny websites great again. I believe in bringing back the glory of the little guys, away from the Google SEO frenzy.</p>

<p>In this post I will walk you through the journey of buliding a search engine from scratch using Python. As usual, all the code I’ve written can be found on my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/alexmolas/microsearch">microsearch repo</a>). This implementation doesn’t pretend to be a production-ready search engine, just a usable toy example showing how a search engine works under the hood.</p>

<p>Also, let me be sincere and admit I’ve exaggerated a little bit in the post title. Indeed, the search engine I’ve implemented is around 80 lines of Python, but I’ve also written some complementary code (data crawler, API, HTML templates, etc.) that’s over makes the whole project a bit bigger. However, I think the interesting part of this project is the search engine which has less than 80 lines.</p>

<p>PS. After writing this post and <code>microsearch</code> I realized that Bart de Goede did <a href="https://github.com/bartdegoede/python-searchengine">something similar</a> a couple of years ago. My implementation is very similar to Bart’s, but in my case, I think I did some things better, in particular (1) my crawler is async, which makes things much faster, and (2) I’ve implemented a user interface that allows to interact with the search engine.</p>

<h2 id="microsearch">microsearch</h2>

<p>Now, let’s delve into the components that make up <code>microsearch</code> and explore how I crafted each element: (1) the crawler, (2) the inverted index, (3) the ranker, and (4) the interface. In the following sections, I’ll provide both theoretical descriptions and practical details on how each concept was implemented in my project.</p>

<h2 id="crawler">Crawler</h2>

<p>The first step to building a search engine is to have data to search. Depending on your use case you can crawl existing data (as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers">Google</a> does) or you can use your own data (as Wallapop or any other e-commerce/marketplace does).</p>

<p>Since one of my intentions was to build a “local Google” I decided to use data from the blogs I follow to build the search engine. In this case, crawling consists of downloading and cleaning all the posts of a certain list of blogs. To make it easier I’ve only crawled posts of blogs with RSS <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. And to make it faster, I’ve used the <code>asyncio</code> Python library. Using asynchronous code has sped up the crawling time from 20 minutes to 20 seconds.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve used a list of 642 RSS feeds. Of these feeds around 100 are the ones I usually read (blogs about ML, data science, math, etc.), and I scrapped the other 500 from <a href="https://github.com/surprisetalk/blogs.hn">surprisetalk blogs.hn project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inverted-index">Inverted index</h2>

<p>An inverted index is a data structure that maps keywords to documents. This data structure makes it trivial to find documents where a certain word appears. When a user searches for some query the inverted index is used to retrieve all the documents that match with the keywords in the query.</p>

<p>To implement the inverted index I’ve used a <code>defaultdict</code> with the signature <code>dict[str, dict[str, int]]</code>. This is, a mapping that given a word (a <code>str</code>) returns another mapping from URL (a <code>str</code>) to the number of times that word appears in the URL (a <code>int</code>). The default value of the mapping is a mapping from URL to <code>0</code>, so if we try to get the value of a keyword that doesn’t exist in a URL we get a zero.</p>

<p>The logic of the inverted index is defined within a class called <code>SearchEngine</code>. We initialize it with two private dicts.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SearchEngine</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>))</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we implement the <code>index</code> methods, which receives an URL and its content, normalizes the content (ie: remove punctuation, everything to lowercase, etc.), and then add it to the index.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>content</span>
    <span>words</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>" "</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>word</span> <span>in</span> <span>words</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>[</span><span>word</span><span>][</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To make the indexing process more usable we can implement a bulk index option, which receives a list of URLs and documents and index them.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>bulk_index</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>documents</span><span>:</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]]):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span> <span>in</span> <span>documents</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we can read the index using the <code>get_url</code> method, which receives a keyword and returns the URLs that contain the keyword.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_urls</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>keyword</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>keyword</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>keyword</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>[</span><span>keyword</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to index the document <code>Foo</code> with the text <code>Hello, World! My name is Foo!</code>, and the document <code>Bar</code> with the text <code>Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!</code> and then search for the word <code>Foo</code>, we can do it as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> from microsearch.engine import engine
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Bar"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.get_urls<span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>)</span>
defaultdict<span>(</span>&lt;class <span>'int'</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 1, <span>'Bar'</span>: 1<span>})</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.get_urls<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span><span>)</span>
defaultdict<span>(</span>&lt;class <span>'int'</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 1, <span>'Bar'</span>: 1<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="ranker">Ranker</h2>

<p>Once you have a set of matching documents for a given query, you need a way to sort them. The most famous ranker is Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, which ranks documents based on the links. However, other options to rank the documents exist, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">BM25</a>, which ranks documents based on the content. In my case, I decided to use the standard BM25. The score between a query $Q$ and a document $D$ is computed as</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^n \text{IDF}(q_i) \frac{f(q_i, D)\times(k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \left(1 - b + b \frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}\]

<p>where the query $Q$ contains the keywords $q_1$, $q_2$, …, $q_n$, the document $D$ has length $|D|$, the average length of a document is defined as $\text{avgdl}$, $k_1$ and $b$ are free parameters, $f(q_i, D)$ is the number of times that keyword $q_i$ appears in the document $D$, and finally $\text{IDF}(q_i)$ is the inverse document frequency, computed as</p>

\[\text{IDF}(q_i) = \ln \left(1 + \frac{N - n(q_i) + 0.5}{ n(q_i) + 0.5}\right)\]

<p>where $N$ is the number of documents and $n(q_i)$ is the number of documents containing $q_i$. There are other ways to compute the IDF, but apparently, you can justify this option from theoretical grounds.</p>

<p>With all this math we are ready to implement the missing part of our <code>SearchEngine</code> class. Firstly we add the constants $k_1$ and $b$ as parameters of our class</p>

<p>now we expose some useful properties that we’ll use later</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>property</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>With this information, we are ready to implement our BM25 scorer. The first thing we need to implement is the inverse document frequency method</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>idf</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>kw</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>number_of_documents</span>
    <span>n_kw</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>get_urls</span><span>(</span><span>kw</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>log</span><span>((</span><span>N</span> <span>-</span> <span>n_kw</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>n_kw</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and with this method, we can finally implement the BM scorer. This method receives a keyword and returns a mapping from all the URLs that contain that keyword to their score.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>bm25</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>kw</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]:</span>

        <span>denominator</span> <span>=</span> <span>freq</span> <span>+</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>k1</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>b</span> <span>+</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>b</span> <span>*</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>])</span> <span>/</span> <span>avdl</span><span>)</span>
        <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>idf_score</span> <span>*</span> <span>numerator</span> <span>/</span> <span>denominator</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This method receives a keyword, and for all the indexed documents it computes the BM25 score for that keyword. With this method we can finally implement the <code>search</code> method, which will be the one we’ll use to make queries to our search engine.</p>

<p>The <code>search</code> method receives a query, normalizes it, extracts its keywords (ie: splits it by space), computes the BM25 scores for each keyword, and returns a dictionary of URLs with their total score.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>query</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>keywords</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>" "</span><span>)</span>
    <span>url_scores</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>kw</span> <span>in</span> <span>keywords</span><span>:</span>
        <span>kw_urls_score</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>bm25</span><span>(</span><span>kw</span><span>)</span>
        <span>url_scores</span> <span>=</span> <span>update_url_scores</span><span>(</span><span>url_scores</span><span>,</span> <span>kw_urls_score</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url_scores</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Following the same example as before, we can use it to search as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> from microsearch.engine import engine
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Bar"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.search<span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 0.19869271730423296, <span>'Bar'</span>: 0.16844281759753774<span>}</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.search<span>(</span><span>"foo bar"</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 0.19869271730423296, <span>'Bar'</span>: 0.8088260293054897<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Putting everything together, we have a search engine class that implements the functionalities to index and search documents in less than 80 lines of code.</p>

<p>Finally, once we have a search engine, we want to expose it somehow. In my case, I decided to build a small FastAPI app that exposes an endpoint with the search engine, and then it also renders a simple webpage that allows you to search. To make the output easier to read I decided to just select the top-N URLs.</p>

<p>If you run it you’ll see something like</p>

<p>then you can introduce your queries using the search box and search the indexed documents. For example, if I search for <code>how to build a search engine?</code></p>

<p>I’m aware this is not the nicest UI ever, and the UX can be improved a lot. However, it works fast, the results aren’t so bad, and most importantly, I’ve built it myself from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="missing-features">Missing features</h2>

<p>For the readers who usually work with search engines, it’s obvious that there are a lot of missing features in my implementation. This is a non-exhaustive list of what it’s missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This implementation doesn’t have <strong>query operators</strong>, ie operators that allow you to tune how the query behaves. For example, if you google <code>how to build a search engine -solr</code> you’ll get results that don’t contain the word <code>solr</code> in them.</li>
  <li>The reverse index works by indexing single keywords, and there’s no option to <strong>index n-grams</strong>. Google allows you to search for <code>"search engine"</code> (notice the double quotes) and it’ll only show you results where the two words appear in this specific order.</li>
  <li>Also, this implementation doesn’t have <strong>query or document expansion</strong>, so if you search <code>engine</code> you won’t get documents with the word <code>engines</code>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>crawling and indexing parts are independent</strong> but we could implement it in such a way that the indexing happens during the crawling, ie: as soon as we have a document we index it. This could be done asynchronously as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’ve enjoyed a lot working on this project. It has helped me to understand better how Solr works under the hood, and while I still have a lot to learn I think I have a better intuition now.</p>

<p>As a side effect, I’ve also learned how amazing is writing asynchronous code for IO-bounded operations. My first implementation of the crawler took ages to finish, and with the async implementation, it took a moment to finish.</p>

<p>My next step on my journey to build a personal search engine is to implement semantic search capabilities in the search engine. I’ve been playing a bit with embedding models and ANN, so my next step is to add this functionality to microsearch. Keep tuned for more!</p>
