</div></div><p><em>Mike Davis | </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HBQ2DZQ?tag=longreads-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecology of Fear</a>&nbsp;<em>| Metropolitan Books | September 1998 | 20 minutes&nbsp;(5,921 words)</em></p><p><em>“Homes, of course, will arise here in the thousands. Many a peak will have its castle.”</em></p><p><em>—John Russell McCarthy, </em>These Waiting Hills<em> (1925)</em></p><p>Late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles. Downtown is usually shrouded in acrid yellow smog while heat waves billow down Wilshire Boulevard. Outside air-conditioned skyscrapers, homeless people huddle miserably in every available shadow.</p><p>Across the Harbor Freeway, the overcrowded tenements of the Westlake district—Los Angeles’s Spanish Harlem—are intolerable ovens. Suffocating in their tiny rooms, immigrant families flee to the fire escapes, stoops, and sidewalks. Anxious mothers swab their babies’ foreheads with water while older children, eyes stinging from the smog, cry for paletas: the flavored cones of shaved ice sold by pushcart vendors. Shirtless young men—some with formidable jail-made biceps and mural-size tattoos of the Virgin of Guadalupe across their backs—monopolize the shade of tienda awnings. Amid hundreds of acres of molten asphalt and concrete there is scarcely a weed, much less a lawn or tree.</p><p>Thirty miles away, the Malibu coast—where hyperbole meets the surf—basks in altogether different weather. The temperature is 85°F (20 degrees cooler than Downtown), and the cobalt blue sky is clear enough to discern the wispish form of Santa Barbara Island, nearly 50 miles offshore. At Zuma surfers ride the curl under the insouciant gazes of their personal sun goddesses, while at Topanga Beach, horse trainers canter Appaloosas across the wet sand. Indifferent to the misery on the “mainland,” the residents of Malibu suffer through another boringly perfect day.</p><p>Needless to say, the existential differences between the tenement district and the gilded coast are enormous at any time. But late summer is the beginning of the wildfire season in Southern California, and that’s when Westlake and Malibu suffer a common lot: catastrophic fire.</p><p>According to previous estimates, Westlake (including adjacent parts of Downtown) has the highest urban fire incidence in the nation: one of its two fire stations was inundated by an incredible 20,000 emergency calls in 1993. Some tenements and apartment-hotels have continuous fire histories dating back to their construction in the early twentieth century. The notorious Hotel St. George, for instance, experienced fatal blazes in 1912, 1952, and 1983. Moreover, almost all of the deadly tenement fires in Los Angeles since 1945 have occurred within a one-mile radius of the corner of Wilshire and Figueroa, Downtown.</p><p>Malibu, meanwhile, is the wildfire capital of North America and, possibly, the world. Fire here has a relentless staccato rhythm, syncopated by landslides and floods. The rugged 22-mile-long coastline is scourged, on the average, by a large fire (one thousand acres plus) every two and a half years, and the entire surface area of the western Santa Monica Mountains has been burnt three times over the twentieth century. At least once a decade a blaze in the chaparral grows into a terrifying firestorm consuming hundreds of homes in an inexorable advance across the mountains to the sea. Since 1970 five such holocausts have destroyed more than one thousand luxury residences and inflicted more than $1 billion in property damage. Some unhappy homeowners have been burnt out twice in a generation, and there are individual patches of coastline or mountain, especially between Point Dume and Tuna Canyon, that have been incinerated as many as eight times since 1930.</p><figure><blockquote><p>At least once a decade a blaze in the chaparral grows into a terrifying firestorm consuming hundreds of homes in an inexorable advance across the mountains to the sea.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In other words, stand at the mouth of Malibu Canyon or sleep in the Hotel St. George for any length of time and you eventually will face the flames. It is a statistical certainty. Ironically, the richest and poorest landscapes in Southern California are comparable in the frequency with which they experience incendiary disaster. This was emphasized tragically in 1993 when a May conflagration at a Westlake tenement that killed three mothers and seven children was followed in late October by 21 wildfires culminating on November 2nd in the great firestorm that forced the evacuation of most of Malibu.</p><p>But the two species of conflagration are inverse images of each other. Defended in 1993 by the largest army of firefighters in American history, wealthy Malibu homeowners benefited as well from an extraordinary range of insurance, land use, and disaster relief subsidies. Yet, as most experts will readily concede, periodic firestorms of this magnitude are inevitable as long as residential development is tolerated in the fire ecology of the Santa Monicas.</p><p>On the other hand, most of the 119 fatalities from tenement fires in the Westlake and Downtown areas might have been prevented had slumlords been held to even minimal standards of building safety. If enormous resources have been allocated, quixotically, to fight irresistible forces of nature on the Malibu coast, then scandalously little attention has been paid to the man-made and remediable fire crisis of the inner city.</p><p>* * *</p><p>From the beginning fire has defined Malibu in the American imagination. In Two Years Before the Mast, Richard Henry Dana described sailing northward from San Pedro to Santa Barbara in 1826 and seeing a vast blaze along the coast of José Tapia’s Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit. Despite—or, as we shall see, more likely because of—the Spanish prohibition of the Chumash and Tong-va Indian practice of annually burning the brush, mountain infernos repeatedly menaced Malibu through the nineteenth century. During the great land boom of the late 1880s, the entire latifundio was sold at $10 per acre to the Boston Brahmin millionaire Frederick Rindge. In his memoirs, Rindge described his unceasing battles against squatters, rustlers, and, above all, recurrent wildfire. The great fire of 1903, which raced from Calabasas to the sea in a few hours, incinerated Rindge’s dream ranch in Malibu Canyon and forced him to move to Los Angeles, where he died in 1905.</p><p>From the time of the Tapias, the owners of Rancho Malibu had recognized that the region’s extraordinary fire hazard was shaped, in large part, by the uncanny alignment of its coastal canyons with the annual “fire winds” from the north: the notorious Santa Anas, which blow primarily between Labor Day and Thanksgiving, just before the first rains. Born from high-pressure areas over the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, the Santa Anas become hot and dry as they descend avalanche-like into Southern California. The San Fernando Valley acts as a giant bellows, sometimes fanning the Santa Anas to hurricane velocity as they roar seaward through the narrow canyons and rugged defiles of the Santa Monica Mountains. Add a spark to the dense, dry vegetation on such an occasion and the hillsides will explode in uncontrollable wildfire: “The speed and heat of the fire is so intense that firefighters can only attempt to prevent lateral spread of the fire while waiting for the winds to abate or the fuel to diminish.”</p><div><div><figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/envelope.png?w=55&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/envelope.png?w=167&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/envelope.png?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/envelope.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px"></figure></div>

</div></div><p>Less well understood in the old days was the essential dependence of the dominant vegetation of the Santa Monicas—chamise chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and live oak woodland—upon this cycle of wildfire. Decades of research (especially at the San Dimas Experimental Forest in the San Gabriel Mountains) have given late-twentieth-century science vivid insights into the complex and ultimately beneficial role of fire in recycling nutrients and ensuring seed germination in Southern California’s various pyrophytic flora. Research has also established the overwhelming importance of biomass accumulation rather than ignition frequency in regulating fire destructiveness. As Richard Minnich, the world authority on chaparral brushfire, emphasizes: “Fuel, not ignitions, causes fire. You can send an arsonist to Death Valley and he’ll never be arrested.”</p><p>A key revelation was the nonlinear relationship between the age structure of vegetation and the intensity of fire. Botanists and fire geographers discovered that “the probability for an intense fast running fire increases dramatically as the fuels exceed twenty years of age.” Indeed, half-century-old chaparral—heavily laden with dead mass—is calculated to burn with 50 times more intensity than 20-year-old chaparral. Put another way, an acre of old chaparral is the fuel equivalent of about 75 barrels of crude oil. Expanding these calculations even further, a great Malibu firestorm could generate the heat of three million barrels of burning oil at a temperature of 2,000 degrees.</p><p>“Total fire suppression,” the official policy in the Southern California mountains since 1919, has been a tragic error because it creates enormous stockpiles of fuel. The extreme fires that eventually occur can transform the chemical structure of the soil itself. The volatilization of certain plant chemicals creates a water-repellent layer in the upper soil, and this layer, by preventing percolation, dramatically accelerates subsequent sheet flooding and erosion. A monomaniacal obsession with managing ignition rather than chaparral accumulation simply makes doomsday-like firestorms and the great floods that follow them virtually inevitable.</p><p>For a generation after Rindge’s death, his widow, May, struggled to keep the family Shangri-la isolated and intact in the face of state attempts to push a highway through the rancho. Like one of the iron-fisted heroines played by Barbara Stanwyck, the so-called Queen of the Malibu closed the ranch roads in 1917, strung barbed wire along the perimeter, and posted armed fence-riders with orders to “shoot to kill.” In one episode during the 1920s, Rindge cowboys provoked a tense confrontation with deputy sheriffs after driving away a road survey crew at gunpoint. Hysterical newspaper headlines warned of “Civil War in Peaceful Southern California!”</p><p>But the pressure during the 1920s boom to open the coastal range to speculative subdivision was unrelenting. In the hyperbole of the era, occupation of the mountains became Los Angeles’s manifest destiny. “The day for the white invasion of the Santa Monicas has come,” declared real estate clairvoyant John Russell McCarthy in a booklet published by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> in 1925. In anticipation of this land rush, the county sheriff had been arresting every vagrant in sight and putting them to work on chain gangs building roads through the rugged canyons just south of Rancho Malibu. (Radical critics at the time denounced this system as “deliberate real-estate graft” meant only to enhance land values in mountain districts “which the population of this city does not even know exists.”)</p><p>Widow Rindge, in any event, would not be allowed to stand in the way of “the march of adventuring Caucasians,” as McCarthy put it. After one of the most protracted legal battles in California history, the court granted the state right-of-way through Rancho Malibu. Opened to traffic in 1928, the Pacific Coast Highway gave delighted Angelenos their first view of the magnificent Malibu coast and introduced a potent new source of ignition—the automobile—into the inflammable landscape.</p><p>The indefatigable May Rindge continued to fight the road builders and developers in the courts, but in the end the costs of litigation forced her to lease choice parts of Malibu beachfront to a movie colony that included Jack Warner, Clara Bow, Dolores Del Rio, and Barbara Stanwyck herself. The colony’s unexpected housewarming was a lightning-swift wildfire that destroyed 13 new homes in late October 1929. Exactly a year later, walnut pickers in the Thousand Oaks area accidently ignited another blaze, which quickly grew into one of the greatest conflagrations in Malibu history.</p><p>*The 1930 Decker Canyon fire was a worst-case scenario involving 50-year-old chaparral and a fierce Santa Ana. Faced with a five-mile front of towering flames, 1,100 firefighters could do little except save their own lives. As the firestorm unexpectedly wheeled toward the Pacific Palisades, there was official panic. County Supervisor Wright, his nerves shaken by a visit to the collapsing fire lines, posted a hundred patrolmen at the Los Angeles city limits to alert residents for evacuation. Should the “fire raging in the Malibu District get closer,” he gasped, “our whole city might go.” Ultimately, this apocalypse (which may have given Nathanael West the idea for the burning of Los Angeles in his novel <em>Day of the Locust</em>) was avoided—no thanks to human initiative—when the fickle Santa Ana abruptly subsided.</p><p>In hindsight, the 1930 fire should have provoked a historic debate on the wisdom of opening Malibu to further development. Only a few months before the disaster, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.—the nation’s foremost landscape architect and designer of the California state park system—had come out in favor of public ownership of at least 10,000 acres of the most scenic beach and mountain areas between Topanga and Point Dume. Despite a further series of fires in 1935, 1936, and 1938 which destroyed almost four hundred homes in Malibu and Topanga Canyon, public officials stubbornly disregarded the wisdom of Olmsted’s proposal for a great public domain in the Santa Monicas. The county of Los Angeles, for example, squandered an extraordinary opportunity in 1938 to acquire 17,000 acres of the bankrupt Rindge estate in exchange for $1.1 million in delinquent taxes. At a mere $64 per acre, it would have been the deal of the century.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A monomaniacal obsession with managing ignition rather than chaparral accumulation simply makes doomsday-like firestorms and the great floods that follow them virtually inevitable.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Instead, in December 1940, an impecunious and heartbroken May Rindge was forced to put her entire empire on the auction block. Potential buyers were advised to make “an early selection” of “ocean-front lots, sites for villas, hotels, golf clubs, estates, beach and yacht clubs, income and business lots, small summer home places, ranchitos, 100–640-acre ranchos, and acreage for further subdivision.” The disconsolate Queen of the Malibu died two months later.</p><p>During the Second World War—severe drought years on the West Coast—hundreds of firewatchers were sent into the Southern California mountains to guard against rumored Axis saboteurs. A few months after the watchers were withdrawn, 150 Malibu homes were incinerated in another November fire. Yet this new disaster failed to discourage a postwar migration of artists, printers, book-dealers, poets, screenwriters, and architects (including Olmsted himself)—many of very modest means, some seeking to escape the scrutiny of McCarthyism—who envisaged Malibu as Carmel south. In an engaging memoir of this period, UCLA librarian Lawrence Clark Powell described a genial way of life devoted to Mozart and beachcombing.</p><p>He also provided a classic account of the onslaught of the terrible firestorm of Christmas week 1956, which, burning its way to the sea, retraced the path of the 1930 blaze.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The wind was still savage when we went to bed at ten, the sky swept clear, aglitter with stars, Anacapa flashed its warning light. The cypresses, pines and eucalyptuses were noisier than the surf. Cats’ fur threw sparks when stroked. We slept in spite of the sinister atmosphere.<br></p></blockquote></figure><p>A Forest Service analysis of this disaster, which killed one person and destroyed one hundred homes, stressed the impossible challenge of combating such erratic and untamable natural forces.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Malibu fires combine most known elements of violent, erratic and extreme fire behavior: fire whirls, extreme rates of spread, sudden changes in speed and direction of fire spread, flashovers of unburned gases complicated by intense heat and impenetrable smoke held close to the ground.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Indeed the conflagration, which coincided with a waxing of Cold War anxieties, had unexpected political repercussions. “If the government could not defeat wildfires in the Santa Monicas,” critics asked, “how would it deal with possible nuclear holocausts?” Accordingly the Eisenhower administration acknowledged the Malibu blaze as “the first major fire disaster of national scope,” and Congress—more concerned with the credibility of a vast civil defense establishment than with the tragedy of local homeowners—debated how to provide “complete fire prevention and protection in Southern California.” (Large Malibu fires, moreover, would later be used by researchers to model the behavior of nuclear firestorms.)</p><p>According to fire historian Stephen Pyne, the Malibu blaze also marked the transition from the traditional forest fire problem to a “new fire regime” characterized by the “lethal mixture of homeowners and brush.” This artificial borderland of chaparral and suburb magnified the natural fire danger while creating new perils for firefighters who now had to defend thousands of individual structures as well as battle the fire front itself. “Whereas it was often remarked that chaparral, particularly that composed largely of chamise, is a fire-climax community, it is now joked that the same is true of the Southern California mountain suburb.”</p><p>Ultimately the 1956 fire—followed by two blazes, one month apart, in 1958–59 that severely burned eight firefighters and destroyed another hundred homes—proved the beginning of the end for bohemian Malibu. A perverse law of the new fire regime was that fire now stimulated both development and upward social succession. By declaring Malibu a federal disaster area and offering blaze victims tax relief as well as preferential low-interest loans, the Eisenhower administration established a precedent for the public subsidization of firebelt suburbs. Each new conflagration would be punctually followed by reconstruction on a larger and even more exclusive scale as land use regulations and sometimes even the fire code were relaxed to accommodate fire “victims.” As a result, renters and modest homeowners were displaced from areas like Broad Beach, Paradise Cove, and Point Dume by wealthy pyrophiles encouraged by artificially cheap fire insurance, socialized disaster relief, and an expansive public commitment to “defend Malibu.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>By declaring Malibu a federal disaster area and offering blaze victims tax relief as well as preferential low-interest loans, the Eisenhower administration established a precedent for the public subsidization of firebelt suburbs.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the absence of fire-risk zoning of the sort that Olmsted had earlier advocated, the only constraint on development was the limited supply of water for firefighting and domestic consumption. The completion of a trunk water line, connecting Malibu to Metropolitan Water District reservoirs, was the signal for a new land rush. The county’s Regional Planning Commission promptly endorsed developers’ wildest fantasies by authorizing a staggering 1,400 percent expansion of the Malibu population over the next generation: from 7,983 residents in 1960 to a projected 117,000 in 1980. Although the California coastal acts of 1972 and 1976, under the populist slogan “Don’t Lock Up the Beach!” eventually slowed this real estate juggernaut (as well as squelching such nightmarish proposals as a Corral Canyon nuclear power plant and an eight-lane freeway through Malibu Canyon), the urbanization of the Malibu coast—Los Angeles’s “backyard Big Sur”—was a fait accompli.</p><div><div><figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="320" height="320" src="https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?resize=320%2C320&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/longreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/members-logo.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"></figure></div>

</div></div><p>Yet, even as they were opening the floodgates to destructive overdevelopment, county and state officials were also turning down every opportunity to expand public beach frontage (a miserable 22 percent of the total in 1969). Nor did they show any interest in creating a public land trust in the mountains, which were now entirely under private ownership, right down to the streambeds. Consequently, most of Malibu remained as inaccessible to the general public as it had been in the Rindge era. (For people of color, moreover, it was absolutely off-limits.) As historians of the coastal access battle put it: “The seven million people within an hour’s drive of Malibu got Beach Boys music and surfer movies, but the twenty thousand residents kept the beach.”</p><p>Returning for a final look, UCLA librarian Powell bitterly decried the aristocratization of his beloved coast:</p><blockquote><p>In a feverish buying and selling of land, the coast has become utterly transformed and unrecognizable. Each succeeding house, bigger and grander, takes the view of its neighbors in a kind of unbridled competition.… Once lost, paradise can never be regained.… Developers have bulldozed the Santa Monicas beyond recovery.</p></blockquote><p>The Malibu nouveaux riches built higher and higher in the mountain chamise with scant regard for the inevitable fiery consequences. The next firestorm, in late September 1970, coupled perfect fire weather (drought conditions, 100-degree heat, 3&nbsp;percent humidity, and an 85-mile-per-hour Santa Ana wind) with a bumper crop of combustible wood-frame houses. According to firefighters, the popular cedar shake roofs “popped like popcorn” as a 20-mile wall of flames roared across the ridgeline of the Santa Monicas toward the sea. With the asphalt on the Pacific Coast Highway ablaze and all escape routes cut off, terrified residents of the famed Malibu Colony took refuge in the nearby lagoon. Firebrands fell like hellish rain on the beach, and day became night under the gigantic smoke pall. Coalescing with another blaze in the San Fernando Valley, this greatest of twentieth-century Malibu firestorms ultimately took 10 lives and charred 403 homes, including a ranch owned by then-governor Ronald Reagan.</p><p>Furious property owners—ignorant of the true balance of power between fire suppression and chaparral ecology—denounced local government for failing to save their homes and demanded new, expensive technological “fixes” for Malibu’s wildfire problems. “Elected officials, acutely sensitive to Malibu’s national prominence in political fund-raising, were quick to oblige. A celebrated example occurred in the late 1970s when the Malibu Colony was being pounded by the heaviest surf in a quarter-century. Larry Hagman, <em>Dallas</em>’s J. R. Ewing, is reported to have told Jerry Brown, the governor of California: “Jerry, do something. Goddammit, we’re in real trouble. Get your ass down here!” In short order, Malibu was declared a disaster area and National Guardsmen were helping sandbag Hagman’s—and sometimes Brown date Linda Ronstadt’s—homes.</p><p>Meanwhile, developers—racing to stay ahead of proposed “slow growth” coastal legislation—redoubled their subdivision efforts. The subsequent boom only provided more fuel for the three successive “Halloween” fires that consumed homes in October 1978, 1982, and 1985. The first two blazes both began in Agoura and roughly followed the route of the 1956 fire through Trancas Canyon, while the third repeated the itinerary of the 1930 Decker Canyon conflagration.</p><p>The 1978 fire, which consumed million-dollar homes in the Broad Beach area (where Powell had lived in the more humble 1950s), also set a new speed record: the fire crossed 13 miles of very rugged terrain in less than two hours (the 1970 fire had taken twice the time). One eyewitness described how the rampaging fire front “turned thousands of wild rabbits into balls of flaming fur that darted insanely about, only to start new fires at the spots where they fell.” The surviving beasts—domestic pets and wild animals alike—“mingled in chaos with human evacuees along the beach at Point Dume while oblivious surfers rode the waves.” Traumatized Malibu residents, also battered by disastrous floods and landslides in 1978 and 1980, could be forgiven for imagining that nature was getting angrier at them.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>A Brief Postscript:</p><p>When most of us build or buy a home, we carefully appraise the neighborhood. In Malibu the neighborhood is fire.&nbsp;Fire that revisits the coastal mountains several times a decade.&nbsp;In the past sixty years, ten of these frequent events have turned into all-consuming firestorms.&nbsp;The latest conflagration, the Woolsey Fire, has incinerated 1,500 homes and killed at least three people.&nbsp;It started in dry grasslands just south of Simi Valley, the site of the notorious trial of Rodney King’s assailants, then crossed a freeway to ignite dense coastal sage vegetation on the northern flank of the Santa Monica Mountains.&nbsp;The range’s deep canyons, perfectly aligned with the seasonal Santa Ana Winds, once again as bellows, accelerating the fire’s rush to the coast where it burned beach homes.&nbsp;The large number of residences lost attests not only to the ferocity of the conflagration but also to the amount of new construction since the 1993 firestorm.</p><p>Why more mansions in the fire-loving hills?&nbsp;Because of a perverse fact: after every major California blaze, homeowners and their representatives take shelter in the belief that if wildfire can’t be prevented, nonetheless, its destructiveness can be tamed.&nbsp;Thus the recently incorporated City of Malibu and the County of Los Angeles responded to the 1993 disaster with aggressive&nbsp;regulations about brush clearance and fire-resistant roof materials.&nbsp;Creating ‘defensible space’ became the new mantra, and it was soon echoed across California in the aftermath of other great fires, such as those that swept San Diego County in 2003 and 2007, burning 4,500 homes and killing 30 people.&nbsp;So instead of a long-overdue debate about the wisdom of rebuilding and the need to prevent further construction in areas of extreme natural fire danger, public attention was diverted into a discussion of the best methods for clearing vegetation (rototillers or goats?) and making homes fire-resistant.&nbsp;And if edge suburbs and backcountry subdivisions, in fact, could be fire-proofed, then why not add more?&nbsp;Since 1993. almost half of California’s new homes have been built in fire hazard areas.&nbsp;Yet, as a contemporary Galileo might say of defensible space, ‘still it burns.’&nbsp;In the last eighteen months 20,000 homes and perhaps a 1,000 lives have been lost in one super-fire after another.</p><figure><blockquote><p>When most of us build or buy a home, we carefully appraise the neighborhood. In Malibu the neighborhood is fire.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Such fires are both old and new.&nbsp;Two different causalities are involved.&nbsp;First vegetation and topography, annually orchestrated by our dry hurricanes, define persistent fire patterns and frequencies.&nbsp;Without human intervention, however, lots of small fires ignited by late summer lightning create an intricate patchwork of vegetation of different ages and combustibility.&nbsp;The one-hundred-thousand-acre firestorms that we now experience annually did occur occasionally in the aftermath of epic droughts, but in a ‘natural’ fire regime they were rare.&nbsp;Fire prevention in the twentieth century, however, nurtured large areas of chaparral and forest into old age, creating perfect conditions for great fires.&nbsp;But as long as so many California towns were surrounded by citrus groves and agricultural land, fire even in its new, larger incarnation was usually stopped before it encountered housing.&nbsp;Today our horticultural firebreaks are gone, strawberry fields are now aging suburbs, and the quest for beach fronts, mountain view lots and big trees has created fire hazards that were once unimaginable.</p><p>Climate change, meanwhile, is coming to California in the form of drought and extreme summer heat, along with episodes of record torrential rain. Although scientists debate whether or not median annual precipitation averaged over decades will actually decline, more of it will fall as rain not as snow, a serious concern given that our water system depends on the Sierra snowpack to store and modulate the release of the water that irrigates cities and agribusiness.&nbsp;Moreover, rainfall is no longer an accurate predictor of fire risk.&nbsp;The winter of 2016-17 was the wettest in the history of Northern California, and spring brought the most glorious wildflower display in generations.&nbsp;But July was torrid and coastal temperatures, usually in the 70s, broke 100°F for a week.&nbsp;The greenery of spring was punctually baked into a bumper crop of brown fire-starter.&nbsp;When the winds began to blow in October, first Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco, and then Montecito, just south of Santa Barbara, caught fire.&nbsp;Three thousand homes were lost and several dozen people, mostly elderly and unaware of the approaching menace, died.&nbsp;But nature in California saves one last act and when the heavens opened up on Montecito’s bare burnt hills in January another 25 people disappeared in the fast-moving debris flows.&nbsp;This same encore awaits Malibu and the Sierra foothills over the next few months.</p><p>Finally, a word or two about Malibu and Paradise.&nbsp;The two cities share three common characteristics: both are very white (the Black population of Malibu is 1.5%; Paradise, 0.1%), relatively geriatric (double the state’s median percentage of over-65s), and inhabit notorious fire corridors.</p><p>Indeed the Paradise area plays in the same elite fire league as Malibu with six massive blazes since 1950, including back-to-back fires in the summer of 2008 that necessitated evacuations that gridlocked Paradise’s roads ─ the shape of chaos to come.&nbsp;But otherwise the cities are avatars of two completely different Californias. Home values in Paradise are half of the state’s median and a tenth of Malibu’s ─ making it one of the last affordable places in the state.&nbsp;Household income in Paradise is $13,000 below the state median; Malibu’s $60,000 above.&nbsp;Paradise also has a unique distinction: nearly 20 percent of its under-65 population is enumerated by the last Census as disabled.&nbsp;This extraordinary proportion of elderly, sick and disabled people undoubtedly contributed to the huge, inconsolable death toll. Two kinds of Californians will continue to live with fire: those who can afford (with indirect public subsidies) to rebuild and those who can’t afford to live anywhere else.</p><p>***</p><p><em>Excerpted from</em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HBQ2DZQ?tag=longreads-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster</a>&nbsp;<em>by Mike Davis.</em> <em>©1998 Mike Davis Published by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt and Company.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/great-things-about-rust-beyond-perf/">https://ntietz.com/blog/great-things-about-rust-beyond-perf/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675219">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nearly every line of code I write for fun is in Rust.
It's not because I need great performance, though that's a nice benefit.
I write a lot of Rust because it's a joy to write code in.
There is so much else to love about Rust <em>beyond</em> going fast without segfaults.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite things about it.
Note that these are <em>not</em> unique to Rust by any stretch!
Other languages have similar combinations of features.</p>
<h2 id="expressive-type-safety">Expressive type safety</h2>
<p>There are two aspects of Rust's type system that I really enjoy: type safety and expressiveness.</p>
<p>I got a taste of this expressiveness back when I learned Haskell, and had been seeking it.
I found it in Rust.
One of the other languages I use a fair amount at work<sup><a href="#work">1</a></sup> is Go, and its type system is much harder for me to express ideas in.
You can do it, but you're not getting the type system's help.
Rust lets you put your design straight into types, with enums and structs and traits giving you a lot of room to maneuver.</p>
<p>All the while, it's also giving you good type safety!
I can express a lot in Python, but I don't <em>trust</em> the code as much without robust tests.
You don't have a compiler checking your work!
It's remarkably helpful having Rust's compiler by your side, making sure that you're using types correctly and satisfying constraints on things.
To call back to data races, the type system is one of the reasons we can prevent those!
There are traits that tell you whether or not data is safe to send to another thread or to share with another thread.
If your language doesn't have the equivalent of these traits, then you're probably relying on the programmer to ensure those properties!</p>
<p>That said, Rust's type system isn't an unmitigated good for me.
It can take longer to get something up and running in Rust than in Python, for example, because of the rigidity of the type system: satisfy it or you don't run.
And I find a lot of Rust that uses generics is very hard to read, feeling like it is a soup of traits.
What we make generic is an implementation question, and a cultural question, so that isn't necessarily inherent to the language but does come strongly bundled to it.</p>
<h2 id="it-doesn-t-crash-out-as-much">It doesn't crash out as much</h2>
<p>Okay, I have a beef with Go.
They included Tony Hoare's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Research_and_career">"billion-dollar mistake"</a>: null pointers.
Go gives you pointers, and they can be null<sup><a href="#nil">2</a></sup>!
This means that you can try to invoke methods on a null pointer, which can crash your program.</p>
<p>In contrast, Rust tries very very hard to make you never crash.
You can make null pointers, but you have to use <code>unsafe</code> and if you do that, well, you're taking on the risk.
If you have something which is nullable, you'd use an <code>Option</code> of it and then the type system will make sure you handle both cases.</p>
<p>The places you typically see crashes in Rust are when someone either intentionally panics, for an unrecoverable error, or when they <em>unintentionally</em> panic, if they use <code>unwrap</code> on an <code>Option</code> or <code>Result</code>.
It's better to handle the other case explicitly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can configure the linter, clippy, to deny code that uses <code>unwrap</code> (or <code>expect</code>)!
If you add this to your Cargo.toml file, it will reject any code which uses <code>unwrap</code>.</p>
<pre data-lang="toml"><code data-lang="toml">[lints.clippy]
unwrap_used = "deny"
</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-race-resistance">Data race resistance</h2>
<p>It's <em>so</em> hard to write concurrent code that works correctly.
Data races are one of the biggest factors contributing to this.
Rust's data race prevention is an incredible help for writing concurrent code.</p>
<p>Rust isn't <em>immune</em> to data races, but you have to work harder to make one happen.
They're almost trivial to introduce in most languages, but in Rust, it's a lot harder!
This happens because of the borrow checker, so it's harder to have multiple concurrent actors racing on the same data.</p>
<h2 id="you-get-more-control-when-you-want">You get more control, when you want</h2>
<p>With Rust, you know a lot more about what the CPU and memory will be doing than in many other languages.
You can know this with C and C++, and newer systems programming languages like Zig.
Rust is a little unique, to me, in being notably higher level than these languages while giving you ultimately the same amount of control (if you break glass enough, for some things).</p>
<p>You're still subject to the operating system, most of the time, so you can't control the CPU and memory <em>fully</em>, but you get a lot more control than in Python.
Or even than Go, another language used when you need good performance.</p>
<p>This lets you predict what your code is going to do.
You're not going to have surprise pauses for the garbage collector, and you're not going to have the runtime scheduler put some tasks off for a while.
Instead, you know (or can determine) when memory will be deallocated.
And you ultimately control when threads take tasks (though with async and the Tokio runtime, this gets <em>much</em> muddier and you do lose some of this control).</p>
<p>This predictability is really nice.
It's useful in production, but it's also just really pleasant and comforting.</p>
<h2 id="mixing-functional-and-imperative">Mixing functional and imperative</h2>
<p>Rust lets you write in a functional programming style, and it also lets you write in an imperative programming style.
Most idiomatic code tends toward functional style, but there's a lot of code that uses imperative style effectively as well!</p>
<p>This is pretty unique in my experience, and I really like it.
It means that I, the programmer, can pick the paradigm that best fits the problem at hand at any given moment.
Code can be more expressive and clearer for the author and the team working on the code.</p>
<p>One of the cool things here, too, is that the two paradigms effectively translate between each other!
If you use iterators in Rust, they convert into <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/rusts-iterators-optimize-footgun/">the same compiled binary</a> as the imperative code.
You often don't lose any efficiency from using either approach, and you're truly free to express yourself!</p>
<h2 id="helpful-compiler-errors">Helpful compiler errors</h2>
<p>A few other languages are renowned for their error message quality—Elm comes to mind.
Rust is a standout here, as well.</p>
<p>Earlier in my career, I was <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/lessons-from-my-first-on-call/">abused by C++</a>.
Besides all the production crashes and the associated stress of that, the compiler errors for it were absolutely inscrutable.
If you messed up a template, you'd sometimes get thousands of lines of errors—from one missing semicolon.
And those wouldn't tell you what the error was, but rather, what came <em>after</em> the mistake.</p>
<p>In contrast, Rust's compiler error messages are usually pretty good at telling you exactly what the error is.
They even provide suggestions for how to fix it, and where to read more about the error.
Sometimes you get into a funny loop with these, where following the compiler's suggestions will lead to a loop of suggesting you change it another way and never get it to succeed, but that's fine.
The fact that they're often useful is remarkable!</p>
<h2 id="it-s-fun">It's fun!</h2>
<p>This is the big one for me.
It's very subjective!
I really like Rust for all the reasons listed above, and many more I've forgotten.</p>
<p>There are certainly painful times, and learning to love the borrow checker is a process (but one made faster if you've been abused by C++ before).
But on balance, using Rust has been great.</p>
<p>It's fun having the <em>ability</em> to go ripping fast even when you don't <em>need</em> to.
It's lovely having a type system that lets you express yourself (even if it lets you express yourself <em>too</em> much sometimes).
The tooling is a joy.</p>
<p>All around, there's so <em>much</em> to love about Rust.
The performance and safety are great, but they're the tip of the iceberg, and it's a language worth considering even when you don't need top performance.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <div id="markdown-content"> <p><em>tl;dr:</em></p> <ul> <li>Historically, general approaches always win in AI.</li> <li>Founders in AI application space now repeat the mistakes AI researchers made in the past.</li> <li>Better AI models will enable general purpose AI applications. At the same time, the added value of the software around the AI model will diminish.</li> </ul> <p>Recent AI progress has enabled new <code>products</code> that solve a broad range of <code>problems</code>. I saw this firsthand watching over 100 pitches during YC alumni Demo Day. These problems share a common thread - they’re simple enough to be solved with <code>constrained</code> AI. Yet the real power of AI lies in its <code>flexibility</code>. While <code>products</code> with fewer constraints generally work better, current AI <code>models</code> aren’t reliable enough to build such products at scale. We’ve been here before with AI, many times. Each time, the winning move has been the same. AI founders need to learn this history, or I fear they’ll discover these lessons the hard way.</p> <p>In 2019, Richard Sutton started his famous essay “The Bitter Lesson” with:</p> <p>“The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin”.</p> <p>He points out that throughout AI’s history, researchers have repeatedly tried to improve systems by building in human domain knowledge. The “bitter” part of the title comes from what happens next: systems that simply use more computing power end up outperforming these carefully crafted solutions. We’ve seen this pattern in speech recognition, computer chess, and computer vision. If Sutton wrote his essay today, he’d likely add generative AI to that list. And he warns us: this pattern isn’t finished playing out.</p> <p>“As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes (…). We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation”</p> <p>From an AI research perspective, the Bitter Lesson deals with clear definitions of “better.” In computer chess, it’s your win rate; in speech recognition, it’s word accuracy. But this post looks at AI <code>products</code> in the application layer (see Figure 1), where “better” means both <code>performance</code> and <code>adoption</code> in the market. We’ll cover adoption in Chapter 2. For now, let’s focus on product performance - the amount of economically valuable work a product can replace. Better performance means handling more complex problems, which unlocks more value.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/stack.png" alt="stack"></p> <p><em>Figure 1, illustration of different types of AI products. In this post, we talk about the application layer.</em></p> <p>AI <code>products</code> are typically an AI <code>model</code> wrapped in some <code>packaging software</code>. You can improve their performance in two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Through engineering effort: using domain knowledge to build constraints into the packaging software</li> <li>Through better models: waiting for AI labs to release more capable models</li> </ol> <p>You can pursue both paths, but here’s the crucial insight: as models improve, the value of engineering effort diminishes. Right now, there are huge gains to be made in building better packaging software, but only because current models make many mistakes. As models become more reliable, this will change. Eventually, you’ll just need to connect a model to a computer to solve most problems - no complex engineering required.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/perf-vs-effort.png" alt="perf-vs-effort"></p> <p><em>Figure 2, illustration of the diminishing returns of engineering effort when building AI products in the application layer. The value diminishes both as more engineering effort is made and as better models are released.</em></p> <p>The graph above shows how engineering effort becomes less valuable as models improve. Current models have significant limitations, which means companies can still gain a lot from engineering work. I saw this at YC alumni Demo Day, where companies were finding success. The landscape splits into two groups: those with products in production at scale (solving simple problems) - a small group for now - and those targeting slightly more complex problems. This second group is doing well because their proof-of-concepts suggest their goals are achievable with enough engineering effort.</p> <p>But here’s the key question these companies face: will the next model release make all that engineering work obsolete, destroying their competitive advantage? The launch of OpenAI’s o1 model illustrates this risk. I spoke with many founders in the AI application layer who were worried because they’d invested heavily in perfecting prompts to boost performance. But with o1, prompt engineering matters less. As Figure 2 shows, o1 is smarter, but this means there’s less value in the engineering work these companies did.</p> <p>At its core, this engineering effort aims to constrain AI and reduce its mistakes. From observing many solutions, I’ve identified two main types of constraints:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Specificity</code>: This represents how focused a solution is. A <code>vertical</code> solution has packaging software built for one specific problem. A <code>horizontal</code> product, in contrast, can handle many different types of problems.</li> <li> <code>Autonomy</code>: This measures how independently the AI can operate. Following Anthropic’s terminology, we have <code>workflows</code> - systems where LLMs and tools follow predefined code paths - and <code>agents</code> - systems where LLMs control their own processes and tool usage, deciding how to complete tasks.</li> </ul> <p>These two types of constraints create a framework for categorizing AI products:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th><strong>Vertical</strong></th> <th><strong>Horizontal</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Workflow</strong></td> <td>Harvey</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Agent</strong></td> <td>Devin</td> <td>Claude computer-use</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Table 1: Classification of famous AI products. Note that ChatGPT likely follows a predefined code path for each message, making it a workflow rather than an agent.</em></p> <p>Let’s explore how each category might be implemented for the same task: a business analyst creating investment pitch slides. Here’s one possible approach for each:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Vertical</code> <code>workflow</code>: A fixed sequence of steps: First, makes a RAG query on a company database, passes this to a small LLM for summarization, then to a more capable LLM that extracts key numbers and uses a calculator tool. The LLM checks if these numbers make sense before writing slide content. Finally, a slide generator creates the presentation. This exact sequence runs every time.</li> <li> <code>Vertical</code> <code>agent</code>: An LLM runs in a loop, using its output from one iteration as input for the next. It has access to the same tools as the workflow version but decides for itself when to use them. The loop continues until the agent determines the results meet its quality threshold.</li> <li> <code>Horizontal</code> <code>workflow</code>: ChatGPT and similar tools could assist with parts of the task, but can’t complete it end-to-end. They lack both the specialization and autonomy needed for the full job.</li> <li> <code>Horizontal</code> <code>agent</code>: Claude computer-use gets access to standard company software. The analyst provides instructions in natural language, and the agent operates the computer like a human would, adapting its approach as needed.</li> </ul> <p>Almost all products at Demo Day fell into the vertical workflow category. This makes sense - current models aren’t reliable enough for other approaches. As a result, even problems too complex for vertical workflows are being forced into this mold since it’s the only way to get close to acceptable performance with current model capabilities. While engineering can improve these solutions, there’s an upper limit to what it can achieve. For problems that are out of reach with current models, the better strategy would be to wait for more capable models that can handle them with minimal engineering. As Leopold Aschenbrenner argues in “Situational Awareness,” for many problems, the engineering work will take longer than the wait for better models:</p> <p>“It seems plausible that the schlep will take longer than the unhobbling, that is, by the time the drop-in remote worker is able to automate a large number of jobs, intermediate models won’t yet have been fully harnessed and integrated”</p> <p>This pattern should sound familiar. Let’s return to the Bitter Lesson. AI researchers repeatedly tried to engineer their way to “acceptable performance,” only to be overtaken by more general solutions that simply used more compute. The parallel to how today’s AI products are built is striking. And we can make this connection even clearer by examining how the Bitter Lesson applies to our two types of constraints:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Bitter Lesson Observation</th> <th>Autonomy</th> <th>Specificity</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents</td> <td>The developer experiments with an autonomous agent but finds it unreliable. Instead, they hardcode the execution steps to follow the workflow that they would go through themselves when solving the task.</td> <td>The developer starts building a general document analysis system but finds it unreliable. Instead, they constrain it to just analyze financial statements, hardcoding specific metrics and validation rules.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2) This always helps in the short term and is personally satisfying to the researcher</td> <td>The developer finds that this increases reliability.</td> <td>The developer finds that specialization improves accuracy since the model only needs to handle a narrow set of documents and metrics.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3) In the long run, it plateaus and even inhibits further progress</td> <td>The constrained workflow sometimes does not give the correct output when faced with novel situations that weren’t considered in the hardcoded steps.</td> <td>The specialized system can’t handle related tasks like analyzing merger documents or earnings calls, requiring separate specialized systems for each type of analysis.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4) Breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation</td> <td>New model releases enable reliable agents that can figure out the right approach dynamically, backtracking and correcting mistakes as needed.</td> <td>New model releases can understand any business document holistically, extracting relevant information regardless of format or type, making specialized systems unnecessary.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For problems with unclear solution paths, products with more autonomy will achieve better performance. Similarly, when dealing with large, complex input spaces, less specific products will perform better.</p> <p>This is the first in a four-part series examining the role of startups in AI. We’ve observed a historical pattern: AI models that leverage domain knowledge consistently get overtaken by those that leverage compute. Today’s AI products show striking parallels to this pattern.</p> <p>Though I’ve tried to focus on observations rather than opinions in this first part, my view likely shows through. Building software to compensate for current model limitations seems like fighting a losing battle, especially given how rapidly models are advancing. As Jarred, partner at YC, noted in the Lightcone podcast: “that first wave of LLM apps [vertical workflows] mostly did get crushed by the next wave of GPTs.”</p> <p>Sam Altman has repeatedly advocated for building startups that make you excited for releases of better models, rather than scared of them. Many of the founders in the AI application layer I speak to are excited about model releases, but for the sake of their startup, I don’t think they should be. They might be missing the insight from Figure 2; better models might actually reduce your edge, not enhance it. Of course, this is from the point of view of product performance - building something that can solve harder problems more effectively. In the next part, we’ll explore a different dimension: market adoption. After all, having better performance doesn’t guarantee winning the market.</p> <h3 id="appendix-a-statistical-view-of-the-bitter-lesson"><strong>Appendix A: Statistical View of The Bitter Lesson</strong></h3> <p>There’s another way to understand the Bitter Lesson using basic statistics. When building models, you typically face a tradeoff. You can either make a model that’s very precise in how it approaches problems (high bias) or one that’s more flexible but less predictable (high variance). The Bitter Lesson suggests choosing the flexible approach.</p> <p>Why? Because with more compute power and data, you can make flexible models more reliable. It’s like having more practice shots in basketball - eventually, you’ll become consistent even with a less rigid shooting form. The reverse isn’t true - a overly rigid approach will always be limited by its built-in assumptions.</p> <p>This maps directly to our discussion of AI products. Vertical workflows and specific constraints are like adding rigid rules - they make the AI more reliable now but limit how good it can eventually become. In contrast, letting AI operate more freely might seem risky today, but it allows the AI to find better solutions as models improve. As we’ve seen throughout this essay, betting against flexibility has historically been a losing strategy.</p> <h3 id="appendix-b-end-to-end-vs-feature-engineering"><strong>Appendix B: End-to-end vs Feature Engineering</strong></h3> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/e2e.png" alt="e2e"></p> <p><em>Figure 1: Comparison of traditional machine learning, which requires manual feature engineering, with deep learning’s end-to-end approach. The traditional approach needs humans to define what’s important in the data, while deep learning figures this out by itself.</em></p> <p>Traditional machine learning requires humans to decide what’s important in the data. You take raw input, like an image, and manually extract meaningful patterns or “features” - like counting specific shapes or measuring certain properties. Deep learning, in contrast, learns these patterns automatically.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/car-features.png" alt="car-features"></p> <p><em>Figure 2: Self-driving car visualization showing feature extraction in action. The system identifies and tracks specific objects like cars, pedestrians, and lane markings. This represents the traditional approach of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, defined pieces.</em></p> <p>Let’s use self-driving cars as an example. You could build it two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Feature engineering: Break down what the car sees into specific pieces - where are the other cars, where are the lanes, how fast is that pedestrian moving?</li> <li>End-to-end: Feed raw video directly into a neural network and let it figure out how to drive.</li> </ol> <p>The feature engineering approach feels safer and more controlled. That’s why it dominated early AI. But as George Hotz observed: “if anything about the history of AI has taught us anything, it’s that feature engineering approaches will always be replaced and loose to end-to-end.”</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/sholto.png" alt="sholto"></p> <p><em>Figure 3: Tweet from Sholto Douglas</em></p> <p>This connects directly to our discussion of AI products. Building vertical-specific tools is like feature engineering - you’re deciding what information matters ahead of time. When you constrain a model’s autonomy, you’re doing the same thing. While this might work better today, history suggests betting on end-to-end approaches will win in the long run.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href="https://x.com/lukaspet" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">X</a> to stay updated.</p> </div> </article></div>]]></description>

The intricate connections between humanity and the wild are fading from our awareness. We no longer see, hear, touch, or smell the vibrant ecosystems that once surrounded us; we have forgotten their importance in this disconnection.</p>

<p>It is as though the natural world has become invisible as if it no longer matters, and many of us even act as if we no longer need it. But the truth is, we do—desperately. Our survival depends on the intricate web of life that the natural world provides: the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and the stability of the climate that supports us.</p>

<p>In conservation terms, rewilding refers to restoring ecosystems to their natural, self-sustaining states by reintroducing native species, rebuilding habitats, and allowing natural processes to function with minimal human intervention. The goal of rewilding is to enhance biodiversity, reestablish ecological balance, and promote resilience to environmental changes, such as climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But how, then, do we begin to rewild ourselves? How do we rekindle our relationship with nature? Rewilding ourselves starts with acknowledging the loss and its profound impact on our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. It involves a conscious effort to reintroduce ourselves to the natural rhythms and processes of the Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can rewild by immersing ourselves in the wilderness, even in small ways—walking barefoot on the grass, planting native species in our backyards, or simply pausing to observe the life teeming around us. It means learning to see the world with fresh eyes, listening to the wind in the trees, touching the bark of ancient woods, and inhaling the aroma of the earth after rain.</p>

<p>For decades, I have conceptualized my work with cultural heritage aromatic plants and the shared experience of a planetary scent as a form of rewilding the mind. By engaging with the deep ecological and cultural narratives embedded in these plants, I reconnected individuals with their sensory heritage and the natural world. This process has not only renewed appreciation for biodiversity but also provided a profound sense of interconnectedness, encouraging us to think beyond the constraints of modernity and rediscover more primal and imperative aspects of our collective human experience.</p>

<p>In doing this, I have found that a growing number of individuals, mostly under the age of 30, are unable to recognize the natural scents of plants, instead associating them with synthetic versions found in commercial products. This disconnection from the natural world highlights the increasing influence of urbanization, digital lifestyles, and a reliance on mass-produced goods. As traditional ecological knowledge fades, there is a pressing need to reintroduce younger generations to the authentic sensory experiences of nature, fostering and rewilding a deeper understanding of biodiversity and environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Rewilding oneself can take many forms, fostering a deeper connection with nature, enhancing ecological awareness, and cultivating a sense of belonging to the natural world. Rewilding is not just about reconnecting with the wild outdoors but also about reviving our innate relationship with the ecosystems that sustain us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In urban environments like New York City, a growing number of individuals are embracing rewilding by becoming beekeepers, birders, and urban gardeners. These activities allow them to engage directly with local biodiversity, whether by cultivating pollinator-friendly plants on rooftops or balconies, creating sanctuaries for native bird species, or tending to community gardens that restore green spaces.</p>

<p>Rewilding can also take a more creative or personal form, such as expressing a profound appreciation for the local ecosystem through art, writing, or storytelling. These expressions not only honor the interconnectedness of nature but also inspire others to recognize its beauty and fragility.</p>

<p>Even small actions, like observing and creating safe passages for wildlife—such as ensuring wild creatures can cross your yard without harm from your pet—or advocating for the establishment of green corridors between neighborhoods, can significantly contribute to the conservation of local wildlife by supporting their movement, habitat connectivity, and survival.</p>

<p>Ultimately, rewilding is about rekindling our sense of wonder and responsibility toward the natural world. It invites us to reimagine our role as stewards of the earth, no matter where we live. Whether through hands-on activities, creative expression, or quiet observation, rewilding offers a pathway to a more harmonious relationship with the environment.</p>

<p>Rewilding ourselves also calls for action. It asks us to protect and restore wild spaces, advocate for sustainable practices, and support policies that preserve biodiversity. It challenges us to reimagine our cities and lifestyles in harmony with nature, integrating green spaces and fostering coexistence with the wild.&nbsp; This helps incorporate individuals into the larger ecological and social fabric, reinforcing a rewilded sense of belonging.</p>

<p>Rewilding ourselves is not just an individual journey but a collective imperative. Together, we can rebuild our bond with the natural world and ensure its survival—and ours. The question is not if we should rewild but how we can begin today.</p>

<p> <strike>Any and all proceeds will fund graduate students
whose work may impact the discovery, diagnosis or treatment of 
genetic disorders.</strike> </p>

<p>
Any and all proceeds will fund graduate students (and postdocs)
doing work in biology that may 
impact treatment of diseases of cellular metabolism.

<p>
<b>Update</b>: If you're interested in <a href="http://www.glycobiology.org/news_display.php?id=1546">being that postdoc</a>, get in touch with me!

<p> It is available at 
<a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/Issue/105539">$6.50</a>
thanks to
Hewlett-Packard's high-quality on-demand publishing service, MagCloud.
</p>

<p> It's sixteen pages, saddle-stitch bound and in full color.</p>

<p>
It's a good gift for new students, the recently defended and relatives thereof.

<p> <b>Why biology?</b>  </p>

<p>If you zoom in on the boundary of human knowledge in the direction of genetics, there's
something just outside humanity's reach:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/images/BertrandsLife.png" width="440">
</p>


<p> My wife and I chose to start funding these graduate students after we learned
that <a href="http://overcomingmovementdisorder.blogspot.com//">our
son</a> has a rare, fatal genetic disorder.  </p>



<p>
It may be too late for my son, but it's not too late for other children.
</p>

<p>
Even one child suffering is one child too many.
</p>

<p>
The only way to end this kind of suffering is science.
</p>

<p>
And, the best way to do science is through graduate students.
</p>


<p>
<em><b>Update</b>: When I first wrote this post, my son's specific disorder was unknown.
Thanks to a scientific advance made in genetic diagnostics--specifically exome sequencing--we were able to isolate the mutations in my son's genome and determine that he is the very first documented case of a new disease: N-glycanase deficiency.

<p>

One small dent in the circle of knowledge; one giant leap for my son.

            <h2 id="goodbye-clojure">Goodbye, Clojure</h2>
<p>After ~7 years, I was <em>done</em> with <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I was writing a some
<a href="https://github.com/djha-skin/degasolv">CLI</a>
<a href="https://github.com/djha-skin/zic">apps</a>, and I <em>hated</em> how long they took to
start up. The community at large seemed not to care about this problem, except
for the <a href="https://github.com/babashka/babashka">babashka</a> folks. However, I spent
long, hard hours banging my head against
<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/">native-image</a>
and it just wasn't working out. It was incredibly painful, and at the end of it,
I still didn't have standalone, fast-starting native executables. I decided that
that was a requirement for my main driving hobby language, and that Clojure didn't
have it. It was then that I decided to move on from Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-hunt-for-a-new-lisp">On the Hunt for a New Lisp</h2>
<p>I started shopping around for a new lisp to use after hours like I'd done before
with my home projects. I had specific requirements in mind, though I didn't
actually list them when I started. I can list them now in hindsight, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be easy to create standalone, fast-starting executables using a
   reasonable toolchain (to address my main concern with Clojure)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/emacs-users-im-okay-i-promise/">I can't use
   Emacs</a>, so
   it's got to be usable in Vim.</li>
<li>It must have good support for Windows and Mac, in addition just Linux/POSIX
   operating systems.</li>
<li>It would be nice if it allows plugging into some other, large-community
   imperative language, like Clojure does with Java.</li>
<li>It must have a reasonably fast runtime -- hopefully as good or better as
   Clojure's.</li>
<li>The language must have a strong multithreading story. It would be grand if
   whatever language it was didn't have a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">GIL</a>, for example.</li>
<li>Must have a strong community.</li>
<li>Must have a good ecosystem, with at least the following libraries
   well-implemented, thus supporting my common use cases of making CLI tools:<ol>
<li>JSON parsing and serialization</li>
<li>Sqlite3 support</li>
<li>HTTP requests library </li>
<li>Would be nice if it had functional data structures like Clojure's (this
   ended up being less of an issue later)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I looked at <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a>, but that community seemed to
still be fractured over the
<a href="https://elmord.org/blog/?entry=20171001-r6rs-r7rs">r6rs</a>/<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/scheme-reports-wg2/c/xGd0_eeKmGI/m/q-xM5fbuAQAJ?pli=1">r7rs</a>
mess. Also, there wasn't <a href="https://akkuscm.org/packages/">a big enough ecosystem</a>
to suit my liking.</p>
<p>I'd already tried <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> in school and didn't like it. The runtime was a bit
slow and bloated for my tastes.</p>
<p>I had seen <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">lisp-lang.org</a> shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28725958">the Orange
Site</a>. I was impressed with the
site. I came back to it later after I first saw it and thought, why not. Maybe
I'll give Common Lisp a shot.</p>
<h2 id="magic-happens-here">Magic Happens Here</h2>
<p>I will spare the reader the full narrative of my learning CL.
It was a rough ride learning the language. (I went about it the wrong way,
getting

for Christmas and reading through that. I eventually found the
<a href="https://clhs.lisp.se/">HyperSpec</a> and started reading that as well.)</p>
<p>There were some weird things I didn't expect to find about CL. It's a
<em>standardized</em> language, more like C than Java that way. There are many
compilers, interpreters, and runtimes that implement that standard. There's even
<a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">a tool to help install them all and wrangle
them</a>. The most popular one <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/common-lisp-community-survey-2024-results/">according to
the
community</a>
is <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a>.</p>
<p>If I had heard about <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> when starting this hunt,
I might have stopped there and not gone on to CL. Nice syntax, small, fast
executables, <a href="https://janet-lang.org/docs/ffi.html">C FFI</a>, <a href="https://janet.guide/">a fun intro
book</a>. It checks all my boxes.</p>
<p>However, I'm glad I did learn CL first, because I think I'd miss the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a> and the
Conditions System, things I learned about later in my journey. Common Lisp is
just a bit of a stronger language.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-met">Requirements Met</h2>
<p>I found answers to all my questions, and decided my next lisp was going to be
Common Lisp. I've been coding in it ever since. Here are the things I found:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standalone Executables</strong>: there are lots of ways to do this in Common Lisp. I
   summarize my favorite way in <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/release-common-lisp-on-your-first-day/">another blog
   post</a>.
   Start up times range from a fraction of a second to nearly instant, depending
   on if you compile the executable with compression or not. This is not a
   bolt-on feature; it's a first-class-citizen way to distribute Lisp programs.</li>
<li><strong>Vim Workflow</strong>: There are a lot of good ones here, but I eventually settled
   into <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/developing-common-lisp-using-vim-with-tmux-or-conemu/">a Vim workflow of my
   own</a>.
   Readers may also be interested to know that <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/experience-report-using-vs-code-alive-to-write-common-lisp/">I found VS Code perfectly
   usable</a>
   as a Common Lisp IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Windows/Mac/Linux Support</strong>: SBCL, a popular implementation and compiler for
   Common Lisp, supports The Big Three relatively well, as outlined in the
   blog post linked in point #1.</li>
<li><strong>Larger Imperative Ecosystem</strong>: Most implementations actually hook into the C
   programming language pretty well through the
   <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi">CFFI</a>. That works for me.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Speed</strong>: SBCL is <a href="https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison">crazy
   fast</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Multithreading</strong>: While the Common Lisp standard does not make provisions
   for multithreading, all major implementations do support it and their
   differences are papered over with a library called
   <a href="https://sionescu.github.io/bordeaux-threads/">Bordeaux-Threads</a>. This
   library serves as an underpinning for the
   <a href="https://github.com/lmj/lparallel">lparallel</a> library, an excellent library
   for multithreading. There's also <a href="https://orthecreedence.github.io/cl-async/">cl-async</a> and <a href="https://orthecreedence.github.io/blackbird/">blackbird</a> for
   asynchronous programming and promises, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Community</strong>: I discovered the community as I did the rest of the
   language -- in fits and starts. A good summary of the community (as it was in
   2024) is summarized in the <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/common-lisp-community-survey-2024-results/">Common Lisp Community Survey
         2024</a>.
         CL features prominently at the <a href="https://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/">European Lisp
         Symposium</a>. CL has a strong
         <a href="https://planet.lisp.org/">blogosphere</a> and
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/">subreddit</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem</strong>: The ecosystem is pretty great. Most folks use
   <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, though I use
   <a href="https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl/releases">OCICL</a> for package management. The
   <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/">Common Lisp Cookbook</a>, the
   <a href="https://www.cliki.net/">CLiki</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl">Awesome
   CL</a> provide
   nice survey of available libraries and techniques. Here
   are some answers to those particular libary queries I had:<ol>
<li><strong>JSON</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe/jzon">jzon</a></li>
<li><strong>Sqlite3</strong>: <a href="https://cl-sqlite.common-lisp.dev/">cl-sqlite</a></li>
<li><strong>HTTP requests</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/dexador">dexador</a></li>
<li><strong>Functional Datastructures</strong>: <a href="https://fset.common-lisp.dev/">FSet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danshapero/cl-hamt">cl-hamt</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="new-friends-take-note">New Friends Take Note</h2>
<p>I wrote this blog post because I noticed that there have been more newcomers on
the <a href="https://discord.gg/HsxkkvQ">Common Lisp Discord</a> and they've been asking the same questions I was
when I was first looking at the language. I wanted to lay down a bit of history
around why I came to Common Lisp, and how I acclimated to the language. I hope
it may be helpful to those new to or curious about Common Lisp.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For the last ten years I’ve worked for American tech companies as an Australian based in Australia. First I worked in a satellite office for Zendesk. My direct manager was Australian, but many other managers and teams (and of course the top executives) were America-based. Now at GitHub I work fully-remote on a mixed team for an American manager based in America.</p>
<h3>Timezones</h3>
<p>The biggest difference in working for an American company is the timezones. I have three or four hours overlap with folks working on the west coast, and maybe one hour overlap with the east coast. Fortunately my American managers have been based on the west coast. I think it’d be hard to manage otherwise. At Zendesk, timezone overlap only mattered when working with American teams, but at GitHub half my team (including my manager) is in America.</p>
<p>When I sit down to work in the morning, the first thing I do is to catch up to half a day of work that’s happened while I was asleep. That means spending around thirty minutes reading emails, notifications, and so on. Slack “remind me later” is a lifesaver - I don’t reply to anything right away unless it’s critical, but I do tag messages that need a reply so they ping me in half an hour once I’m done catching up. The morning is usually quite busy, because I have to fit in any calls or synchronous chats in that time. If I don’t have calls, I try to work as quickly as possible so I can resolve any blockers before everyone else signs off for the day.</p>
<p>Afternoons are almost always clear. This is one of the biggest benefits to working cross-timezones: I have a few hours of deep work available every day where I can be confident my manager isn’t going to pull everyone in for a meeting. It can also be pretty lonely. For the first nine months at GitHub I was the only APAC-timezone based engineer, so every afternoon was just me<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I give a lot of credit to GitHub for having excellent “writing things down” culture. At a lot of companies it would be really hard to keep up with what was going on when you’re not in the right timezone. But I rarely felt like decisions were being made in meetings I couldn’t attend.</p>
<p>One other big benefit to being in a different timezone is the ability to hand off work so that it never really stops. Because of the hand-off cost, we only do this for some types of work (e.g. important bugs or really critical features), but when we do it feels like a superpower. The team can literally move 2x as fast. It’s also great for customers when they report an issue and it’s fixed by the next morning - an all-American team would have to work late to get that done, but for a split-timezone team it’s just par for the course.</p>
<h3>Instability</h3>
<p>Working for an American company as a non-American feels more unstable. There’s always the possibility that the American company might decide to terminate the Australian experiment and shutter the entire team. I’ve seen this happen multiple times to other satellite offices or teams outside of the USA. You can try to be as valuable as possible, but ultimately there’s nothing you can do if the C-staff suddenly decide that working across timezones isn’t worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Australia does have a healthy tech sector, but it’s nothing compared to America’s. If I lived in San Francisco, I’d have ~100x more available jobs to apply to if I lost my current one. </p>
<p>For this reason, I operate a little less idealistically and a little more tactically than I would in an Australian-based company. American engineers seem happier to be disagreeable or to push back hard against company strategy. I put a lot of thought into <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship">how to align</a> with company strategy (and when I push back, how to make sure that’s in service of the company’s current goals.)</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Australians and Americans are culturally similar, but not identical<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Australians typically play down their achievements, while Americans like to talk themselves up. Americans naturally read to Australians as boastful, while Australians naturally read to Americans as meek (or not very competent). American office culture is more enthusiastic and tonally positive than Australian office culture. Americans tend to be enthusiastic about their company mission - in the extreme, believing that they’re saving the world - while Australians are more liable to think “it’s just a job, mate”.</p>
<p>In my experience, there’s not much meeting-in-the-middle here: if you work for an American company, you’ve got to talk like an American. It’s an adjustment. I can’t speak for how it’d be to make this adjustment if you were from a less similar culture, but I bet it’d be tough.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Why do it? Why wouldn’t I work for Australian tech companies? In general, American companies tend to operate at a bigger scale, offer better comp (Australian companies don’t typically offer RSUs) and have better brand recognition. So when I’m looking to work at scale at a company I’ve heard of, American companies are more competitive.</p>
<p>I’ve also grown to love the rhythm of busy mornings and deep-work afternoons. And of course working fully remote is great. I think it’s a pretty good deal for the company too - follow-the-sun work and on-call is a big benefit - so I hope I get to keep doing it.</p>
