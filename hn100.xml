            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/news/eshyft-report-breach/">https://www.websiteplanet.com/news/eshyft-report-breach/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43349115">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="new-post-content"><p><em><span>Cybersecurity Researcher, Jeremiah Fowler, discovered and reported to </span><a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/"><span>Website Planet</span></a><span> about a non-password-protected database that contained over 86,000 records belonging to</span> <b>ESHYFT</b><span> — a New-Jersey-based HealthTech company that operates in 29 states. It offers a mobile app platform that connects healthcare facilities with healthcare workers, including Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), and Registered Nurses (RNs).</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements-optimage1.png"><span><span><img data-src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements-optimage1.png" width="780" height="582" alt="WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements" src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements-optimage1.png"></span></span></a></p><p>
The publicly exposed database was not password-protected or encrypted. It contained 86,341 records totaling 108.8 GB in size. The majority of the documents were contained inside of a folder labeled “App”. In a limited sampling of the exposed documents, I saw records that included profile or facial images of users, .csv files with monthly work schedule logs, professional certificates, work assignment agreements, CVs and resumes that contained additional PII. One single spreadsheet document contained 800,000+ entries that detailed the nurse’s internal IDs, facility name, time and date of shifts, hours worked, and more.</p><p>
I also saw what appeared to be medical documents uploaded to the app. These files were potentially uploaded as proof for why individual nurses missed shifts or took sick leave. These medical documents included medical reports containing information of diagnosis, prescriptions, or treatments that could potentially fall under the ambit of HIPAA regulations.</p><p>
The name of the database as well as the documents inside it indicated that the records belonged to ESHYFT. I immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to the company, and the database was restricted from public access over a month later. I received a response thanking me for the notification stating: “Thank you! we’re actively looking into this and working on a solution”. It is not known if the database was owned and managed by ESHYFT directly or via a third-party contractor. It is also not known how long the database was exposed before I discovered it or if anyone else gained access to it. Only an internal forensic audit could identify additional access or potentially suspicious activity.</p><p>
ESHYFT provides a mobile platform that connects healthcare facilities with qualified nursing professionals. It is available on both Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Apple no longer provides user statistics, but the ESHYFT app has been downloaded more than 50,000 times from the Google Play Store.</p><p>
The application claims to offer nurses the flexibility to select shifts that fit their schedules while providing healthcare facilities with access to vetted W-2 nursing staff to meet their needs. The platform is available in following U.S. states: AL, AZ, AR, CA, CT, DE, FL, GA, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MD, MI, MN, MO, NE, NJ, OH, PA, RI, SC, TN, VT, VA, WA, WI, and WV.</p>

A <a href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/data-research/projecting-health-workforce-supply-demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (NCHWA) projects a 10% nationwide shortage of registered nurses by 2027. With the growing need for healthcare workers, platforms like ESHYFT serve an important role in filling those staffing deficiencies. This means that workers who perform offline jobs (like nursing) are now integrated with online technology, and <strong>healthtech companies need to implement robust privacy safeguards to bridge the gap securely.</strong></p><p>
As more hospitals and healthcare workers depend on technology for data storage, care management, and employment, the need for increased cybersecurity measures across the entire industry is inescapable. Hospitals are considered critical infrastructure and have been routinely targeted by cybercriminals. In recent years, numerous networks have been hit with devastating ransomware attacks. In my opinion, the data and PII of the doctors, nurses, and staff are equally as important as the healthcare facilities themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Any exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), salary details, and work history of nursing professionals could result in significant potential risks and vulnerabilities</strong> — both for the affected individuals and the healthcare facilities that employ them. Scans of identification documents (such as driver’s licenses or Social Security cards) when combined with addresses and other contact details could hypothetically provide a gateway for cybercriminals to commit identity theft or financial fraud in the victims’ names.</p>
<p><strong>Another potential risk of exposed personal and professional details would be highly targeted phishing campaigns</strong> that could use real information to deceive victims with employment scams or drive them into revealing additional personal or financial data. I am not suggesting or implying that ESHYFT’s data or that of their users is at risk of any type of scam or fraudulent activity, or compromised in any manner. I am only providing a general observation of potential cybersecurity risks as it relates to the exposure of personally identifiable information. This commentary is intended solely to highlight the broader landscape of privacy and cybersecurity considerations.</p><p>
My recommendations for healthtech companies and medical software providers would be to take proactive cybersecurity measures to protect their data and prevent unauthorized access. This would include mandatory encryption protocols of sensitive data and regular security audits of internal infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities. <strong>It is always a good idea to limit the storage of sensitive data and anonymize records where possible.</strong> This includes assigning data an expiration date once it is no longer in use.</p><p>
In this particular case, it appears that user files were uploaded to a single folder and not segregated based on their sensitivity. As an example, a user’s profile image could have a low sensitivity rating while proof of a medical exam could have a high sensitivity rating. In theory, these two documents should not be stored in the same folder. <strong>When sensitive data is segregated and encrypted, it adds an additional layer of protection</strong> in the event of an accidental exposure or malicious attack.</p><p>
Moreover, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be a requirement for any application where the user has access to potentially sensitive information or documents. By requiring MFA, even if user credentials (like username and password) are exposed, it is more difficult for someone to simply login and gain full access to the application or user dashboard.</p><p>
Lastly, for healthtech companies of any size, <strong>it is a good idea to have a data breach response plan in place and a dedicated communication channel for reporting potential security incidents.</strong> Far too often I observe that companies have only customer support or sales contacts listed, forgoing the contact information of key stakeholders who need to act in case of a data breach. When sensitive data is publicly exposed, every second counts, and any delay in mitigation and recovery could be potentially catastrophic.</p><p>
It is also important to give timely responsible disclosure notices to anybody who could be directly affected by the breach. After any data incident, users should be notified and educated on how to recognize phishing attempts in relation to the specific application or service that was potentially compromised. Protecting users from the real risks of social engineering and phishing attempts makes common sense and benefits both the service provider and the user or customer.</p><p>
I imply no wrongdoing by Shiftster LLC dba ESHYFT, any contractors or affiliates. I do not claim that internal data or user data was ever at imminent risk. The hypothetical data-risk scenarios I have presented in this report are exclusively for educational purposes and do not reflect any actual compromise of data integrity. It should not be construed as a reflection of any organization’s specific practices, systems, or security measures.</p><p>
As an ethical security researcher, I do not download the data I discover. I only take a limited number of screenshots solely for verification purposes. I do not conduct any activities beyond identifying the security vulnerability and notifying the relevant parties. I disclaim any responsibility for any and all actions that may be taken as a result of this disclosure. I publish my findings to raise awareness on issues of data security and privacy. My aim is to encourage organizations to proactively safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access.</p>

  <div><p>EFF is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mark Klein, a bona fide hero who risked civil liability and criminal prosecution to help expose a massive spying program that violated the rights of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Mark didn’t set out to change the world. For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&amp;T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.</p>
<p><span>Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it.</span></p>
<p>When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&amp;T’s central office in San Francisco, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A">Room 641A</a>. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/07/24/backbone-3c-color.jpg">made a copy</a> of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/12/secretroom1_f.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="Photo of NSA-controlled &quot;secret room&quot; " title="Photo of NSA-controlled &quot;secret room&quot; "></p></div>
<p>Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&amp;T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pylu8ycLfC4">Chris Dodd</a>, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.</p>
<p>We used Mark’s evidence to bring two lawsuits against the <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying">NSA spying</a> that he uncovered. The first was <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hepting">Hepting v. AT&amp;T</a> and the second was <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel">Jewel v. NSA</a>. Mark also came with us to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/us/07nsa.html">Washington D.C</a>. to push for an end to the spying and demand accountability for it happening in secret for so many years.&nbsp; He wrote an account of his experience called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6625940-wiring-up-the-big-brother-machine-and-fighting-it"><em>Wiring Up the Big Brother Machine . . . And Fighting It</em>.</a></p>

<p>Mark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&amp;T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.</p>
<p>And the fight is not over. The law, <a href="https://www.eff.org/702-spying">called Section 702</a>, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.</p>
<p>Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In March 2025 I received an email asking about PuTTY’s “logo” –
      the icon used by the Windows executable. The sender wanted to
      know where it had come from, and how it had evolved over
      time.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I receive an email asking a question, and by the time
      I’ve finished answering it, I realise it’s worth turning into a
      blog post. This time I knew it was going to be one of those
      before I even started typing, because there’s a graphic design
      angle to the question <em>and</em> a technical angle. So I had a
      lot to say.</p>
    <p>PuTTY’s icon designs date from the late 1990s and early 2000s.
      They’ve never had a major <em>stylistic</em> redesign, but over
      the years, the icons have had to be re-rendered under various
      constraints, which made for a technical challenge as well.</p>
    <h2 id="drawing">Hand-drawn era</h2>
    <p>When I first started drawing PuTTY icons, I didn’t know I was
      going to need lots of them at different sizes. So I didn’t start
      off with any automation – I just drew each one by hand in the
      MSVC icon editor.</p>
    <h3 id="original">PuTTY itself</h3>
    <p>Expanded to a visible size, here’s the earliest version of the
      original PuTTY icon that I still have still in my source
      control. That means it was current in early 1999; my source
      control doesn’t go all the way back to the very project start in
      the summer of 1996, but if it did, I expect this
      was <em>probably</em> the same icon I originally drew. I’d have
      drawn one quite early, because Windows GUI programs look pretty
      unhelpful without an icon.</p>
    <figure>

        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original PuTTY icon, in colour and in
        monochrome</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It’s 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 pixels, and uses a limited palette of primary
      colours and shades of grey. That’s because I started the project
      in the mid-1990s, when non-truecolour displays were very common.
      There was a fixed 16-colour palette recommended for use in
      icons, consisting of the obvious primary and secondary colours
      and dim versions of them, plus a couple of spare shades of grey.
      That way all the icons in the entire GUI could reuse the same 16
      palette entries and not run the display out of colours. So this
      icon is drawn using that palette.</p>
    <p>Providing a plain black-and-white version was another standard
      recommendation at the time. But I can’t remember why – I
      certainly never actually <em>saw</em> a computer running Win95
      or later with a B&amp;W display! My best guess is that the
      recommendation was intended for use with the “Win32s” extension
      that would let 32-bit programs at least <em>try</em> to run on
      Windows 3.1 (on suitable underlying hardware). Probably Windows
      3 still supported black and white displays.</p>
    <p>I don’t think I thought about the design very much. I just
      dashed it off because I needed <em>some</em> kind of an icon.
      The two computers are drawn in a style that was common in the
      ’90s: a system box sitting under a CRT monitor, with a floppy
      disk drive visible at the right-hand end. They’re connected with
      a lightning bolt to suggest electrical communication between
      them. I didn’t <em>believe</em> I was being very original: I had
      the vague idea that several icons of this kind already existed
      (although I’ve never been able to find any specific example of
      what I was thinking of), so in my head, it fit with the general
      iconography of the day, and seemed as if it would be immediately
      understandable.</p>
    <p>I can’t remember why the lightning bolt was <em>yellow</em>.
      With hindsight that seems the strangest thing about it; cyan
      would have been a more obvious choice for electricity. Possibly
      it was just to contrast more with the blue screens of the
      computers.</p>
    <p>Speaking of which … I can’t remember why the screens were blue,
      either. I <em>think</em> I just intended it as a neutral-ish
      sort of colour which wasn’t black, so that it was clear that the
      screens were turned on. I’m pretty sure the blue <em>wasn’t</em>
      an allusion to the Windows Blue Screen of Death – that wouldn’t
      make sense, because in a typical use of PuTTY, only <em>one</em>
      end of the connection is running Windows, and neither end has
      crashed!</p>
    <p>Looking back, I suppose I might also have considered making the
      two computers look different from each other, on the theory that
      the client machine might be sitting on someone’s desk, and the
      server might be in a rack in a datacentre? But I was a student
      when I started writing PuTTY, and <em>my</em> Linux server you
      could remotely log into was on my desk and not in a rack. So I
      think that just never even occurred to me.</p>
    <h3 id="pscp">PSCP (and PSFTP): file transfer</h3>
    <p>In 1999, a contributor sent an SCP implementation, and PSCP was
      born. I decided to draw it an icon of its own.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t especially important for PSCP to have an icon at all.
      You don’t run it <em>from</em> a GUI (it’s useless without
      command-line arguments), so it doesn’t need an icon for you to
      find it in Explorer or identify it in the Start Menu. And it
      doesn’t put up GUI windows, so it wouldn’t need an icon to
      identify those in the taskbar either. But I drew an icon anyway.
      I can’t remember why. Maybe it was just for completeness, or I
      felt like doing a bit of drawing, or something.</p>
    <p>I made the PSCP icon by modifying the existing PuTTY icon,
      replacing one of the two computers with a piece of paper with
      variable-length lines on it, suggesting a written document:</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/pscp-original.png" alt="[pscp-original.png]">

        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original PSCP icon, in colour and in
        monochrome</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I kept the lightning bolt connecting the remaining computer to
      that document, the theory being that you use PSCP to remotely
      access documents. (In some fairly vague sense.)</p>
    <p>Later on, we gained a second file transfer tool, PSFTP, and I
      reused the same icon for that, on the basis that they’re both
      file transfer tools and the icon doesn’t really say anything
      specific to one of them. PSFTP is still a command-line
      application, but unlike PSCP, it’s possible to run
      it <em>from</em> the GUI (by clicking on it in Explorer or the
      Start Menu), because it has an interactive prompt, so if you
      don’t run it with any command-line arguments, you can tell it at
      the prompt where to connect to. So PSFTP put the same icon to a
      more practical use than PSCP did.</p>
    <p>(On the other hand, giving two tools the same icon means you
      have to check carefully which one you’re dragging around in
      Explorer! Perhaps it would have been better to make the PSCP and
      PSFTP icons different in some way. But I couldn’t easily think
      of a visual depiction of the ways the two tools differ.)</p>
    <h3 id="pageant">Pageant: SSH agent</h3>
    <p>Pageant, our SSH agent, was the next tool in the suite that
      needed an icon.</p>
    <p>My original idea for an icon depicting an SSH agent was to draw
      the face of a <em>secret</em> agent – in the stereotypical
      outfit from the sillier end of spy fiction, with a wide-brimmed
      hat and a turned-up collar.</p>
    <p>But I’m terrible at drawing faces. After a few failed attempts,
      I realised that Pageant would never get released <em>at all</em>
      if I waited until I’d drawn the icon I wanted. So instead I took
      the secret agent’s hat – the only part which I <em>had</em>
      drawn to my satisfaction – and simply sat it on top of a larger
      version of the computer from the original PuTTY icon, at a
      rakish angle.</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/pageant-original.png" alt="[pageant-original.png]">
        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original Pageant icon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I’d intended that as a placeholder, planning to come back and
      have another try later at drawing my original idea of a human
      secret agent. But then I realised the icon I’d already drawn was
      simply <em>better!</em> It fits visually with the rest of the
      suite by reusing the same computer design; it’s more appropriate
      because the ‘agent’ in question <em>is</em> computerised rather
      than human. And most importantly of all, a computer wearing a
      hat turned out to be cute. So I kept it.</p>
    <p>On the technical side: Pageant’s original icon <em>didn’t</em>
      come with a black and white version. I don’t remember why not;
      perhaps, with Windows 3 a few more years in the past, it just
      didn’t seem important enough any more. But on the other hand,
      Pageant introduced a new requirement: I had to draw
      a <em>small</em> version of the icon. Up to this point I’d just
      drawn everything at the (then) standard icon size of 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32;
      but Pageant puts an icon in the System Tray on the taskbar, so
      it needed a smaller 16&nbsp;×&nbsp;16 icon to fit there. If you just let
      Windows scale down the 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 version, it didn’t do such a good
      job of it.</p>
    <figure>

        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>Half-size version of the original Pageant icon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Drawing a small version of the same computer logo was a
      challenge, especially while still using that 16-colour fixed
      palette. You can see that I’ve done some tricks with the darker
      palette entries, ‘hand-antialiasing’ the hatband, and replacing
      the internal black outline at the bottom of the computer monitor
      with a dark grey one to try to make it less prominent – as if
      the original 1-pixel black outline had been scaled down to half
      a pixel.</p>
    <p>(But the <em>external</em> outline is still solid black, so
      that it separates the entire icon clearly from whatever
      background colour it’s shown on. The taskbar is grey, and so is
      most of the icon, so that’s still important!)</p>
    <h3 id="puttygen">PuTTYgen: key generator</h3>
    <p>After that came PuTTYgen. I drew another “computer + lightning
      bolt + object” icon, this time with the other object being a key
      – a weak visual pun, since PuTTYgen generates and works with
      cryptographic keys.</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/puttygen-original.png" alt="[puttygen-original.png]">
        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original PuTTYgen icon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The lightning bolt indicating network communication was
      particularly inappropriate in this tool. It was already fairly
      tenuous in PSCP, but PuTTYgen doesn’t do any network
      communication <em>at all</em>, so the lightning bolt was
      completely inaccurate. I really put it in there for visual
      consistency with the rest of the icons: it’s there to signal
      “this is a tool from the same suite as PuTTY”.</p>
    <p>(I’m still not <em>very</em> happy with the drawing of the
      key.)</p>
    <p>This icon is the other way up from the PSCP one: here, I’ve
      kept the computer in the lower left corner from the main PuTTY
      icon, and replaced the top right one with a different weird
      object, whereas in PSCP, I kept the top right computer and
      replaced the <em>other</em> one with an object. I don’t remember
      having any particular reason for that – perhaps I just didn’t
      even bother to check which way round I’d drawn the previous
      icon! But I’m not too unhappy with it, because it makes the two
      icons more different from each other, so easier to tell
      apart.</p>
    <h3 id="config">Configuration dialog box</h3>
    <p>The next icon we needed wasn’t for a separate tool at all: it
      was for PuTTY’s configuration dialog box.</p>
    <p>The taskbar entry for the config box had the boring “default”
      icon, just representing a generic window frame, that Windows
      uses for any window that doesn’t supply a better one. I’d
      decided that looked ugly.</p>
    <p>Rather than just reuse the main PuTTY icon unmodified, I drew
      an icon to specifically represent configuration or modification,

      <figcaption>The PuTTY configuration dialog icon, in colour and in
        monochrome</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For this icon I went back to including a monochrome version. I
      can’t remember why. Perhaps it was just that I was modifying an
      existing icon which <em>did</em> have a monochrome version!</p>
    <h2 id="script">Scripted era</h2>
    <p>Nothing else happened in this area until 2007.</p>
    <p>That was about when people started to complain that the 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32
      pixel icons had started to look nasty. Displays had become
      bigger, and Windows was defaulting to displaying 48&nbsp;×&nbsp;48 icons
      instead of 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32. So if your application only had a 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 icon,
      Windows would stretch it.</p>
    <p>It wouldn’t have looked great if a 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 icon had been
      magnified by an exact factor of 2 to 64&nbsp;×&nbsp;64, copying each input
      pixel the same number of times. But 48 isn’t even a multiple of
      32, so instead Windows had to stretch my
      icons <em>unevenly</em>, which looked even worse.</p>
    <p>Rather than hand-draw another full set of icons, I decided to
      get more ambitious. So I wrote a piece of code that drew all the
      components of each icon image in a programmatic way, so that I
      could run the script to auto-generate a full set of icons for
      every tool. That eliminated the inconsistency about which icons
      had tiny versions, and which ones had black and white versions:
      now <em>all</em> the icons had <em>all</em> versions.</p>
    <p>The hard part of that was the tiny 16&nbsp;×&nbsp;16 icons. I’d only
      drawn one of those so far, for Pageant. Now I had to try to
      capture the artistic judgment I’d used for the
      “hand-antialiasing” in that icon, and try to make a piece of
      software do the same thing for <em>all</em> the graphical
      components of the icon suite.</p>
    <p>I remember that being pretty hard work, but in the end I
      managed to make something I was happy with. After
      that, <em>every</em> icon had 48&nbsp;×&nbsp;48, 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 and 16&nbsp;×&nbsp;16
      icons.</p>

    <p>I stopped short of trying to make the program
      recreate <em>every</em> decision I’d made in the original
      drawing. I made quite a few of those decisions in a hurry
      without much thought, after all. So I just got the script to a
      point I was happy <em>enough</em> with. And I took the
      opportunity to improve on a few things: for
      example, <em>all</em> versions of the Pageant hatband are now
      antialiased, not just the tiny version.</p>
    <p>But there are other ways that the scripted icons
      don’t <em>exactly</em> match the original hand-drawn versions.
      The radio buttons below should let you flip back and forth
      between two example icons in the original and script-generated
      versions:</p>

      <figcaption>Use the radio buttons to switch between the original
        PuTTY and Pageant icons and the 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 output from the
        script</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The actual PuTTY icon is a pretty close match – only a small
      number of pixels changed. But the Pageant icon is quite
      different: apart from the deliberate change of the antialiased
      hatband, the computer in the icon isn’t even the
      same <em>size!</em> I can’t remember if that was a pure accident
      (maybe I didn’t flip back and forth between the two versions of
      that icon while I was writing the script), or a deliberate style
      change.</p>
    <p>(Of course, if I’d <em>wanted</em> to change the size of the
      computer, it would have been easier to do it using the script
      than redrawing by hand. So it would have made sense for it to be
      a deliberate change, now that the opportunity was available. But
      I don’t remember that it <em>was</em> deliberate.)</p>
    <p>As I said earlier, I made sure the script could generate a full
      set of black-and-white icons too, just in case. In 2007 I think
      it was even less likely that anyone would still be running
      Windows (or anything else) on a B&amp;W display, but one of the
      nice things about having this stuff done by a script is that you
      can get it to do a lot of hard work for you just in case. So now
      I have a full set of black and white icons too, even at the new
      size of 48 pixels:</p>

    <h3 id="pterm">pterm</h3>
    <p>In 2002 I had ported a lot of the PuTTY code to Linux. I wrote
      a Linux version of the full GUI PuTTY application, and also
      reused part of the code as an X11 terminal
      emulator <code>pterm</code> which you could use in place of
      existing ones like <code>xterm</code>.</p>
    <p>Linux GUI applications can also have icons if they want to: an
      X11 program can set a property on its window, containing a
      bitmap to be used as its icon. Window managers vary
      in <em>what</em> they use this for – they might minimise the
      whole window to an icon in Windows 3.1 style, or display the
      icon in a taskbar entry in the style of more modern Windows, or
      display the icon somewhere in the application’s window frame, or
      anything else they can think of.</p>
    <p>I hadn’t done anything about this in 2002, partly because as
      far as I knew the toolkit library I was using (GTK 1) didn’t
      support setting an icon on the window, and also because it would
      have been a pain to provide the same icons in multiple bitmap
      file formats.</p>
    <p>But now that I was generating the icons from a script, it was
      suddenly much easier to make the script output multiple file
      formats. Also I found out that GTK 1 <em>did</em> let you set an
      icon property after all. (In any case, I already knew GTK 2
      could do that, and was planning an upgrade to that.) So, for
      both reasons, it was now practical to provide icons for the X11
      versions of the PuTTY tools.</p>
    <p>So I had to draw an icon for <code>pterm</code>, which didn’t
      already have one!</p>
    <p>This time, I really did run out of imagination.
      Since <code>pterm</code> doesn’t do any network communication, I
      simply drew an icon consisting of <em>just one</em> copy of the
      same computer logo seen in all the other icons, expanding it to
      the full size of the icon image. (A little bigger than it was for
      Pageant, since this time it didn’t have to fit under a hat.)</p>
    <p><code>pterm</code> also has a configuration dialog box, so I
      made a separate icon for that, reusing the same spanner overlay
      from PuTTY proper.</p>

      </div>
      <figcaption>The icon for <code>pterm</code>, and its
        configuration dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Much</em> later, in 2021, it became possible to write a
      version of <code>pterm</code> that would run on Windows, and act
      as an alternative GUI container for an ordinary
      Windows <code>cmd.exe</code> or Powershell session. This icon
      became the one for Windows pterm as well, once that
      happened.</p>
    <h3 id="installer">Installer</h3>
    <p>The flexible icon-drawing script also let me support true
      colour icons as an extra output mode, so I wasn’t limited to the
      old 16-colour palette any more.</p>
    <p>That came in handy when I needed an icon for the
      PuTTY <em>installer</em>. I thought it would be nice to draw a
      cardboard box as part of that icon, with the flaps open at the
      top and a lightning bolt coming out of it pointing at a
      computer, suggesting “PuTTY is zapping out of this box on to
      your machine”. Cardboard boxes are brown, and brown wasn’t in
      the 16-colour icon palette – but now we weren’t limited to that
      palette any more, so I could draw a true-colour icon
      using <em>actual</em> brown!</p>
    <p>But I still wanted to support the 16-colour icons, because I
      never like to throw away backwards compatibility if I can avoid
      it. And I noticed that you could make <em>several</em>
      acceptable shades of brown by taking two different colours in
      the old Windows 16-colour icon palette, and mixing them 50:50.
      All my mixes involved the dark red (<span><code>#800000</code></span>); I got three
      different browns, or brown-enough colours, by mixing it with
      black (<span><code>#000000</code></span>), dark yellow
      (<span><code>#808000</code></span>), and full yellow
      (<span><code>#ffff00</code></span>).</p>
    <p>So I made the cardboard box out of those three 50-50 mixes,
      using them all to show that different parts of the box were at
      different angles to the light. That way, in the true-colour icon
      I could use a single colour that was the mean of the two old
      colours, and in the 16-colour version I halftoned it by
      alternating pixels of the <em>actual</em> two old colours.</p>

    <h2 id="svg">SVG revamp</h2>
    <p>My icon-drawing script works well at the ordinary 32&nbsp;×&nbsp;32 and
      48&nbsp;×&nbsp;48 sizes, and scales <em>down</em> to 16&nbsp;×&nbsp;16 reasonably
      well, but it doesn’t work so well when you start
      scaling <em>up</em>.</p>
    <p>So, if anyone needs <em>really big</em> versions of the icons,
      generating them by just running the same script with a bigger
      image size won’t produce very nice output. In one of my failed
      attempts to port PuTTY to the Mac, I found that MacOS wanted a
      128&nbsp;×&nbsp;128 icon to use in the dock, and the output of my script
      at that size was definitely not great.</p>
    <p>I’ve more or less given up on that Mac port now, but I thought
      that a fully scalable version of all the icons might still be a
      useful thing to have around. For one thing, it allows using them
      in contexts other than GUI icons. (Gratuitous merch, anyone?
      T-shirts? Laptop decals? 🙂)</p>
    <p>So, partly “just in case” but also for fun, I’ve been working
      on a second icon-drawing script. It mimics the same “thought
      processes” of the original script, but it outputs SVG files
      instead of bitmaps – keeping the artwork still as close as
      possible to the original style.</p>
    <p>As of now, these are my best efforts at the SVG versions:</p>

      <figcaption>All eight icons, in fully scalable SVG</figcaption>

    <p>For the tiny icons, I still think my original script is doing a
      better rendering job, because SVG has no idea at all how best to
      do that antialiasing. But for <em>large</em> icons, especially
      in true colour, I think my recommendation is going to be to base
      them on these SVGs – just render to a big bitmap.</p>
    <h2 id="eof">That’s all, folks!</h2>
    <p>That’s the history and the current state of the PuTTY icon set.</p>
    <p>People sometimes object to the entire 1990s styling, and
      volunteer to design us a complete set of replacements in a
      different style. We’ve never liked any of them enough to adopt
      them. I think that’s probably <em>because</em> the 1990s styling
      is part of what makes PuTTY what it is – “reassuringly
      old-fashioned”. I don’t know if there’s <em>any</em> major
      redesign that we’d really be on board with.</p>
    <p>So I expect by now we’re likely to keep these icons, or
      something basically the same, for the whole lifetime of the
      project!</p>

<p>So far, we’ve only really touched on some of the fundamentals of reverse engineering with one game example, but this time we’re looking at something a bit different.</p>



<p>Shenmue (1999) is widely known for its pursuit of realism and has remained an influential series to this day, with its third game releasing in 2019. This pursuit of realism wasn’t unintentional, but one of the key design choices they made early on in development. With 2 cult classic hits on the SEGA Dreamcast, in this post, we’ll look at some code in the game which reveals a mystery and how reverse engineering can be used to understand exactly how the game attempts to capture the essence of realism, and maybe even the original developers intentions..</p>







<h2>Logic</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, the concepts behind reverse engineering actual logic remains roughly the same. We have to reason with the code we see and try to apply that reasoning to the code. Machines don’t execute C code, they read and execute machine code, of which was generated during the lossy process of compilation itself. This creates something of an interesting place for reverse engineers and interested developers alike, as the skill of being able to reverse engineer some code, or data, even a bug, ultimately builds your skillset as a developer and thus can lead you into different career paths. An obvious example is security: malware reverse engineering and other areas of the cybersecurity field have an inherent desire to be able to identify exactly what a piece of code is doing. </p>



<p>Functions are transformed from their C source code into “machine code”, which is the assembled form of assembly instructions. This process, of C source code being transformed into assembly and then assembled into machine code, is a lossy process inherently. Thus, while attempting to reverse engineer logic, we often find that the underlying code has been slightly altered from its original form, in an effort to make the code more performant. </p>



<p>With this in mind, depending on the original source code, the compiler and toolchain being used, and some other factors, it can be challenging to truly understand the developers original intentions, especially since all variable, function names and comments are usually always removed as part of compilation and we must recreate these as much as we can ourselves. This is the most complex form of reverse engineering and a lot of time, effort and patience are what pay off the most. </p>



<h2>The Mystery</h2>



<p>In real life, the Earth’s axial tilt plays a crucial role in determining the suns position at any given time of the year. </p>

<p>In Shenmue, simulating everything would be a tall order, but with this they can certainly get most of the way there. In the game, there is a heavy emphasis on keeping to a schedule and the minutae of daily life, and this is evidenced in the below logic, which we’ll dissect.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="774" src="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glv880MX0AAIB8F-1024x774.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glv880MX0AAIB8F-1024x774.jpg 1024w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glv880MX0AAIB8F-300x227.jpg 300w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glv880MX0AAIB8F-768x580.jpg 768w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glv880MX0AAIB8F.jpg 1055w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>

<div><p>This is the result of many hours of reverse engineering sessions and discovered a while ago, we noticed something quite interesting. For the purposes of demonstration, I’ve omitted certain things, this will become clear later on in the post. </p><p>As stated before, the game is heavily based around daily life and as such, I discovered that this code was responsible for calculating the suns position and direction, for the purposes of lighting the scene. Reversing is inherently an iterative process — as you progress, your understandings may change about a previous function or some piece of data — and as such the screenshot above shows what my understanding was at the time.</p></div>

<p>This line is converting the current time into a rotation, we know this because DEG_TO_RAD, in this case, is π over 180: a common method for converting degrees into radians. But what is 12 and -15? </p>



<p>Moving onto the next line, we essentially have more confirmation that this value is a rotation value, as it is passed into <code>sin</code>, after being subtracted by <code>HALF_PI</code>. We progress onto the next line, which is where the meat of the calculation takes place.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="143" src="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-1024x143.png" alt="" srcset="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-1024x143.png 1024w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-300x42.png 300w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-768x107.png 768w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3-1536x215.png 1536w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png 1824w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<div><p>This line condenses quite a bit of logic and we get more confirmation that this is a rotation being built up, through the heavy use of π and moving in and out of degrees. There’s something peculiar here, though. </p><p>The magic numbers so far have mostly made sense, especially given their use with <code>sin</code>. But now we have 365.0 to add to our mystery number list, and an array:</p></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="86" src="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-1024x86.png" alt="" srcset="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-1024x86.png 1024w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-300x25.png 300w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4-768x65.png 768w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png 1220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This array is being accessed directly by the current month and, upon closer inspection, we can also see 365 at the end of the array and it seems that this array is in fact an array that maps the accumulated days within a year for each month. There are 12 numbers, each one representing the total number of days that have passed for that month. We’ll rename this array to <code>g_accum_days</code> to reflect our current research.</p>



<p>Now we’ve gained a little bit of a clearer picture as to what is happening here, part of the expression from the last line of code is calculating how far along the game currently is into the year:</p>



<p><code>g_accum_days[month-1] - day / 365</code></p>



<p>in which it is then converted into a rotation with the help of a couple more magic numbers. </p>







<p>Just like in previous posts, at this point, a new theory was emerging: it seems as though the game is performing a calculation that derives the suns position based on the games current progression into the year, by approximating its axial tilt, roughly 23.4°. </p>











<h2>The Second Iteration</h2>



<p>It’s just a theory so far, and we’ve only looked at <em>Shenmue</em>, but AM2 also released <em>Shenmue II</em> shortly after and, given that both games share the same philosophies, perhaps if we delve into its implementation, we can spot some differences and hopefully clear up the remaining mysteries behind the rest of the magic numbers. </p>



<p>Before looking at its actual code implementation, we confirm and rename the day accumulation array. It’s exactly the same as the first game, but how it is being used shows something else:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="76" src="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5-1024x76.png" alt="" srcset="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5-1024x76.png 1024w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5-300x22.png 300w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5-768x57.png 768w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5.png 1466w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This line shows an extra statement within the calculation from the first game. Now, instead of <strong>202</strong>, the game is now directly referencing the 5th element of the day accumulation array. Checking over the value of the 5th element gives us 181. This could have resulted in a slightly off approximation of the summer solstice, which occurs around day ~172 within the year. However, it is more than likely that the code was refactored to directly reference this within the day accumulation array. </p>











<p>Initially we thought that this could be a bug, but despite the omission of 202, the 2 implementations remain somewhat equivalent…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="212" src="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6-1024x212.png" alt="" srcset="https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6-1024x212.png 1024w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6-300x62.png 300w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6-768x159.png 768w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6-1536x319.png 1536w, https://wulinshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6.png 1774w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Some of the changes we see here are likely part compiler optimisations and the code being changed. </p>



<p>First, the game is essentially converting time into a rotation, where noon (12pm) is directly above and each hour represents 15 degrees, known as the solar time angle. The game then approximates the earths axial tilt, with a given latitude <code>tiltAngle</code>, based on the Earth’s tilt, 23.5°.</p>



<p>This step essentially allows the game to simulate the sun’s position as realistically as possible based on the current date and time.. and a given latitude. </p>







<h2>Findings</h2>



<p>To wrap all of this up, we’ve discovered that the game is correctly approximating the suns position in a way which aligns with the design goals and philosophies of one of gamings most beloved franchises. But up until this point, I’ve refrained from showing one key variable: <code>tiltAngle</code></p>



<p>In order to perform this calculation, you need the latitude, and since <em>Shenmue</em> is based in Yokosuka, Japan, it would make sense that the latitude used for this calculation would be 35°, and <em>Shenmue II</em> as 22°, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_by_latitude">just as it is in real-life</a>. <br></p>



<p><strong>However, in this case, it appears as though this could be quite literally reversed (pun intended)</strong>:</p>



<p><strong><em>Shenmue I</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Shenmue II</em></strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, it is impossible to tell without clarification from the developer in this instance, but the intent here is to show how reverse engineering code is an iterative process and your understanding of the original logic is always changing the more you look into the details. </p>



<p>I hope you found this post informative and was as interesting to read as it was for me to dedicate large amounts of time reverse engineering these games. If you’ve never checked them out, I strongly suggest doing so.</p>



<p>Full code will be made available in the not too distant future.</p>

So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.</p><p data-block-key="73qu7">Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.</p><p data-block-key="4he0s">The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.</p><p data-block-key="dtsn7">Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.</p><p data-block-key="im3d">We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="2q7pg">Enhancing Gemini’s world understanding</h2><p data-block-key="f1glf"><br>Alongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.</p><p data-block-key="6k4gb">Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.</p><p data-block-key="1lam2">Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="2q7pg">Responsibly advancing AI and robotics<br></h2><p data-block-key="16hbn">As we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, <a href="https://sites.google.com/corp/view/safe-robots" rel="noopener" target="_blank">holistic</a> approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.</p><p data-block-key="7s8sj">The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.</p><p data-block-key="3dcnu">To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/shaping-the-future-of-advanced-robotics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robot Constitution</a> inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the <a href="https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new ASIMOV dataset</a> will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.</p><p data-block-key="ch213">To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.</p><p data-block-key="cis52">In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="World's First Ammonia-Fueled Ship Hits a Snag"><p>The <em><a href="https://www.equinor.com/news/20240826-worlds-first-ammonia-powered-supply-vessel" target="_blank">Viking Energy</a></em>, an oil platform supply ship<strong></strong>undergoing a pioneering retrofit to run on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ammonia">ammonia</a> fuel, is now scheduled to begin operations in 2026—two years later than initially planned. Once completed, it will be the first vessel capable of operating full-time on ammonia, marking a major milestone in efforts to reduce <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in the maritime industry.</p><p><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> previously reported on ammonia as a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-the-shipping-industry-is-betting-big-on-ammonia" target="_blank">potential replacement</a> for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/petroleum">petroleum</a> fuels in the shipping industry in 2021, at which time key stakeholders—including Norwegian energy <a href="https://www.equinor.com/about-us/our-history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">giant Equinor</a>, technology provider <a href="https://www.wartsila.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wärtsilä</a>, and shipping company <a href="https://eidesvik.no/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eidesvik Offshore</a>—expected the <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/viking">Viking</a> Energy</em> to set sail in 2024. However, progress has slowed.</p><p>Industry experts attribute the delay to the complex infrastructure required to handle ammonia safely. “Ammonia is toxic, explosive, and corrosive. We must use special piping, storage tanks, and trucks outfitted with materials engineered to be both leakproof and resistant to ammonia’s corrosive properties,” says <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/port-electrification" target="_self">John Prousalidis</a>, a professor of marine engineering at the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Technical University of Athens</a>. </p><p>A spokesperson for Wärtsilä told<em> IEEE Spectrum</em>  that the delay has not been related to performance or safety issues, but to “ the challenges of being at the forefront of maritime decarbonization.” The spokesperson explains that the project “was <span>originally the demonstrator in the EU-funded <a href="https://www.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/projects-dashboard/projects-repository/shipfc_en" target="_blank">ShipFC</a> Clean <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hydrogen">Hydrogen</a> Partnership program, which aimed to install a 2-megawatt ammonia-powered fuel cell onboard.” But because </span><span> logistics for the production of solid oxide <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fuel-cells">fuel cells</a> for this application did not mature as quickly as anticipated, the EU organizers put “a temporary pause” on the retrofit. The 2024 deadline was no longer feasible, but the partnership restarted the project with a specially made <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gas-turbine">gas turbine</a> designed to run on ammonia.</span></p><p><span>When working with first-of-their-kind technologies, timelines can shift — but the ambition remains the same: to make ammonia a viable zero-carbon fuel for the maritime industry,” says the Wärtsilä spokesperson.</span></p><p>Being first comes with a set of challenges that must be overcome. One of the biggest environmental concerns with ammonia-powered ships is the potential release of nitrogen oxides. “Instead of CO<sub>2</sub>, which contributes to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/global-warming">global warming</a>, we could end up with nitrogen oxides, which are lethal to breathe,” says Prousalidis. “To avoid simply swapping one pollutant for another, ammonia propulsion systems must include emissions-control technologies to prevent harmful nitrogen oxides from entering the atmosphere,” he adds.</p><p>A promising alternative to combustion engines is ammonia-powered fuel cells like the one originally slated to power the <em>Viking Energy.</em> Fuel cells generate electricity without producing nitrogen oxide emissions. By avoiding combustion entirely, these fuel cells allow ammonia’s nitrogen content to remain in its inert form, eliminating a key health risk.</p><h2>Ammonia Fuel Delays for <em>Viking Energy</em></h2><p>Despite the challenges, experts believe ammonia could become a mainstream maritime fuel—but not overnight. “Twenty or thirty years ago, the shipping industry made a major shift to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/natural-gas">natural gas</a>, believing it was the fuel of the future. Now, we know it wasn’t the right step,” says Prousalidis.</p><p>Looking back at past fuel transitions, he noted that each shift—from steam to oil, and then to natural gas—took around 20 years to achieve full adoption. He expects a similar timeline for the adoption of ammonia or hydrogen. “We need to be patient while persisting in our efforts and not getting discouraged by early challenges.”</p><p>That perspective aligns with what Equinor’s vice president of renewable and low-carbon technology, Henriette Undrum, told <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> in 2021 when she urged the public to be patient: “We are not just solving one small problem for one ship. It’s part of the bigger picture. It will be a starting point to build up the market for zero-carbon fuels.”</p><p><img alt="The Viking Energy platform supply vessel out at sea." data-rm-shortcode-id="b52ecb33293c195f29b836637393dcb6" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-viking-energy-platform-supply-vessel-out-at-sea.jpg?id=56650806&amp;width=980" height="1446" id="1381b" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-viking-energy-platform-supply-vessel-out-at-sea.jpg?id=56650806&amp;width=980" width="2314"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Eidesvik’s ammonia-powered Viking Energy is now slated to ship out in 2026.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Eidesvik</small></p><p><span>As ammonia and hydrogen gain traction as maritime fuels, seaports could play a pivotal role in in solving ammonia’s chicken-and-egg problem.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Column</span> My decade-old and very well-travelled 13" MacBook Pro finally died, and I hoped my new-ish M2 iPad Pro could replace it.</p>
<p>Yet no matter how hard I try, an iPad cannot serve me like a Mac does and I can’t help but wonder why.</p>
<p>Some of it must be my mindset: Nearly 50 years of using computers equipped with keyboards and screens "programmed" me with certain expectations. Fourteen years of using iPads has programmed me with a very different set of capabilities.</p>

    

<p>I think I could unlearn some habits but only after enormous efforts.</p>

        


        

<p>Operating systems therefore look like another reason I can’t make the iPad my main machine.</p>
<p>I've <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/23/apples_got_a_good_thing/">written</a> about the M2 iPad Pro and M2 MacBook Air sharing many components yet running different OSes. But even if I could somehow get macOS running on my iPad Pro, would that resolve this tension?</p>

        

<p>I don't think so. A tablet lacks a keyboard and trackpad and even if I buy models designed for the iPad, tablets are all about push, poke, and drag.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs reportedly held back the release of the iPad (despite huge pent-up-demand) until he felt the iPad interface reflected more than just a 'scaled up iPhone'. What we see today is the outcome of almost two decades of design choices that have only recently started to accommodate keyboards and external pointing devices.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/20/data_is_the_new_uranium/">Data is the new uranium – incredibly powerful and amazingly dangerous</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Any computer that can't offer me a terminal window, root access, and the ability to type "python" to get into a REPL shell feels fake - an incomplete simulation of a real computer. Yes, I have <a target="_blank" href="https://ish.app/">iSH</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">aShell</a> on my iPad Pro - great tools, yet neither offering the kind of power that I need when using PyTorch (which runs great on a bare-metal M2).</p>
<p>I could single out Apple for its ridiculous policies that make iPads less useful than Macs, but Cupertino is not alone: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/28/windows_10_demise_linux/">Microsoft won't let users upgrade</a> their older boxen to Windows 11. I have a first-generation Surface Go (magically, both a laptop and a tablet) that still works perfectly, and which will become so much electronic detritus later this year because Microsoft refuses to let its own hardware run its own operating system.</p>
<p>It's infuriating, largely because it all feels so self-serving.</p>

        

<p>The promises of "safety and security" vendors intone as they guide us into their monopolistic cages mean something very different when looking out from inside those bars. Safety feels like vulnerability, and security becomes entirely dependent on the steady attention of a vendor that suddenly has no fears about losing customers even if they fumble the ball.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike_falcon_sensor_bsod_incident/">Crowdstrike</a>, anyone?</p>
<p>I already know I'll ignore my misgivings and buy an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/05/apple_m3_ultra_mac_studio/">M4 MacBook Air</a> to replace already-missed 2015 machine. Apple builds well - this laptop might make it with me well into the 2030s.</p>
<p>What kind of OS and services will we be using then? Will 'office' software <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/europe_has_second_thoughts_about/">still come from one vendor</a> (ok, possibly two, for those using Google's apps)?</p>
<p>Will we still have just three operating systems to choose from - of which only two are really suitable for a worker's desktop? Will we have just two mobile OSes? Will everything continue to consolidate, an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/30/tech_monopoly_doctorow/">ensh*ttification</a> demanding <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/microsoft_365_price_rises/">more and more</a> from us while offering less and less in return?</p>
<p>Or are we closer to a different kind of world in which improving AI interfaces mean none of this really matters? Can all of this entrapment be abstracted away by agents? I'd like to think so - but if history is any guide, AI providers will be tempted to lay down a breadcrumb path to another cage.</p>
<p>Time to find an angle grinder. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>
          The open, global internet is a remarkable resource that connects us
          all and empowers individuals to share ideas, collaborate, and
          innovate. It embodies our collective hopes for a better future,
          fostering learning, understanding, and solutions to the challenges we
          face together.
        </p>

        <p>
          As passionate supporters of Mozilla and its mission, we want to
          express our thoughts on the current landscape, especially in light of
          the ongoing <em>U.S. v. Google LLC</em> case and its implications for
          Mozilla’s search partnerships. While Mozilla has always championed
          user privacy and an open web, the increasing reliance on Google for
          revenue raises important questions about our shared commitment to
          these values.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now is the time for Mozilla to take bold steps to reinforce its
          identity as a privacy-centric nonprofit and to prioritize the Firefox
          browser as the heart of your mission.
        </p>

        <h2 id="embrace-independence">Embrace Independence</h2>

        <p>
          It is time to reevaluate the partnership with Google and seek
          alternatives that align with Mozilla’s values. By distancing itself
          from Google, Mozilla can reaffirm its commitment to user privacy and
          autonomy, fostering trust among its user base.
        </p>

        <h2 id="focus-on-firefox">Focus on Firefox</h2>

        <p>
          The Firefox browser has been a cornerstone of Mozilla’s identity. By
          concentrating resources and innovation on enhancing Firefox, you can
          improve user experience, performance, and privacy features. This focus
          will not only attract new users but also retain existing ones who
          value a browser that prioritizes their needs.
        </p>

        <h2 id="privacy-first">Sustainable, Privacy-First Ventures</h2>

        <p>
          Firefox needs new revenue streams to be sustainable. New products and
          services under Mozilla’s umbrella should reflect the same commitment
          to privacy that defines Mozilla. By prioritizing user-friendly,
          privacy-respecting practices, you can strengthen your reputation as a
          leader in the digital rights movement.
        </p>

        

        <p>
          Mozilla thrives on the passion and creativity of its community. By
          actively involving users and developers in the conversation, you can
          gather valuable insights and foster a sense of shared ownership in the
          future of Mozilla.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          The future of Mozilla depends on its ability to remain true to its
          founding principles. By taking decisive action to reinforce your
          commitment to privacy and focusing on the Firefox browser, you can
          continue to lead the way in creating a better internet for everyone.
        </p>

        

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Gemma is a lightweight, family of models from Google built on Gemini technology. The Gemma 3 models are multimodal—processing text and images—and feature a 128K context window with support for over 140 languages. Available in 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B parameter sizes, they excel in tasks like question answering, summarization, and reasoning, while their compact design allows deployment on resource-limited devices.</p>

  <p>I've been a good student for 5 years at a French computer school. I've been a good freelance developer for 20 years. I've used Ruby on Rails exclusively however never writing my own code always for clients.</p>
<p>One day I learned Common Lisp. It was supposed to be a short mission I thought I could learn Common Lisp in ten days and hack a quick server management protocol. I ended up writing throw-away Common Lisp code that generated C for a fully-fledged ASN.1 parser and query system for a custom Common Lisp to C SNMP server.</p>
<p>Years later I wrote more and more Common Lisp code and ended up writing cl-unix-cybernetics which has the most stars on Github of all my repos there, and cl-streams and cl-cffi, and finally cl-facts which is a triple store that can be used as a Common Lisp graph database. The results were astonishing : very fast, atomic transactions, nestable transactions, compatible with unwind-protect, only 3 macros to learn and you're all set. Cl-facts was presented as a lightning talk at ELS (European Lisp Symposium) in Belgium. Slides for my talk there is available, see the <a href="https://www.kmx.io/">front page</a>.</p>
<p>Writing all these Common Lisp packages took a long time and I was loosing all my clients. I did not care, Common Lisp was awesome and a tool for future generations for sure.</p>
<p>However I also had a lot of echoes around me of people failing where Theo de Raadt and others had said they were wrong. Virtual machines still suck a lot of CPU and bandwidth for nothing but emulation. Containers in Linux with cgroups are still full of RCE (remote command execution) and priviledge escalation. New ones are discovered each year. The first report I got on those listed 10 or more RCE + PE (remote root on the machine). Remote root can also escape VMs probably also. You do have backups right ? So it kept me centered on OpenBSD and avoided me the hell that most DevOps faced : Terraform, Ansible and such. So I saw people angry with VMs and containers and also people angry with their very programming language. Like Clojure : who can write a strategy game with thousands of units each having their own vision of the world, without having a garbage collector running like hell ? In fact my friend went away and tried to write the game and failed. Garbage collectors suck, and all my Common Lisp projects have very limited applications just because of the garbage collector. And we all know it's a commercial argument to the jVM : it has one of the best GCs around and it did cost a lot to write correctly. I guess it was not written in a one time scratch</p>
<p>So I thought OK I have a killer app but no-one will run it because it's in Common Lisp. The only rational solution for performance and portability reasons, unless another tool is developed for these specific purpose like C, is C. Linux is written in C, OpenBSD is written in C, GTK+ is object-oriented pure C, GNOME is written in C. Most of the Linux desktop apps are actually written in plain old C. So why try harder ? I know C.</p>
<p>So I started writing my <strong>libc3</strong> utility library, which would become a language (<strong>C3</strong>) with an interpreter (<strong>ic3</strong>) but could also be compiled (<strong>c3c</strong>) if we did manage to get it through at some point; and data structures emerged from UTF-8 buffers and the other way around pretty fast and all was bounds-checked at memory cost but the results were awesome. Defensive programming all the way : all bugs are reduced to zero right from the start. The system has been maintained clean of wrong bugs all of the time. There are no security implications of running KC3 code. So very fast a small interpreter was born, pumping <strong>tags</strong> (an enum-tagged union of all datatypes of the language) in a REPL (read eval print loop).</p>
<p>3 years later I just finished a 5 layered refactor and all the tests pass again and the webserver seems to not be broken again. The language was renamed from C3 to KC3 as the original name was already taken. So what do we have ?</p>
<p>I had already ported the graph database (<strong>cl-facts</strong>) to C89 and though a couple of bugs remained at the time of import pretty much all the database was written during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Everything was there : add a triple, remove a triple, the recursive query system, transactions, logging and persistence. Pixel perfect implementation of my original design in Common Lisp but in plain old C89 which I remembered quite well.</p>
<p>Besides the graph data base I also wrote parsers and generators to get formal semantics for all algorithmic types I know of and could write in such a short amount of time : Structs, Linked lists, Maps, Hash tables, Time, Complex, Rationals, Tuples, Code blocks, Quotes, Unquotes, Copy on write, Skip lists, Sets, etc. I have macros like I explain in my other article. I'll do a follow up with some examples of macros. I was very much inspired by the awesome work of José Valim and Elixir. See Fly.io's blog if you want to read José Valim !</p>
<p>I have a REPL (<strong>ikc3</strong>) which parses keyboard or file input and outputs all results of a KC3 evaluation to the console (standard output). It is used for most of the second phase of unit testing KC3.</p>
<p>I have a webserver with an MVC framework which is producing the very webpage you're reading : <strong>kc3_httpd</strong>.</p>
<p>I have 700 views on a Common Lisp article which is crazy I did not think Common Lisp had so many followers.</p>
<p>I have a documentation website all written using <strong>kc3_httpd</strong> and a vamped Markdown to HTML C implementation.</p>
<p>Come on Discord and join the fun.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><p>Posted on March 12, 2025</p><p>AI for coding is in a weird spot right now.</p><p>You get people claiming that you can build a complete SaaS in 3 days, and others saying that it's worse than useless. Both of these people are probably just exaggerating or straight up lying.</p><p>I love coding with Cursor, it's completely changed the way I code, but it's also complete garbage a good deal of the time.</p><p>So as an AI skeptic i'll tell you everything I know to make your experience as good as possible.</p><p><em>Note: If you prefer watching rather than reading,<!-- --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2b7wMfalI" target="_blank">here's a YouTube video</a> <!-- -->with the same content.</em></p><p>Let's start with an easy one.</p><p>If you don't have a<!-- --> <span>.cursorrules</span> file you are missing out.</p><p>(This has changed recently to be a bunch of<!-- --> <span>.mdc</span> files, just CMD+Shift+P<!-- --> <span>New Cursor Rule</span> and it will create one for you in the right place)</p><p>You can have one ready to go in about 10 minutes, and it will save you hours of time.</p><p>Look up your stack on this<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents" target="_blank">list of cursorrules</a> <!-- -->and pull out the best bits.</p><p>But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time.</p><p>You don't need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined.</p><p>The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light.</p><p>And here's the thing: if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say "please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing." And then chuck it in there.</p><p>Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing (??) in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it won't happen again.</p><p>And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about.

The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if there's anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it.</p><p>Okay and let's get into some rapid fire tips.</p><ul><li>I like Composer (now called Agent) for simple, low impact changes. And Chat (Ask) for everything else. Just the step of manually having to click apply and taking that extra second to think about the changes it's making, and in which files it's happening, rather than just be presented with a wave of green changes ready to get smashed in.</li><li>Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you.</li><li>Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it <em>manually.</em> <!-- -->You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better.</li><li>Ask "is this the best way to do this?" or "have you considered xyz".</li><li>Learn when a problem is best solved manually.</li><li>Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process.</li><li>If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.</li></ul><p>One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach.</p><p>It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing "You're right" "I see the issue now" only to end up in a worse place than you started.</p><p>But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.</p><p>And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.</p><p>I also think one of the biggest factors in your experience with coding with AI is going to be <em>what</em> you are coding, and which tech stack you are using. So if it just keeps sucking no matter what you try, and you feel like you're going crazy seeing everyone hype it up, it's probably not your fault.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
           <p>Binary Security found the undocumented APIs for Azure API Connections. In this post we examine the inner workings of the Connections allowing us to escalate privileges and read secrets in backend resources for services ranging from Key Vaults, Storage Blobs, Defender ATP, to Enterprise Jira and SalesForce servers.
</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>During a client engagement, I was checking out their Azure Resources looking for common vulnerabilities. They were utilizing a Logic App to post some messages to Slack. Usually, we can find some tokens or other sensitive information in the workflow run history of these apps, as it is common to not mark input (and output) as sensitive. I could not find anything of the sort in this case, so I moved on from the investigation. However, by chance I saw an odd response from a request automatically made from the portal when going into the API Connection resource. It was something like:</p>

<p>Now, this might seem uninteresting at first glance, but there are two key fields in this response that really opened up a whole slew of possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="the-inherent-insecurity-of-api-connections">The Inherent Insecurity of API Connections</h2>
<p>Consider the <code>testLinks</code> and <code>testRequests</code> fields of the above response. It seems that they provide a sort of proxy between the Azure Management API and the actual backend server, most clearly seen by the <code>extensions/proxy</code> path. We can also see that the connection perhaps is authenticated in some way, by the <code>OAuth</code> value in the <code>parameterValueSet</code>. Now, naively, I would think that this means that some user, probably whoever set this up, is authenticated to this connection, and we would need his token to call through the connection, or maybe do an <code>OAuth</code> dance ourselves.</p>
<p>What I would <strong>not</strong> expect is that anyone with Reader permissions on the connection is allowed to arbitrarily call any endpoint on the connection:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>
</span><span>GET</span> <span>/subscriptions/8e3ce52f-d45b-4347-8705-65892507465e/resourceGroups/logic-app-tests/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/jira/extensions/proxy/conversations.list</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>2</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The response is actually exactly the same as a direct query on the Slack API endpoint <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list">conversations.list</a></p>
<p>While the Slack case is perhaps not the most security critical, this result begs the question: Does this work for all the other types of APIs exposed through this interface?</p>
<p>The answer is yes. If you have created an API Connection to any backend server, this includes other Azure resources, all Readers on that subscription can call all <code>GET</code> requests defined on the connection. Specifically, this includes Key Vaults, SQL Databases, Jira-servers, Defender ATP, etc.</p>
<h2 id="azure-management-arm-apis-security-model">Azure Management (ARM) API’s Security Model</h2>
<p>Before I show how to exploit this properly, some background on the Azure Management API is required. While we cannot know for sure how the developers at Microsoft designed the system, it seems clear to me that initially, the security model of the management API considered that Readers should be allowed to perform <code>GET</code> requests. You would have to be <code>Contributor</code> or higher to perform any changes, i.e. using any of the <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc methods.</p>
<p>This can be seen by for instance requiring a number of sensitive endpoints for <code>App Services</code> to be empty <code>POST</code> requests, like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/list-host-keys">List Host Keys</a>.</p>
<p>At Binary Security we have reported a number of vulnerabilities relating to the leaking of sensitive information through insecure <code>GET</code> endpoints. The result of this is that the security model has been somewhat changed in recent times, and it is now not obvious if a Reader is allowed to call a <code>GET</code> endpoint. This is, however, still a viable attack method, and reading the documentation is still a goldmine for exploitable bugs.</p>
<p>Getting back to the API Connections, it should be clear that the Management’s <code>/extensions/proxy/{action}</code> endpoints will allow all Readers to call the defined <code>GET</code> requests. And while this is not seen as a problem in the ARM world, there is of course no guarantee that the connected API adheres to this security model.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-api-connection">Creating an API Connection</h2>
<p>API Connections are resources in the Azure world, just like Key Vaults, SQL Databases or VMs, but they are not required to be explicitly created. They are automatically created for you when setting up Actions in a Logic App, so even if you have never heard of them before, it is quite possible that there are a lot of them hanging out in your tenant. For instance, creating a connection to your Key Vault is as easy as going to the Logic App Designer view, finding the Key Vaults actions, setting some initial values and authenticating.
<img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/createkeyvault-connection.png" alt="Sign in to create the connection"></p>
<p>This of course requires that the person setting it up, and authenticating to the Key Vault has appropriate access to the Key Vault. After signing in, it is not required to even save the Workflow, the resource is still created, and will need to be explicitly deleted if it is not needed any more.</p>
<p>The flows for internal Azure Resources are all similar, where you can choose between different authentication types. For external resources, the setup varies, but in all cases, some authentication information is saved within the API Connection in some way, and this is used when querying the API.</p>
<p>This means that the authentication used on the backend API call is always the same, and does not depend on the user or principal calling the ARM API. Crucially, the backend cannot know whether the call comes from the Logic App or from the proxy endpoint, called by any Reader on the resource.</p>
<h2 id="the-api-connection-api">The API Connection API</h2>
<p>The full list of API Connections (Connectors) can be seen <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/">here</a>. The proxy endpoints are not explicitly listed, but they can either be deduced from the API of the connected service, or by querying the <code>managedAPIs</code> endpoint for that specific Connector, which exposes a Swagger definition of the API. Here we query it for the definition of the Jira Connector:</p>

 <li><code>/{connectionId}/secrets/{secretName}/value</code> to retrieve the value of the secret</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sql-databases">SQL Databases</h3>
<p>The SQL Connector is quite similar to the Key Vault, you are basically free to read whatever you want:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/databases</code> -  List Databases</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/datasets</code> - List Datasets</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/datasets({dataset})/tables({table})/items</code> - Get rows from a table</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/get-data-from-sql.png" alt="Reading the rows of the database"></p>
<p>There is also a hilarious error message here, when trying to do some path traversing in the dataset name. It did not seem to be exploitable in any way, but I bet you have never seen a stacktrace exposed in an HTTP status message:</p>

<h2 id="jira">Jira</h2>
<p>The Jira Connector also exposes effectively everything on your Jira instance:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/v2/project/search</code> - List projects</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/user/permission/search</code> - List users</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/2/search</code> - List issues</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/issue/{issueKey}</code> - Read an issue</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>This connector is also interesting because it, of course, must be connected to your Jira instance somewhere else on the Internet. When setting up the connection, the developer gives the connection the URL of the Jira Instance. Incredibly, this is ignored in all subsequent requests, and instead, a special <code>X-Request-Jirainstance</code> header must be included in the request. This should point to your Jira instance, but there is no verification, so an attacker is free to SSRF at will. By setting this to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker will receive the API token used by the connection. This effectively also bypasses the restriction on the requests, and allows the attacker to query any endpoint with any method.</p>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/send-request-to-collaborator.png" alt="The special header will force the server to make a request to an attacker-controlled site"></p>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/collaborator-receives-token.png" alt="The attacker receives the request, with the token in the `Authorization` header"></p>
<p>Note that this attack is only possible when using the <code>APIToken</code> authentication mechanism. When using <code>OAuth</code>, a GUID is used to identify your Jira Instance.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest">The Rest</h2>
<p>All API Connections must be considered insecure as long as Readers can call the backend server. In nearly all cases I have seen, the connection exposes all information on the backend service. In addition to the ones above, this includes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Salesforce</li>
 <li>Azure Storage Blobs</li>
 <li>Azure Defender ATP</li>
 <li>Google Mail, Contacts, Calendars</li>
</ul>
<p>and probably much more.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>I think there is significant undiscovered potential in these connections. Without going into detail, I can tell you that API Connections have a significant amount of architecture hidden between the Management Server and the backend API. All calls go from ARM to a <em>global</em> APIM instance containing every tenant’s API Connection, utilizing a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-tokens">Token Store</a>. The initial authentication setup likewise goes through a <em>global</em> Consent server for storing tokens. If this hidden infrastructure is compromised, there will be significant cross-tenant impact as well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully by now, you have realized the impact of a lacking security model. While these endpoints are undocumented, that only makes them harder to find, not exploit. I am confident that any security researcher who had found them would immediately have noticed the glaring security hole it puts in their tenant. Hopefully, this post will allow others to discover more insecurities in Azure, so that we can be more secure in the future.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-response">Microsoft response:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Jan 6: Report submitted to Microsoft, both a general for API Connections and one specifically for Jira.</li>
 <li>Jan 7: API Connection case is closed by Microsoft as not valid, I submit it again with more words.</li>
 <li>Jan 10: Microsoft confirms the API Connection vulnerability</li>
 <li>Jan 12-17: Microsoft fixes the API Connection vulnerability by not allowing any requests through <code>/extensions/proxy</code> except for <code>testrequests</code>.</li>
 <li>Jan 30: Microsoft replies on the Jira ticket, saying they cannot reproduce it, which should be obvious, since now it is fixed.</li>
 <li>Feb 12: Jira Ticket is closed</li>
 <li>Feb 13: Microsoft replies to the API Connection case, saying it has been fixed.</li>
 <li>Feb 20: The case is closed as a duplicate.</li>
</ul>
