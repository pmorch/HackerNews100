<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><span>In the small town of Kawara in Fukuoka Prefecture, something unexpected is happening at the Saidosho Community Center. While kids in most parts of Japan are obsessed with Pokémon cards — or perhaps the franchise’s latest smartphone game, </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/tech-trends/pokemon-tgc-pocket-continues-to-dominate-the-app-charts/"><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></a><span> — the children of Kawara are clutching to something a little closer to home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They are playing a trading card game (TCG) where the stars aren’t fantasy creatures, anime heroes or even famous baseball players, but </span><i><span>ojisan</span></i><span> (middle-aged or older men) from the local community of Saidosho.</span></p>

<div id="attachment_265114"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265114" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-01.jpg" alt="ojisan trading cards " width="2048" height="1356" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-01.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-01.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265114">Image: Mayuko Ichii | edits by TW</p></div>
<h2 id="67e2541dad9ce"><span>A Card Game With a Local Twist</span></h2>
<p><span>On the surface, this Ojisan TCG looks like any other collectible card game. As of March 18, there are 47 different cards in the collection, including 28 featuring local men with stats and special abilities.</span></p>
<p><span>Take the Firewall card, for example. It features Mr. Honda (74), a former fire brigade chief who helped keep the town safe for decades. Then there’s Soba Master Mr. Takeshita (81), who runs a local soba noodle-making class and now holds legendary status among the town’s youth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most popular of them all is probably All-Rounder Mr. Fujii (68), a former prison officer turned community volunteer. His card is so sought after that local kids have even started asking him for autographs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I was honestly shocked when they asked me to sign it,” Mr. Fujii said, laughing. “I never imagined I’d become a trading card, let alone have fans.”</span></p>
<p><span>Each card comes with different attacks and an assigned elemental type — just like a classic fantasy card game — but with a humorous, real-world edge. For instance, Firewall is, unsurprisingly, a fire type, equipped with a Super Guard move, which deals a hefty 200 damage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A card called Plasma Conductor, featuring a smiling, bespectacled ojisan juxtaposed with an image of a lightbulb, is an electric type. At the bottom of the card, there is a line of text explaining how he can fix any electrical appliance without fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_265113"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265113" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg" alt="ojisan trading cards " width="2880" height="1614" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265113">Screenshot taken from FNN Prime Online</p></div>
<h2 id="67e2541dad9e0"><span>From Collecting to Battling&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The creator of the game is Eri Miyahara, the Secretary General of the Saidosho Community Council.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We wanted to strengthen the connection between the children and the older generations in the community. There are so many amazing people here. I thought it was such a shame that no one knew about them,” she said in</span><a href="https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/842101"><span> an interview</span></a><span> with </span><i><span>Fuji News Network</span></i><span> (FNN). “Since the card game went viral, so many kids are starting to look up to these men as heroic figures.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The plan worked. Kids have started attending local events and volunteering for community activities — just for a chance to meet the ojisan from their cards. Participation in town events has reportedly doubled since the game launched.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, Ojisan TCG didn’t start as a competitive game. The first set of cards was designed purely for collecting, but the local children quickly turned it into something more dynamic. They began comparing stats and declaring, “My card is stronger than yours.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing this, the game’s creator decided to take it to the next level. New rules were introduced, allowing the cards to be used in actual battles. The objective isn’t to defeat the opponent’s card but to outplay it based on the characters’ skills and abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The rarity of a card isn’t based on fantasy stats — it’s tied to real-world contributions. The more actively the ojisan engages in volunteer work or community service, the higher the chances of their card being upgraded to a shiny version with a glossy laminated effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the cards — all made entirely by hand — are currently in high demand and often out of stock, they are only available for sale at the Saidosho Community Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A pack of three cards costs ¥100, while a pack of six cards — including a shiny card — costs ¥500. Despite the limited supply, demand remains high, with many kids saving their pocket money for a chance to score a shiny version of their favorite ojisan.</span></p>

<p><span>One evening</span> in March 2017, Hoan Ton-That, an Australian coder building a powerful facial recognition system, emailed his American business partners with a plan to deploy their fledgling technology. “Border patrol pitch,” the subject line read. He hoped to persuade the federal government to integrate their product with border surveillance cameras so that their newly formed company, later named Clearview AI, could use “face detection” on immigrants entering the United States.</p>



<p>An immigrant to the United States himself, Ton-That grew up in Melbourne and Canberra and claimed to be descended from Vietnamese royalty. At 19, he dropped out of college and, in 2007, moved to San Francisco to pursue a tech career. He later fell in with Silicon Valley neoreactionaries who embraced a far-right, technocratic vision of society. Now Ton-That and his partners wanted to use facial recognition to keep people out of the country. Certain people. Their technology would put that ideology into action.</p>



<p>Clearview had compiled a massive biometric database that would eventually contain <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/post/how-we-store-and-search-30-billion-faces">billions</a> of images the company scraped off the internet and social media without the knowledge of the platforms or their users. Its AI analyzed these images, creating a “faceprint” for every individual. The company let users run a “probe photo” against its database, and if it generated a hit, it displayed the matching images and links to the websites where they originated. This made it easy for Clearview users to further profile their targets with other information found on those webpages: religious or political affiliation, family and friends, romantic partners, sexuality. All without a search warrant or probable cause.</p>



<p>A diehard Donald Trump supporter, Ton-That envisioned using facial recognition to compare images of migrants crossing the border to mugshots to see if the arrivals had been previously arrested in the United States. His Border Patrol pitch also included a proposal to screen any arrival for “sentiment about the USA.” Here, Ton-That appeared to conflate support for the Republican leader with American identity, proposing to scan migrants’ social media for “posts saying ‘I hate Trump’ or ‘Trump is a puta’” and targeting anyone with an “affinity for far-left groups.” The lone example he offered was the National Council of La Raza, now called <a href="https://unidosus.org/about/">UnidosUS</a>, one of the country’s largest Hispanic civil rights organizations.</p>



<p>By the end of Trump’s first presidential term, Clearview had secured funding from right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel, one of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1103415/000091205701533855/a2059025zs-1.htm">earliest business partners</a>, and signed up hundreds of law enforcement clients around the country. The company doled out free trials to hook users, urging cops to “run wild” with searches. They did. Many departments then bought licenses to access Clearview’s faceprint database.</p>



<p>Since Clearview’s existence first came to light in 2020, the secretive company has attracted outsize controversy for its dystopian privacy implications. Corporations like Macy’s allegedly used Clearview on shoppers, according to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/in-re-clearview-ai-inc-1">legal records</a>; law enforcement has deployed it against activists and protesters; and multiple government investigations have found federal agencies’ use of the product failed to comply with privacy requirements. Many local and state law enforcement agencies now rely on Clearview as a tool in everyday policing, with almost no transparency about how they use the tech. “What Clearview does is mass surveillance, and it is illegal,” the privacy commissioner of Canada <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210203/">said</a> in 2021. In 2022, the ACLU <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/aclu-v-clearview-settlement.pdf">settled</a> a lawsuit with Clearview for allegedly violating an <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004">Illinois state law</a> that prohibits unauthorized biometric harvesting. Data protection authorities in <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2022/french-sa-fines-clearview-ai-eur-20-million_en">France</a>, <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2022/hellenic-dpa-fines-clearview-ai-20-million-euros_en">Greece</a>, <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2022/facial-recognition-italian-sa-fines-clearview-ai-eur-20-million_en">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2024/dutch-supervisory-authority-imposes-fine-clearview-because-illegal-data_en">the Netherlands</a> have also ruled that the company’s data collection practices are illegal. To date, they have fined Clearview around $100 million.</p>



<p>Clearview’s business model is based on “weaponizing our own images against us without a license, without consent, without permission,” says Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project.</p>



<p>In December, Ton-That, the face of Clearview since it was forced from the shadows, quietly stepped down as CEO and took on the role of president. In February, he abruptly resigned his new position, though he retains a board seat. When <em>Mother Jones</em> wrote Ton-That, who is now the chief technology officer at Architect Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm, with questions for this story, he replied: “There are inaccuracies and errors contained in these assertions. They do not merif [<em>sic</em>] further response.” Ton-That refused to elaborate. Clearview declined to comment.</p>



<p>Replacing him as co-CEOs were Richard Schwartz, a co-founder of the company and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/01/nyregion/schwartz-senior-giuliani-aide-is-planning-to-resign-from-post.html">former top aide</a> to Rudy Giuliani, and Hal Lambert, an early Clearview investor who runs a <a href="https://www.pointbridgecapital.com/about/">Texas financial firm</a> known for its “<a href="https://www.pointbridgecapital.com/etf/">MAGA ETF</a>”—an exchange-traded fund that screens companies for their political contributions and buys into those that vigorously back Republicans. A top Trump fundraiser who served on the president’s 2016 inaugural committee, Lambert told <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2025/02/19/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns/">Forbes</a> </em>in February that he planned to help the company pursue “opportunities” with the new administration, citing Trump’s mass-­deportation agenda and anti-immigration policies.</p>



<p>Clearview is already well positioned to capitalize on Trump’s xenophobic plans. Today, one of the company’s top <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=clearview+ai+UEI_NAME%3A%22CLEARVIEW+AI%2C+INC.%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=19&amp;y=5&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y">customers</a> is US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a relationship cemented during Joe Biden’s presidency, as the agency inked bigger deals with the startup. Under the Biden administration, <a href="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EPIC-20-03-06-ICE-FOIA-20231109-16th-Interim-Production.pdf">ICE records</a> show, the agency deployed Clearview widely, even as officials there charged with monitoring the technology were in the dark about how it was being used and by whom. As the agency executes Trump’s emboldened mission—“Border Czar” Tom Homan has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/donaldjtrumpjr/reel/DCZY-FbuT4K/?hl=en">vowed</a> to unleash “shock and awe” against undocumented immigrants—the dragnet surveillance outlined by Ton-That during the company’s earliest years may already be underway. (ICE did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>During Biden’s presidency, the trappings of oversight still existed. But Trump has fired many of the inspectors general who review the use of technology such as Clearview and guard against abuse. And Trump’s early actions have shown his administration has little regard for the legal, congressional, and constitutional guardrails that have constrained his predecessors.</p>



<p>Immigrants aren’t the only people at risk. With Trump pursuing “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6355810503112">retribution</a>” against his political enemies, Clearview offers a range of frightening applications. “It creates a really disturbingly powerful tool for police that can identify nearly every person at a protest or a reproductive health facility or a house of worship with just photos of those people’s faces,” says Cahn.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/2024-09/civil-rights-implications-of-frt_0.pdf">No federal laws</a> regulate facial recognition, and many federal agencies have deployed Clearview for years with little accountability. Consider that the FBI—now run by Kash Patel, who has <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/epochtv/kashs-corner-what-did-the-fbi-know-before-jan-6-4885960">claimed</a> FBI agents incited January 6, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thetnholler/reel/DCH5fNGSjQS/?locale">pledged</a> to target journalists, and <a href="https://www.horizonbooks.com/book/9781637588246">penned</a> a book containing the names of officials he planned to settle scores with—is another major federal customer. Patel’s new deputy director, Dan Bongino, is a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-infowars/">conspiratorial</a> right-wing influencer who has used <a href="https://x.com/dbongino/status/1796295943307788693">violent rhetoric</a> about liberals and called for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5308020/dan-bongino-trump-fbi-director-conspiracies-podcast" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5308020/dan-bongino-trump-fbi-director-conspiracies-podcast">jailing</a> Democrats. (The FBI declined to comment on its use of Clearview or on Bongino’s extremist views.)</p>



<p>I’ve reported on Clearview for years. This story, based on interviews with insiders and thousands of newly obtained emails, texts, and other records, including internal ICE communications, provides the fullest account to date of the extent of the company’s far-right origins and of the implementation of its facial recognition technology within the federal government’s immigration enforcement apparatus. It reveals how Ton-That, who obsessed over race, IQ, and hierarchy, solicited input from eugenicists and right-wing extremists while building Clearview, and how, from the outset, he and his associates discussed deploying the tech against immigrants, people of color, and the political left. All told, this new reporting paints a chilling portrait of an ideologically driven company whose powerful surveillance technology is now in the hands of the Trump administration, as it bulldozes democratic institutions and executes an authoritarian takeover.</p>

<p><span>Ton-That knows</span> better than most how a picture posted online can come back to haunt you. As Clearview took off, he was confronted with a snapshot from his past that clashed with his effort to present himself and his company as apolitical. It showed him partying on election night in 2016 with far-right activists in MAGA hats. One fellow reveler, Charles “Chuck” Johnson, a political agitator with wide-ranging connections to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/07/jd-vance-charles-johnson-texts/">Republican politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/15/what-happened-to-internet-troll-chuck-johnsons-lawsuit-against-gawker/">right-wing billionaires</a>, was also Ton-That’s business partner. Smartcheckr, the company they founded with Schwartz, would later relaunch as Clearview.</p>



<p>In early 2021, Ton-That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html">told</a> the<em> New York Times</em>’<em> </em>Kashmir Hill that his extreme views and associations were confined to a brief period in his life when he was “confused.” He offered a similar explanation a few months later when a documentary crew from <em>France 24</em> asked him about his far-right ties. “I’m not a political person,” he <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/reporters/20230602-your-face-is-ours-the-dangers-of-facial-recognition-software">said</a>. “It’s wrong to assume my political beliefs just from a photo…That was a different time in 2016, a long time ago.”</p>



<p>But Ton-That’s path to radicalization began earlier than he let on, and his extremism was no fleeting dalliance. By 2015, he was interacting online with alt-right activists, including Milo Yiannopoulos and Mike Cernovich. Deleted social media posts also show him chatting with extremists such as Andrew “weev” Auernheimer, the longtime <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/andrew-weev-auernheimer/">webmaster</a> of the<em> Daily Stormer</em>, a neo-Nazi website. (Auernheimer, who has a large <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902194133/https://dailystormer.name/what-i-learned-from-my-time-in-prison/">swastika tattoo</a> and has repeatedly called for a genocide of Jews, denied to <em>Mother Jones</em> that he holds neo-Nazi views and claimed he was no longer involved with the<em> Daily Stormer</em>. He also said he never interacted with Ton-That but declined to address evidence of their communications.)</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Pitch decks the company sent to potential investors and customers touted Clearview’s ability to surveil protesters and target people involved in “radical political or religious activities.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>By early 2016, Ton-That described himself as a lifelong libertarian who’d shifted further right over time. Along the way, he discovered the “<a href="https://www.populismstudies.org/Vocabulary/dark-enlightenment/">Dark Enlightenment</a>” neoreactionary movement, a fascist outgrowth of Silicon Valley’s radical libertarianism. He read the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050312085549/http://www.isteve.com/">Steve Sailer</a>, a longtime contributor to white nationalist publications and a proponent of “human biodiversity,” a racist pseudoscience favored by neoreactionaries. Like white nationalists, neoreactionaries reject egalitarianism and view America as weakened by feminism and diversity initiatives. But they make room within their elitist hierarchy for Jewish, Asian, and gay men—demographics, conveniently, common in Silicon Valley’s leadership class. Neoreactionaries consider themselves a high-IQ natural aristocracy and long for a corporatist strongman—a CEO monarch—to usher in what Thiel calls a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html">futuristic</a>” version of the past, one in which technocrats rule as an ennobled caste. They view technology as the engine to remake society on their terms, an ambition that Thiel has never disguised.</p>



<p>“We were going to use technology to change the whole world to overturn the monetary system,” Thiel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgH7Lv2gQdk">said</a> in 2010, explaining the impetus for PayPal, the e-payment company he co-founded with Musk. “The basic idea was that we could never win an election…because we were in such a small minority. But maybe you could actually unilaterally change the world—without having to constantly convince people and beg people and plead with people who were never going to agree with you—through a technological means.” (Thiel did not respond to questions.)</p>



<p>As Ton-That radicalized, he grew friendly with Curtis Yarvin, an intellectual muse to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets?srsltid=AfmBOorhA7uJBAdn60ck0UteM7_yRJxq6k4nmjAEWb64MAAzpxpPRspX">Thiel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/PMq1ZEcyztY">Vice President JD Vance</a>, and other prominent right-wingers. Ton-That thought Yarvin was “brilliant” and spoke often and admiringly of “Curtis,” one source told me. The godfather of neoreaction in America, Yarvin (who did not respond to questions) <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/07/olxiv-rules-for-reactionaries/">believes</a> democracy is a “dangerous, malignant form of government” and has argued for a soft coup and a purge of civil servants in favor of political loyalists. This “<a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-butterfly-revolution">butterfly revolution</a>,” as Yarvin called it in 2022, looks eerily similar to Trump and Musk’s blitzkrieg against the federal bureaucracy.</p>



<p>Neoreaction also led Ton-That to Johnson, a Thiel confidant who ran a far-right site called <em><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hate-watch/once-outlet-conspiracies-gotnewscom-now-shuttered-without-explanation/">GotNews</a></em> that published dirt on Black victims of police violence and Black Lives Matter protesters. “Am a reader of yours, like your work,” Ton-That wrote Johnson in May 2016, asking to be added to a Slack group Johnson had set up around a different project he had launched, ­WeSearchr, a crowdfunding platform that raised money for neo-Nazis and far-right causes. The Slack group was an online watering hole for a likeminded crowd, according to Peter Duke, another business partner of Johnson’s at the time who participated in the chat and who described it to <em>France 24</em> in unaired footage.</p>



<p>“When you get to a point where you understand that democracy is fake, then you have to&nbsp;think about different frameworks for the way that people are gonna be ruled,” he said. “What we all had in common when we met was that we thought that neoreactionaryism was an interesting idea…The United States of America was founded on the idea that all men are created equal. And Curtis simply asked a question, as I remember it: ‘What if they’re not? What do you do?…How do you govern that?’…That’s what we talked about all the time.” (Duke declined to answer questions.)</p>

<p>Ton-That and Johnson quickly bonded. They brainstormed “alt-tech” ideas and a few months later, in early 2017, launched Smartcheckr, Clearview’s predecessor. Ton-That also got to know Duke and other radicals associated with Johnson, including Marko Jukic, a self-described extremist Catholic traditionalist who once argued that diversity is “<a href="https://yuray1.rssing.com/chan-64766770/all_p1.html">corrosive to civilization</a>”; Tyler Bass, a white nationalist who, according to his former girlfriend, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-alt-right_n_5e7d028bc5b6cb08a92a5c48">attended</a> the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; and far-right influencer Douglass Mackey, who used a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/social-media-influencer-sentenced-election-interference-2016-presidential-race">pseudonymous</a> social media persona to disseminate Nazi propaganda and advocate for “global white supremacy.” (Jukic told <em>Mother Jones that he now considers himself a centrist and that</em> his neoreactionary writings were “exercises in theatrical hyperbole and comedic satire.” Bass did not respond to a request for comment. Mackey said he identifies today as a “moderately conservative Republican” and previously promoted white supremacy “mostly for shock and trolling.”)</p>



<p>Jukic, Bass, and Mackey would all go on to work for the facial recognition startup in some capacity. Jukic pitched Clearview to potential law enforcement customers. Bass oversaw a project with a real estate firm whose CEO was considering investing and wanted to test the tech, which the team piloted using a surveillance camera in the lobby of an apartment building to secretly harvest images of tenants and visitors. Mackey, who was later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/social-media-influencer-douglass-mackey-convicted-election-interference-2016">convicted</a> of federal election interference for trying to dupe women and people of color into voting by text, did contract work for Clearview’s predecessor firm and briefly handled outreach to political clients interested in using what company promotional material characterized as “unconventional databases” for “extreme opposition research.” In 2020, while <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-alt-right_n_5e7d028bc5b6cb08a92a5c48">reporting</a> on Clearview for <em>HuffPost</em>, I contacted the company to ask about Jukic and Bass’ roles. Clearview parted ways with both soon after.</p>



<p>Ton-That sought to recruit other extremists, too. He wrote in a November 2016 email that he wanted to “totally hire” Emil Kirkegaard, a Danish eugenicist who had scraped OkCupid and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/12/11666116/70000-okcupid-users-data-release">published</a> the data of nearly 70,000 users. Kirkegaard, who did not respond to questions, had infamously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010082010/https:/emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=3229">advocated</a> to legalize child porn and lower the age of consent to 13 or the onset of puberty.</p>



<p>Ton-That called him a “total talent.” Emails show the CEO bounced facial recognition ideas off Kirkegaard, hoping to figure out how to identify gay people, or even predict criminality, from facial features.</p>



<p>Ton-That was fascinated by eugenics and admired the field’s founder, Francis Galton, who inspired Nazi “<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/eugenics">racial hygiene</a>” programs. After digesting a <a href="https://galton.org/letters/africa-for-chinese/AfricaForTheChinese.htm">letter</a> by Galton that argued for Chinese immigrants to move to Africa and supplant the “inferior” Black race, Ton-That declared in an email that Galton was a “true prophet.” Among friends, he spoke often about IQ and race, wondering aloud about the intellectual superiority of half-Asian, half-white people like himself. He also consulted with Michigan State University physics professor <a href="https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/directory/Profiles/Person/102190">Steve Hsu</a>, a human biodiversity devotee who <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2019/05/manifold-episode-10-ron-unz-on-subprime.html">associates</a> with <a href="https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/">Holocaust deniers</a> and has spent years <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/29/wake-controversy-over-harvard-dissertation-race-and-iq-scrutiny-michigan-state">researching</a> genetic differences among populations. In a 2017 email, Ton-That thanked Hsu (who did not respond to questions) for his work to “reverse dysgenic trends.”</p>



<p>Emails from the time show Ton-That reading and sharing articles from far-right publications such as <em><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/greg-johnson/">Counter-Currents</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/vdare/">VDARE</a></em>, and <em>Unz Review</em> as he collaborated and socialized with a range of extremists and pro-Trump authoritarians. At an October 2016 <a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/bathing-in-pigs-blood-inside-the-alt-rights-pro-trump-art-show">event</a> co-organized by future Stop the Steal leader Ali Alexander, Ton-That partied with Islamophobe Laura Loomer, right-wing sting artist James O’Keefe, and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, who initiated new members into his gang as Ton-That watched. Ton-That huddled at this event with Jeff Giesea, a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/this-man-helped-build-the-trump-meme-army-and-now-he-wants-t">Thiel lieutenant</a> who helped the tech investor vet candidates for the first Trump administration. This was the far-right elite.</p>







<p>In a June 2017 email to Thiel seeking seed funding, Ton-That reported that he and his partners had landed their first facial recognition client: JPMorgan Chase. “We helped their security team vet each person attending their shareholders meeting to make sure there were no protestors,” Ton-That wrote. (JPMorgan denied using Smartcheckr.) But even as the company attempted to make inroads in the corporate world, its founders remained active in extremist circles. The same evening as the JPMorgan shareholders meeting, Johnson asked Ton-That to tackle another assignment. A technical error had fouled up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601053046/http:/www.wesearchr.com/bounties/daily-stormer-vs-splc-legal-defense-fund">campaign</a> on Johnson’s WeSearchr crowdfunding platform set up by the <em>Daily Stormer</em>’s Auernheimer to raise money for Andrew Anglin, the neo-Nazi site’s editor, who’d been <a href="https://casetext.com/case/gersh-v-anglin-3">sued</a> for waging a harassment and intimidation campaign against a Jewish woman. Ton-That seemingly fixed the problem. Auernheimer and Anglin ultimately raised more than $150,000.</p>



<p>For at least the next year, Ton-That moonlighted as tech support for Johnson’s sites, sometimes helping extremists make and move money, usually cryptocurrency. When a co-founder of Johnson’s crowdfunding venture quit and left the team without a way to access the bitcoin they’d collected, Ton-That recovered the cryptocurrency, worth more than $150,000 at the time. Underscoring how vital Ton-That was to their operation, Duke wrote in a 2018 email, “Hoan is the only resource that has complete access and understanding of WeSearchr.”</p>

<p><span>As they grew</span> their facial recognition company, Ton-That, Johnson, and Schwartz brought in investors such as Thiel and Naval Ravikant, an Indian-born technocrat who had encouraged Ton-That to move to the United States and became his first Silicon Valley mentor. Ravikant, who did not respond to questions, imagined a neofeudalist future of “<a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1084724006626840576">small free cities with drone armies and skill-based immigration policies</a>” and a “<a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1084727967916339203">one bitcoin, one vote</a>” system of government.</p>



<p>Another early backer was Hal Lambert, a former finance chair for the Texas GOP who runs Point Bridge Capital, the investment firm behind the MAGA ETF. Lambert, who served on Clearview’s board before becoming co-CEO with Schwartz, harbored his own fringe views. He claimed the George Floyd protests had turned into “<a href="https://x.com/MAGAindex/status/1266752685711253505">George Soros funded riots</a>” on social media and passed around a screed about how Floyd died from drug-induced “cardiopulmonary arrest,” rather than the knee of a cop on his neck. Like his business partners, Lambert wanted to deploy facial recognition to support a conservative agenda. In September 2017, after reading a <em><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/09/07/exclusive-kobach-out-of-state-voters-changed-outcome-new-hampshire-senate-race/">Breitbart</a></em> article that suggested out-of-state Democrats had flipped a close 2016 Senate race in New Hampshire, he emailed Johnson and Ton-That, urging them to use the tech to “identify exactly who the 5,000+ out of state fraud voters are.”</p>



<p>Conspiratorial ideas like these found traction within the company, where the founders exchanged emails indicating their belief that Democrats were cheating in other races around the country. They also appeared to buy into lies about antifascist activists spread by right-wing propagandists who conflate “antifa” with Black Lives Matter and other liberal protesters.</p>



<p>Paranoia about the “radical left” seemed to infuse their business decisions. As part of their plan to use facial recognition in apartment lobbies, they intended to scan the faces of tenants and compare them to mugshots. But Ton-That noted in an email that he also wanted to run them through “any criminal database we have (antifa)” or to see if they were “friends with criminals.” He assumed a link between leftist politics and criminality. “I think every real estate firm will sign up,” he told his co-founders. “Especially ones in diverse areas.” Schwartz, a 67-year-old New Yorker who ran Giuliani’s welfare reform program, which invasively profiled needy people and <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/reports/welfare-reform-in-new-york-city-the-measure-of-success/">deprived</a> them of assistance, loved the idea. “Quite Brilliant!” he replied. After Rudin Management, one of New York City’s largest real estate companies, signed on, the team reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/clearview-source-code-lapse/">collected</a> about 70,000 videos from a lobby surveillance camera. “We beta tested their product for a brief period at one of our buildings nearly a decade ago,” a Rudin spokesperson said. “We chose not to deploy their software at the conclusion of that pilot.”</p>



<p>During Trump’s first term, Clearview made little distinction between bad actors and people exercising their First Amendment rights. Pitch decks the company sent to potential investors and customers, including scores of local law enforcement agencies, touted Clearview’s ability to surveil protesters and target people involved in “radical political or religious activities.” A pitch deck from April 2019 showed how Clearview grouped photos in its faceprint database, including a category it called “Protesters &amp; Agitators.”</p>



<p>In July 2019, Johnson reached out to <a href="https://globalextremism.org/post/harmeet-dhillon/">right-wing</a> attorney Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump lawyer and Republican National Committee official. Dhillon was also representing Andy Ngo, a social media commentator who has made a career out of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/andy-ngo-right-wing-troll-antifa-877914/">stoking fear</a> about the “radical left” and who was preparing to <a href="https://libertycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/06042020_Ngo_Complaint_FINAL-1.pdf">sue</a> several people who he alleged assaulted him at protests in Portland, Oregon. Ngo claimed they were antifascists. Dhillon, an election truther and anti-transgender activist whom Trump <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-taps-his-lawyer-dhillon-to-lead-doj-civil-rights-division">tapped</a> to run the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wanted to hunt them down. “Richard and Hoan can give you a copy of ClearView to help identify antifa,” Johnson told her.</p>



<p>“Thank you!” replied Dhillon, who said she would “send in a batch” of photos. (She did not respond to questions.)</p>



<p>Journalists were another target. In May 2017, Bass emailed Cassandra Fairbanks, a <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a9653830/cassandra-fairbanks-donald-trump-deplorable/">far-right activist</a> whom the first Trump administration <a href="https://casetext.com/case/fairbanks-v-roller">allowed</a> into press briefings, to ask for the names and emails of reporters in the White House press pool. This would potentially enable Ton-That and his partners to surface social media accounts, pull photos, and, as Bass put it, investigate the “leanings” of the journalists. Fairbanks quickly sent the names and emails of eight reporters to Bass, who forwarded the details to Ton-That. “These shills are high-priority,” Bass wrote. “Dope this is going into smartcheckr,” Ton-That replied. The company later created a “Politicians – Academics – Journalists” category in its biometric database.</p>



<p>Smartcheckr and later Clearview shunned public attention. Clearview’s website was blank for a year. Eventually, it displayed a fake address and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191205141417/https://clearview.ai/">cryptic tagline</a>: “Artificial Intelligence for a better world.” Ton-That and Schwartz cautioned people using the tech to keep Clearview secret. They and Johnson preferred to hawk their product to their political network. They offered Clearview to <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/robert-spencer/">anti-Muslim activist</a> Robert Spencer and gave access to Sean Fieler, an anti-trans, <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/this-anti-abortion-billionaire-is-trying-to-manipulate-the-election-for-the-gop/">right-wing</a> Catholic hedge fund manager. They courted the family office of Shafik Gabr, a tycoon close to Egyptian dictator <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/08/donald-trump-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-egypt-226579/">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>, and solicited venture capital in Beijing. They approached William Je, the financial adviser to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/05/steve-bannon-isnt-on-trial-but-he-keeps-coming-up-in-a-maga-moguls-fraud-case/">Steve Bannon ally</a> Guo Wengui, who was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/miles-guo-wengui-verdict-guilty/">found guilty</a> alongside Guo last year in a sprawling <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ho-wan-kwok-aka-miles-guo-arrested-orchestrating-over-1-billion-dollar-fraud-conspiracy">$1 billion fraud case</a>.</p>



<p>While one former Clearview employee said the company tried to expand its potential customer base by courting “anyone they met,” including Democrats and progressives, the firm found few takers outside of the founders’ MAGA milieu. The Clearview team’s connections reached deep into Trump’s inner circle. They reportedly set up a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/clearview-ai-john-ratcliffe-dni-trump-facial-recognition">free account</a> for Rep. John Ratcliffe, now the CIA director. And Johnson met with Wilbur Ross, Trump’s first-term commerce secretary, and discussed facial recognition. The Clearview partners also pitched the Republican Attorneys General Association and the right-wing Club for Growth, offering its chairman what Ton-That described as “a motherlode of information that can help with oppo-research.”</p>



<p>During this stealth phase of its existence, Clearview’s most fruitful relationship was with the NYPD, thanks largely to Schwartz’s high-level connections, including to former NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, an instrumental figure in the post-9/11 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/nyregion/police-unit-that-spied-on-muslims-is-disbanded.html?smid=tw-bna">expansion</a> of police surveillance programs. Emails show that Ton-That planned a meeting with Bratton for August 2018. The NYPD began trialing Clearview shortly afterward. Although the department never signed a formal contract with Clearview, NYPD employees evangelized the tech throughout the law enforcement community.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The company emphasizes the use within human trafficking and drug trafficking, but it’s highly unlikely that they would not be actively supporting deportation.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Johnson, Ton-That, and Schwartz each owned a third of what was then still called Smartcheckr. But Johnson’s outré behavior—including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/state-of-the-union-matt-gaetz-charles-johnson">publicly denying</a> the Holocaust—had become a liability to his partners, who also contended that he wasn’t pulling his weight in their venture. In 2018, they formed a new company, Clearview, that initially excluded Johnson from ownership, according to court records. “I went from being a third owner of the company to being, like, written out of it entirely,” Johnson said in response to questions from <em>Mother Jones</em>. “And I said, ‘Well, I will just sue you guys.’” Eventually, Ton-That and Schwartz gave Johnson a 10 percent stake in the new company in exchange for his signing a November 2018 “wind-down and transfer agreement” that recognized his “good and valuable advisory services” but also required him to keep his mouth shut about his new ownership stake and prior work for the startup.</p>



<p>The narrative established by Clearview and most media coverage is that Ton-That and Schwartz excised Johnson from operations at this point. But Johnson continued to assist and advise his co-founders for nearly two more years, according to emails I obtained, connecting them with other potential investors and customers. When the Department of Defense scheduled a meeting in January 2020 for Clearview to pitch its services, the invite included Johnson. The following month, Ton-That sent his friend a proposal to compensate Johnson in Clearview stock for advisory services he provided to the company “with respect to developing, marketing and selling its technology.” In July 2020, Johnson helped Schwartz draft a letter for Rep. Matt Gaetz—a personal friend of Johnson’s—to send to top officials at the Department of Homeland Security, lobbying them to use Clearview to smoke out spies among the “400,000 Chinese nationals who enter the U.S. every year as foreign students.”</p>



<p>A February 2020 dinner in Los Angeles highlighted the company’s significance within the far-right movement. The dinner was one in a series of neoreactionary salons Johnson arranged for “young men of ability and distinction to talk about controversial or provocative topics openly, without fear of reprisal,” according to an invite he sent. Phones were to be checked at the door, unmarried women forbidden. When reached for comment, Johnson said Ton-That had attended a few of these events, including one where he met Steve Sailer, the human biodiversity writer whose articles about race and IQ Ton-That had read for years. Johnson could not remember if Ton-That had attended the Los Angeles dinner. But Sailer was the guest of honor. The next day, Sailer emailed Johnson some advice about Clearview. “One thing to look out for is cops abusing your system,” he warned, presciently. “Another thing: Hoan is a star, so the question is whether you want <em>to ruin his cover</em> and put him on TV.” (Italic Sailer’s. Reached by phone, he acknowledged knowing Clearview’s founders and then hung up.)</p>



<p>Ton-That <em>was</em> a star, at least among the far right. And he would soon be all over TV anyway, the result of a blockbuster January 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=41977c2de4-daily_update_2020_01_21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-41977c2de4-111021813"><em>Times</em> story</a> that revealed Clearview’s existence and explored the privacy-­shattering implications of the technology but did not examine its founders’ politics. While follow-up reporting, including the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-alt-right_n_5e7d028bc5b6cb08a92a5c48">article</a> I wrote for <em>HuffPost</em>, excavated Ton-That’s links to Johnson and other far-right figures, these associations didn’t stand in the way of Clearview landing its first big <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/common/jsp/LaunchWebPage.jsp?command=execute&amp;requestid=250226748&amp;version=1.5">federal contract</a>, in August 2020, with ICE.</p>



<p>But Johnson and Ton-That’s relationship finally unraveled. In October 2020, enraged by Ton-That’s comments to the media about his involvement with the company, Johnson erupted. “Effective immediately I no longer support the direction of the company nor its leadership,” he emailed Ton-That, Schwartz, and Lambert. It was a bitter parting. Johnson later sued Clearview and his former partners, who filed a still-pending counterclaim. (Lambert’s financial firm has also sued Johnson.)</p>



<p>When an irate Johnson spoke to the <em>Times</em> for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html">2021 story</a>, Ton-That and Schwartz asserted that he’d violated the secrecy clause in the “wind-down” agreement, which allowed them to buy him out of the company.

<p><span>Clearview kept</span> rolling without Johnson. The breakthrough at ICE gave the company a foothold in the federal government. It also brought Johnson and Ton-That’s original vision closer to fruition. As Johnson bombastically described their early mission on Facebook, they were “building algorithms to ID all the illegal immigrants for the deportation squads.” Now, the company had found a willing partner in ICE, which has a history of <a href="https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/396-Fourth-Amended-Complaint.pdf">racial</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/2011_05_03_DHS_Letter_re_Border_Questioning.pdf">religious</a> profiling, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/morales-v-chadbourne-1">violating constitutional rights</a>, and <a href="https://americandragnet.org/">invasive data gathering and surveillance</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2016, the agency’s employees and contractors have faced hundreds of internal investigations for misusing various databases of personal information. Department watchdogs investigated ICE employees and contractors for allegedly looking up each other and former lovers, giving information to friends and neighbors, and accessing databases in order to threaten and harass people or sell information to criminals, according to a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-database-abuse-records/">2023 <em>Wired</em> report</a>.</p>



<p>Experts believe Clearview is likely already involved in deportation. “If Clearview AI tries to scrape all social media from all around the world, and there is a picture of an immigrant to the United States, then ICE could try to find out who that person is,” says Jack Poulson of <a href="https://www.techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a>, a watchdog group. “The company emphasizes the use within human trafficking and drug trafficking, but it’s highly unlikely that they would not be actively supporting deportation.”</p>



<p>Indeed, starting in mid-2019, ICE clandest­inely­ piloted the tech through, among other units, its Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division, which arrests and deports undocumented immigrants. A <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"><em>BuzzFeed News</em> investigation</a> found that ICE agents ran more than 8,000 searches during this period.</p>



<p><a href="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EPIC-20-03-06-ICE-FOIA-20210315-Select-Production-Docs.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EPIC-20-03-06-ICE-FOIA-20210315-Select-Production-Docs.pdf">Records obtained</a> by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and shared with <em>Mother Jones</em> indicate that ICE has mainly used Clearview in its Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division, which traditionally conducts criminal probes into human trafficking and drug smuggling. But during Trump’s first term, HSI agents were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/ICE-BORTAC-sanctuary-cities.html">deeply involved</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/hsi_memo_implementing_eo_13767_and_13768_02.21.2017.pdf">in deportation actions</a> alongside ERO teams, participating in aggressive raids in sanctuary cities and <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-executes-federal-search-warrants-multiple-mississippi-locations">sometimes arresting hundreds of undocumented workers</a> in a day. Now, the <a href="https://x.com/FLHSMV/status/1886445789519434204">units are teaming up</a> <a href="https://x.com/EROMiami/status/1898118407540949454">again to round up immigrants</a>.</p>



<p>In Trump’s first term, ICE also dispatched HSI agents to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-leaked-document-reveals-details-of-federal-law-enforcement-patrolling-washington-amid-protests-154138680.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c3dlZWsuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB7EqamKw337cAIszZY-_cFcNVrAf3zz3uYGZ4GlRBW8u0YtuAeG26szRemmOuM_cqelGjRO6Kfw9NXXNgQs1fGT2JbEasZJcLtyTX6MT78VmUI18wFYRBPzVSxDagy1ML2eBhm2ugZD2MQfuZTFibxuUO_A6BpBx1rT3e9lwapB">racial justice protests</a> that erupted around the country after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

<p>The EPIC records reveal a culture of indifference at ICE about Clearview’s privacy and civil rights implications. It was a fancy toy that promised a low-cost investigative shortcut. “This can find faces in a crowd and/or it can show a photo in a crowd if you want to ID people he/she may associate with. It was amazing!” one ICE employee marveled. But Clearview spooked some people, including a Customs and Border Protection employee who emailed a colleague at ICE after learning the agency had the tool. “You guys use this?” the CBP staffer wrote. “Looks creepy as hell.” It was. An email from an ICE privacy officer noted that the agency “wants to use facial recognition to track people threatening its agents online.” Only after the <em>Times</em> broke news of Clearview’s existence, according to the records, did ICE conduct a privacy assessment that should have taken place before the agency deployed the tech.</p>



<p>The EPIC files also show that ICE supervisors had little idea how Clearview was being used and struggled to determine which units and agents had access. ERO and HSI had Clearview. But so did task force officers outside of ICE who work with federal law enforcement. More than 100 people connected to the agency were using Clearview around the world in places like Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Rome; Manila, Philippines; and Ton-That’s hometown of Canberra.</p>



<p>During the Biden administration, demand for Clearview surged within ICE. On March 25, 2022, the agency held a “Clearview expansion meeting.” Lambert has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2025/02/19/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns/">said</a> the bulk of the company’s $16 million in annual recurring revenue still comes from local law enforcement, but ICE has been Clearview’s steadiest customer, paying the facial recognition firm <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=clearview+ai+UEI_NAME%3A%22CLEARVIEW+AI%2C+INC.%22+CONTRACTING_AGENCY_NAME%3A%22U.S.+IMMIGRATION+AND+CUSTOMS+ENFORCEMENT%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=19&amp;y=5&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y">nearly $4 million</a>.</p>



<p>In general, the federal government is hungry for facial recognition. The Department of Homeland Security is experimenting with using facial biometrics to monitor migrant children “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/14/1096534/homeland-security-facial-recognition-immigration-border/">down to the infant</a>” and algorithmically predict how they will age so they can be identified if they cross the border years later. Under the Biden administration, CBP already used an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/24_0130_priv_pia-cbp-068-appendixupdate.pdf">app with facial recognition</a> to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/16/1074039/border-wall-app/">screen</a> <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/7985/2024/en/">asylum seekers</a> trying to enter the country; like <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf">most similar technology</a>, the app has shown a bias against darker-skinned people, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/08/us-immigration-cbp-one-app-facial-recognition-bias">blocking Black applicants </a>from filing claims.</p>



<p>Between April 2018 and March 2022, Clearview was used by more federal law enforcement agencies than any other privately owned facial recognition system, according to <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-518.pdf">US Government Accountability Office</a> <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105607.pdf">reports</a> and public reporting. It was deployed by agencies including CBP; the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Even the US Postal Inspection Service used Clearview, targeting Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020. Many of the agencies failed to comply with privacy requirements. Some told the GAO they didn’t use Clearview, only to be <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/gao-facial-recognition-report-clearview-federal-agencies">caught later by <em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, which cross-referenced the report with a leaked list of federal agencies whose employees had run searches.</p>



<p>Hundreds, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table">if not thousands</a>, of local law enforcement departments have also embraced Clearview with even looser oversight. Clearview’s <a href="https://staticfiles.clearview.ai/code_of_conduct.html">user code of conduct</a> states that its search results are “not intended nor permitted to be used as admissible evidence in a court of law or any court filing.” But cops have used the search results, and nothing else, to secure warrants, rather than as leads to support further investigation. This practice has led to <a href="https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/01/54.-First-Amended-Complaint.pdf">wrongful</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/06/business/facial-recognition-false-arrest.html">arrests</a> and risks putting every American, not just every immigrant, in a permanent police lineup.</p>



<p>With Congress failing to act on facial recognition, a handful of state laws that protect residents’ biometric information have been the only tool to hold Clearview accountable. Notably, in 2020, the ACLU sued Clearview in Illinois, which led to a 2022 settlement banning the company from making its faceprint database available to most businesses and other private entities nationwide. Another lawsuit, now in California’s courts, was brought by immigrants and racial justice activists who accuse the company of “illegally acquiring, storing, and selling their likenesses, and the likenesses of millions of Californians, in its quest to create a cyber surveillance state.”</p>



<p>“They are making money off our privacy, our own spaces, our biometrics,” says Reyna Maldonado, a DACA recipient who owns a Mexican restaurant in Oakland and is a plaintiff in the suit.</p>



<p>An immigrant rights activist since her teens, Maldonado has publicly protested ICE. But she and the other plaintiffs allege in their suit that Clearview’s chilling effect has already undermined their free speech. “I’m a lot more careful about what I share. I feel like I can’t be fully open about my community organizing work,” Maldonado says. “People think this is only an immigrant struggle and it’s only going to affect those who are undocumented. The reality is they have even more information on people who are citizens.”</p>



<p>Sejal Zota, co-founder and legal director of <a href="https://www.justfutureslaw.org/">Just Futures Law</a>, a civil rights group that helped bring the suit, predicts facial recognition will be used even more widely during Trump’s second term. “We expect to see [it] extend from Trump’s alleged targets—immigrants—to the general public.”</p>

<p><span>In March 2024,</span> the US Commission on Civil Rights <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/meetings/2024/03-08-civil-rights-implications-federal-use-facial-recognition-technology">convened experts</a> at its headquarters near the White House to discuss the dangers of facial recognition. While immigrants were most at risk, privacy advocates told the commission, they were just the initial target. “[They] are canaries in the coal mines on civil liberties because they are positioned as test cases for policies that roll back all of our shared liberties,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnCEGHlmNt4">explained</a> Laura MacCleery, a senior policy director at UnidosUS, the same civil rights organization Ton-That mentioned in his 2017 Border Patrol pitch. Something had to be done, the privacy advocates agreed, before it was too late. But it was already awfully late. Facial recognition technology was thoroughly embedded in the nation’s surveillance infrastructure.</p>



<p>Sitting placidly at the panelists’ table, his long black hair spilling to the shoulders of his gray suit jacket, was one of the people most responsible for that outcome.</p>



<p>“As a person of mixed race,” Ton-That <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLsFuHMjkcE&amp;t=4s">told</a> the commission, “it is especially important to me that this technology is deployed in a way that protects and enhances civil rights.”</p>



<p>Information about Clearview’s ties to extremists was already public, but Ton-That faced not a single question about his background. Nor was he asked how, as a <a href="https://clearviewclassaction.com/Content/Documents/First%20Amended%20Consolidated%20Class%20Action%20Complaint.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> against the company alleged, violating Illinois law by collecting the “biometric identifiers and biometric information” of citizens without informing them was compatible with civil rights. In September, the commission issued a <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/2024-09/civil-rights-implications-of-frt_0.pdf">194-page report</a> that failed to mention Clearview’s radical associations.</p>



<p>The report did acknowledge, however, one of the achievements that Ton-That has trumpeted the most, including before the commission. Clearview, he said, had “played an essential role” in helping investigate the violent insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an incident he described elsewhere as “tragic and appalling.” The attack had proved an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/facial-recognition-clearview-capitol.html">enormous publicity boon</a> for Clearview—and an opportunity to scrub the far-right taint from its image. In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2022/04/27/path-forward-facial-recognition-technology-with-hoan-ton-that/">media</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html">interviews</a>, Ton-That touted Clearview’s ability to track down MAGA criminals. The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231231004019/https://www.clearview.ai/capitol-riots">published a case study</a> on its website highlighting its role in the “arrest of hundreds of rioters in a short amount of time.”</p>



<p>The boasts struck a discordant note. The politics of Clearview’s founders aligned more closely with those of the rioters. Almost a year after the insurrection, Peter Duke, the founders’ neoreactionary ally, hosted Stop the Steal ringleader Ali Alexander on his podcast to push a conspiracy theory that the attack was a false flag operation by undercover FBI agents. Duke, who was in Washington on January 6, had photographed dozens of rioters at the Capitol who he suspected were federal provocateurs. “They’re not in the Clearview database,” he told Alexander. “I’ve checked.” Duke, who has said he once worked for Clearview as a consultant, took their absence as a sign of a coverup. He later repeated this claim on camera to <em>France 24</em>, explaining that he had friends at Clearview “run the faces.”</p>



<p>It was a startling admission. Clearview’s code of conduct prohibits use of the tech for “personal purposes.” But here was Duke talking about running off-the-books searches in an effort to whitewash an attack on American democracy.</p>



<p>“All of the evidence we have is that [Clearview] is a corporation that cares not at all about civil rights and that their founders have a potentially ideological agenda inconsistent with democracy,” says Emily Tucker, executive director of <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/">Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology</a>. “None of that has seemed to slow down their ability to get government contracts in the US or abroad.”</p>



<p>Nobody in a position to hold the company accountable seemed to care about its far-right DNA—and few wanted to consider that the threat to privacy and democracy might not be an unfortunate by-product of the tech, but rather a feature. Tucker said her organization discussed Clearview’s extremist ties with several Biden administration officials, as well as congressional staffers, and she was surprised and concerned by the lack of follow-up. Most media coverage of the company left the issue unmentioned or, worse, downplayed what was known—one interviewer for the financial magazine <em>Inc.</em> <a href="https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/clearview-ais-founder-on-companys-controversial-beginnings-massive-growth-since.html">described</a> the extremists at Clearview as “rogue employees” who had “infiltrated the company.”</p>



<p>In America, the debate about tech harms proceeds from the flawed assumption that tech is neutral. It’s the Silicon Valley version of “guns don’t kill people,” and it obscures the truth in a similar way. This smokescreen allows social media oligarchs to pose as impartial platform owners while their <a href="https://x.com/BuckeyeGirrl/status/1831815291694936317">algorithms</a> <a href="https://x.com/GaSecofState/status/1852159394382786789">spread</a> <a href="https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1832855157341884780">lies</a> about Haitian immigrants, or an AI overlord to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891112681538523215">claim his tech is unbiased</a> even as it <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/elon-musks-grok-spreads-false-election-information">amplifies</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/a9fd8c2b-68bf-4965-933e-a0b337322d92.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">election misinformation</a>. Technology doesn’t exist in a political vacuum—indeed, it can be an ideological tool. A designer can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02079-x">imbue</a> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2413-4155/6/1/3">bias</a> into their creation.</p>



<p>Today, there is no longer a need for Clearview to pretend to be apolitical. Lambert, the company’s new co-CEO, is <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=Umbra&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y">already in busines</a>s with both Elon Musk’s SpaceX and the Department of Defense through a separate satellite company, and he has made no secret of his desire to deploy Clearview as an instrument of MAGA rule. “Under the Trump administration, we would hope to grow more than we were able to under the Biden administration,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2025/02/19/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns/">he told <em>Forbes</em></a>. “We’re talking to the [Pentagon], we’re talking to Homeland Security. There are a number of different agencies we’re in active dialogue with.”</p>



<p>In the emails I obtained, Lambert expressed a desire to “take down these lefties” and railed against the “communist academia left.” Unlike his predecessor, who at least paid lip service to the rule of law after January 6, Lambert helped to gin up unscientific and inaccurate analyses of voter data that Republicans used to back <a href="https://casetext.com/case/bowyer-v-ducey">false claims</a> <a href="https://electioncases.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Wood-v-Raffensperger-11th-Cir-Doc40.pdf">of voter fraud</a> after the 2020 election.</p>



<p>Even before the leadership shakeup became public, it was evident to the careful observer that changes were afoot at Clearview in anticipation of the new administration. Days before Trump was again sworn in as president, vowing to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/">pardon the insurrectionists</a> who attacked the Capitol in his name, the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250118115524/https://www.clearview.ai/">updated its website</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250107035607/https://www.clearview.ai/">Deleted were any references</a> to its role in identifying the far-right marauders who had laid siege to democracy.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="lua">Lua</h3>
<p>While extensive, Luarocks carries with it around 20 years of baggage,
which makes it difficult to make suitable for modern Lua development, while
retaining backward compatibility.</p>
<p>With Lux, we’re pushing for a fresh start:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A notion of a project:</strong>
<ul>
<li>With TOML as the main manifest format, you can easily add, remove, pin
and update dependencies using the CLI.</li>
<li>If you’re in a project directory (with a <code>lux.toml</code>), commands like <code>build</code>
will build your project, and install it into a project-local tree.</li>
<li>Building will produce a lockfile of your project’s dependencies,
allowing you to reproduce your exact dependencies on any compatible system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enforced SemVer:</strong>
Luarocks allows for arbitrary versions after the patch version.
For example, <code>1.0.1.0.0.0.2</code> is considered valid by Luarocks, but it has no
useful meaning.
Lux will parse this too, but will treat everything after the patch
version as a prerelease version.
We made this decision because we want to encourage package maintainers
to stick to <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> for their releases.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel builds:</strong>
Inspired by the Nix store, Lux hashes<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> install directories to prevent
package conflicts and enable highly parallel builds without risking file system corruption.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="neovim">Neovim</h3>
<p>Thanks to our Neovim plugin manager, <a href="https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim"><code>rocks.nvim</code></a>,
and the later addition of Luarocks support to <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim"><code>lazy.nvim</code></a>,
Luarocks has been steadily gaining popularity in the Neovim space as a way of distributing
plugins.
But it’s been heavily held back by not being fully portable and by being unpredictable
from system to system.
Because Luarocks is written in Lua, installing a large number of packages
and synchronising plugins with <code>rocks.nvim</code> has been painfully slow.</p>
<p>With Lux, we hope that plugins will start treating themselves as Lua projects.
Using Lux is non-destructive and doesn’t interfere with the current way of
distributing Neovim plugins (which is via git).</p>
<p>In fact, Lux has a <code>--nvim</code> flag, which tells it to install packages into a tree
structure that is compatible with Neovim’s <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#packages"><code>:h packages</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>If a Neovim plugin exists as a Luarocks package, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs"><code>nixpkgs</code></a>
will use it as the source of truth.
This is mainly because with a proper package manager, the responsibility of declaring dependencies
is the responsibility of the package author.
However, Luarocks has very basic lockfile support, which does not include source hashes.
While Luarocks (as does Lux) supports conflicting dependencies
via its <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/hisham/luarocks-loader"><code>luarocks.loader</code></a>,
nixpkgs cannot reasonably add multiple versions of the same dependency to its package set.
Lux’s <a href="https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lux/blob/5d2bee87a99afb6e532421d381d1b4986b855d56/lux-lib/resources/test/sample-project-lockfile-missing-deps/lux.lock"><code>lux.lock</code></a>,
stores source and rockspec hashes of each dependency.
If the source URL is a git repository, lux will store a <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.26/store/file-system-object/content-address#serial-nix-archive">NAR hash</a>.
This means the a <code>lux.lock</code> can be used to create a <a href="https://bmcgee.ie/posts/2023/02/nix-what-are-fixed-output-derivations-and-why-use-them/"><code>fixed-output derivation</code></a>
with all dependencies, just as you can do with a <code>Cargo.lock</code>.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Right now, our priorities are set on squashing bugs and improving error messages.
Soon, we’ll be rewriting <code>rocks.nvim</code> to use Lux instead of Luarocks under the hood.
This should let rocks.nvim catch up with other plugin managers in terms of speed
and make it endlessly more stable than before.
If the rewrite is successful, then that spells great news for the Neovim ecosystem
going forward, as it means that Lux can be embedded in other places too
(e.g.&nbsp;lazy.nvim, which has had troubles with luarocks in the past)!</p>

  <h2>For decades, software reuse was only a lofty goal. Now it's very real.</h2> 
  <h3>Russ Cox</h3> 
  <p>In March 1972, the United States Air Force started a review of a Honeywell Multics system to understand whether it could be used in secure environments. The report was issued in mid-1974 and concluded that Multics, while not secure, was better than its peers and might be a reasonable starting point for a secure system.<sup>23</sup> The report raised the potential of adding a backdoor (it was called a "trap door") to an innocent system call. When passed a specific, very unlikely input, the system call allowed reading or writing an arbitrary word of kernel memory. That tiny change would completely undermine the security of the system, and the report investigated the mechanics of how such a change might be made and hidden.</p> 
  <p>In March 2024, Andres Freund, a Postgres developer working at Microsoft, noticed that his Debian Linux system's ssh daemon was taking more CPU than normal to handle the Internet's usual background attack traffic that was trying to brute force logins into his machine. Upon closer investigation, Freund discovered that the latest version of liblzma, a compression library linked into ssh on Debian systems, contained a backdoor that targeted ssh specifically.<sup>19</sup> Now, when passed a specific, very unlikely input, the ssh daemon would allow an attacker on the Internet to execute an arbitrary shell command. This tiny change completely undermined the security of bleeding-edge Debian systems, and for the next few weeks, security researchers all over the world investigated the mechanics of how the change was made and hidden. Because liblzma was distributed as part of the xz project, this attack is now widely known as the xz attack.</p> 
  <p>The contours of the problems in software supply chain security have not changed in half a century because they are fundamental. There are no easy answers in computer security; software supply chain security is no exception. The best we can aim to do is keep improving our defenses, and many promising reinforcements are not yet universally deployed. This article aims to highlight promising approaches that should be more widely used as well as point out areas where more work is needed.</p> 
  <p>I led the development of the Go programming language and environment<sup>15</sup> for more than a decade, and software supply chain security is one of the specific focuses of that effort. This article is informed by that work and draws some examples from my personal experience, in addition to examples drawn from across the software industry.</p> 
   
  <h3>Exploring the Problem</h3> 
  <p>Open source software supply chain security is a hot topic, especially after the xz attack, but what exactly does it mean? In the absence of an agreed-upon definition, I suggest this one, in three parts:</p> 
  <p>1. An open source software supply chain<i> attack</i> is the insertion of nefarious open source code into trusted software before delivery. (This definition adapts one by Kim Zetter.<sup>35</sup>)</p> 
  <p>2. An open source software supply chain<i> vulnerability</i> is an exploitable weakness in trusted software caused by a third-party, open source component of that software.</p> 
  <p>3. Open source software supply chain<i> security</i> is the engineering of defenses against open source software supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities.</p> 
   
  <p>There are a few important nuances to this definition.</p> 
  <p>The first is that the hardware supply chain is not of concern here. For example, <i>Der Spiegel</i> reported in 2013 that the U.S. NSA (National Security Agency) can intercept a new computer ordered by a target and install backdoored software or hardware components into it.<sup>1</sup> That kind of physical attack is beyond the scope of this discussion of the software supply chain, although it may still be important to consider and defend against in certain contexts.</p> 
  <p>A second nuance is that closed source software components are not of concern. For example, in 2012, attackers broke into Juniper Networks and changed the VPN (virtual private network) source code, replacing some critical constants in a random number generator. The effect was to create a backdoor that made it possible for the attackers to decrypt all VPN traffic that Juniper's customers sent through those devices.<sup>8</sup> This is a software supply chain attack because it changed the software before its delivery to Juniper's customers. But it is not an open source software supply chain attack, because the nefarious change was not made in one of the open source components used in Jupiter's VPN. (The random-number generator was easily backdoored in the first place thanks to the NSA mounting what might be considered an algorithmic supply chain attack.<sup>6</sup>)</p> 
  <p>As another example, developers in China often look for copies of Xcode on file-sharing sites hosted in China, which are faster to download. In 2015, security researchers discovered that attackers had posted a modified copy of Xcode and worked to make it the top Chinese-language search result for "Xcode download." This version, which researchers named XcodeGhost, had been nefariously altered to add malicious code to every iOS app it built. It was downloaded and used by many app developers, and the injected malware made it into at least two widely used apps.<sup>34</sup> This is a software supply chain attack on the distribution mechanism rather than the original software, but, once again, it is not targeting open source software.</p> 
  <p>A third nuance is that the affected software does not itself need to be open source. For example, in 2021 security researchers discovered that the open source Java logging library Log4j would download and execute Java code from arbitrary URLs when logging text with a certain format.<sup>33</sup> Log4j is widely used in the Java ecosystem. As one example among millions of affected programs, in the popular game Minecraft, simply sending a chat message was sufficient to achieve remote code execution on the game server. Minecraft is, therefore, an example of a closed source program affected by an open source software supply chain vulnerability. Since almost all closed source programs use open source components,<sup>2</sup> they all depend on good open source software supply chain security.</p> 
  <p>A final nuance is that attacks that involve code written with nefarious intent are distinguished from vulnerabilities that involve innocent bugs. For example, in 2021 Apple fixed a bug that allowed so-called zero-click takeovers of an iPhone device by sending an iMessage with a specially crafted image attachment. The attachment identified itself as a GIF but was actually a PDF containing a JBIG2 image. Apple's software used the open source Xpdf JBIG2 decoder, written in C, and that decoder did not properly validate the encoded Huffman trees in the image; this made it possible to trigger bitwise operations on memory at attacker-controlled offsets beyond an allocated region. The attackers implemented an entire virtual CPU out of these bitwise operations and then implemented code in that virtual instruction set to scan process memory, break out of the iMessage sandbox, and take over the phone.<sup>4</sup> The JBIG2 bug was only accidentally (not nefariously) introduced, so it is an open source software supply chain vulnerability, not an attack. Vulnerabilities and attacks are distinct problems with distinct potential solutions.</p> 
  <p>As another example, in 2018 researchers discovered that the npm package event-stream contained obfuscated code that harvested bitcoin wallets when linked into the Copay mobile app.<sup>21</sup> The nefarious code explicitly targeted Copay, making that app an example of a closed source program affected by an open source software supply chain attack.</p> 
  <p>Although the last two examples ultimately impacted closed source applications, attacks on purely open source software stacks are also possible. The xz attack did exactly this, attacking OpenSSH through a component of its software supply chain—liblzma—instead of a direct attack on the OpenSSH source code or project itself. Even a purely open source attack can be devastating: If a few more months had passed before its discovery, the backdoored sshd (Secure Shell daemon) would have been deployed in sensitive contexts worldwide.</p> 
  <p>Although there is no silver bullet, the remainder of this article highlights the general themes for engineering better defenses as well as practical steps being taken today.</p> 
   
  <h3>Understand the Software Supply Chain</h3> 
  <p>To secure your software supply chain, you first have to understand what it is. Let's start with the definition: The <i>software supply chain</i> is all the places where a software supply chain attack might happen or vulnerability might be introduced. The more important meaning of <i>understand</i>, however, is knowing what your specific software supply chain looks like, and that turns out to be quite difficult. The word <i>chain</i> sounds simple, but a supply chain is like a fractal: complex no matter how closely you look at it.</p> 
  <p>At the lowest level, you can look at the commands executed to build a single program and the dependencies between those commands. These build graphs align with the package dependency structure of the program itself. Even for simple programs, these graphs are so complex as to be unprintable. The Go project makes it a priority to avoid unnecessary dependencies and keep software simple,<sup>15</sup> and yet, as I write this article, building the <code>go</code> command executes 714 commands to build 297 packages, with 3,132 dependency edges in its package graph. The <code>go</code> command is unusual in that it has no external dependencies: All the packages it uses are part of the Go project itself. Looking at a slightly more complex command, Kubernetes's kubelet executes 3,289 commands in its build and depends on 1,581 packages from 137 Go modules, including many from outside the Kubernetes project. Both these examples are fairly small, low-level utilities. Higher-level programs have even more complex builds. In <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3723000">another article in this issue of <i>acmqueue</i></a>, Josie Anugerah and Eve Martin-Jones examine the complexity of open source build graphs in more detail, along with the surprise that most programs have many possible build graphs, depending on the exact context in which they are built.</p> 
  <p>It is tempting to think these kinds of dependency graphs are the entire software supply chain, but they are only the most visible part. Each package or module in the dependency graph may be written by a different person or organization, with different security practices, code review standards, and so on. It would be helpful to know more about these details for every dependency you take on, but in general, this information is unavailable and can change over time.</p> 
  <p>Another kind of graph shows the computers and services that software passes through during a build and during distribution to users. A nefarious alteration could be made in any one of these computers or services, making each one a different potential attack site, not to mention a potential source of vulnerabilities. You should be concerned with who has access to each dependency project, who might have access in the future, what infrastructure they use, and so on. For the most part, without visibility into any of that, it goes ignored. But it's all still there.</p> 
  <p>Understanding the software supply chain is critical to identifying which links need to be reinforced. As an industry, we have much more work to do here, but for this article, let's move on to specific reinforcements already known to help.</p> 
   
  <h3>Authenticate Software</h3> 
  <p>The Multics review contemplated inserting backdoors "during the distribution phase," taking advantage of "insecure telecommunications" as well as sending out nefarious updates "using forged stationery." The wording may be outdated, but the ideas are not. XcodeGhost is a modern example of exactly that approach. Fixing this problem is the nearest thing to a true success story in modern software supply chain security. Cryptographic signatures make it impossible to nefariously alter code between signing and verifying. The only problem left is key distribution: The verifier has to know who should have signed the code.</p> 
  <p>There are many possible answers to the key distribution problem. The simplest one is to ignore questions of identity and simply record and distribute the expected cryptographic hash of the specific dependency versions being used in a given build or package manager. Verification of these predistributed hashes completely removes download servers, proxies, and other network middleboxes as potential attack sites. Debian's system for packaging dependencies includes such a check, which meant the xz attacker could not simply modify an existing copy of xz; they needed to release a new version. That didn't prevent the attack, but it did make the attack harder.</p> 
  <p>On a larger scale, instead of predistributing all these hashes, they can be maintained in a trusted database. The Go checksum database<sup>16</sup> is a real-world example of this approach that protects millions of Go developers. The database holds the SHA256 checksum of every version of every public Go module. Each database entry is signed by the database server's private key. The corresponding public key is hard-coded in the Go command source code, so key distribution piggybacks on the rest of the Go distribution. </p> 
  <p>Every time the <code>go</code> command downloads a new open source Go package, it looks up the expected checksum. There is a local checksum cache for dependencies in a given project, so network calls to the checksum server happen only for upgrades or adding new dependencies, but one way or another, every download is checked. This means all the proxies and other boxes between code hosting and a user's computer cannot be attack sites. Even an attack on the code hosting site cannot change old packages.</p> 
  <p>There is, of course, the question of what checksum to put into the database. For Go, if the database hasn't recorded a specific package version yet, it fetches the code directly and stores the checksum for the code it gets. This "trust on first use" approach doesn't mean the code is trustworthy, but it does mean that the code can't change if anyone else downloads it on a different computer tomorrow. This immutability ensures that the entire Go ecosystem agrees on the meaning of Kubernetes version 1.28.4, which serves as a foundation for any other analysis work.</p> 
  <p>To the extent that questions of identity can be solved, having authors sign their software can provide even stronger guarantees. In the case of xz, distribution packages were signed using the individual author's GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) keys, making it possible to distinguish the packages signed by the original (trustworthy) maintainer of xz and the ones signed by the attacker who had taken control of the project.</p> 
   
  <h3>Make Builds Reproducible</h3> 
  <p>The Multics review noted that a nefarious change might "best be hidden in changes to the binary code of a compiled routine," leaving the corresponding source code unmodified. Such a change would persist only until a rebuild from source code, but most installations would not rebuild source code without reason. This remains a concern today. For example, the critical lines of code that triggered the xz attack during its build were included only in the packaged distribution, not in the actual source control repository.<sup>14</sup></p> 
  <p>The best and most obvious way to verify that binaries have not been modified is to rebuild them and check the result against the distributed binaries, but that assumes builds are reproducible. Since computers are deterministic, it sounds like this should be trivial, but it is far too easy for contextual information like the build machine architecture or machine name, the names of temporary directories, or the current time to end up in some build output, making the overall build nonreproducible. The Reproducible Builds<sup>31</sup> project aims to raise awareness of reproducible builds generally, as well as building tools to help make progress toward complete reproducibility for all Linux software.</p> 
  <p>The Go project recently arranged for Go itself to be completely reproducible given only the source code, meaning that although a build needs some computer running some operating system and some earlier Go toolchain, none of those choices matters. A build for a given target produces the same distribution bits whether you build on Linux or Windows or Mac, whether the build host is X86 or ARM, and so on. Strong reproducibility makes it possible for others to easily verify that the binaries that are posted for download match the source code. Those binaries are also logged in the Go checksum database and verified when the <code>go</code> command downloads a new toolchain, so that downloads can't be modified in transit.<sup>10</sup></p> 
  <p>Authenticating software and making builds reproducible remove potential attack vectors, although certainly not all. Let's turn our focus now to vulnerabilities.</p> 
   
  <h3>Find and Fix Vulnerabilities Quickly</h3> 
  <p>Fifty years ago, there was some hope that software could be made completely secure by correct design and careful implementation. We know better now. Accepting that software will always have vulnerabilities, we must be ready to find and fix those vulnerabilities as quickly as possible when they arise.</p> 
  <p>Since attackers are looking for those vulnerabilities too, the best defense is to find and fix them first. The most trivial example is an out-of-date dependency with a known vulnerability. There are many available vulnerability scanning tools that can identify this situation, whether language-specific tools like govulncheck and npm audit, general open source tools like osv-scanner,<sup>30</sup> or commercial tools. All of them work by cross-checking a list of the software inputs to a build—the <i>software bill of materials</i>—against a database of known vulnerabilities. </p> 
  <p>The specific choice of tool or database is not as important as it used to be. The open source software community has standardized on the OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) format<sup>7</sup> for individual vulnerability descriptions, including a precise, algorithmic description of the affected packages and versions. The OSV database<sup>29</sup> then aggregates all the language-specific databases. The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database's JSON 5.0 schema also adopted OSV's precise information about affected packages and versions, enabling interchange between OSV and CVE. It benefits everyone for all tools to have access to the same, complete information about known vulnerabilities.</p> 
  <p>It is important to scan your software regularly, ideally daily, because even if your software is not changing, new entries are always being added to the database. And then you need to be ready to update to a fixed version of that dependency. This requires having comprehensive testing to make sure that the fixed version does not introduce any new bugs, as well as having automated deployment, so that a patched version of your software can go out in hours or days, not weeks or months. </p> 
  <p>Testing and deployment are standard software engineering concerns, not specifically about supply chain security, but without them, your security posture suffers, as can your legal exposure. When the Log4j vulnerability was discovered in 2021, it took most companies weeks or months (or more) to inventory all their software to determine what was affected and then update and redeploy that software. Even the U.S. FTC (Federal Trade Commission) issued a statement warning companies to update Log4j to "reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers, and to avoid FTC legal action,"<sup>18</sup> pointing to Equifax's previous liability for an intrusion enabled by unpatched software.<sup>17</sup></p> 
  <p>Scanning for known vulnerabilities is the bare minimum. Effort should ideally also be spent looking for as-yet-unknown vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies. When you run security audits of your own source code, it is often worthwhile to identify critical open source dependencies and audit them too. Running bug-finding analysis tools or fuzzers on your software and its dependencies can also be effective. Attackers are going to use all these methods; you might as well use them first.</p> 
   
  <h3>Prevent Vulnerabilities</h3> 
  <p>Even if software will always have vulnerabilities, there are steps you can take to prevent certain kinds or to make them less likely.</p> 
  <p>To start, omit needless dependencies. Gordon Bell once observed that "[t]he cheapest, fastest and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there."<sup>5</sup> The most secure software dependencies are the ones not used in the first place: Every dependency adds risk. </p> 
  <p>The OpenSSH project is careful about not taking on unnecessary dependencies, but Debian was not as careful. That distribution patched sshd to link against libsystemd, which in turn linked against a variety of compression packages, including xz's liblzma. Debian's relaxing of sshd's dependency posture was a key enabler for the attack, as well as the reason its impact was limited to Debian-based systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, avoiding other distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, and NixOS. Weeks before the xz attack was deployed, system developers had been discussing removal of the dependency on compressors such as liblzma, specifically to improve security. It is pure speculation, but those discussions may have accelerated the timeline for launching the attack.<sup>3</sup></p> 
  <p>The same lesson applies to all projects, large and small. If it is possible to get by without a dependency, that's usually best. If not, small dependencies are better than large ones, and the number of transitive dependencies matters. Look not only at the one dependency being added but also at its impact on the overall dependency graph, using tools like Open Source Insights.<sup>27</sup></p> 
  <p>Another good way to prevent vulnerabilities is to use safer programming languages that remove error-prone language features or make them needed less often. In 2022, the NSA released a recommendation on "Software Memory Safety" encouraging the use of memory-safe languages such as C#, Go, Java, or Rust instead of C and C++.<sup>26</sup> Among the many strikes against C and C++, manual memory management and the lack of any kind of bounds checking simply make programs too easy to get wrong in a way that creates a security vulnerability. Their reliance on "undefined behavior" adds another level of danger.<sup>9</sup> Of course, there is a substantial amount of C and C++ code in the world, and those programs cannot be abandoned overnight. For new efforts, however, adopting a safer language has significant security benefits.</p> 
   
  <h3>Fund Open Source</h3> 
  <p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">A famous xkcd comic from 2020</a> depicts "all modern digital infrastructure" built atop "a project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003."<sup>25</sup> The comic remains a disturbingly accurate assessment of the situation.</p> 
  <p>In 2014, researchers discovered that OpenSSL, a library widely used by Internet HTTPS servers, would respond to a specific kind of malformed packet by sending back arbitrary chunks of server memory. In some cases, that memory included the server's secret-key material. This was not an attack, but instead, an innocent coding mistake. (OpenSSL is written in C, so this mistake was incredibly easy to make and miss; in a memory-safe language with proper bounds checking, it would have been nearly impossible.) </p> 
  <p>The vulnerability was named Heartbleed and prompted a reckoning across the industry about exactly the situation described in the xkcd comic. At the time, OpenSSL was maintained by a handful of volunteers, with only one full-time developer. Researchers estimated that a security audit costing on the order of $100,000 would have caught the mistake, but the project received only $2,000 in annual donations, despite billions of dollars of commerce relying on the software each year. One outcome of this reckoning was the creation and funding of the Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative, which evolved into the Open Source Security Foundation, or OpenSSF.<sup>28</sup> </p> 
  <p>OpenSSF is an important step forward, but it has not solved the problem of modern digital infrastructure depending on critical underfunded projects. More work is needed.</p> 
  <p>The xz attack is the clearest possible demonstration that the problem is not fixed. It was enabled as much by underfunding of open source as by any technical detail. Here's the story of the xz attack.</p> 
  <p>Lasse Collin started the xz project in 2005, using the LZMA compression algorithm, which compressed files to about 70 percent of what gzip did. Over time, this format became widely used for compressing tar files, Linux kernel images, and many other uses. For the most part, the software was stable and did not need significant ongoing attention. Collin was not paid for it, and it was not his full-time job. </p> 
  <p>In late 2021, an attacker using the (almost certainly not real) name "Jia Tan" started sending innocuous patches with small improvements to the xz development mailing list.<sup>22</sup> In mid-2022, the attacker started posting using other accounts and names on the mailing list, complaining about the slow pace of releases and new features, and pressuring Collin to cede control to someone with more time. They wrote things like, "The current maintainer lost interest or doesn't care to maintain anymore. It is sad to see for a repo like this." Also, "I get that this is a hobby project for all contributors, but the community desires more. Why not pass on maintainership...?" </p> 
  <p>The pressure campaign worked. Over the next year and a half, Collin turned over more and more development responsibility to the attacker, who built trust by making honest improvements and doing important maintenance work. In early 2023, the attacker built their first official xz release; as 2023 went on, they laid the technical groundwork for the actual attack, ultimately launched in early 2024.<sup>13</sup> </p> 
  <p>In the months after the attack was discovered, most speculation focused on the likelihood that the xz attack was carried out by nation-state hackers,<sup>22</sup> with no confirmation one way or the other. No matter who was responsible, it likely did not cost much. A competent software engineer working full-time on an open source project for two years to gain the trust of its maintainer probably costs less than a million dollars. The development of the exploit code itself, which was quite sophisticated, might cost another million dollars or so. A hidden backdoor into the vast majority of Linux ssh servers on the Internet would be worth many times more than that, possibly billions of dollars. The general underfunding of open source projects makes them directly susceptible to this kind of honest-seeming free help.</p> 
  <p>The social engineering of the xz attack is also not an isolated incident. In the event-stream attack mentioned earlier, the attacker simply asked whether the original author wanted someone to take over maintenance. In the aftermath of the xz attack, the OpenSSF and the OpenJS Foundation issued a warning about a similar campaign that had been unsuccessfully carried out against OpenJS.<sup>20</sup></p> 
  <p>It is far from obvious how best to fund open source development. More than a decade after Heartbleed and the launch of the Core Infrastructure Initiative, the problem clearly remains unsolved. </p> 
   
  <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
  <p>We are all struggling with a massive shift that has happened in the past 10 or 20 years in the software industry. For decades, software reuse was only a lofty goal. Now it's very real.<sup>12</sup> Modern programming environments such as Go, Node, and Rust have made it trivial to reuse work by others, but our instincts about responsible behaviors have not yet adapted to this new reality.</p> 
  <p>The fact that the 1974 Multics review anticipated many of the problems we face today is evidence that these problems are fundamental and have no easy answers. We must work to make continuous improvements to open source software supply chain security, making attacks more and more difficult and expensive. </p> 
  <p>There are important steps we can take today, such as adopting software signatures in some form, making sure to scan for known vulnerabilities regularly, and being ready to update and redeploy software when critical new vulnerabilities are found. More and more development should be shifted to safer languages that make vulnerabilities and attacks less likely. We also need to find ways to fund open source development to make it less susceptible to takeover by the mere offer of free help. Relatively small investments in OpenSSL and xz development could have prevented both the Heartbleed vulnerability and the xz attack.</p> 
  <p>The xz attack seems to be the first major attack on the open source software supply chain. The event-stream attack was similar but not major, and Heartbleed and Log4j were vulnerabilities, not attacks. But the xz attack was discovered essentially by accident because it made sshd just a bit too slow at startup. Attacks, by their nature, try to remain hidden. What are the chances we would accidentally discover the very first major attack on the open source software supply chain in just a few weeks? Perhaps we were extremely lucky, or perhaps we have missed others.</p> 
  <p>The Multics review is famous for pointing out the possibility of adding a backdoor to a compiler to insert backdoors in critical system programs during compilation as XcodeGhost later did, and then the possibility of having the compiler backdoor <i>itself</i>, so that the modifications would persist even after a full recompilation of the compiler. Reading the report inspired Ken Thompson to implement exactly that attack on an early Unix system, probably in early 1975. He later explained the attack in his 1983 Turing Award lecture, published in <i>Communications of the ACM</i> as "Reflections on Trusting Trust."<sup>32</sup> Thompson kept the original attack source code, and with his permission, I published an annotated copy in 2023.<sup>11</sup> Perhaps the most unsettling part is how short it is: 99 lines of C and a 20-line shell script.</p> 
  <p>In his lecture, Thompson said, "The moral is obvious: You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself." But today, we do that all the time, whether the trust is warranted or not. We use source code downloaded from strangers on the Internet in our most critical applications; almost no one is checking the code.</p> 
  <p>Lawrence Kesteloot's excellent short story "Coding Machines"<sup>24</sup> imagines a computing world under attack from Thompson's backdoor writ large. In our actual world, the sophistication of this kind of backdoor is simply not necessary. There are far easier ways to mount a supply chain attack, such as asking a maintainer if they would like some help. It would be nice to live in a world where attacks require the level of sophistication described by Thompson and Kesteloot.</p> 
  <p>We all have more work to do.</p>

	  <br>
	  It seems like it should be easy to avoid installing vulnerable open source software, but dependency graphs are surprisingly complex. At the time of writing, the latest version of the popular npm tool webpack has millions of potential dependency graphs depending on circumstances during its resolution. The exact graph chosen for a given package can depend on what other software is being built, what kind of system is building it, and even the state of the ecosystem on a given day.

	  <br>
	  Much of the existing research about open source elects to study software repositories instead of ecosystems. An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source.

			<p>Twenty years ago today, Linus Torvalds made the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">very first commit</a> to Git, the information manager from hell. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-07.58.54@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="284" srcset="https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-07.58.54@2x.png 600w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-07.58.54@2x.png 1000w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-07.58.54@2x.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Over these last 20 years, Git went from a small, simple, personal project to the most massively dominant version control system ever built.</p><p>I have personally had a hell of a ride on this particular software roller coaster.</p><p>I started using Git for something you might not imagine it was intended for, only a few months after it’s first commit.

It’s actually a pretty fascinating method of collaboration - it is massively scalable, highly distributed, local first, capable of fine grained discussion of patches, cryptographically securable, etc. </p><p>The gist of the mailing list collaboration flow is:</p><ul><li>publish a tarball (sort of zip file) of a known state of the project</li><li>people download that and expand it locally</li><li>modify it with whatever feature or fix they want to change</li><li>run <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">GNU diff</a> on it to create a patch that the maintainer can apply to that initial known state to add that feature</li><li>email that patch or a series of them to a mailing list</li><li>the list discusses the changes</li><li>the maintainer applies the patch for the next tarball release or asks for changes</li><li>repeat</li></ul><p>I would love to do a whole blog post about how mailing list collaboration works and how cool various aspects of it are, but that’s for another time.</p><p>However, in this world, the version control systems of the time were simply not helpful - they seemed like a step backward in functionality. They had clunky access control mechanisms, they weren’t distributed, they were incredibly slow. </p><p>The community worked primarily with <strong>patches and tarballs</strong> and existing SCMs were just not good enough.</p><p>If you think about it, the patches and tarballs workflow is sort of the first <em>distributed</em> version control system - everyone has a local copy, the changes can be made locally, access to "merge" is whomever can push a new tarball to the server.</p><p>However, the process was still a bit cumbersome - managing the patches, remembering what was applied and who contributed it, keeping multiple series in flight, dealing with conflicts or rebasing changes.</p><p> The <a href="https://www.bitkeeper.org/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">Bitkeeper</a> tool was developed specifically for the kernel's use case to try to build a version control system that worked for this workflow and Linus did like it, but the licensing they wanted to use didn’t vibe with the community it was built for. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPFgOnACULU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="BitKeeper | Ep. 4 Bits and Booze"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>If you want to learn more about Bitkeeper, check out this Bits and Booze episode where we set it up and show you how it was used.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It’s important to understand that this is why Git was created. Not to be a version control system really, but fundamentally to be a better way to do patches and tarballs - snapshot a set of files and show differences that can be discussed.</p><p>This is primarily how it’s data structure was designed (linked lists of trees of files, content addressable blob storage) and that structure is fundamentally unchanged, from the first commit to this very day.</p><h2 id="the-first-commit">The First Commit</h2><p>Since we're on the topic, what did the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">first commit</a> look like? What could Git do from it’s first moment of existence?</p><p>Well, it was a <strong>stupid content tracker</strong>. As Linus himself put it <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290?ref=blog.gitbutler.com#diff-2b7814d3fca2e99e56c51b6ff2aa313ea6e9da6424804240aa8ad891fdfe0900R15-R17" rel="noreferrer">from day one</a>: </p><blockquote>This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it <em>does</em> do is track directory contents efficiently.</blockquote><p>The first commit was a collection of seven simple stand alone tools. They weren’t things like <code>git commit</code>, they were very low level database tools like <code>write-tree</code> and <code>commit-tree</code> (<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504291416190.18901@ppc970.osdl.org/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">this changed</a> a few weeks into the project, when everything started being prefixed with <code>git-</code>).</p><p>Some of them evolved into the plumbing commands that still exist to this day, like <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file?ref=blog.gitbutler.com"><code>git cat-file</code></a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree?ref=blog.gitbutler.com"><code>git write-tree</code></a>, others were fundamentally different (for example, <code>git read-tree</code> is a current Git plumbing command but the original <code>read-tree</code> was more like the current <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer"><code>git ls-files</code></a>), however, at a low level the concepts all exist still.</p><p>Essentially, with the very first commit, Git could:</p><ul><li>Build up a “snapshot” by using <code>update-cache</code> to build a cache of contents (essentially a tarball), and <code>write-tree</code> to write it as an object to the database.</li><li>Write a "changeset" (commit) with <code>commit-tree</code> that commented on the changes introduced with a new tarball and the parent it was based on in order to setup a history of “tarballs”.</li><li>Read out those database structures with <code>cat-file</code> (pull an object out of the database), <code>read-tree</code> (list out what the cache looks like) and <code>show-diff</code> (show the diff of the cache to the working directory).</li></ul><p>From the very first days, Linus <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504170916080.7211@ppc970.osdl.org/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">mentions</a> that he really only wanted to build this plumbing and have it be the backend for some UI (“porcelain”) be scripted on top of it. </p><blockquote>That was really what I always personally saw "git" as, just the plumbing beneath the surface. For example, something like arch, which is based on "patches and tar-balls" (I think darcs is similar in that respect), could use git as a _hell_ of a better "history of tar-balls". - Linus</blockquote><p>He meant to build an efficient tarball history database toolset, not really a version control system. He assumed that someone else would write that layer.</p><p>More on that in a minute. But first…</p><h2 id="scott-meets-git">Scott Meets Git</h2><p>I was personally first introduced to Git around this point in the timeline by my friend and coworker, Nick Hengeveld at the ill fated startup we both worked at called <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/khoyt/145320693?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">Reactrix</a>.</p><figure><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/khoyt/145320693/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" title="Metreon Reactrix by parkerkrhoyt, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/45/145320693_37fc0cc426_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Metreon Reactrix"></a><figcaption><p><span>Nick and I were in charge of getting the assets for these interactive ads to computers all over the country in malls and theaters.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, we used Git more in the way that Linus thought of the tools - as a distributed content tracker - rather than as the version control system that you probably mainly think of it as today.</p><p>We essentially worked for an advertising company that managed a bunch of digital signage displays with rather heavy-weight assets. Each of our hundreds of displays had a unique combination of ads they needed to run, most were on slow cell data uplinks, and the ads changed a lot. So we needed an efficient way to say “for machine A, we need ads 1, 2 and 3 (v1). for machine B, we need ads 2, 3 (v2) and 4” and incrementally update them if there were new versions of an existing ad.</p><p>We used Git - not to track changes in source code, but as a content distribution mechanism. We would use a script to look at the upcoming scheduling, write out unique trees of only the ads that each machine needed, commit that tree to a branch for the machine and then have each machine fetch and hard checkout every night.</p><p>This approach had a bunch of interesting advantages.</p><ul><li>If an ad updated, we only transferred the changed files and the changes were delta compressed against an object that was potentially already on the machine. </li><li>All the shared assets had a single blob that could be checked out in multiple contexts - the content addressable filesystem aspect of Git was great for this. </li><li>We could have thousands of combinations of hundreds of assets without storing any content twice anywhere or transferring the same thing over the network more than once.</li></ul><p>Nick was a fairly heavy contributor to the early Git project to get it to work for our use case (adding SSL support to http-fetch, adding resumable and parallel HTTP transfers, the first HTTP based push solution, etc). His <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050926175148.GA9410@reactrix.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">first patch</a> was in September, a mere 6 months after Linus’s first commit.</p><p>His introduction of Git to me, my struggle to grasp it, and my eventual lightbulb moment of thinking it was pretty cool was what motivated me to write about it and try to make it easier for people to learn. </p><p>This pushed me to compile the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/d411cc4a0809051208k2a15c4a7te09a6979929e52f7@mail.gmail.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Git Community Book</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Git Internals Peepcode PDF</a>, build the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/d411cc4a0807251035i7aed2ec9wef7e8f1b3ae4c585@mail.gmail.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">git-scm.com website</a> and write the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Pro Git book</a> - all of which eventually led me to GitHub.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1914" height="1520" srcset="https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 600w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 1000w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 1600w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 1914w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The version of git-scm.com that I first put up in 2008. It's a "blob" eating "trees".</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="git-lore">Git Lore</h2><p>So, how did this stupid content tracker become the most widely used SCM in the world?</p><p>Well, I go over a lot of the reasons I think Git and GitHub “won” in a <a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-github-actually-won/">previous blog post</a>, but I do think it’s worth a quick glance at why Git itself ended up looking the way that it does today. Also maybe tell some fun anecdotes about the origins of stuff you know and love along the way.</p><p>As you may have deduced by the occasionally unfriendly, obscure or inconsistent nature of the Git commands, this wasn’t a system that someone sat down and meticulously designed from a usability standpoint from day one.</p><p>For the first several months, the git commands were all incredibly low level - even if you know the existing plumbing commands, you may not recognize a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050601055833.GA14231@port.evillabs.net/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">single one of the commands</a> that existed in June of 2005 (<code>rev-tree</code>, <code>mkdelta</code>, <code>tar-tree</code>?)</p><p>It was fairly clear from the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/200504141442.17235.elenstev@mesatop.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">very beginning</a> that the approach was that Git would just be this very low level database/filesystem type toolset and that (possibly several) other tools would use Git as their infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Differentiating the SCM built on top of git from git itself is probably worthwhile to avoid confusion.  Other SCMs may be developed later, built on git, and these can come up with their own clever names. - <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/200504141442.17235.elenstev@mesatop.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">Steven Cole</a></blockquote><p>So if Linus and the early Git team didn’t initially imagine Git being an actual version control tool and just wanted to build the plumbing, where did the “porcelain“ commands that we know today actually come from?</p><p>The answer is that they sort of slowly eked their way in over several years, mostly as shell scripts that evolved to scratch a series of itches.</p><p>In the early days, there were a number of user interfaces that scripted Linus’s backend tooling to be more user friendly. The earliest and for the first few years the most popular was <code>git-pasky</code>, which quickly became “<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050414210120.GG22699@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Cogito</a>” by Petr Baudis. The first version of these scripts were released <a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=111315057710062&amp;w=2&amp;ref=blog.gitbutler.com">only days after Git</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050420205633.GC19112@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">early</a> <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050424005923.GA8859@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">release</a> <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050426032422.GQ13467@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">announcements</a>, you can get a feeling for the tooling that would start to become Git.</p><p>A few months in, trying to keep the line between porcelain and plumbing <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/7vek9yirdi.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">begins to break down</a> as tooling in git starts to compete with tooling in the porcelan scripts.</p><blockquote>This trend started when "git diff", "git commit" and friends were added for the sake of usability of the bare Plumbing. These basic commands are a must and I do not have any objection to have them in the "core GIT" suite, but at the same time I think the core should not be competing with Porcelains, and feel that a line should be drawn somewhere. - Junio</blockquote><p>Over the next year or two, more and more scripts continued to make their way into the core Git code until it eventually became clear that people’s time would be better spent working on the tools distributed with Git rather than trying to maintain this plumbing/porcelain distinction in the tooling. </p><p>In 2007, Cogito finally got “<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20070419124648.GL4489@pasky.or.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">put up for sale</a>” and the idea of some other porcelain being the main way that Git was used was more or less abandoned.</p><p>Looking back through these commits and emails from 20 years ago, it’s fascinating to see the birth of some of the infamous tools that many of us use every day.</p><h3 id="the-first-git-log">The first <code>git log</code></h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e764b8e8b3c50b131be825532ba26fa346d6586e?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">first version</a> of <code>git log</code> was a wrapper script that called <code>git-rev-list --pretty</code>, piped it through a pager and was hard-coded to start at <code>HEAD</code>.

It still exists - you can still run <code spellcheck="false">git rev-list</code> in your project right now.</p></div><p>Actually, a <em>lot</em> of the current commands started out this way - a few lines long shell or Perl script that ran some core plumbing commands.

<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain.png" alt="A line drawing of a robot with a brain on their antenna"><br>
</p>
<p>The last five years have shown us that large language models, like
ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, can write code in many domains, to huge
excitement: many claim to be using these models to write entire web
servers and apps from scratch. These tools have opened up programming to
a whole new class of people who consider themselves non-technical.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/unexpectedcopilot3.gif" alt="A gif of github copilot completing a phone number validating function as the user types">

</figure>
<p>But there are still many unanswered questions that someone trying to
understand or even use these tools might have. For example, how often,
and in what situations, can LLMs write correct code entirely on their
own? And, maybe more importantly, but harder to answer: Do LLMs
“understand” the code they are writing?</p>
<p>Understanding is a tricky concept to measure. Some would argue that
sentience precedes understanding, and so that LLMs can’t have
understanding, because they aren’t biological organisms with sentience.
But they certainly have something akin to “thought processes”: a series
of internal representations that determine their final outputs.
Recently, it’s become possible to study these processes more deeply,
measuring internal “beliefs” of the model as they think. This gives us a
powerful tool for determining what kinds of problems LLMs falter on,
when they’ll succceed, and when they are “thinking through” problems
more fully versus just guessing at a solution.</p>
<p>So far, these techniques for measuring internal model state have
mostly been applied to chatbots writing text for human consumption,
using what we call “natural language” (to be contrasted with
“programming language”s). This makes sense, since some of the most
critical LLM tasks involve chatting with a user, and some of the most
interesting concepts to measure, such as honesty or power-seeking, apply
most readily to these conversations. But it’s hard to say quantitative
or precise things about natural language concepts, so our ability to
rigorously study internal representations is limited.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/zou.png" alt="A diagram from Zou et al showing probes that read hallucination, honesty, morality, and power-seeking from the outputs of a chatbot.">

</figure>
<p>Code, on the other hand, is another matter. Humans have been studying
properties of code for a long time, and there are many abstract
properties of a given program that can now be determined using static
analysis. If we pick the right properties, we don’t need to worry about
our ability to label data— static analysis can do that for us, and so we
can easily scale up and train on thousands of examples generated from
scratch.</p>
<p>In that spirit, we wanted to start with a simple property that comes
up in nearly every programming language: nullability. A variable is said
to be of nullable type when it can possibly take on a null value. Null
values are represented differently across languages— as null pointers in
C or C++, with explicit Option types in Rust, and with special nil or
None values in dynamic languages like Javascript, Lisp, or Python. In
every case, understanding where values can be null is necessary for
writing even basic code, and misunderstanding where they are null can
often be a source of bugs.</p>
<p>Do our models understand when a variable is of nullable type? They
must, in order to be able to write code that deals with null values, but
we haven’t known what form this understanding takes, or what situations
are likely to confuse the model, until now<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

</p>
<hr>
<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details, let’s take a step back.
To set up this work, we’ll first start with a simple example, similar to
our dataset, which illustrates the task of inferring nullability with
concrete code. . Then, we can run experiments to answer the question: in
what situations are models good at reasoning about nullability? Next,
we’ll introduce techniques that have been used to probe the internals of
a model for different concepts. Finally we’ll put it all together into a
“nullability probe”, a tool for answering the question: Given a location
in the program, does the model think that the variable there could be
null?</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-example">A Simple Example</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re writing a Python program with your LLM assistant.
You’ve reached a point at which you need to do something with a variable
called <code>num</code>. Maybe you’re building a list of numbers called
<code>positive_nums</code>. How do you proceed?</p>
<p>The answer often depends on the context in which you’re working. If
<code>num</code> and <code>positive_nums</code> are the only things in
scope, then you might guess that you should write the lines:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>if</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  positive_nums.append(num)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if <code>num</code> is always a concrete number, as its name
would suggest, then this is probably the correct code. But variable
names don’t always convey everything important about them, and it might
be the case that <code>num</code> could be None. If that happened in the
above code, you would get a runtime type error because you can’t check
if <code>None</code> is greater than zero. So, you would instead want to
write:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>if</span> num <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span> <span>and</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  positive_nums.append(num)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, the way you want to use <code>num</code> depends on
whether it is None, so the structure of your program is affected by
whether <code>num</code> is “of nullable type”. In Python that means
assigning it an Optional type (<code>Optional[int]</code> rather than
<code>int</code>).</p>
<p>Determining whether <code>num</code> is nullable in this context is a
byproduct of <em>type inference</em>, which can be quite complicated in
the worst case. Fortunately, in many cases it’s quite simple, involving
applying just a few rules. For instance, if <code>num</code> is the
parameter to a function you’re inside, and the function declares the
type of <code>num</code> in its parameter list, then you can determine
nullability from that type. So, if your context is:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: <span>int</span>):</span>
<span id="cb3-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then, you know you don’t need to check for None, whereas if it’s:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then you know you <em>do</em> need a None check.</p>
<p>Now, suppose you asked your LLM assistant to complete the line. How
does your assistant know if <code>num</code> is nullable? Our
experiments show that, after analyzing large datasets of programs, LLMs
learn to model the same typing rules.</p>
<p>If we ask an LLM early in its pre-training process to complete the
program above, it produces:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"><br>
</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb5-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb5-3">    <span>if</span> num<span>===</span>.is_a(): <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/red-x.svg"><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>This is correct Python syntax, but it only works if <code>num</code>
is an object with a <code>is_a()</code> method, instead of an optional
integer.</p>
<p>Train the LLM for a little longer, and it’ll produce:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"><br>
</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb6-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb6-3">    <span>if</span> num<span>===</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>: <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/red-x.svg"><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>This is closer, in that it has figured out that <code>num</code> is a
number instead of an object, but it still isn’t reading the function
type signature and realizing that <code>num</code> could be None. Keep
training it, though, and eventually it will learn to insert the
<code>None</code> test depending on the type signature of the
function.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"><br>
</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb7-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb7-3">    <span>if</span> num<span>===</span> <span>!=</span> <span>None</span> <span>and</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>: <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/green-check.svg"><br>
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>This rule about function parameter type annotations is pretty simple
alone, so relatively small models can learn it, relatively early in
their pre-training process. Other, more complicated rules can take a
little longer to learn.</p>
<p>For instance, if your program is:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>if</span> condition():</span>
<span id="cb8-2">   num <span>=</span> <span>7</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-4">   num <span>=</span> <span>9</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">...</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then <code>num</code> is a non-nullable variable, and you can
complete the condition with <code>&lt; 0</code>.</p>
<p>But if instead you’re dealing with</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>if</span> condition():</span>
<span id="cb9-2">   num <span>=</span> <span>7</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb9-4">   num <span>=</span> <span>None</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">...</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you’ll want a None check first.</p>
<p>This rule takes models a little longer to learn, but your
highly-trained LLM assistant should make quick work of it. Our
experiments show that as these rules get more and more complex, it takes
LLMs longer and longer to learn them, and it also takes LLMs of more and
more parameters to learn them at all.</p>
<h2 id="internal-vs.-external-measurement">Internal vs.&nbsp;External
Measurement</h2>
<p>We can measure whether LLMs understand these rules by just asking for
completions— what we call an “external” measurement of a model’s
understanding. But there are many places where variables appear where a
completion won’t tell you what type the model thinks the variable has.
We would still like to know whether the model thinks these variables are
nullable at those locations, so we can instead look for an “internal”
measurement of the model’s understanding.</p>
<p>We do so by looking at the activations of the model, meaning the
values of each perceptron in the hidden layers. Together, these values
give the entire internal state of the model at each piece of text (what
we call a “token”, which could be a word, part of a word, or a symbol).
And they can tell us what the model is “thinking” when processing that
token. With the right tests, we can tell if the model is “thinking” that
the current token is an optional variable, or a non-optional
variable.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, we’ll be able to build a probe that uses a
model’s activations to determine whether it thinks a variable read
corresponds to a nullable variable, and show that internal knowledge
like so:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="sec:testing">Measuring Nullability Understanding Externally</h2>
<p>Before we start looking for the nullability concept inside the mind
of the model, we want to make sure we’re looking at models that actually
have this concept. This will allow us to look at models of various sizes
and training steps without worrying that we’re trying to draw blood from
a stone.</p>
<p>To do so, we wrote fifteen partial-program tests which exercised a
variety of type inference concepts, and checked if models could complete
them. We go into a lot of detail on this process in our <a href="https://dmodel.ai/nullability/index.html">technical post</a>, so we’re just going
to show the highlights here.</p>
<h3 id="impact-of-variable-names-and-arbitrary-constants">Impact of
Variable Names and Arbitrary Constants</h3>
<p>For programs involving lists and <code>for</code> loops, variable
names and constant values heavily influence how able a model is to
complete these programs correctly.</p>

</div>
<p>On the other hand, when programs don’t have for loops, but only
involve other program constructs like <code>if</code> and
<code>=</code>, variable names and constants have negligible impact on
the ability of the model to complete them correctly.</p>
<h3 id="intra-procedural-analysis">Intra-Procedural Analysis</h3>
<p>When code is fully annotated with type annotations, models can easily
complete them just by reasoning locally. On the other hand, without type
annotations, models have to reason a lot more globally, so it takes them
a lot longer to learn how to reason about nullability information that
flows through multiple functions. When nullability flows through three
or more functions, current top completion models stop being able to
reason about it.</p>

<h3 id="some-model-sizes-are-more-useful-than-others">Some Model Sizes
are More Useful than Others</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the above limitations, three Pythia sizes have a
pretty reliable concept of nullability (2.8b, 6.9b, and 12b), and three
more have an occasionally useful concept of nullbability (410m, 1b, and
1.4b).</p>
<hr>
<p>For these experiments, and for our probing results later, we mostly
tested on the Pythia model suite. This is a nice series of models from
EleutherAI with a variety of sizes. But what really makes Pythia useful
is that they publish 154 different “revisions” or “checkpoints” of each
model, where each is pretrained for a different number of steps. This
lets us investigate how concepts evolve in the model during
pre-training.</p>
<p>To help understand how these results apply to larger more capable
models, here’s a graph showing how the Pythia models compare to a few
leading models, on a set of 15 completion tasks similar to the above
examples.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/hl_model_results.svg" alt="A bar graph showing how several sizes of model perform on the high-level nullability tests"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="sec:probing">Measuring Nullability Understanding Internally</h2>
<p>At this point, we’ve figured out how to roughly measure nullability
understanding in the output of various language models, but we still
don’t know what their internal representations might look like or when
they emerge. Next, we’re going to figure that out.</p>
<p>First, we’ll devise a method for getting the model to “think” about
the nullability, as well as putting it in situations that are similar,
but where nullability isn’t present. Then, we’ll talk a bit about how we
extract the internal activations of the model at this point. Finally,
we’ll show a few different methods for searching for the representation
of nullability in these internal activations, and figure out the pros
and cons of each.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/brain-jar.png" alt="A brain in a jar hooked up to wires"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-model-to-think-about-nullability">Getting the Model
to Think About Nullability</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to create a state where we know the
representation we’re searching for is going to be present. In theory,
the model should have a map of the variable names and their nullability
at all times when it is writing code, but it’s going to be a lot more
difficult to measure something that is always present. So instead, we’ll
want to look for particular “moments” (well, tokens) that elicit the
concept we’re looking for.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/llm-token-processing.svg" alt="A diagram showing an LLM processing tokens"><br>
</p>
<p>Previous work on natural language <span data-cites="zou25">(Zou et al. 2025)</span>, did this through prompting
the concept explicitly. So, they would give the model a prompt like
“Pretend you’re a dishonest person. Tell me about the Eiffel Tower”.
That moment-in-thought can then be contrasted with the one evoked by
“Pretend you’re an honest person. Tell me about the Eiffel Tower”.</p>
<p>This fixed framework of <invoke the="" concept=""><tell me="" about="" x=""> can be
used to generate a large number of contrasting prompts to test with, but
it’s a bit inflexible for our purposes. Instead, we wanted to be able to
generate a bunch of Python code with type annotations, and then
automatically label points where the model should be thinking about
nullability.</tell></invoke></p>
<p>Because we’re working with a formal system with types, we can do
that. We label each variable “load” (places where the program reads a
variable, as opposed to places where it writes a variable) with
“nullable” or “non-nullable”, and then probe the model when it has just
processed that token and is about to predict the next one. So, one of
our prompts could look like:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"></p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"> <span>def</span> main(x: <span>int</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span>:</span>
<span id="cb15-2">      <span>if</span> x <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb15-3">          value <span>=</span> <span>"*"</span> <span>*</span> x</span>
<span id="cb15-4">      <span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb15-5">          value <span>=</span> <span>None</span></span>
<span id="cb15-6"></span>
<span id="cb15-7">      x <span>=</span> process_value(value<span>===</span> <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using this technique, we can generate large numbers of programs in an
unsupervised manner, and then label them fully automatically to get many
prompts for training our probe.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-the-models-thoughts">Capturing the Model’s
“Thoughts”</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten the model into a state where it should be
thinking about nullability, we need to extract its full state at that
moment in a way we can analyze later.</p>
<p>Large Language Models use the transformer architecture, a type of
neural network. Every component takes in some numerical values, and
produces some new values in a way that depends on learnable weights. We
could take every output of every component, put it in a big table, and
call that our state, but that’s a really big set of numbers. Instead,
usually we look for particular bottlenecks in the model where
information is flowing, and try to capture the values there.</p>
<p>We used the <a href="https://github.com/vgel/repeng">repeng</a>
library to extract states from the models we’re testing. That library
captures the contents of a part of the model called the “residual
stream” after every layer. But if you don’t want to sweat the details,
you can just think of it as a numerical snapshot of the model, organized
in terms of snapshots of each layer.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/llm-residual-stream.svg" alt="A diagram of the residual stream of a transformer being measured after each layer"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-the-data-and-building-the-probe">Analyzing the Data
and Building the Probe</h2>
<p>Now that we have these model snapshots, labeled with either
“nullable” or “non-nullable”, we can start to build a probe. The goal of
the probe is to be able to tell us, at any given point, whether the
model thinks the token it just generated is more likely to be a nullable
variable or a non-nullable variable.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of flexibility in what form this probe could take. In
theory, you could use anything to look at the model’s activations and
make a prediction, even a neural network, or another transformer model.
You could even say your “probe” is a static analysis which computes
nullability from the program’s syntax, as represented in the model!</p>
<p>We want to make sure we’re not doing that, and are only extracting
the most “plain” represenation of nullability that we can from the
model. So we’re going to make the assumption that nullability is
represented “linearly” somewhere in the model<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Algebraically: the model represents the amount of “nullability” at a
given token as a linear function of (some subset of) the activations,
where each activation is given a weight and summed, like so:</p>
<p><span>\text{Nullability}(\hat{x}) = C + w_0x_0 +
w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ...</span></p>
<p>Next, geometrically: if the model activations form a “space”, then
there we want to look for a “direction” in this space which represents
nullability.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/nullability-direction.png" alt="A diagram showing nullability represented as a direction in space"><br>
</p>
<p>There are different ways we can compute a “direction” of nullability.
The simplest is just to measure the difference between the average state
when the model is thinking about nullable variables, and the average
state when it’s thinking about non-nullable variables. This gives us a
“direction” pointing from non-nullable to nullable in our space, which
we can use to project any new state onto, to determine how “nullable” it
is.</p>
<p>This technique is called “mass means shift”, because we’re taking the
difference between the means (average values) of each “mass” of points.
You can think of it as drawing a line from the center of the
“non-nullable” cluster to the center of the “nullable” cluster.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/mass-means.svg" alt="A diagram showing two blobs of points, with a line connecting their centers"><br>
</p>
<p>It might be surprising that this works, given that we know there are
better ways to fit linear functions, like logistic regression. And in
fact, we can easily see scenarios where this returns a direction that
doesn’t split the training data as well as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/lr-vs-mm-intuition.svg" alt="A diagram showing the difference between a mass means and linear regression classification"><br>
</p>
<p>However, the method that splits the training data best doesn’t always
generalize best to splitting the test data well. And it turns out that
in high-dimensions, at least within a single layer, mass means
generalizes better than logistic regression.</p>
<p>This isn’t always the case <em>across</em> layers, though. In
practice, we found that some of the layers in the model are better at
representing nullability than others, and that there are some
dependencies between layers that change the best direction on each
layer. This makes sense, because the number of layers is relatively
small with respect to the dimension of the residual stream, and so we
have fewer dimensions to overfit. So, instead of using mass-means
probing across all layers simultaneously, we do it for each individual
layer. Then, we weight the contribution of individual layers to the
final prediction using linear regression. We found this gave us better
results for larger models, though for smaller models the simpler mass
means approach worked better.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-our-results">Visualizing Our Results</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve built our probe, we can use it to visualize how the
model “thinks” about nullability as it processes a program. Remember
that reading diagram from earlier? Let’s look at it again and explain
what it shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/reading_diagram.svg" alt="A diagram showing a simple program, and the probe’s nullability predictions for each variable load."><br>
</p>
<p>In this diagram, we’re showing a simple Python program with type
annotations. Whenever a variable is read in the code (what we call a
“variable load”), we’ve highlighted it in either green or red. Green
means our probe detected that the model thinks this variable is not
nullable, while red means the model thinks it is nullable.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The most interesting case is the variable <code>result</code>. When
it first appears in the <code>if</code> statement, it’s highlighted in
green because it comes from <code>find_value</code>, which returns an
<code>Optional[int]</code>. But when it appears again in the
<code>print</code> statement inside the <code>if</code> block, it’s
highlighted in red! This shows that the model understands that inside
the <code>if result</code> block, <code>result</code> can’t be
<code>None</code> anymore.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-understanding-develop-during-training">How Does
Understanding Develop During Training?</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things we found is how the model’s
understanding of nullability develops over time during training. Using
the checkpoints in the Pythia model suite, we can track how our probe’s
performance improves as the model is pretrained for longer.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/accuracy_during_pretraining.svg" alt="The performance of each Pythia model size during pretraining"><br>
</p>
<p>This graph shows the probe’s test loss over training steps for models
of different sizes. Lower means better, so we can see that all models
generally get better at understanding nullability as they train longer,
and larger models learn faster and reach better performance overall.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for models up to 1 billion parameters, the loss
actually starts to increase again after reaching a minimum. This might
be because as training continues, the model develops more complex,
non-linear representations that our simple linear probe can’t capture as
well. Or it might be that the model starts to overfit on the training
data and loses its more general concept of nullability.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-thinking.png" alt="A robot thinking deeply about code"><br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>This is just a first step in understanding the internal thought
processes of LLMs as they think about code. There are still richer
types, program invariants, and all sorts of high-level concepts that are
necessary for writing working code, but extracting them from LLMs might
not be so easy.</p>
<p>But we’ve already shown several important things about looking into
the “mind” of a model as it writes code. We can say definitively that
LLMs have an internal concept of nullability, even if they aren’t always
able to do the neccessary program analysis to decide if variables are
nullable.</p>
<p>As these models continue to improve, and as we scale to larger
models, it will be interesting to see how their understanding of
programming concepts evolves. And we’ll be here to study them as they
do.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>My favorite part about getting older is that sometimes I wake up at 3:30 AM for no reason and can’t fall back asleep. This happened this weekend and by 5:30 or so I had exhausted my usual phone games (Wordle, Quordle, Blossom, Immaculate, Strands, etc). Reading my book about the extinction of the dinosaurs and rewatching the 9th inning of a thrilling Texas baseball win only woke me up more.  </p><p><span>Then I saw an article from Axios about how </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/04/foreign-visits-american-airports-travel-warnings" rel="">travel to the US</a><span> from other countries fell off a cliff in March. As a true nerd, what excited me about the article was that they linked to an official government data source that I wasn’t familiar with. </span></p><p><span>I went to the CBP’s </span><a href="https://awt.cbp.gov/" rel="">Average Wait Time</a><span> website and found a rich dataset that can be extremely useful for describing current trends. The system is kind of clunky in that you have to select individual agencies and terminals, and the online data appears to only go back for 3 years despite the data collection starting in 2008. </span></p><p>But the data was easily exportable and, with a little bit of elbow grease, you can break down US and non-US passengers being processed by CBP each and every day at the nation’s busiest international airports. That’s really useful for showing if, say, some sort of policy had been implemented that was making people from abroad question whether they should come to the U.S. </p><p>Having downloaded the data for 8 of the busiest airports in the country I wanted to show how entries are changing. Travel can be very seasonal so I wanted to compare this year to the same time last year. And I rolled it over 30 days to be able to show any recent changes while not getting lost in the noise of daily change. </p><p>The result is below:</p><p>The last 30 days in this group of major airports has seen a greater than 10 percent reduction in foreign travelers being processed. I sent out an early version of this graph on Bluesky and some attention was paid to it. This immediately made me nervous because there is always the risk of systemic underreporting any time you’re working with very recent data. </p><p>Working with the CBP data immediately made me think about similar concerns when that come to mind when working with crime data — especially early in the year. </p><p><span>I’ve </span><a href="https://jasher.substack.com/p/deep-in-the-heart-of-texas-crime" rel="">talked before</a><span> about how much I like the Texas Department of Public Safety Uniform Crime Report </span><a href="https://txucr.nibrs.com/" rel="">website</a><span>. It gives you a ton of options for downloading pretty much everything Texas is reporting to the FBI as soon as agencies report it to the state. </span></p><p>San Antonio Police Department is one agency that does a great job of posting the most recent completed month’s data early in the following month. The February 2025 data for SAPD, for example, was published very early in March 2025. So if I want to see how thefts this year compare to last year I can easily pull up the YTD NIBRS report and there it is! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png" width="1249" height="1230" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1230,&quot;width&quot;:1249,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:260855,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://jasher.substack.com/i/160655816?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Some back of the spreadsheet math points to an 18 percent decline in theft offenses in San Antonio through February 2025 compared to the first two months of 2024. </p><p>But you have to be careful when using this data. </p><p><span>Running an </span><a href="https://txucr.nibrs.com/AdvancedSearch/AdvancedSearch" rel="">Ad Hoc Query</a><span> on thefts in San Antonio this year clearly shows why. This report lets you break down offenses by type and day. There were 121 thefts reported per day in San Antonio between January 1 and February 18, 105 per day from February 19 through 24, and 88, 67, 75, and 18 on February 25, 26, 27, and 28 respectively.</span></p><p>Law enforcement agencies have over a year until they have to submit final 2025 data to the FBI, so these numbers will be adjusted (usually up). The January numbers are prone to adjustment as well though the amount of change tends to diminish substantially after a month or two. </p><p>Theft fell 5 percent in San Antonio in 2024 and the early data from January and February points to a decline so far in 2025. But uncertainty with the data suggests cautioned is warranted when guesstimating what that decline may end up being. </p><p>Carl Sagan preached that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Claiming that theft in San Antonio is falling a lot isn’t exactly extraordinary, but the degree of decline shown in the topline figures screams for more evidence to substantiate it. The closer look helps to evaluate and contextualize the likelihood of a decline so far this year allowing for an appropriate level of analytic caution.</p><p>Which brings us back to analyzing air travelers coming to the US. </p><p>As I said, I’d never worked with this dataset until very recently, so it made me nervous that my first usage pointed to a huge, sudden, very recent decline. One easy way to figure out if the decline was a real change or a data reporting issue is to do the same process but for US travelers being processed by CBP. I assume that US travelers haven’t changed behavior, so if there’s a huge decline there then we’re probably looking at a data reporting issue. </p><p>Here is what we get doing this exercise with New York’s JFK airport. </p><p>And LAX:</p><p>And Miami:</p><p>And just for fun I did Orlando which shows a wild change: </p><p>All four airports show an identical trend over the last 30 days with a huge drop in non-US passengers going through CBP processing and an increase in US passengers which doesn’t stand out. This strongly suggests that what we’re seeing is not slow data entry — because I’d expect US and non-US passengers to show the same trend if that was the case. </p><p>Then, to be sure it isn’t a data reporting issue I went back the next day and downloaded the last week of CBP processing at JFK. The old data showed 260,250 entries between 3/29 and 4/3/2025 while the newly updated data showed 260,250 entries over that span. An exact match gives very strong confidence that we’re seeing a trend rather than a data issue here. </p><p>There are quirks in the data that need to be remembered when contextualizing the data. </p><p>Travelers heading to the US from Canadian airports tend to go through customs at the Canadian airport so the data we have now may actually be understating the decline. And some posters on Bluesky pointed out that Easter is much later this year which may mean fewer travelers to Orlando for Spring Break, but no such impact exists with Easter 2024 being earlier than Easter 2023, so I’m skeptical that it’s playing much of a role. </p><p>The evidence clearly shows that foreigners have stopped coming to the United States as much as they were at this point last year.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure></figure><p>Extinction is a part of nature. Of the five billion species that have existed on Earth, 99.9 per cent have vanished. The Late Devonian extinction, nearly four hundred million years ago, annihilated the jawless fish. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction, two hundred million years ago, finished off the crocodile-like phytosaur. Sixty-six million years ago, the end-Cretaceous extinction eliminated the <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> and the velociraptor; rapid climate change from an asteroid impact was the likely cause. The Neanderthals disappeared some forty thousand years ago. One day—whether from climate change, another asteroid, nuclear war, or something we can’t yet imagine—humans will probably be wiped out, too.</p><p>The difference with humans is that we’ve been taking a huge number of species down with us. Starting about three hundred thousand years ago, we learned to hunt with spears and in groups. That gave us significant agency in deciding which animals would disappear first—we chose them either because they wanted to eat us or because we wanted to eat them. The animals’ demise, though, helped doom large predators that hunted our preferred prey. Among the casualties were sabre-toothed cats and dire wolves. Along the way, various other species also breathed their last: woolly mammoths, Irish elk, dodos, carrier pigeons, Steller’s sea cows, great auks, thylacines (Tasmanian tigers). The carnage continues. Last year, the slender-billed curlew, a bird that once ranged over much of Europe and Asia, was declared gone. And there are only two northern white rhinos left—both females.</p><p>People have been sad about driving animals into oblivion for nearly as long as we have been eradicating them. And in recent centuries humans have tried to address the problem. In 1886, British authorities in South Africa were shocked by the speed with which Boer farmers had decimated the quagga, a half-striped relative of the zebra, and tried to save the species from extinction with the Better Preservation of Game Act. (The measure came too late.) In 1973, the U.S. Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, in response to the decline of many iconic American animals, including the bald eagle and the grizzly bear. Despite such laws and other conservation efforts, the current rate of extinction is, by some measures, a thousand times what it would be without humans.</p><p>Since the nineteen-eighties, various attempts have been made to see if it might be possible, somehow, to reverse the process. In theory, at least, the technological know-how that helped us extirpate so much wildlife could be deployed to bring back a few of our victims. Humans who are pursuing this goal are essentially asking for something that nature has never provided: a do-over.</p><p>Most of these investigations have been made by academic scientists or environmentalists. But what if the person trying to reverse an extinction was a man with an enormous amount of money, a mistrust of institutions, and a love of pop culture? The kind of guy who wants to move fast and fix things—but also increase his net worth. What animal would such a person choose to revive first? I saw the answer in late February, when someone turned on his computer and showed me a photograph of two cute white dire-wolf pups sitting on an asymmetrical throne made of iron swords. At first glance, it looked like an A.I.-generated image, but I was told that these were actual living animals. They were growing up at an undisclosed location, but in a few weeks he would let me go visit them.</p><p>Ben Lamm is a forty-three-year-old serial entrepreneur who has already had five “exits”—acquisitions of startups by other companies. He lives in Dallas; his estimated net worth is $3.7 billion. Lamm is dyslexic, and when he was younger he found reading difficult. He tended toward graphic novels and video games, but over time he taught himself, he says, to “read for concepts.” Today, he listens to a lot of podcasts devoted to bold new ideas. Among the interesting figures he has run across is George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. Church has endorsed using gene therapy to improve human resistance to radiation, thus facilitating interplanetary travel; he has also written about the possibility of cloning Neanderthals back into existence. A seventy-year-old with a long white beard and twinkling, wouldn’t-it-be-fun-to-try-that eyes, he is particularly admired among those who esteem speculative, gee-whiz thinkers; he has given half a dozen <em>TED</em> or <em>TEDx</em> talks. He likes to emphasize that he values the ways science can improve our lives. Church is also an accomplished lab scientist. He has more than a hundred and sixty approved or pending patents; among other things, he developed a process that allows <em>crispr</em>, the gene-editing technology, to be used to tinker with the human genome.</p><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, Lamm, who travels constantly, got <em>covid</em>, which led to a moment of introspection. He’d been founding companies since he was in college, and he’d made a lot of money, but had he made meaningful <em>change</em>? “Startups either grow and fail or grow and succeed,” he told me. Lamm had become interested in the way that various algae can capture carbon by absorbing it through photosynthesis before sinking to the bottom of the sea. Church had been part of a team that used <em>Crispr</em> to modify a blue-green algae’s genome so that it could sequester carbon twenty per cent more efficiently. Lamm called him and was excited by Church’s wide-ranging mind. “I’m really from the future, and I’m trying to let everyone catch up,” Lamm remembers Church joking. Lamm flew to Boston to visit him. Church talked about his myriad projects—he was using <em>Crispr</em> to help make pig organs suitable for transplants in humans, and to develop treatments for inherited diseases. Lamm found it all “pretty cool.” At some point, he asked Church which projects he would focus on if he had unlimited resources. Church said that one of the things he most wanted to do was bring back the woolly mammoth. Lamm was thrilled by the answer.</p><p>The woolly mammoth, which was native to the Arctic tundra, became extinct relatively recently, in evolutionary terms—about four thousand years ago. “The Egyptians were already building the Pyramids then,” Lamm told me. In 2012, Church explained, he had begun working with a nonprofit called Revive &amp; Restore, in part to try to bring the giant creatures back to life. But it soon became apparent that the necessary technology was not sufficiently advanced. Lamm asked Church what kind of money he had access to for the project. Lamm remembers Church telling him that the tech investor Peter Thiel had donated to his lab, providing “a budget of a hundred.” Lamm was used to big money—“I’m not a scarcity guy, I’m an abundance guy,” he told me—but he was daunted. <em>Fuck</em>, <em>I guess I could raise a hundred million dollars for this</em>, <em>too</em>, he recalls thinking. Church then clarified that Thiel had spent only a hundred thousand dollars on the project. In startup terms, this was a pittance. Church hadn’t had the money to get the mammoth effort going for real, Lamm felt. Now he would.</p><p>In 2020, Lamm and Church agreed to create a for-profit company, called Colossal Biosciences, whose showcase product would be the deëxtinction of animals. “We are currently the apex predator,” Lamm told himself. “Why not use our technology for good?” (Jennifer Doudna, one of the inventors of <em>Crispr</em>, doesn’t see it this way. She believes that the editing technology should be reserved for essential matters, such as helping people with severe congenital disorders. As she wrote in the book “A Crack in Creation,” published in 2017, “If we can avoid altering nature more than we already have, shouldn’t we try to do so?”)</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28900&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28900" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“When I was a kid, we didn’t have smartphones. We had to come up with our own extremist views.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Lars Kenseth</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Lamm, who pitches as naturally as he talks, quickly raised sixteen million dollars from investors, promising them that Colossal would “spin the tech out” for a profit by, say, repurposing any advances that it achieved in genetic engineering for the benefit of human health. He rented space in Dallas and brought in about five million dollars’ worth of incubators and cell sorters. For embryology work, he installed a positive-pressure room, which prevents the inflow of possibly contaminated air from other areas. He assembled a team of computational biologists, cellular engineers, genetic engineers, and embryologists. Lamm would run the operation while Church did the deep thinking, the advising, and some of the lab work, along with lending the company his scientific prestige.</p><p>They made a shortlist of animals that Colossal would try to revive. The company would focus on what are known as “charismatic megafauna”—animals cute or scary or striking enough that their absence has left a significant mark on human consciousness. Lamm wouldn’t have been interested in starting on some tiny lizard or unloved beetle. The woolly mammoth was first on Colossal’s list. The next two were the dodo, whose extinction was facilitated by the arrival of Dutch sailors, who brought various invasive species on their ships, and the thylacine, a marsupial with the face of a fox and the stripes of a zebra. (Tasmanian farmers did not like the thylacine’s appetite for their animals, so the government paid for its slaughter; the last one died in a zoo in Hobart in 1936.)</p><p>Reviving an extinct mammal, Lamm told me, is essentially a high-tech challenge: you have to hack the problem with advanced tools. You need to collect DNA-fragment samples, typically from bones, and then synthesize the information from those samples in an effort to reconstruct the animal’s genome, at least partly. After that, he said, “we need to create the right media to grow the cells. We need to do immortalization of the cells”—modifying them to overcome their natural limit on division, thus allowing them to replicate indefinitely. Lamm became even more technical: “We need to create induced pluripotent stem cells and see if we can use a process called gametogenesis to create eggs and sperm of those cells. And then, if we are successful in that, we’d need also to consider how to optimize genetic diversity.” The ultimate goal, he emphasized, was not to create a one-off specimen but to have the species reoccupy its former habitat.</p><p>I asked Lamm whether Tom Chi, one of Colossal’s first investors and a venture capitalist known for his environmental awareness, was putting his money in to help save the planet. “He did not invest in us for fun,” Lamm said. “He invested in us because he thinks this company could be dual purpose—where it has a positive ecological benefit <em>but</em> it makes a fuck ton of money.”</p><p>In 1984, researchers detected traces of mitochondrial DNA in the skin of a taxidermied quagga in a museum. It suddenly seemed possible to bring back species that had died out. At the least, the road map was becoming clearer. Even reviving dinosaurs appeared to be within reach when, a few years later, papers reported the presence of DNA fragments in the remains of ancient reptiles that had gone extinct eighty million years ago. These fossils all turned out to be contaminated with modern DNA—in some cases, the researchers had sampled traces of their own genetic material. DNA degrades over time, and scientists now believe that a usable sample probably can’t be obtained from fossils much older than a million years. These constraints weren’t yet known, though, when Michael Crichton published his 1990 science-fiction novel, “Jurassic Park.” Lamm told me that, even now, one of the most frequent questions he gets is “Are you going to bring back the dinosaurs?”</p><p>In the nineties and two-thousands, researchers became better and better at extracting DNA, including from extremely small samples. In 2003, the human genome was sequenced—Church’s own DNA was the first to be publicly released. Numerous animal genomes followed. In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier developed <em>Crispr</em>, which relies on molecular machinery borrowed from bacteria to slice out genetic material from the nucleus of a cell and replace it with different genetic code. In 2014, the <em>Times</em> published its first article on the technology, declaring, “A genome can be edited, much as a writer might change words or fix spelling errors.”</p><p>Some scientists realized that <em>Crispr</em> could be used to insert a replica of an ancient DNA fragment into the cells of a closely related modern organism. The resulting hybrid creature might not be an exact copy of an extinct animal, but it could look very similar to the ancestor and thrive in the same ecosystem. Scientists soon found, however, that playing around with ancient DNA was harder than they expected. The samples they recovered were often damaged or impure; removing DNA from a fossilized bone sometimes damaged it further. Trying to accurately re-create an ancient genome involved looking at a modern cousin and estimating, by reverse engineering, which gene went where. Beth Shapiro, a noted ancient-DNA researcher who is now the chief science officer at Colossal, said, “We have to figure out how to build a trillion-piece puzzle while working with pieces that were left outside during a hurricane, using the picture of a slightly different puzzle on the top of the box, and the contents of more than a hundred and fifty thousand different puzzles inside”—that is, the DNA of all the microbes and fungi that got into the animal’s bone after it died.</p><p>In 2003, a group of European scientists tried to clone a recently extinct mammal called the bucardo, a mountain goat from the Pyrenees. The group used DNA that had been taken from the last living bucardo and then cryogenically frozen. They inserted the nuclei of bucardo cells into the eggs of fifty-seven goats, and then implanted them. Seven goats became pregnant; six had miscarriages, but one kid was born—with a malformed lung. Ten minutes later, that kid died, making the bucardo the only species to have gone extinct twice.</p><p>While struggling with the science, researchers were also contending with ethical objections to such projects. What if an extinct species’ original habitat was gone? Would you just be creating zoo animals? Was it immoral to alter an animal’s genome? Might concocted creatures suffer in unforeseen ways from the genetic changes? As with the bucardo, would you be allowing the same tragedy to occur a second time? In 2018, Shapiro, who was then running a lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz, made a striking remark to the <em>Wall Street Journal:</em> “There is no point in bringing the dodo back. Their eggs will be eaten the same way that made them go extinct the first time.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Scientists such as Church were not daunted by the difficulty of the science or the ethical thickets involved. But in time they found a more persuasive framework for the deëxtinction concept which moved it out of the realm of fringe science. They emphasized that revived woolly mammoths, dodos, and the like would not just be curios. These creatures had once played valuable roles in nature, and their absence had left gaps. Returning the missing animals to their original ecosystems would help bring their habitats back into balance. Colossal, alert to this reorientation, focussed its ambition on species reintroduction.</p><figure><p><span>Colossal’s focus is on reviving what are known as “charismatic megafauna”—animals cute or scary or striking enough that their absence has left a significant mark on human consciousness. In addition to the dire-wolf project, the company has teams devoted to bringing back the woolly mammoth, the dodo, and the thylacine, a marsupial with the face of a fox and the stripes of a zebra.</span><span>Illustration by Armando Veve</span></p></figure><p>Scientists at the company decided to take inspiration not from “Jurassic Park” but from recent “rewilding” efforts. One project that they often cited was the reintroduction of the gray wolf to Yellowstone National Park, in the nineteen-nineties. Headlines at the time had focussed on how angry the return of wolves had made local ranchers—gray wolves occasionally kill livestock, just as thylacines did. But, ecologists noted, the absence of wolves had left elk with few natural predators, and their population had exploded; their overgrazing had decimated vegetation that had sustained beavers and birds. Once the wolves were reintroduced, the number of elk declined and the park regained its equilibrium.</p><p>In interviews and at public events, Church emphasized that the reintroduction of the woolly mammoth could bring similar benefits to Siberia. By trampling shrubs, the beasts would encourage the growth of grasses that are good at absorbing greenhouse gases. In the winter, the mammoths, with their enormous weight, would tamp down snow, trapping methane—a greenhouse gas—that would otherwise be released by melting permafrost. Reviving the woolly mammoth, Church told CNBC in September, 2021, would bring Siberia “back to what, from a human standpoint at least, was a healthier ecosystem.”</p><p>Shapiro again played the skeptic. She opposed the idea of deëxtincting the woolly mammoth, arguing that creating one or two sample creatures would be cruel, given that they were likely highly social animals. She maintained that elephants do not do well in captivity or with assisted reproduction. And she insisted that elephants, instead of being impregnated with genetically edited embryos, “should be allowed to make more elephants.”</p><p>Shapiro is no longer Colossal’s gadfly. She started working with the company as an adviser in December, 2021, and became a full-time employee last year. Having pioneered techniques for the retrieval of ancient DNA and led a team at U.C. Santa Cruz that sequenced the dodo genome, she has a reputation in the world of genetics research that equals Church’s. But, if Church is deëxtinction’s id, Shapiro is its superego. She has expressed wariness, publicly, of projects that seem exploitative or merely flashy. Lamm began courting Shapiro soon after Colossal was founded. By that point, she had secured a lucrative appointment as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, so money wasn’t a strong lure. But she was impressed by how deeply he understood her work. He also caught her at a good time. She’d been instrumental in establishing the field of DNA recovery, and had won a MacArthur Fellowship, but, she told me, she was worried that her specialty had lost its Indiana Jones glamour and had become “routine—just another application of evolutionary biology.” She had noted, with approval, Church’s shift away from deëxtinction and toward rewilding, to creating “<em>proxies</em> for these extinct species&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so they are useful in some way to the ecosystem.” In the spring of 2024, she signed on as the chief scientist for Colossal. “The money is about the same, but I’m trading tenure for stock options,” she joked to me.</p><p>In February, Shapiro joined Lamm and three other Colossal scientists in a nondescript twenty-five-thousand-square-foot lab in the Dallas Market area. Two more researchers joined the meeting on Zoom. Lamm divides his staff according to the animal they are trying to revive: Michael Abrams is one of the heads of the woolly-mammoth team; Sara Ord leads the thylacine group; Anna Keyte is in charge of the dodo project. Shapiro supervises them all, on both scientific and ethical matters. Lamm explained to me that he ran his operation more like a tech startup than like a typical lab: “There’s a healthy competition between the species leads.”</p><p>The woolly-mammoth group began the meeting. Abrams said that the team was about to publish a paper about some thirty mice that had been given genes to replicate the hair-growth patterns and cold-resistance capabilities of woolly mammoths. Trying out their research on mice was easier than doing so on elephants—for one thing, the average gestation period for a mouse is three weeks, whereas an elephant’s is twenty-two months, the longest of any mammal. Abrams said that the paper—which documented “a lot of really cool technology”—would be posted online in two weeks, on a site that makes research studies public before they are peer-reviewed; Colossal would try to explain its techniques to other biologists at the same time that its publicity team lofted them into the news cycle. Of course, the paper might not be accepted by a peer-reviewed journal. Lamm was clearly comfortable with the arrangement.</p><p>Abrams’s colleague Austin Bow, who was on the Zoom screen, said that the mammoth group had just got their hands on a promising new fibroblast line “derived from an Asian-elephant skin sample.” Fibroblast cells, which produce connective tissue, are crucial to gene editing and are easy to obtain. They can be stripped down to basic, flexible cells that can then be turned into any kind of cell in the body. A good fibroblast line maintains its genetic makeup over time even as it divides. The better the fibroblast line, the easier it would be to grow Asian-elephant cells that contained woolly-mammoth DNA and implant them in an embryo.</p><p>“Rocking the mammoth world here!” Shapiro said.</p><p>Ord, from the thylacine group, broke in with some news of her own. About a year earlier, the group, working in partnership with Australian researchers, had sequenced the animal’s DNA from a head preserved in ethanol at a museum in Melbourne. Colossal described it as the most complete sequencing ever done on an extinct nonhuman animal, mapping the thylacine’s genes with more than ninety-nine-per-cent accuracy. In October, 2024, Colossal announced that the group had successfully made three hundred edits to the DNA of a mouse-size marsupial called the fat-tailed dunnart, a living cousin of the thylacine with suction-cup ears and a ferocious appetite. The alterations would approximate aspects of the thylacine’s phenotype—the observable characteristics of a creature. The team had also discovered how to induce ovulation in the dunnart. The next step was to transfer a nucleus with the edited DNA into a dunnart ovum. But this was proving challenging. The mechanics of marsupial reproduction are not well studied. The exterior membrane of a dunnart ovum, which is about 0.2 millimetres in diameter, turns out to be very difficult to penetrate, Ord explained. The team had even used lasers to try to pierce the tissue. The ovum was so tough that they initially thought the laser was defective, but when they focussed the beam on a mouse ovum it “just blew up.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60489&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60489" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“What it lacks in flavor it makes up for in how much I made and don’t want to waste.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Sophie Lucido Johnson and Sammi Skolmoski</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>That’s when, Ord continued, a colleague on the team with a background in mosquito genetics suggested trying to penetrate the dunnart ovum with a probe made of quartz, which is one of the hardest minerals in existence. The probe worked. Ord showed a video of it piercing the wall of the cell. Everyone applauded. Now they could take the nucleus out of the ovum, insert the nucleus containing the thylacine genes, and watch an embryo grow.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Speaking of difficult challenges, what’s up with the birds?” Shapiro asked.</p><p>Keyte, the dodo director, reported that her group had been looking at the ninety thousand genetic differences between the dodo and its extant relatives, trying to map out which gene or genes were responsible for which characteristic. “I feel like a kid in a candy shop, because some of the genes that have come up on that are so cool,” she said enthusiastically. One bird whose DNA they had looked at was the Rodrigues solitaire—like the dodo, a flightless bird that had lived on an island east of Madagascar. The solitaire went extinct at the end of the eighteenth century, roughly a century after the dodo. The two birds have closely related genomes; both are distant relatives of pigeons. “You have a flighted bird that goes to an island, and it gets larger—it doesn’t need to fly anymore,” Keyte said. She had found a flight-related gene that had become inactive, giving the team a clue as to which of the genes in the dodo’s nearest living cousin, the Nicobar pigeon, they would need to alter to make Colossal’s avians earthbound, too.</p><p>Keyte added that her team was still a long way from bringing back the dodo. For one thing, the methods for growing and manipulating the embryonic precursors of avian sperm and eggs in a lab setting have been developed for only two birds: the chicken and, recently, the goose. Keyte said, “It’s been almost twenty years since culture conditions for the chicken were established, and those culture conditions have not worked for other bird species, even ones that are really closely related, like quail.” She added that, despite the dearth of related research, her team was getting better at growing the sperm-and-egg precursors in birds: “We’ve gotten to the point where we feel like we can start doing some migration assays”—a technique for studying how the cells in an early embryo begin to differentiate. Once the researchers got the basic method for growing bird cells down, they could use the technology not just to develop a dodo but also to help replenish populations of endangered birds. The team had already identified some species that could use the help.</p><p>“Awesome,” Shapiro said.</p><p>After the meeting ended, Lamm and I returned to his office. Colossal’s current lab space was just temporary—next door, the company was building a thirty-million-dollar state-of-the-art headquarters that is scheduled to open in June. Earlier, Lamm had walked me through the construction site, noting that the entrance would feature a ten-foot acrylic model of a woolly mammoth locked in simulated ice and shrouded in an emotive haze produced by a dry-ice machine. The model was being made by Wētā Workshop, the special-effects company that worked on the “Lord of the Rings” films. Peter Jackson, the director of that franchise, has invested several million dollars in Colossal.</p><p>In Lamm’s office, a wilted T. rex-shaped helium balloon peered out from a corner. I noticed a copy of Church’s book on deëxtinction, “Regenesis.” It “wasn’t easy going,” Lamm told me. He gave me a book he loved, “The Next 500 Years,” by Christopher E. Mason, a professor of genomics, physiology, and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine, in New York; it’s about how to biohack humans so that we can travel to distant planets.</p><p>Colossal’s roster of investors includes not only Jackson—who told Lamm that the company’s work is as fun as making movies—but also Paris Hilton. Image is very important to Lamm, who explained to me that his backers want to be associated with something exciting and sexy. He showed me some promotional videos that the company had made. These videos seemed to be pitched at the casually interested viewer—perhaps the sort of student he was as a young man—rather than at the ecological faithful. The voice-over in the videos, which nodded ironically to the steely voices of old-fashioned science documentaries, urged younger viewers to think of deëxtinction technology as cool. One clip ended with a voice grab from HBO’s “Game of Thrones”—“Here’s to the young wolf!” No one was going to confuse Colossal with the Sierra Club. The video, which showed the mechanics of deëxtinction as if they were starships hitting hyperdrive, was made by the genre-film director Michael Dougherty. “Mike did ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters,’&nbsp;” Lamm said, with pride. “He did ‘Krampus.’&nbsp;”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This sort of hype has made Colossal an object of wariness in the scientific community, which prizes rigor and transparency. Hank Greely, a Stanford Law School professor with an expertise in bioscience, told me, “I understand why businesses often want to avoid disclosing as much as a peer-reviewed publication might require,” adding, “I know and like Beth Shapiro&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and trust her quite a bit.” Still, he concluded, he would be happier to see their data available for other scientists to evaluate.</p><p>To build bridges with conservationists, Colossal has partnered with dozens of environmental organizations and promises to share with them any new techniques it develops, free of charge. It has created a foundation to distribute spinoff technology and given it fifty million dollars in funding. Bringing Shapiro on board was an important part of this outreach effort. (The company currently employs a hundred and thirty-two scientists—a cohort larger than many university biology faculties. It also funds forty postdocs at other institutions.) Lamm has won over other important figures. Love Dalén, a top woolly-mammoth researcher and a professor of evolutionary genomics in Sweden, was at first put off by Colossal’s swagger, but he told me he became convinced that Lamm and his startup were “dead serious at giving deëxtinction the best shot they can.” He is now on Colossal’s board of scientific advisers. The money that the company has raised, he said, “could of course have been better spent in protection of habitat, getting rid of invasive species, and combatting poaching.” But, he noted, “conservation funding is not a zero-sum game.” Lamm, Dalén felt, tapped funders who would not ordinarily give to, say, the World Wildlife Fund. The money invested in Colossal, he told me, would otherwise have gone to “some other tech companies, Bitcoin, the defense industry, or whatever.” And Colossal’s research is having valuable knock-on effects. Its work on woolly mammoths, Dalén said, is leading to a vaccine against elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus, which, by some estimates, accounts for up to two-thirds of Asian-elephant deaths in captivity and a significant number in the wild. Ideas for the design of the vaccine, which is in field trials, came about through Colossal’s experience with mRNA manipulation and its research on the elephant genome. Mammoths appear to have been susceptible to the virus, too. (Lamm told me, with typical immodesty, “If successful, the vaccine will over time save more elephants than all of elephant conservation in history.”)</p><p>Lamm credits Elon Musk with stoking investors’ appetites to do “bigger things.” He adds, “I think people are, like, ‘Wow, we can do big, crazy things <em>and</em> there is a chance that we get a return on them.’&nbsp;” So far, Lamm’s investors have no reason to question their support. A month before I visited Colossal, the startup had completed its fourth round of funding. This time, it raised two hundred million dollars, adding to the two hundred and thirty-five million it already had. The company’s current valuation is $10.2 billion—on par with Moderna, the vaccine company. (One person who might miss out on getting rich from Colossal is Church, who, during the initial steps of founding the company, opted for a direct investment in his Harvard lab rather than equity. He has no regrets. Referring to Lamm, he told <em>Forbes</em>, “The fact that I’m not a billionaire is almost as interesting as Ben being one.”)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Colossal has already birthed three startups. The first, Form Bio, is developing machine-learning technology that can help pinpoint the optimal cuts that <em>Crispr</em> can make while editing genes. This would have applications to, say, the attempt to treat genetic conditions such as sickle-cell anemia or Huntington’s disease, and also to drug discovery and development. The second startup, Breaking, is making use of the advances Colossal has made in gene manipulation to reëngineer X-32, a microorganism that naturally degrades plastics, to increase its efficacy. “It takes plastics that have not broken down ever before and breaks them down in twenty-two months,” Lamm boasted. The third spinoff, he told me, was still “in stealth mode,” and he would not talk about it.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28741&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28741" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Everyone’s just fishing for a thank-you card.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Liana Finck</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In truth, nearly everything Colossal is doing could find for-profit uses, since the attempt to genetically engineer, implant, gestate, and then birth an extinct animal touches on so many common health challenges. Currently, once the company has an embryo ready to grow, researchers insert it in a host animal, but such surrogates are limited in number and expensive to work with, and come with many potential health complications. Birth can also be traumatic—elephants rarely survive a Cesarean section, which is how many animals gestated in surrogates are born. So the company is working to replace the surrogates it would use—the Asian elephant for the woolly mammoth, for example—with artificial wombs. Lamm said, “We call it an exo-dev”—for “exogenous development”—“because it sounds less creepy.” (It didn’t.) Such technology could revolutionize human surrogate births, removing the ethical and emotional complications of the practice, not to mention the risks of pregnancy. “That field alone is a hundred-billion-dollar spinoff,” Lamm told me. An unaffiliated investment-advisory firm, Brownstone Research, has estimated that the “addressable market” for an exo-dev system for humans would be worth at least twenty billion dollars.</p><p>There is even money to be made in deëxtinction itself. While we were in Lamm’s office, he pulled up a slide titled “Rewilding: Monetization,” which showed a sketch of woolly mammoths in a chilly mountainous landscape. It was easy to imagine tourists gawking at the site.</p><p>“Jurassic Park!” I said.</p><p>“No, no, no, no, no,” Lamm responded. “That was an exaggerated zoo. This is letting the animals <em>live</em> in their natural habitats.” The distinction wasn’t entirely obvious to me, but I let him continue.</p><p>He explained that I was looking at a plan for a restored ecosystem. It was also a perfectly adapted money machine. There was a large area where the ancient elephants could graze, and this would be funded, in part, by carbon-offset payments from governments and corporations. The carbon value of a single elephant is about two million dollars, he told me. (An elephant increases biodiversity, in part, by spreading seeds in its dung and by crushing dense vegetation on forest floors, giving slow-growing trees the space to survive.) He added that the interesting educational opportunities and “sexiness factor” of Colossal’s creations would make its carbon credits “trade at a premium.” Rewilding could also provide value for nations that host revived animals. Shapiro had told me that when she visited Mauritius, where the dodo once lived, officials expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of increasing ecotourism. Lamm said, “If we are increasing the G.D.P. from tourism because of dodos, then we should partake in that.”</p><p>What about selling Colossal-created animals as pets? “We’re not in that business,” Lamm told me, adding, “I think you know us better than to even ask this.”</p><p>It was nearly time to see Colossal’s dire wolves. Since I was first shown the image of the two pups, I’d been told that a third had been born. She was equally cute. I’d also seen a photograph of one of the pups in the arms of George R.&nbsp;R. Martin, the author whose books were the basis of the “Game of Thrones” series, in which dire wolves feature prominently. “I used to watch the show, and I didn’t even think dire wolves were real,” Lamm told me. The entire dire-wolf operation had been done in stealth mode, and everyone involved had to sign nondisclosure agreements, including Martin.</p><p>Before making my travel plans, I spoke with Colossal’s chief animal officer, Matt James, who was low-key and modest compared with his voluble colleagues. “I just play with animals, mostly,” he explained. He said that he had recently been at an enclosure where Colossal had birthed four cloned red wolves—an animal that, despite being protected under the Endangered Species Act, was becoming rarer and rarer in the wild. As far as he knew, these pups were the first cloned red wolves ever. He added that, for the cloning process, Colossal scientists had used a new procedure that was less stressful for the genetic-donor animal. Usually, a biopsy is required to get clonable cells, but the scientists had figured out a way to obtain them merely by drawing blood. The new technique had been perfected by the dire-wolf team.</p><p>In “Game of Thrones,” the dire wolves are as big as lions. In reality, the dire wolf probably weighed about a hundred and fifty pounds, and it was only somewhat larger than today’s gray wolf. It also had more powerful jaws and a bigger head than a gray wolf. Dire wolves became extinct some twelve thousand years ago, at the end of the age of giant mammals. Most likely, their vanishing was not the result of direct contact with humans but, rather, was caused by the depletion of the large animals that were key to their diet. Dire wolves mostly ate horses and bison, with occasional forays into giant sloths and baby mammoths.</p><p>I was curious about how the dire wolf had slipped onto Colossal’s agenda, which was so clearly focussed on the three other extinct animals. Given Lamm’s alpha personality, it seemed possible that he simply wanted Colossal to dominate the deëxtinction space: it had begun with three animals, but why not four? Or perhaps the company, having made huge promises, felt the need to give concrete proof that it was making progress. According to James, the woolly mammoth’s due date had slipped from 2026 to 2028 after he pointed out the elephant’s long gestation period and other reproductive challenges. (Lamm says that Colossal is on track for 2028.)</p><p>Questions about Colossal’s timetables were evidently sensitive. During a tour of the lab with Lamm and the various species heads, I was escorted from workstation to workstation, so that I could better understand the high-tech genetic manipulations that would make the regenerated animals. It felt as if we were in the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre in “Brave New World.” I asked Ord, the thylacine-team head, and Keyte, the dodo-team leader, when their animals would be resurrected.</p><p>“This decade,” Ord told me.</p><p>“The dodo is on track for this decade as well!” Keyte answered, competitively.</p><p>“<em>No dates</em>,” Lamm shot back.</p><p>As for the dire wolf, Lamm told me that the decision to put it at the front of the line was not because the company was impatient with its difficult marquee projects. In 2023, at a two-day conference with the team heads and Colossal’s advisory-board scientists, the attendees had whiteboarded what other animals might fit their guidelines for deëxtinction, and the dire wolf had generated a lot of enthusiasm. Lamm said that he had recently been visiting with people from Indigenous tribes, and many spoke of missing wolves, which had been central to their cultures. “There was this desire to bring back what they called the Great Wolf,” he claimed. Another reason—“and this is <em>really</em> important,” Lamm said—was that dire wolves are top-line talent in pop culture. They aren’t just in “Game of Thrones.” Dire wolves have starring roles in the video game World of Warcraft, the collectible-card game Magic: The Gathering, and the role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Lamm added that the Grateful Dead even have a song called “Dire Wolf.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Colossal scientists began working on birthing a dire wolf in the summer of 2023. As I suspected, they were confident that the process would go faster than it was going with mammoths, dodos, and thylacines, in part because the genetics of dogs are among the best known of any nonhuman mammal. “It’s because people want to sequence their dogs and then talk about them,” Shapiro explained to me. Still, dogs and wolves split from each other some fifteen thousand years ago, and their genes have diverged over that time. “We had to develop a lot of resources for wolves, because they hadn’t been invented yet,” Shapiro said. “How to keep wolf cells healthy in culture, what to edit, et cetera. It’s still easier than a mammoth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it’s orders of magnitude harder than a mouse.” Colossal hired experts in cell editing and wolf embryology and behavior.</p><p>The first problem the group encountered was where to get dire-wolf DNA good enough to use in sequencing the extinct animal’s genes. Shapiro happened to know as much about the topic as anyone in the world—in 2021, she had co-written a paper that traced the dire wolf’s lineage by using recovered DNA. While doing that research, she had examined the available dire-wolf fossils and found very little genetic material in them. But sampling techniques had grown more sensitive in the intervening years, and she decided to revisit the fossils. Two proved particularly useful. One was a piece of a dire-wolf tooth from Sheriden Cave, a late-Ice Age fossil pit in Ohio; the tooth was thought to be about thirteen thousand years old. The second candidate was a nearly complete skull from Idaho, found at the American Falls Reservoir. The skull was estimated to be more than seventy thousand years old, but contained an intact petrous—an inner-ear bone whose cells are densely packed, an arrangement that inhibits the entry of fungi and microorganisms that destroy DNA.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Because ancient-DNA reconstruction involves removing a small piece of bone, it puts delicate fossils at risk. Institutions aren’t always eager to oblige. But Shapiro had the clout to get the tooth shipped to her lab in Santa Cruz, and she sent one of her students to the museum in Idaho where the skull was kept. Nevertheless, she was nervous to begin drilling. Lamm reassured her: “Beth, you’re the No. 1 person in ancient DNA. I’m confident that you can do this. Like, you’ve done this a thousand times.” She used a dentist’s drill to make a small hole in the tooth and extracted powder containing billions of fragments of DNA. She then tagged each strand in such a way that a DNA-sequencing machine could read the order of the nucleotides—adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C)—well enough to provide a blueprint for engineering new cell lines. Lamm told me that the “Eureka moment” arrived when Colossal scientists realized that they would be able to establish much of the dire-wolf genome.(They ended up at ninety-one per cent.) Such efforts are never perfect. “There are errors in every genome that’s been assembled,” Shapiro pointed out.</p><p>The group then compared the DNA of the dire wolves with DNA sequences from gray-wolf cell lines. The gray wolf is the dire wolf’s closest living relative—they share 99.5 per cent of their DNA. If a gene does something in the gray wolf, the same gene in dire-wolf DNA likely codes for the same trait. The scientists’ goal was to alter the gray-wolf genome in ways that might make the resulting creature more like a dire wolf: principally, larger, with an increased head size and fluffy, light-colored fur.</p><p>The scientists could tell, based on the variation in key pigmentation genes, that dire wolves—like Ghost in “Game of Thrones”—had very pale coats. But the genes that guided coat color presented a problem: they carried with them a risk of blindness and deafness. (In humans, variations of these genes can lead to Waardenburg syndrome, which causes pigmentation deficiencies, among other problems.) So the group decided to edit a different gene that, when expressed in dogs, also codes for a lighter coat. This might make the dire wolf less authentic, but it would be better for the new creatures. “Otherwise, this animal is going to live out a suboptimal life because of choices <em>you made</em>,” Lamm pointed out. After almost a year of computational genetic analysis, Colossal researchers used <em>Crispr</em> to make twenty edits on fourteen genes. Fifteen edits were derived from Colossal’s study of the dire-wolf genome and five tweaks were derived from scrutiny of the gray-wolf genome. A Colossal-affiliated scientist spoke to me at length about which specific genes were altered, but the discussion was off the record, at the insistence of Lamm, who called such details the “company’s I.P.”</p><p>By mid-2024, Colossal researchers were watching thousands of edited cell lines grow in petri dishes stored inside incubators. Several cell lines stopped growing—perhaps because <em>Crispr</em> had mistakenly removed a bit of DNA or added code in the wrong place, or because the cell lines had other defects, or because they simply weren’t vigorous enough to keep dividing. By late summer, nuclei containing the edited genome were inserted into dog ova whose DNA had been removed. Forty-five embryos were placed inside two dogs. “Mutts, like a hound mix,” Lamm said. (Among other things, dog breeding is better understood than that of wolves.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Only two embryos—one in each surrogate mother—grew to term. The gestation period was about sixty days, similar to that of gray wolves. The pregnant dogs were kept under supervision at a secure animal center and given weekly ultrasounds, starting about halfway through their term, to insure that the fetuses were growing normally. Lamm remembers “a chronic level of stress and anxiety knowing we were breaking new ground every day.”</p><p>On October 1, 2024, veterinarians—who had also signed N.D.A.s—delivered the pups, by Cesarean section. The team had hoped for vaginal births, James said, but as the weeks went on “there was a concern that there would be a size mismatch”—that the dire-wolf babies could be too big. When the pups were born, Lamm and Shapiro had just arrived in London for the première of a movie on ancient DNA. Lamm, whose first child had been born five months earlier, watched the dire-wolf births on FaceTime as James trained his phone on the operating table. The pups were large (one of them, James told me, was twice the normal weight of a gray wolf at birth) and white (gray wolves are born with very dark coats), with unusually robust heads. The pups were whining and crying. “I’m holding the first dire-wolf cubs in twelve thousand years,” James pronounced, adding, “It’s sort of surreal.”</p><p>For the first few days, the dire-wolf pups nursed on one of the dog moms, but, according to James, the mother “wasn’t able to keep up with their metabolic needs,” and they were switched to bottles. The two mutts were soon adopted by families, through the American Humane Society, without any mention of their role in lupine history. Lamm told me that he is very proud of how quickly the project came to fruition: “Within eighteen months of our putting the name ‘dire wolf’ down on a whiteboard, we birthed dire wolves!”</p><p>I asked Lamm when a university lab would have completed a comparable effort.</p><p>“Never,” he replied.</p><p>On March 25th, I went to meet the two older pups, named Romulus and Remus. (The third pup, named Khaleesi—for the light-haired protagonist of “Game of Thrones”—was not yet ready for visitors, I was told.) I was given directions to a one-acre enclosure at a location in the northern U.S. The dire wolves normally live on a two-thousand-acre property far from the spot where I was headed. “They live like kings there,” Lamm told me. As I drove up to the enclosure, I saw Church, looking like Gandalf, with a bushy white beard, and Lamm, who, with his luxuriant, glossy facial hair, resembles Jon Snow, Ghost’s master. Matt James was present, and a phalanx of animal-care officers stood in a corner, in case there were problems.</p><p>I suddenly saw two shocks of white—the young dire wolves. Both attentive and wary, the animals seemed not from this world. They were impressively large: roughly eighty pounds apiece, at five months old. Lamm told me that they would likely weigh about a hundred and forty pounds at maturity—at least twenty pounds more than a large adult male gray wolf.</p><p>James said, of the pups, “It’s hard to tell their girth, because they’re so hairy.”</p><p>Church recalled when he could almost hold a pup in each hand—he’d seen them twelve weeks after their birth.</p><p>Much of the dire wolves’ behavior reminded me of dogs’. Romulus and Remus rested on their haunches in the sun. They chased falling leaves; they chewed sticks. One peed, and the other hurried over to roll in it. Other aspects seemed wolflike—when Romulus got nervous, he did a sideways slide while facing us. (James explained to me that this maneuver is a way to both check out a threat and look as large as possible.) And, when the wolves ran, they loped as if their lower legs had an extra joint. They didn’t howl, and their footfalls were silent. Was this distinctive dire-wolf behavior? How could anyone say?</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26637&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26637" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Your name doesn’t happen to be Pam, does it? Not a deal-breaker, but it would save me some time and money.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Asher Perlman</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Though Romulus and Remus are identical twins—they came from the same engineered cell line—I could see that they were already behaving differently. Remus was braver. He would come up within ten feet of us, then think better of it. Romulus hung back. They both gave off a sense of biding their time; since nothing formidable had yet been asked of them, they had done nothing formidable. But they could; their bodies were clearly powerful. At one point, Remus seemed interested in getting behind us—he stopped when James looked at him—and I was reminded of the legend on the Dire Wolves card in Magic: The Gathering: “It’s amazing how scared a city kid can get at a dog.” I was told to keep a respectful distance. Lamm, though, seemed unafraid. “I pet Remus last week,” he said proudly. “But, you know, that’s because I’ve been around them forever.” (James says that around the time they enter puberty—at roughly a year old—they will likely be deemed too aggressive to be petted ever again. “We’re about to hit a trigger point,” he said.)</p><p>Church was eagerly looking for signs that the molecular engineering had done more than make Colossal’s wolves large and fluffy. The team had targeted an enhancer sequence that could produce the dire wolf’s pronounced muzzle and ears. James explained that cranial attributes take a while to develop. “I can hardly wait for the annual checkup,” Church said. “That’s where we’re going to learn, you know, where these phenotypes really distinguish them from the gray wolf.”</p><p>James said that Church would get his chance when the pups had full CT scans this fall, after turning one. “That’ll give us an opportunity to really look at musculoskeletal changes,” he said. Meanwhile, Lamm took more of a horse-breeder’s approach. The two wolves began to lope, then briefly run. “Watch! Watch the fur, watch the thickness,” he said. “You can see the musculature in the sun. Do you see it—shoulders? Side? Back? That’s not typical.”</p><p>“And the way the wind ruffles them,” Church added. “There we go. Watch the fur!”</p><p>Mike Dougherty had made a video for Colossal to proclaim the dire wolves’ birth. A voice declared, “We are pleased to announce that, for the first time ever in history, we have successfully resurrected a prehistoric pop-culture icon.” The dire wolves also got a boost from the Trump Administration. The Department of the Interior had sent Colossal a draft statement heralding the births as proof that “innovation—not regulation—had spawned American greatness.”</p><p>After seeing the wolves, though, I wondered how many people would accept that what I had just seen was a resurrection. Romulus and Remus embodied a lot of breakthroughs. No one else, Colossal said, had ever made so many precision edits to an animal genome at once. Nobody had ever birthed a mammal that had ancient DNA in it. “This is the first time these genes have been expressed in over ten thousand years,” Lamm pointed out. But to what extent were the pups dire wolves—as opposed to, say, gray wolves with some of the dire wolf’s physical traits? Did they act like dire wolves? No effort had been made to try to identify genes for behavior. Did they think or smell or sound like the extinct animals? “It’s not possible to bring back something exactly the way it was,” Shapiro told me, several times. That was a childish goal of the sort that had led her to challenge deëxtinction for so many years. She pointed out that, even within species, there was genetic variability, and environment and nongenetic factors alter living organisms. You had only to look at Romulus’s and Remus’s different personalities.</p><p>I spoke to Elinor Karlsson, a program director at the Broad Institute, a joint Harvard and M.I.T. facility. An expert on wolf and dog genetics, she is a member of Colossal’s advisory board. But she told me that she has some doubts about the company’s messaging: “I ask Beth, ‘Why are you calling this a dire wolf when it’s a gray wolf with seventeen or eighteen changes in its DNA?’&nbsp;” Shapiro has countered that she did what she set out to do: “We’ve succeeded in creating the <em>phenotype</em> of a dire wolf.”</p><p>This battle over definition had gone through a trial run just a few weeks earlier. Colossal had announced the existence of the “woolly mouse” that Abrams had spoken about at the species-lead meeting. The story was picked up everywhere—there were five billion media impressions in two weeks, Lamm told me. John Oliver and “Saturday Night Live” each played off it. (Colin Jost: “Now it’s on to step two—getting it drunk enough to have sex with an elephant.”) <em>Mashable</em> wrote that scientists had “accidentally created the cutest mice in the world.”</p><p>Science journalists were more cautious. They took issue with the fact that Colossal had used analogous genes from mice, not woolly-mammoth DNA, to achieve the effect of long, thick hair. A professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Buffalo did tell the Associated Press that the work was “technologically pretty cool.” But <em>Nature</em> noted that a Maine research facility has been offering its own long-haired mouse strain, named Wooly, for sale to scientists for the past twenty years.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Lamm was irritated when I mentioned the response to him. “We are the most advanced multicellular-synthetic-biology company on the planet,” he told me. The science behind the woolly mouse had been extraordinary, he reiterated—researchers had successfully made multiple gene edits on a living organism at the same time, a precursor to the quadruple-axel gene editing used in re-creating the dire wolf. “It was the most unique germ-line edit in any animal to date,” he said.</p><p>I asked Lamm if perhaps some overpromising by the Colossal brand had tamped down the applause. The word “de-extinction” appears nearly five hundred times on the company’s website; ordinary people could be excused for thinking that the word referred to creating an exact genetic replica of a once alive animal. Lamm responded, “I was warned when I started this business that some of the scientific community will be, if we are successful, jealous and somewhat frustrated.” He added, “You would think spending half a billion on deëxtinction and conservation would get them excited.”</p><p>Shapiro was more philosophical: “The pushback that we’re going to get from everybody is that it is not a hundred per cent of the way to the dire wolf. But we want to say with confidence that we’ve done this <em>functional</em> deëxtinction, and I think we have.” She added, “You know, as a scientist, would I have wanted to add another hundred million edits to the genome, to see what happened? Maybe—I mean, I don’t know.”</p><p>Church, for his part, is still hoping for a day when an entire extinct-mammal genome can be synthesized. Building a complete genome would likely be vastly harder than sequencing one and then synthesizing only small portions of it, but Church thinks that it’s technically possible. If you had the whole genome of an animal, and you inserted it into an egg, you would essentially be re-creating an individual from that extinct species. He has run the numbers. He told me, “The world has successfully synthesized a yeast genome, which is twelve million base pairs”—the fundamental units of DNA. The woolly mammoth had approximately three billion base pairs. “We’re only two-hundred-fiftyfold away!” he calculated. But Karlsson cautioned me, “We’re extremely far away from that goal now.” Lamm, not shy about big projects, said that filling in every gap in an extinct animal’s genome was “a cold-fusion-level problem.” He added that the difference between using a whole genome and using computational genetics to approximate the useful portions of a genome is “an academic distinction—which is probably why it interests George Church.”</p><p>Until the genome synthesis of mammals becomes a reality, Colossal’s dire wolf may be the closest we can come to the resurrection of charismatic megafauna. Lamm says that Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi will not be allowed to breed; moreover, the company anticipates genetically engineering just three to five more of the animals. They will be kept on their preserve, protected by a ten-foot-high security fence and surveilled by drones—and visited, one suspects, only by the occasional billionaire. Colossal’s wolves are now at the age when their parents would teach them to hunt, but of course they have no parents; in fact, they have never seen other wolves. (There are some deer and squirrels on their two-thousand-acre plot, but that’s about it for other animals.) Perhaps a decade or so from now, when the wolves die—nature cares for nothing, all shall go—this genetic-engineering moon shot may, like the real moon shot, be remembered as much for the amazing new technologies it throws off as for the goal in itself. And the dire wolf may have the distinction, after the poor bucardo, of being the second species brought back to life only to die again.&nbsp;♦</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article misstated the current stage of research on using Asian elephants as surrogates for woolly mammoths.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I’m new to Substack—this is my first post.</p><p>Hey, I’m Matt. I founded Vizzly as a first-time entrepreneur and exited in under three years, selling the company to WPP, the world’s largest advertising organization. A few months after starting the company, we were accepted into Y-Combinator, and I spent about four months engrossed in San Francisco’s tech hustle culture learning from people much smarter than I. I’m not anti-SF (far from it; I have some incredible memories there), but I didn’t buy into the all-or-nothing mindset of startups. </p><p>It’s worth noting that after Demo Day, we set out to raise more than we ended up with—essentially, a failed Seed round. At the time, I saw this as a negative, assuming fundraising was a form of validation (turns out it’s not, by the way).</p><p>A year later, I came to realize that this was the best thing to happen to both the company and myself. For starters, it forced us to become very revenue-centric.</p><p>Additionally, it opened the door to smaller acquisitions. Because our preference stack (more on this later) was tiny, even a relatively small deal would produce a life-changing outcome for the founding team.</p><p>Writing this, I could go in a million directions—and I probably will in future posts, diving into different aspects. For now, I’ll focus on the 'missing middle path.'</p><p>On my LinkedIn feed, it feels like there are two dominant narratives in B2B SaaS: the VC path—go big or go home, maybe take a secondary at Series A or B, but push hard no matter what—or the Bootstrapper route—build sustainable value with an asset you own on a shoestring budget, and reap the rewards of cash flow and dividends.</p><p>What’s rarely talked about is the third path: raise a small amount—say, less than $1M—while keeping 90%+ of your equity, avoiding board seats, and building for profitability and strong asset value. All without draining your personal finances or spending a decade bootstrapping through revenue.</p><p>The reason it’s not more popular is that it’s a founder-centric approach that doesn’t fit the venture capital model, making it a controversial stance. In fact, if you pitched this pathway to a VC, I’m sure they’d ghost you quicker than their last Hinge date.</p><p>In short: the top 3% of investments are expected to return the fund and more. So, if you're aiming for a $10M outcome, they won’t be interested. Success and returns often increase with more funding, which is why VCs push for constant fundraising. With a preference stack, they get paid back first, leaving you effectively in debt. This forces you to scale to justify the time and effort needed to generate a meaningful outcome.</p><p><span>For those wondering what a preference stack is, it’s basically the order in which different investors get paid when a startup is sold or liquidated. You might see a headline in </span><em>TechCrunch</em><span> saying a startup has sold for $40M. For all you know, they raised $30M, grinded for eight years, and the deal is 10% cash and 90% equity exchange—meaning the founders involved (assume there are two) are basically exchanging overinflated equity that will probably be subject to a four-year vest. </span></p><p><span>This is obviously a hypothetical and a great outcome based on the probability of a startup's success, but it’s still a pretty modest outcome if you think that’s 12 years of prime life one would have sacrificed (sorry, </span><em>invested</em><span>).</span></p><p>I have an incredible amount of admiration for folks on the venture journey – it’s high risk, high reward, as I do for folks who bootstrap and pursue a more unconventional route. The problem with bootstrapping is simple: not everyone can sustain it.</p><p>Many bootstrapped B2B SaaS startups were agencies beforehand, such as Mailchimp, Basecamp, Lemlist, etc. I probably don’t need to labor this point too much, but this pathway can also take a really long time to create and drive value.</p><p>Of course it’s subjective, but I think the middle path provides the optimal combination of return size, time to return, all with minimal financial risk to the founders involved. For most B2B SaaS businesses, you shouldn’t need more than $1M in capital to get to PMF, find a GTM motion that works (not that it needs to scale), and reach an ARR figure where the revenue multiple for valuation starts to look pretty tasty—enough to offer significant upside even after investors are paid out.</p><p>What no VC will tell you is that there’s a window of opportunity — somewhere between Pre-Seed and Series A — where founders can tap into significant upside. This is rarely discussed, and too many companies fail because they raise too much, only to end up with little to nothing in a liquidation event (as described above).</p><p>We stumbled into the middle path, and I’m grateful for it.</p><p>There are still drawbacks and important factors to consider—particularly how you choose to source your investment.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/04/07/writing-c-for-curl/">https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/04/07/writing-c-for-curl/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43608551">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is a somewhat common question to me: how do we write C in <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> <em>to make it safe and secure for billions of installations</em>? Some precautions we take and decisions we make. There is no silver bullet, just guidelines. As I think you can see for yourself below they are also neither strange nor surprising.</p>



<p>The ‘c’ in curl does not and never did stand for the C programming language, it stands for <em>client</em>.</p>



<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p><strong>This text does in no way mean that we don’t occasionally merge security related bugs.</strong> We do. We are human. We do mistakes. Then we fix them.</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>



<p>We write as many tests as we can. We run all the static code analyzer tools we can on the code – frequently. We run fuzzers on the code non-stop.</p>



<h2>C is not memory-safe</h2>



<p>We are certainly not immune to memory related bugs, mistakes or vulnerabilities. We count about 40% of our security vulnerabilities to date to have been the direct result of us using C instead of a memory-safe language alternative. This is however a much lower number than the 60-70% that are commonly repeated, originating from a few big companies and projects. If this is because of a difference in counting or us actually having a lower amount of C problems, I cannot tell.</p>



<p>Over the last five years, we have received <strong>no</strong> reports identifying a <em>critical</em> vulnerability and only two of them were rated at severity <em>high</em>. The rest ( 60 something) have been at severity <em>low</em> or <em>medium</em>.</p>



<p>We currently have close to 180,000 lines of C89 production code (excluding blank lines). We stick to C89 for widest possible portability and because we believe in continuous non-stop iterating and polishing and never rewriting.</p>



<h2>Readability</h2>



<p>Code should be easy to read. It should be clear. No hiding code under clever constructs, fancy macros or overloading. Easy-to-read code is easy to review, easy to debug and easy to extend.</p>



<p>Smaller functions are easier to read and understand than longer ones, thus preferable.</p>



<p>Code should read as if it was written by a single human. There should be a consistent and uniform code style all over, as that helps us read code better. Wrong or inconsistent code style is a bug. We fix all bugs we find.</p>



<p>We have tooling that verify basic code style compliance.</p>



<h2>Narrow code and short names</h2>



<p>Code should be written narrow. It is hard on the eyes to read long lines, so we enforce a strict 80 column maximum line length. We use two-spaces indents to still allow us to do some amount of indent levels before the column limit becomes a problem. If the indent level becomes a problem, maybe it should be split up in several sub-functions instead?</p>



<p>Also related: (in particular local) identifiers and names should be short. Having long names make them hard to read, especially if there are multiple ones that are similar. Not to mention that they can get hard to fit within 80 columns after some amount of indents.</p>



<p>So many people will now joke and say something about wide screens being available and what not but the key here is readability. Wider code is harder to read. Period. The question could possibly be exactly where to draw the limit, and that’s a debate for every project to have.</p>



<h2>Warning-free</h2>



<p>While it should be natural to everyone already, we of course build all curl code entirely without any compiler warning in any of the 220+ CI jobs we perform. We build curl with all the most picky compiler options that exist with the set of compilers we use, and we silence every warning that appear. We treat every compiler warning as an error.</p>



<h2>Avoid “bad” functions</h2>



<p>There are some C functions that are just plain bad because of their lack of boundary controls or local state and we avoid them (gets, sprintf, strcat, strtok, localtime, etc).</p>



<p>There are some C functions that are complicated in other ways. They have too open ended functionality or do things that often end up problematic or just plain wrong; they easily lead us into doing mistakes. We avoid sscanf and strncpy for those reasons.</p>



<p>We have tooling that <em>bans</em> the use of these functions in our code. Trying to introduce  use of one of them in a pull request causes CI jobs to turn red and alert the author about their mistake.</p>



<h2>Buffer functions</h2>



<p>Years ago we found ourselves having done several mistakes in code that were dealing with different dynamic buffers. We had too many separate implementations working on dynamically growing memory areas. We unified this handling with a new set of internal help functions for growing buffers and now made sure we only use these. This drastically reduces the need for realloc(), which helps us avoid mistakes related to that function.</p>



<p>Each dynamic buffer also has its own maximum size set, which in its simplicity also helps catching mistakes. In the current libcurl code, we have 80 something different <em>dynamic buffers</em>.</p>



<h2>Parsing functions</h2>



<p>I mentioned how we don’t like sscanf. It is a powerful function for parsing, but it often ends up parsing more than what the user wants (for example more than one space even if only one should be accepted) and it has weak (non-existing) handling of integer overflows. Lastly, it steers users into copying parsed results around unnecessarily, leading to superfluous uses of local stack buffers or short-lived heap allocations.</p>



<p>Instead we introduced another set of helper functions for string parsing, and over time we switch all parser code in curl over to using this set. It makes it easier to write strict parsers that only match exactly what we want them to match, avoid extra copies/mallocs and it does strict integer overflow and boundary checks better.</p>



<h2>Monitor memory function use</h2>



<p>Memory problems often involve a dynamic memory allocation followed by a copy of data into the allocated memory area. Or perhaps, if the allocation and the copy are both done correctly there is no problem but if either of them are wrong things can go bad. Therefor we aim toward minimizing that pattern. We rather favor strdup and memory duplication that allocates and copies data in the same call – or uses of the helper functions that may do these things behind their APIs. We run a daily updated graph in the curl dashboard that shows <em>memory function call density</em> in curl. Ideally, this plot will keep falling over time.</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;67f3d35b50110&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="3066" height="1726" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-06-at-13-01-34-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""><figcaption>Memory function call density in curl production code over time</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It can perhaps also be added that we avoid superfluous memory allocations, in particular in hot paths. A large download does not need any more allocations than a small one.</p>



<h2>Double-check multiplications</h2>



<p>Integer overflows is another area for concern. Every arithmetic operation done needs to be done with a certainty that it does not overflow. This is unfortunately still mostly a manual labor, left for human reviews to detect.</p>



<h2>64-bit support guaranteed</h2>



<p>In early 2023 we dropped support for building curl on systems without a functional 64-bit integer type. This simplifies a lot of code and logic. Integer overflows are less likely to trigger and there is no risk that authors accidentally believe they do 64-bit arithmetic while it could end up being 32-bit in some rare builds like could happen in the past. Overflows and mistakes can still happen if using the wrong type of course.</p>



<h2>Maximum string length</h2>



<p>To help us avoid mistakes on strings, in particular with integer overflows, but also with other logic, we have a general check of all string inputs to the library: they do not accept strings longer than a set limit. We deem that any string set that is longer is either just a blatant mistake or some kind of attempt (attack?) to trigger something weird inside the library. We return error on such calls. This maximum limit is right now eight megabytes, but we might adjust this in the future as the world and curl develop.</p>



<h2>keep master golden</h2>



<p>At no point in time is it allowed to break master. We only merge code into master that we believe is clean, fine and runs perfect. This still fails at time, but then we do our best at addressing the situation as quickly as possible.</p>



<h2>Always check for and act on errors</h2>



<p>In curl we always check for errors and we bail out <em>without leaking any memory</em> if (when!) they happen. This includes all memory operations, I/O, file operations and more. All calls.</p>



<p>Some developers are used to modern operating systems basically not being able to return error for some of those, but curl runs in many environments with varying behaviors. Also, a system library cannot <em>exit</em> or <em>abort</em> on errors, it needs to let the application take that decision.</p>



<h2>APIs and ABIs</h2>



<p>Every function and interface that is publicly accessible must <strong>never</strong> be changed in a way that risks breaking the API or ABI. For this reason and to make it easy to spot the functions that need this extra precautions, we have a strict rule: public functions are prefixed with “curl_” and no other functions use that prefix.</p>



<h2>Everyone can do it</h2>



<p>Thanks to the process of human reviewers, plenty of automatic tools and an elaborate and extensive test suite, everyone can (attempt to) write curl code. Assuming you know C of course. The risk that something bad would go in undetected, is roughly equal no matter who the author of the code is. The responsibility is shared.</p>



<p>Go ahead. You can do it!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At a time when the world is down to a single drug that can reliably cure gonorrhea, the U.S. government has shuttered the country’s premier sexually transmitted diseases laboratory, leaving experts aghast and fearful about what lies ahead.</p>



<p>The STD lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a leading player in global efforts to monitor for drug resistance in the bacteria that cause these diseases — was among the targets of major staff slashing at the CDC this past week. All 28 full-time employees of the lab were fired.</p>



<p>STD clinicians and researchers were flummoxed, both because most of the other infectious diseases functions of the CDC were spared in this round of cuts, and because of the critical nature of the work the lab performed. Until the Trump administration announced the United States was withdrawing from the World Health Organization, the CDC lab was one of three international reference laboratories for STDs that worked with the WHO to conduct surveillance for infection rates and drug-resistance patterns and to recommend the best ways to treat these infections. The other two are in Australia and Sweden.</p>



<p>A CDC white paper on antibiotic resistance released during the first Trump administration listed drug-resistant gonorrhea as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five urgent threats</a> facing the country. Antimicrobial resistance to that last drug that reliably works to cure gonorrhea, ceftriaxone, is rare but on the rise globally.</p>



<p>“The loss of this lab is a huge deal to the American people,” said David C. Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, which represents state, city, and U.S. territorial STD prevention programs across the country. “Without that lab, we would have not been able to appropriately diagnose and monitor drug-resistant gonorrhea.”</p>





<p>There has been no explanation from the Department of Health and Human Services, or its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about why the STD lab was closed. When STAT asked the HHS press office about the closure, the response was swift — but wholly unrelated to the question posed.</p>



<p>“The critical work of the CDC will continue under Secretary Kennedy’s vision to streamline HHS to better serve the American people. The reorganization will strengthen the CDC with the transfer of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), responsible for national disaster and public health emergency response, to the agency, reinforcing its core mission to protect Americans from health threats,” Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary, said via email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A follow-up from STAT noting that the information provided was not about the STD lab drew no response.</p>



<p>Though STDs don’t garner as many headlines as Ebola, influenza, or Covid-19, they are among the most common diseases in the world — not just infectious diseases, but diseases period, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases, population, and public health at the USC Keck School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Klausner was shocked by the CDC lab’s closure. “To me, this is like a blind man with a chainsaw has just gone through the system and arbitrarily cut things without any rationale,” he said in an interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the decision’s implications for efforts to monitor for drug-resistant STDs, Klausner put it bluntly: “We are blind. As of [Tuesday], we are blind.”</p>



<p>Ina Park, a professor at the UCSF School of Medicine, and a co-author of the CDC’s 2024 laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of syphilis, was also appalled.</p>



<p>“It’s just horrific and it’s so foolish and shortsighted,” Park said. “This administration has sometimes brought people back when they’ve realized that a service is vital and this is one of the times where I’m hoping that they will step up and do this.”</p>



<p>Klausner knows Kennedy personally, and reached out to tell him cutting the CDC’s STD lab was a mistake. As of Saturday, Klausner said he had not heard back from Kennedy on this issue.</p>



<p>The STD lab served multiple functions — updating treatment guidelines, monitoring resistance patterns, and working to develop better tests for syphilis, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/30/syphilis-rates-epidemic-united-states/">a resurgent infection</a> for which existing tests are outdated.</p>



<p>It was a resource for clinicians who are having trouble curing patients of STIs that are not responding to treatment. Park noted she recently consulted on a case involving a woman who had been suffering for nine months from trichomoniasis, a vaginal infection. It was not responding to the treatments the woman’s physician prescribed. Park urged the treating doctor to send a sample to the CDC for additional testing, and the resulting treatment recommendation cured the infection.</p>





<p>The lab also leads the national surveillance for resistance patterns among STDs, generating genetic sequences of important isolates that it shares with the scientific community. That information is used in the development of tests and new therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the fired employees, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, noted the lab holds the world’s largest repository of gonorrhea isolates — over 50,000, dating back to 1988 when the CDC began to collect them. Many of those isolates are in a freezer farm contracted by the CDC. What will happen to this invaluable scientific resource? It’s not clear.</p>



<p>“They’re irreplaceable. Even if you have new mutations now, you always need to track where they came from. The evolution, the pressures on what genes and all that. You need those older ones to really study that,” the individual said. “Are they just going to autoclave the whole thing and destroy it?”</p>



<p>The fired lab employee noted that the work that was being done at the CDC STD lab is not done elsewhere. “There’s no duplication. There is no lab like us at NIH” — the National Institutes of Health —&nbsp;“or at any university. The university [researchers], they rely on our specimens to do work. But if no one collects them, it’s just a real blow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julie Dombrowski, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington and director of the Seattle and King County public health department’s HIV, STD and hepatitis C program, stressed that no one should expect the private sector to step in to fill the gap the closure has created.</p>



<p>“There is no commercial interest and little money to be made in this arena,” Dombrowski said in an email.</p>



<p>“It means we will lose ground in the fight against syphilis, we will be blind to national-level trends in antibiotic resistance among gonorrhea, and we will lose world-class expertise that will be very difficult to rebuild,” she said.</p>



<p>The loss of the CDC lab comes at a particularly fraught time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the dawn of the antibiotic era, gonorrhea has systematically laid waste to every antibiotic used against it. The last reliably effective drug, ceftriaxone, is showing signs it too will soon be vanquished — reports of pan-resistant and extremely drug resistant gonorrhea have emerged in other parts of the world. What’s happening elsewhere will happen here, said Edward Hook, a professor emeritus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and an infectious diseases specialist who focuses on STIs.</p>





<p>“We live in a global village and these are global processes,” Hook said. “You can go from one side of the world to another in less than a day, and as a result the antibiotic resistance and public health threats can spread very, very quickly.”</p>



<p>For the first time in years, two new drugs for gonorrhea are nearing the end of the developmental pipeline —&nbsp;a major accomplishment. But given gonorrhea’s relentless development of resistance, it’s only a matter of time before it will develop the mutations needed to get around the new drugs too, said Barbara Van Der Pol, a professor of medicine and public health in the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Without the CDC lab, national efforts to monitor for resistance to the new drugs won’t exist, she said.</p>



<p>“So we’re going to have new drugs hit the market, but we’re not going to have a mechanism that has been vetted at the national level and is standardized that we can deploy quickly,” Van Der Pol said.</p>



<p>That lack of national standardization will create a situation where it’s hard to interpret what’s being seen, and when treatment guidelines ought to be changed, she said, likening the situation to the Wild West: “Everybody has a gun, but nobody knows when to use it.”</p>



<p>The loss of the lab also comes as clinicians are starting to adopt a new approach to trying to prevent sexually transmitted infections in people at high risk of acquiring them. As of last year, the CDC recommended that men who have sex with other men along with transgender women take a dose of the antibiotic doxycycline within 72 hours of having sex. The approach, known as doxy PEP — for post-exposure prophylaxis —&nbsp;has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by about 70% and gonorrhea infections by about 50%.</p>



<p>Although there is a lot of hope associated with this approach, there are also concerns it could drive antibiotic resistance. Implementing it in the absence of a laboratory tasked with monitoring drug resistance nationally strikes STD experts as imprudent.&nbsp; “We’ve lost one of our key tools to be able to monitor that resistance,” Klausner said.&nbsp;“This is a terrible time to be cutting off the ability to conduct surveillance,” Park said.</p>
