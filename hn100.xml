<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a relatively new member of adult society, and an absolute infant of
the business world, I didn't think much about bank choice. I figured: you
put money in, you take money out, they're all the same. I also figured a local
branch of a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking
machine, so also... who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let's relive and
rediscover the effect of these assumptions as I did.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2012">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I start my company. I am a 22 year old recent college graduate living in San
Francisco and pursuing the startup dream. I file my incorporation paperwork
and wait to receive the necessary information for one of the first
steps in the life of any new business: opening a bank account.</p>
<p>My filing is processed and I receive my EIN while visiting my parents
in a suburb of Los Angeles. I have time to kill during one of the days so
I drive down to the nearest Chase bank branch and open a business banking
account. We'll call the person who helped me at the local branch Alex (this
will be important later). I fund that account with a $20,000 personal loan which
was almost all of my savings. I get an account number, an online login, and
<em>boom, we're in business!</em></p>
<p>About 6 months later, I raise a ~$1M seed round. I supply my Chase business
banking account information for the wire, and at close the funding is wired to
the account. I am sitting in a cafe in downtown San Francisco and I receive a
call from an unknown number -- it's Alex, the banker that
helped me open my account. He is being very casual, sort of like
"Hey, just wanted to check on things." "I noticed a big deposit and wanted
to make sure you had everything you needed." etc. For my side, I am
mostly confused: why is this person calling me? I mostly say things like
"yes yes I'm fine" and end the call quickly. Some wheels have started
turning in Southern California, and I just hadn't known it yet.</p>
<div><p>Someone out there is probably mentally screaming at me "you fool!"
at this point. With hindsight, I agree, but I will remind you
dear reader that I have only been legally allowed to purchase alcohol
for just over a year at this point in my life in the story.</p></div>
<hr>
<ol start="2014">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The two years since 2012 -- from a banking perspective -- are quiet. Alex
doesn't call me again, and we have no changes in our banking setup. For two years,
the company was in heads-down building mode. We had shown significant product
traction and were now ready to ramp up hiring to continue building.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, we raise a $10.2M series A. I once again provide the
same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds are
wired. Surprise surprise, Alex calls me! I'm starting to realize banks get
an alert when there are major changes in account balances. Regardless,
I once again brush Alex off -- "everything is good thanks! bye!" -- and
continue on with my life.</p>
<p>At this point, I am bewildered that this guy I met at the random local branch
to sign some papers is the one calling me, but didn't think much more of
it at the time.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2016">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, the two years since 2014 are mostly quiet from a banking
perspective. Alex called more regularly to "check in" but otherwise
nothing has changed. We still bank with Chase. I still have never gone
back into a branch. I do everything online.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2016, we raise a $24M series B. I once again provide the
same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds
are wired. Again, Alex calls. Again, I brush him off. The bank is where I
plant money, I don't need anyone calling me. I just want to focus on building
the company.</p>
<p>Throughout 2016, we had been building out an executive team for the company.
And around the same time of the funding, we hire a Vice President of Finance. As he gets
up to speed with our financial footing, he notices we have ~$35M sitting in
cash in a Chase bank account. This is <em>obviously</em> not a smart thing to do,
so he suggests some financial plans for how to better safeguard and utilize
this mountain of cash.</p>
<p>As part of these plans, he suggests moving to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
They're local to the Bay Area, he's worked with them before, and their
bankers understand startups. It'll make accounts receivables, payables,
payroll, etc. easier. To me, a bank is a bank is a bank, and if it helps
make his job easier, I support his plan.</p>
<p>I log into the Chase online portal and initiate a wire for the full account
balance to SVB. I have to pay something like a $30 fee to wire $35M
(inconsequential to the story, but amusing nonetheless). Someone calls me for
verification -- not Alex -- and the wire processes. <em>Boom, we're done with
Chase.</em> Or so I think.</p>
<p>Alex calls me the next day. The day we initiated the wire was his day off.
He sounds slightly agitated. I wasn't rude to him, but I was short with him.
I switched banks, that's all there is to it. Thanks and goodbye. I never
talk to Alex ever again. A bank is a bank is a bank, you put money in,
you get money out, I don't understand why I would need to <em>talk to someone</em>.</p>
<div><p>I once again interrupt this story to appeal to the readers who are
screaming at me and thank you for joining me on this story recounting
my learning journey. Rest assured, at this point in the story, a professional
was now in charge of the company's finances. But the decisions of the
years leading up to this would have lingering effects for a few more years...</p></div>
<hr>
<ol start="2017">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>We now take a brief detour from the company, because this is where my
personal life becomes relevant to the story.</p>
<p>For the prior three years, I had been living in Los Angeles. At some
point during 2017, I had to go to a local Chase branch to make some
changes to my personal accounts. It has been close to a year since the company
stopped using Chase.</p>
<p>I visit the closest bank branch to my apartment. This bank branch is 20
miles north of where my parents live -- or the area with the branch where I
opened the original company business bank accounts. I'm going to Chase for
purely personal reasons, but this information is unfortunately relevant
to the story.</p>
<p>At my local branch, I walk up to the teller and provide some handwritten
information: my name, account number, desired transaction, etc. The teller looks at the paper,
then looks at me, then looks back at the paper, then asks "Are you the
HashiCorp guy?" <em>What?</em> HashiCorp is doing well but its not <em>at all</em>
something a random non-technical consumer would know about. What is going on?</p>
<p>I say yes and he acknowledges but doesn't automatically offer any more
information. I have to know, so I continue "How do you know that?" His
response is "Dude, everyone at Chase down here knows about HashiCorp." <em>Huh?</em></p>
<div><p>Up to this point, everything in the story is what I know and experienced
first hand. What follows however is now second hand information as told
by this teller. I haven't verified it, but other employees (at other branches)
have said similar things to me over the years.</p></div>
<p>The teller proceeds to explain that Alex -- the guy I opened my original
company account with -- became a fast rising star in the area. He had
opened a business account in a small suburb that grew from $20,000 to
$35,000,000 in balances in just four years! Despite the business (my business)
not engaging in higher-revenue activities with the bank, the opportunity
this account represented to the small business wing of the small suburban
branch stirred up some excitement. It was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>And then, overnight, the account went to $0. Without talking to anyone,
without any prior warning, that account was <em>gone</em>. I used online banking
to transfer the entirety of the balance to another bank. The small suburban
branch viewed this as a <em>huge loss</em> and Alex came into work with some tough
questions and no answers. I instantly recalled feeling that Alex was agitated
when he called me the day after the transfer, and I now had an idea of why.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened to Alex, the teller said he was "no longer
working in the area" and said it with a noticably negative tone. I don't
know what this means and I never found out. Perhaps, he just moved.</p>
<p>Following this event, Chase began an educational series to other local
branches in the Los Angeles area explaining that there are these "startups"
and how their financial patterns do not match those of a typical business. This series
taught branches how to identify startups and how to consider their accounts.
The case study they used for this presentation: HashiCorp.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2018">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It has been two years since hiring our VP of Finance and our financial
department is in really healthy shape. I still have certain approval rights
but no longer directly manage the accounts of the company.</p>
<div><p>Given the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank, I feel it's important to
mention that at this point of the company, we had already begun diversifying
our balances across multiple banks. SVB will not be mentioned again for
the remainder of the story.</p></div>
<p>I'm working at my office at home in Los Angeles and I receive a phone
call from our finance department. That's weird, I rarely receive phone calls.
They tell me that during a routine internal audit, they realized there are
a few customer accounts that are still paying their bill into the old Chase
account.</p>
<p><em>I never closed that original Chase business account back in 2016.</em> Let
me explain how that happens. To close an account, I had to do it in person at
any local Chase branch. Startups are busy, the account balance in 2016 was $0,
and so I just put it off. Well, a couple years passed, it was still open,
and a few customers were actually sending payments to it.</p>
<p>Worse, upon the realization that a few customers were paying into this account,
our finance team realized that there was also fraud. For over a year, someone
had been wiring thousands of dollars out every few weeks. We were short
over $100,000 due to fraud. The finance team immediately called Chase and
reported the fraud, locked down the account, and Chase started an investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the finance team wanted me to close the account and wire the
remaining balance to our actual business bank. With the fraud actively being
handled by Chase and the finance team, I take on the task of closing the
account. I immediately head to the nearest local Chase branch (once again
a branch I've never been to before) and explain the situation.</p>
<p>After waiting for 15 minutes, a manager walks up to me. I know this can't
be good. The branch manager explains that due to the actions taken to lock
down the account for fraud, electronic transfers are unavailable. It doesn't
matter that I'm provably the person who opened the account, electronic
transfers are "impossible."</p>
<p>I say okay, and ask how I am supposed to close the account and transfer
the remaining balance. He said I can close the account and withdraw the
remaining balance only in cash. <em>Cash?</em> At this point, I literally asked:
"like, green paper money cash?" He says yes. The balance in the account is
somewhere around $1M.</p>
<p>I spent another two hours at the bank, juggling between calling our
finance department, talking to this branch manager, and calling the Chase
business phone line. We determine that instead of literal green cash, I
can get a cashier's check. But there is a major problem: the amount the
cashier's check is made out for has to be available <em>at that local branch</em>
(or, whichever branch issues it).
And, well, local branches I guess don't usually have $1M cash lying around.
Or, if they do, its not enough to cover other business activities for the day
so they're not willing to part with it.</p>
<p>The bank manager gives me the phone number of another branch manager that
"may be able to help me." He literally writes down a phone number on a
piece of paper. This is all feeling so surreal. I call this number and
its for a slightly larger branch a few miles down the road. He says
"you're the HashiCorp guy right?" And I roll my eyes. My infamy in the
area is still well known.</p>
<p>This manager is very helpful, if not a bit gruff. He explains to me that
each local branch has some sort of performance metric based on inflows and
outflows at the given branch. Therefore, funding a $1M cash withdrawal was
not attractive to them. I'm learning a lot in a really condensed period of
time at this point. I don't even know if what he's telling me is true, or
legal, all I hear is "this is going to be hard to do if you want it all at
once."</p>
<p><em>But we do want it all at once. And we want to close the account. Now.</em>
He is not happy, but he says he'll call me back in 24 to 48 hours. True
to his word, he calls me back the next day. He says that he had to coordinate
to ensure his branch had the proper funding to satisfy this transaction,
and that the funding would be available at a specific date a few days hence.
He said I have to do the withdrawal <em>that day</em> because his branch will not
hold that amount in cash for any longer.</p>
<p>He also subtly suggested I hire personal security or otherwise deposit
those funds somewhere with haste. I believe his exact words were "if you
lose that check, I can't help you." Again, this was a one time event, and
I don't know how true that all is, but it was said to me.</p>
<p>A few days later, I walk into the branch (I did not hire personal security).
I tell the teller my name and there is a flicker of immediate recognition.
The teller guides me to a cubicle, the account is successfully closed,
I'm issued a $1M cashier's check, and I walk out the door.</p>
<p>My business banking relationship with Chase is, at long last, complete.</p>
<div><p>I want to make it clear that Chase could've been an excellent
banking partner. I never gave them the chance. I never told them what
my business does or what I'd use the money for. I never talked to anyone
(besides saying what I needed to get off the phone). This story isn't
a cautionary tale about Chase, it is rather recounting my naivete
as a young, first-time startup founder.</p></div>
<hr>
<p>Epilogue.</p>
<p>The cashier's check was uneventfully deposited into our primary business
banking account shortly after I walked out of the Chase branch.</p>
<p>The fraud investigation took a few months to complete but we were
able to recover all of the lost funds.</p>
<p>Enough time has passed and employees cycled that I'm no longer recognized at
any Los Angeles area Chase branches.</p>
<p>I look back on these events and there are many places I cringe. At the
same time, I can't imagine making different choices because I was acting in
good faith at all times with the knowledge I had. I think the choices I made were
reasonable for any new founder, and I know many founders who have made
similar choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there was no long term negative impact of the events that
transpired (except maybe for Alex, but I truly don't know) and I can now
look back on it with amusement.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html">https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45055641">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m about to head away from looking after this site for a few weeks (part vacation, part work stuff). As I contemplate some weeks away from the daily routine, I feel an urge to share some scattered thoughts about the state of LLMs and AI.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’ve seen a few early surveys on the effect AI is having on software development, is it really speeding folks up, does it improve or wreck code quality? One of the big problems with these surveys is that they aren’t taking into account <em>how</em> people are using the LLMs. From what I can tell the vast majority of LLM usage is fancy auto-complete, often using co-pilot. But those I know who get the most value from LLMs reckon that auto-complete isn’t very useful, preferring approaches that allow the LLM to directly read and edit source code files to carry out tasks. My concern is that surveys that ignore the different work-flows of using LLMs will produce data that’s going to send people down the wrong paths.</p>

<p>(Another complication is the varying capabilities of different models.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’m often asked, “what is the future of programming?” Should people consider entering software development now? Will LLMs eliminate the need for junior engineers? Should senior engineers get out of the profession before it’s too late? My answer to all these questions is “I haven’t the foggiest”. Furthermore I think anyone who says they know what this future will be is talking from an inappropriate orifice. We are still figuring out how to use LLMs, and it will be some time before we have a decent idea of how to use them well, especially if they gain significant improvements.</p>

<p>What I suggest, is that people experiment with them. At the least, read about what others are doing, but pay attention to the details of their workflows. Preferably experiment yourself, and do share your experiences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❇&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’m also asked: “is AI a bubble”? To which my answer is “OF COURSE IT’S A BUBBLE”. All major technological advances have come with economic bubbles, from canals and railroads to the internet. We know with near 100% certainty that this bubble will pop, causing lots of investments to fizzle to nothing. However what we don’t know is <em>when</em> it will pop, and thus how big the bubble will have grown, generating some real value in the process, before that happens. It could pop next month, or not for a couple of years.</p>

<p>We also know that when the bubble pops, many firms will go bust, but not all. When the dot-com bubble burst, it killed pets.com, it killed Webvan… but it did not kill Amazon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202106-reducing-speaking.html">retired from public speaking</a> a couple of years ago. But while I don’t miss the stress of giving talks, I do miss hanging out with my friends in the industry. So I’m looking forward to catching up with many of them at <a href="https://gotocph.com/2025">GOTO Copenhagen</a>. I’ve been involved with the GOTO conference series since the 1990s (when it was called JAOO), and continue to be impressed with how they put together a fascinating program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>My former colleague Rebecca Parsons, has been saying for a long time that hallucinations aren’t a bug of LLMs, they are a feature. Indeed they are <em>the</em> feature. All an LLM does is produce hallucinations, it’s just that we find some of them useful.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of this is that we should always consider asking the LLM the same question more than once, perhaps with some variation in the wording. Then we can compare answers, indeed perhaps ask the LLM to compare answers for us. The difference in the answers can be as useful as the answers themselves.</p>

<p>Certainly if we ever ask a hallucination engine for a numeric answer, we should ask it at least three times, so we get some sense of the variation. Furthermore we shouldn’t ask an LLM to calculate an answer than we can calculate deterministically (yes, I’ve seen this). It is OK to ask an LLM to generate code to calculate an answer (but still do it more than once).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>Other forms of engineering have to take into account the variability of the world. A structural engineer builds in tolerance for all the factors she can’t measure. (I remember being told early in my career that the unique characteristic of digital electronics was that there was no concept of tolerances.) Process engineers consider that humans are executing tasks, and will sometimes be forgetful or careless. Software Engineering is unusual in that it works with deterministic machines. Maybe LLMs mark the point where we join our engineering peers in a world on non-determinism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’ve often heard, with decent reason, an LLM compared to a junior colleague. But I find LLMs are quite happy to say “all tests green”, yet when I run them, there are failures. If that was a junior engineer’s behavior, how long would it be before H.R. was involved?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>LLMs create a huge increase in the attack surface of software systems. Simon Willison described the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">The Lethal Trifecta</a> for AI agents: an agent that combines access to your private data, exposure to untrusted content, and a way to externally communicate (“exfiltration”). That “untrusted content” can come in all sorts of ways, ask it to read a web page, and an attacker can easily put instructions on the website in 1pt white-on-white font to trick the gullible LLM to obtain that private data.</p>

<p>This is particularly serious when it comes to agents acting in a browser. Read an attacker’s web page, and it could trick the agent to go to your bank account in another tab and “buy you a present” by transferring your balance to the kind attacker. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/">Willison’s view</a> is that “the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely”.</p>

                <em>“let’s ship it and iterate”</em> as Staff or
                <em>“that won’t scale”</em> as a Principal.</p>
              <p>Yet, for all of our intellectual humility,
                why do we <del>write</del> vibe code like this?</p>
              <pre data-lang="Swift"><code><span>if</span> <span>current<wbr>Location</span><span>.</span><span>distance</span><span>(</span><span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>target</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span> <span>{</span>

              <p>GPS coordinates aren’t exact.
                They’re noisy. They’re approximate. They’re probabilistic.
                That <code>horizontal<wbr>Accuracy</code> property tucked away in your <code>CLLocation</code> object
              is trying to tell you something important:
              you’re <em>probably</em> within that radius.
              <em>Probably.</em></p>
            <p>A <code>Bool</code>, meanwhile, can be only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
              That <code>if</code> statement needs to make a choice one way or another,
              but code like this doesn’t capture the uncertainty of the situation.
              If truth is light,
              then current programming models collapse the wavefunction too early.</p>
            <h2>
              Picking the Right Abstraction</h2>
            <p>In 2014, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft Research
              proposed a radical idea:
              What if uncertainty were encoded directly into the type system?
              Their paper,
              <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/uncertaint-a-first-order-type-for-uncertain-data-2/">Uncertain&lt;T&gt;: A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data</a></em>
              introduced a probabilistic programming approach that’s both
              mathematically rigorous and surprisingly practical.</p>
            
            <p>As you’d expect for something from Microsoft in the 2010s,
              the paper is implemented in C#.
              But the concepts translate beautifully to Swift.</p>

            <p>When you compare two <code>Uncertain</code> values,
              you don’t get a definitive <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.

              And in doing so, you end up with much smarter code.</p>

<div><p>Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s).</p><p>- First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship.</p><p>- Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer.</p><p>Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups.</p><p>Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator (<a href="https://github.com/OperatorFoundation" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/OperatorFoundation</a>). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case.</p><p>In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols.</p><p>- The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term.</p><p>I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055852"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055852" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055852&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Thank you very much for a detailed answer. Might I rudely ask -- as you're knowledgeable in this space, what do you think of Mullvad's DAITA, which specifically aims to defeat traffic analysis by moving to a more pulsed constant bandwidth model?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055940"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055940" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055940&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>DAITA was introduced after my time in the industry, but this isn't a new idea (though as far as I know, it's the first time this kind of thing's been commercialized).</p><p>It's clever. It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself.</p><p>A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now.</p><p>In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055945"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055945" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055945&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-chain-name="c0fUbP76WXURanD" data-gtm-name="Article Body" id="c0fUbP76WXURanD"><article><p>“The generator is down, and we don’t have enough ice to continue icing the remains of soldiers killed in action. How much longer, ma’am?”</p><p>That’s the message I received while deployed to Balad, Iraq, as an Air Force second lieutenant. I was overseeing generators in theater, and the one powering the mortuary facility had failed. The clock was ticking. I didn’t have HVAC expertise or the necessary parts. The only viable backup generator was on the other side of the country.</p><p>I had two choices: initiate a long contracting process to hire a civilian technician, or send a convoy across Iraq for the backup unit — risking lives to get it there. We chose the convoy. We got lucky.</p><p>But what if we hadn’t?</p><p>That question — what if — has stuck with me. Because this wasn’t a theoretical delay. This was a real moment where a failure in repair readiness jeopardized our ability to care for the fallen with dignity and speed. And I know it wasn’t the only one.</p><p>That’s why I support the right to repair.</p><p>I’ve lived what it means when a piece of equipment fails at a critical time. I know how far away contractors can be when you need them most. And I know what our service members are capable of — if we trust them with the tools and training to do the job.</p><p>Military right to repair means giving service members the ability to fix their own gear — on base, in the field or downrange — without having to wait on outside contractors. That includes access to the tools, parts and manuals they need to do the job. Right now, private companies can put restrictions on military equipment that block troops from making even basic repairs. That slows everything down, costs taxpayers more, and in the worst cases, puts lives at risk.</p><p>This year, Congress has a chance to change that.</p><p>Thanks to a growing, bipartisan push — including new legislation led by Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont. — right-to-repair reforms are being considered in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). These two senators, from opposite parties, have made it clear: The Pentagon is wasting billions, and service members are bearing the cost.</p><p>Including the Warrior Right to Repair Act in the NDAA is a critical step forward for readiness, national security and the safety of warfighters downrange, and it’s taxpayer friendly. </p><p>Mission readiness depends on the ability to make repairs in the field. Service members need the tools, parts and authority to make immediate fixes themselves, without having to navigate red tape.</p><p>When our military relies too heavily on private contractors for basic maintenance, that dependence gives outside companies leverage over military operations, introducing profit motives into urgent repair decisions. Our armed forces should operate on military timelines — not corporate maintenance schedules.</p><p>Warfighter safety is directly tied to the reliability of our gear. In high-risk environments, a delay in repairing a critical piece of equipment can mean the difference between life and death. </p><p>Right to repair is smart, responsible fiscal policy. Sustainment costs can represent <a href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/right-to-repair-for-the-pentagon-to-dos-for-right-now" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/right-to-repair-for-the-pentagon-to-dos-for-right-now">up to 70% of a weapons system’s lifetime expense</a>. When troops are blocked from doing basic repairs, costs increase and transparency disappears. That’s a waste of taxpayer dollars. </p><p>Finally, repairing our own equipment is critical to inculcating and maintaining a military culture of adaptability and self-reliance. We train service members to be problem solvers. Empowering them to repair their own gear isn’t just smart policy — it reflects the values we instill in every recruit. Right to repair honors that ethos and ensures we treat service members like professionals, not passive end-users.</p><p>We wouldn’t tell a Marine they can’t clean their rifle without a manufacturer present. So why are we telling our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines they can’t fix a comms system or power supply?</p><p>I’m grateful that, in that moment in Iraq, we had a backup option — even if it meant launching a risky cross-country convoy. But what if we hadn’t? What if that second generator didn’t exist or wasn’t reachable in time? Without immediate repair options, the remains of our fallen could have become unrecognizable. The families who entrusted us with their loved ones would have suffered consequences that no one should have to imagine.</p><p>That’s what’s at stake when service members can’t repair the equipment they rely on. It’s not just about saving money or avoiding delays — it’s about honoring our dead, protecting the living and giving our troops the flexibility they need to do the right thing when it counts. Right to repair is about readiness. It’s about humanity. And it’s long overdue. </p><p>That’s why I’m calling on Congress — and especially House Armed Services Committee leaders like Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers — to include military right-to-repair provisions in this year’s NDAA by supporting the bipartisan Warrior Right to Repair Act.</p><p><i>Retired Lt. Col.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>The thing that surprised me most about traveling to China back in 2019 was how </span><em>quiet</em><span> it was. I expected chaos, noise, pollution—all the stuff you associate with a developing country. Instead, I found electric bikes gliding silently through tree-lined streets. We lived there for five months until COVID hit.</span></p><p>About a week ago, I went back to visit Yunnan. Walking through the ancient towns another reality hit me: China doesn't need us anymore. These towns were packed with only Chinese tourists, I counted maybe ten Westerners the whole week. No Starbucks, no McDonald's, no Western chains at all. Just tea shops selling pu'er, silver ornaments, wooden objects, ceramics, dried mushrooms, and flower cakes. China has built its own enormous internal market—its own tourism, its own brands, its own everything. They've turned inward not from isolation but from self-sufficiency.</p><p>It's wild how many people still think of China as the place that makes cheap crap. This perception is frozen somewhere in the 2000s. Japan went through the same arc. "Made in Japan" meant low quality in the 50s, then it meant the best electronics in the world by the 70s. But China's transformation happened even faster. In roughly a decade, they went from knockoff smartphones to homegrown EVs that compete head-to-head with Tesla.</p><p>The numbers are insane. By purchasing-power parity (PPP), China has been the world’s largest economy since the mid-2010s, responsible for roughly a fifth of global output. Chinese labs and firms now lead in the majority of frontier technologies. And in manufacturing, China’s output is larger than the US and EU combined. Yet somehow we still talk about China like it’s “emerging.” Crazy.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1125241,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://apropos.substack.com/i/171432290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_g7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe0479d0-7e58-422c-9ff8-f4842cfdeff3_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Shanghai in 2019</figcaption></figure></div><p>In rural Yunnan, I saw this ancient tractor with no hood—engine completely exposed—passing by a swarm of electric motorcycles. That image captures the development curve here: steep and fast.</p><p>Take banking. The US went from cash to checks to credit cards to using Venmo a lot. China went straight from cash to mobile payments. They had limited credit card infrastructure, so when Alipay and WeChat showed up, boom—an instant cashless society. Now about a billion Chinese pay with a scan.</p><p>Or look at energy. The West spent 150 years building coal plants, then natural gas, then slowly adding renewables. China went from burning coal directly to becoming the world's solar panel factory. They make 80% of all solar panels globally.</p><p>Transportation? California approved high-speed rail in 2008 to link LA and San Francisco for $33 billion. Costs ballooned; there’s still no service. The U.K. canceled HS2’s northern leg after years of overruns. Berlin’s new airport opened almost a decade late and billions over budget. Meanwhile, China built 40,000 kilometers of high-speed rail that runs at 350 km/h. </p><p>Retail? The US built 23 million square feet of retail space per capita—ten times more than Europe—most of it in strip malls and big boxes surrounded by parking lots. Then Americans slowly moved online, with Amazon taking 20 years to capture 10% of retail. China skipped the strip mall phase entirely. They went straight from street markets to super-apps that livestream shopping, where one influencer can sell $15 million worth of lipstick in five minutes. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg" width="698" height="930.5068681318681" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:698,&quot;bytes&quot;:3602477,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://apropos.substack.com/i/171432290?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2oq5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc579451-2c49-4248-a0a4-99c0b67b9c62_3000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>It’s this or electric cars, no in-between.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I imagine a Chinese family and there’s three completely different Chinas. One was about survival, the second aspiration, and the final one about prosperity.</p><p><strong>The grandmother, 75 years old (born 1950):</strong><span> She represents Mao's China, a world of scarcity and ideology. She was eight during the Great Leap Forward, when famines killed 30 million people. Her village had no electricity until she was twenty.  Her entire childhood was about collective farms, struggle sessions, and Red Guards. The state controlled everything—where you lived, what you ate, who you married. </span></p><p><strong>The father, 45 years old (born 1980):</strong><span> He represents Deng's China, when the country opened up and looked outward for models. He was born two years after Deng Xiaoping said "to get rich is glorious" and launched the reform era. His childhood coincided with China becoming the world's factory floor. Germany's exports to China surged from 52 billion euros in 2009 to 123 billion euros in 2021. This guy's first job in 1998 might have been at one of these German factories. His generation witnessed China join the WTO in 2001, Beijing hosting the Olympics in 2008, and becoming the world's second-largest economy in 2010.</span></p><p><strong>The teenager, 15 years old (born 2010):</strong><span> She represents Xi's China, technologically advanced and confident. Born the year China overtook Japan economically. Has never known a China that wasn't a superpower. She boards high-speed trains with facial recognition, uses apps the West doesn’t have, and has never written a check. Her China isn’t catching up to anyone.</span></p><p>That's three completely different universes of experience in one family, sitting around the same dinner table: from famine to facial recognition in 75 years.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apropos.substack.com/p/china-is-eating-the-world?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://apropos.substack.com/p/china-is-eating-the-world?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>China now leads in renewable—without the discourse</span><strong>.</strong><span> Solar panels? 80% Chinese-made. Wind turbines and EV batteries? 60% and 75% Chinese-made. Heat pumps? China is the main manufacturer and exporter. We’re going to solve climate change with a lot of Chinese technology—or we’re not going to solve it at all. (Who tells Greta Thunberg?)</span></p><p>The Global South is voting with its money. The Belt and Road now counts roughly 150 partner countries. Developing nations want material infrastructure, and China delivers: ports, railways, power plants.</p><p>Tech is splitting. There’s a Chinese internet (WeChat, Alipay, Douyin, Baidu) serving 1.4 billion people—and there’s everyone else. They don’t need Google.</p><p>Supply chains can’t function without China. Every single attempt to "decouple" fails. China doesn't just assemble your iPhone. They mine the rare earths, refine the materials, make the components, build the machines that build the machines. </p><p>Democracy stopped being inevitable. Singapore, Dubai, Rwanda—they're all copying the Chinese model: authoritarian capitalism with good PR. Deliver growth, maintain order, forget the voting.

for production workloads. By reading this post you agree to never implement
or use this accursed abomination. This article is released to the public for
educational reasons. Please do not attempt to recreate any of the absurd
acts referenced here.</p></div></div>
<p>You may think that the world is in a state of relative peace. Things
look like they are somewhat stable, but reality couldn't be farther
from the truth. There is an enemy out there that transcends time,
space, logic, reason, and lemon-scented moist towelettes. That enemy
is a scourge of cloud costs that is likely the single reason why
startups die from their cloud bills when they are so young.</p>
<p>The enemy is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-managed-nat-network-address-translation-gateway-for-aws/">Managed NAT
Gateway</a>.
It is a service that lets you egress traffic from a VPC to the public
internet at $0.07 per gigabyte. This is something that is probably
literally free for them to run but ends up getting a huge chunk of
their customer's cloud spend. Customers don't even look too deep into
this because they just shrug it off as the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>This one service has allowed companies like <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">the duckbill
group</a> to make <em>millions</em> by showing
companies how to not spend as much on the cloud.</p>
<p>However, I think I can do one better. What if there was a <em>better</em> way
for your own services? What if there was a way you could reduce that
cost for your own services by up to 700%? What if you could bypass
those pesky network egress costs yet still contact your machines over
normal IP packets?</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Really, if you are trying to avoid Managed NAT Gateway in production for
egress-heavy workloads (such as webhooks that need to come from a common IP
address), you should be using a <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/">exit
node</a> with a public IPv4/IPv6
address attached to it. If you also attach this node to the same VPC as your
webhook egress nodes, you can basically recreate Managed NAT Gateway at home.
You also get the added benefit of encrypting your traffic further on the wire.
This is the only thing in this article that you can safely copy into your
production workloads.</p></div></div>
<h2>Base facts</h2>
<p>Before I go into more detail about how this genius creation works,
here's some things to consider:</p>
<p>When AWS launched originally, it had three services:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3">S3</a> - Object storage for
cloud-native applications</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Simple_Queue_Service">SQS</a> - A
message queue</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud">EC2</a> -
A way to run Linux virtual machines somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those foundational services, I'm going to focus the most on S3: the
Simple Storage Service. In essence, S3 is <code>malloc()</code> for the cloud.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>If you already know what S3 is, please click <a href="#postcloud">here</a> to skip this
explanation. It may be worth revisiting this if you do though!</p></div></div>
<h3>The C programming language</h3>
<p>When using the C programming language, you normally are working with
memory in the stack. This memory is almost always semi-ephemeral and
all of the contents of the stack are no longer reachable (and
presumably overwritten) when you exit the current function. You can do
many things with this, but it turns out that this isn't very useful in
practice. To work around this (and reliably pass mutable values
between functions), you need to use the
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc()</code></a>
function. <code>malloc()</code> takes in the number of bytes you want to allocate
and returns a pointer to the region of memory that was allocated.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is sus" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/sus"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Huh? That seems a bit easy for C. Can't allocating memory fail when there's no
more free memory to allocate? How do you handle that?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is happy" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/happy"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>Yes, allocating memory can fail. When it does fail it returns a null pointer
and sets the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html">errno</a>
superglobal variable to the constant <code>ENOMEM</code>. From here all behavior is
implementation-defined.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Isn't "implementation-defined" code for "it'll probably crash"?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>In many cases: yes most of the time it will crash. Hard. Some applications are
smart enough to handle this more gracefully (IE: try to free memory or run a
garbage collection run), but in many cases it doesn't really make more sense
to do anything but crash the program.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is facepalm" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/facepalm"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Oh. Good. Just what I wanted to hear.</p></div></div>
<p>When you get a pointer back from <code>malloc()</code>, you can store anything in
there as long as it's the same length as you passed or less.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Numa is delet" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/delet"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>Fun fact: if you overwrite the bounds you passed to <code>malloc()</code> and anything
involved in the memory you are writing is user input, congradtulations: you
just created a way for a user to either corrupt internal application state or
gain arbitrary code execution. A similar technique is used in The Legend of
Zelda: Ocarina of Time speedruns in order to get arbitrary code execution via
<a href="https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/srm/srm-overview">Stale Reference
Manipulation</a>.</p></div></div>
<p>Oh, also anything stored in that pointer to memory you got back from
<code>malloc()</code> is stored in an area of ram called "the heap", which is
moderately slower to access than it is to access the stack.</p>
<h3>S3 in a nutshell</h3>
<p>Much in the same way, S3 lets you allocate space for and submit
arbitrary bytes to the cloud, then fetch them back with an address.
It's a lot like the <code>malloc()</code> function for the cloud. You can put
bytes there and then refer to them between cloud functions.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>The bytes are stored in the cloud, which is slightly slower to read from than
it would be to read data out of the heap.</p></div></div>
<p>And these arbitrary bytes can be <em>anything</em>. S3 is usually used for
hosting static assets (like all of the conversation snippet avatars
that a certain website with an orange background hates), but nothing
is stopping you from using it to host literally anything you want.
Logging things into S3 is so common it's literally a core product
offering from Amazon. Your billing history goes into S3. If you
download your tax returns from WealthSimple, it's probably downloading
the PDF files from S3. VRChat avatar uploads and downloads are done
via S3.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is happy" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/happy"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mara">Mara</a></span><span></span></p><p>It's like an FTP server but you don't have to care about running out of disk
space on the FTP server!</p></div></div>
<h3>IPv6</h3>
<p>You know what else is bytes? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_packet">IPv6
packets</a>. When you send an
IPv6 packet to a destination on the internet, the kernel will prepare
and pack a bunch of bytes together to let the destination and
intermediate hops (such as network routers) know where the packet
comes from and where it is destined to go.</p>
<p>Normally, IPv6 packets are handled by the kernel and submitted to a
queue for a hardware device to send out over some link to the
Internet. This works for the majority of networks because they deal
with hardware dedicated for slinging bytes around, or in some cases
shouting them through the air (such as when you use Wi-Fi or a mobile
phone's networking card).</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Wait, did you just say that Wi-Fi is powered by your devices shouting at
eachother?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is aha" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/aha"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Yep! Wi-Fi signal strength is measured in decibels even!</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Numa is delet" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/delet"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>Wrong. Wi-Fi is more accurately <em>light</em>, not <em>sound</em>. It is much more accurate
to say that the devices are <em>shining</em> at eachother. Wi-Fi is the product of
radio waves, which are the same thing as light (but it's so low frequency that
you can't see it). Boom. Roasted.</p></div></div>
<h3>The core Unix philosophy: everything is a file</h3>
<span id="postcloud"></span>
<p>There is a way to bypass this and have software control how network links work,
and for that we need to think about Unix conceptually for a second. In the
hardcore Unix philosophical view: everything is a file. Hard drives and storage
devices are files. Process information is viewable as files. Serial devices are
files. This core philosophy is rooted at the heart of just about everything in
Unix and Linux systems, which makes it a lot easier for applications to be
programmed. The same API can be used for writing to files, tape drives, serial
ports, and network sockets. This makes everything a lot conceptually simpler and

<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html"><code>tar</code></a> command. The name
<code>tar</code> stands for "Tape ARchive". It was a format that was created for writing
backups <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive">to actual magnetic tape
drives</a>. Most commonly, it's used to
download source code from GitHub or as an interchange format for downloading
software packages (or other things that need to put multiple files in one
distributable unit).</p></div></div>
<p>In Linux, you can create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a> device to let
applications control how network or datagram links work. In essence,
it lets you create a file descriptor that you can read packets from
and write packets to. As long as you get the packets to their intended
destination somehow and get any other packets that come back to the
same file descriptor, the implementation isn't relevant. This is how
OpenVPN, ZeroTier, FreeLAN, Tinc, Hamachi, WireGuard and Tailscale
work: they read packets from the kernel, encrypt them, send them to
the destination, decrypt incoming packets, and then write them back
into the kernel.</p>
<h3>In essence</h3>
<p>So, putting this all together:</p>
<ul>
<li>S3 is <code>malloc()</code> for the cloud, allowing you to share arbitrary
sequences of bytes between consumers.</li>
<li>IPv6 packets are just bytes like anything else.</li>
<li>TUN devices let you have arbitrary application code control how
packets get to network destinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, all you'd need to do to save money on your network bills
would be to read packets from the kernel, write them to S3, and then
have another loop read packets from S3 and write those packets back
into the kernel. All you'd need to do is wire things up in the right
way.</p>
<p>So I did just that.</p>
<p>Here's some of my friends' reactions to that list of facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like you've just told me how to build a bomb. I can't belive
this actually works but also I don't see how it wouldn't. This is
evil.</li>
<li>It's like using a warehouse like a container ship. You've put a
warehouse on wheels.</li>
<li>I don't know what you even mean by that. That's a storage method.
Are you using an extremely generous definition of "tunnel"?</li>
<li>sto psto pstop stopstops</li>
<li>We play with hypervisors and net traffic often enough that we know
that this is something someone wouldn't have thought of.</li>
<li>Wait are you planning to actually <em>implement and use</em> ipv6 over
s3?</li>
<li>We're paying good money for these shitposts :)</li>
<li>Is routinely coming up with cursed ideas a requirement for working
at tailscale?</li>
<li>That is horrifying. Please stop torturing the packets. This is a
violation of the Geneva Convention.</li>
<li>Please seek professional help.</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Before any of you ask, yes, this was the result of a drunken conversation with
<a href="https://twitter.com/quinnypig">Corey Quinn</a>.</p></div></div>
<h2>Hoshino</h2>
<p>Hoshino is a system for putting outgoing IPv6 packets into S3 and then
reading incoming IPv6 packets out of S3 in order to avoid the absolute
dreaded scourge of Managed NAT Gateway. It is a travesty of a tool
that does work, if only barely.</p>
<p>The name is a reference to the main character of the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshi_no_Ko">Oshi no
Ko</a>, Hoshino Ai. Hoshino is
an absolute genius that works as a pop idol for the group B-Komachi.</p>
<p>Hoshino is a shockingly simple program. It creates a TUN device,
configures the OS networking stack so that programs can use it, and
then starts up two threads to handle reading packets from the kernel
and writing packets into the kernel.</p>
<p>When it starts up, it creates a new TUN device named either <code>hoshino0</code>
or an administrator-defined name with a command line flag. This
interface is only intended to forward IPv6 traffic.</p>
<p>Each node derives its IPv6 address from the
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html"><code>machine-id</code></a>
of the system it's running on. This means that you can somewhat
reliably guarantee that every node on the network has a unique address
that you can easily guess (the provided ULA /64 and then the first
half of the <code>machine-id</code> in hex). Future improvements may include
publishing these addresses into DNS via Route 53.</p>
<p>When it configures the OS networking stack with that address, it uses
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink">netlink</a> socket to do this.
Netlink is a Linux-specific socket family type that allows userspace
applications to configure the network stack, communicate to the
kernel, and communicate between processes. Netlink sockets cannot
leave the current host they are connected to, but unlike Unix sockets
which are addressed by filesystem paths, Netlink sockets are addressed
by process ID numbers.</p>
<p>In order to configure the <code>hoshino0</code> device with Netlink, Hoshino does
the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds the node's IPv6 address to the <code>hoshino0</code> interface</li>
<li>Enables the <code>hoshino0</code> interface to be used by the kernel</li>
<li>Adds a route to the IPv6 subnet via the <code>hoshino0</code> interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it configures the AWS API client and kicks off both of the main
loops that handle reading packets from and writing packets to the
kernel.</p>
<p>When uploading packets to S3, the key for each packet is derived from
the destination IPv6 address (parsed from outgoing packets using the
handy library
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/gopacket">gopacket</a>) and the
packet's unique ID (a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oklog/ulid/v2">ULID</a> to ensure that
packets are lexicographically sortable, which will be important to
ensure in-order delivery in the other loop).</p>
<p>When packets are processed, they are added to a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/within.website/x/internal/bundler">bundle</a> for
later processing by the kernel. This is relatively boring code and
understanding it is mostly an exercise for the reader. <code>bundler</code> is
based on the Google package
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/support/bundler"><code>bundler</code></a>,
but modified to use generic types because the original
implementation of <code>bundler</code> predates them.</p>
<h3>cardio</h3>
<p>However, the last major part of understanding the genius at play here
is by the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/within.website/x/cardio">cardio</a>.
Cardio is a utility in Go that lets you have a "heartbeat" for events
that should happen every so often, but also be able to influence the
rate based on need. This lets you speed up the rate if there is more
work to be done (such as when packets are found in S3), and reduce the
rate if there is no more work to be done (such as when no packets are
found in S3).</p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Okay, this is also probably something that you can use outside of this post,
but I promise there won't be any more of these!</p></div></div>
<p>When using cardio, you create the heartbeat channel and signals like
this:</p>
<pre><code><span>heartbeat<span>,</span> slower<span>,</span> faster <span>:=</span> cardio<span>.</span><span>Heartbeat</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>,</span> time<span>.</span>Minute<span>,</span> time<span>.</span>Millisecond<span>)</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The first argument to <code>cardio.Heartbeat</code> is a
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context"><code>context</code></a> that lets you cancel the
heartbeat loop. Additionally, if your application uses
<a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/ln-the-natural-logger-2020-10-17"><code>ln</code></a>'s
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/within.website/ln/opname"><code>opname</code></a> facility, an
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/expvar"><code>expvar</code></a> gauge will be created and named
after that operation name.</p>
<p>The next two arguments are the minimum and maximum heart rate. In this
example, the heartbeat would range between once per minute and once
per millisecond.</p>
<p>When you signal the heart rate to speed up, it will double the rate.
When you trigger the heart rate to slow down, it will halve the rate.
This will enable applications to spike up and gradually slow down as
demand changes, much like how the human heart will speed up with
exercise and gradually slow down as you stop exercising.</p>
<p>When the heart rate is too high for the amount of work needed to be
done (such as when the heartbeat is too fast, much like tachycardia in
the human heart), it will automatically back off and signal the heart
rate to slow down (much like I wish would happen to me sometimes).</p>
<p>This is a package that I always wanted to have exist, but never found
the need to write for myself until now.</p>
<h3>Terraform</h3>
<p>Like any good recovering SRE, I used
<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to automate creating
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM</a> users and security policies for
each of the nodes on the Hoshino network. This also was used to create
the S3 bucket. Most of the configuration is fairly boring, but I did
run into an issue while creating the policy documents that I feel is
worth pointing out here.</p>
<p>I made the "create a user account and policies for that account" logic
into a Terraform module because that's how you get functions in
Terraform. It looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>data <span>"aws_iam_policy_document"</span></span> <span>"policy"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>statement</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>actions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>      <span>"s3:GetObject"</span>,
</span><span>      <span>"s3:PutObject"</span>,
</span><span>      <span>"s3:ListBucket"</span>,
</span><span>    <span>]</span>
</span><span>    <span>effect</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
</span><span>    <span>resources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>      var.bucket_arn,
</span><span>    <span>]</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>statement</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>actions</span>   <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"s3:ListAllMyBuckets"</span><span>]</span>
</span><span>    <span>effect</span>    <span>=</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
</span><span>    <span>resources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"*"</span><span>]</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>When I tried to use it, things didn't work. I had given it the
permission to write to and read from the bucket, but I was being told
that I don't have permission to do either operation. The reason this
happened is because my statement allowed me to put objects to the
bucket, but not to any path INSIDE the bucket. In order to fix this, I
needed to make my policy statement look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>statement</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>actions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>    <span>"s3:GetObject"</span>,
</span><span>    <span>"s3:PutObject"</span>,
</span><span>    <span>"s3:ListBucket"</span>,
</span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span><span>  <span>effect</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Allow"</span>
</span><span>  <span>resources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
</span><span>    var.bucket_arn,
</span><span>    <span>"<span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>var</span><span>.</span><span>bucket_arn</span><span>}</span></span>/*"</span>, <span># allow every file in the bucket</span>
</span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This does let you do a few cool things though, you can use this to
create per-node credentials in IAM that can only write logs to their
part of the bucket in particular. I can easily see how this can be
used to allow you to have infinite flexibility in what you want to do,
but good lord was it inconvenient to find this out the hard way.</p>
<p>Terraform also configured the lifecycle policy for objects in the
bucket to delete them after a day.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>resource <span>"aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration"</span></span> <span>"hoshino"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>bucket</span> <span>=</span> aws_s3_bucket.hoshino.id
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>rule</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>"auto-expire"</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>filter</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>expiration</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>      <span>days</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
</span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Enabled"</span>
</span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>

<h3>The horrifying realization that it works</h3>
<p>Once everything was implemented and I fixed the last bugs related to
<a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/more-throughput/">the efforts to make Tailscale faster than kernel
wireguard</a>, I tried to
ping something. I set up two virtual machines with
<a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/waifud">waifud</a> and installed Hoshino.
I configured their AWS credentials and then started it up. Both
machines got IPv6 addresses and they started their loops. Nervously, I
ran a ping command:</p>
<pre><code><span>xe@river-woods:~$ ping fd5e:59b8:f71d:9a3e:c05f:7f48:de53:428f
</span><span>PING fd5e:59b8:f71d:9a3e:c05f:7f48:de53:428f(fd5e:59b8:f71d:9a3e:c05f:7f48:de53:428f) 56 data bytes

</span></code></pre>
<p>It worked. I successfully managed to send ping packets over Amazon S3.
At the time, I was in an airport dealing with the aftermath of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-outage-1.6861923">Air
Canada's IT system falling the heck
over</a>
and the sheer feeling of relief I felt was better than drugs.</p>

get when your code finally works.</p></div></div>
<p>Then I tested TCP. Logically holding, if ping packets work, then TCP
should too. It would be slow, but nothing in theory would stop it. I
decided to test my luck and tried to open the other node's metrics

<p>I was floored. It works. The packets were sitting there in S3, and I

support jumbo frames then you can usually get away with 9216 bytes at max.</p></div></div>

network equipment here, so realistically our packets can be up to to the limit
of the IPv6 packet header format: the oddly specific number of 65535 bytes.
This is configured by the Maximum Transmission Unit at the OS level (though
usually this defines the limit for network frames and not IP packets).
Regardless, Hoshino defaults to an MTU of 53049, which should allow you to
transfer a bunch of data in a single S3 object.</p></div></div>
<h2>Cost analysis</h2>
<p>When you count only network traffic costs, the architecture has many
obvious advantages. Access to S3 is zero-rated in many cases with S3,
however the real advantage comes when you are using this cross-region.
This lets you have a worker in us-east-1 communicate with another
worker in us-west-1 without having to incur the high bandwidth cost
per gigabyte when using Managed NAT Gateway.</p>
<p>However, when you count all of the S3 operations (up to one every
millisecond), Hoshino is hilariously more expensive because of simple
math you can do on your own napkin at home.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, consider the case where an idle node is
sitting there and polling S3 for packets. This will happen at the
minimum poll rate of once every 500 milliseconds. There are 24 hours
in a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a
minute. There are 1000 milliseconds in a second. This means that each
node will be making 172,800 calls to S3 per day, at a cost of $<span id="hnprice1">0.86</span>
per node per day. And that's what happens with no traffic. When
traffic happens that's at least one additional <code>PUT</code>-<code>GET</code> call pair
<em>per-packet</em>.</p>
<p>Depending on how big your packets are, this can cause you to easily
triple that number, making you end up with 518,400 calls to S3 per day
($<span id="hnprice2">2.59</span> per node per day). Not to mention
TCP overhead from the three-way handshake and acknowledgement packets.</p>
<p>This is hilariously unviable and makes the effective cost of
transmitting a gigabyte of data over HTTP through such a contraption
vastly more than $0.07 per gigabyte.</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>This architecture does have a strange advantage to it though: assuming
a perfectly spherical cow, adequate network latency, and sheer luck
this does make UDP a bit more reliable than it should be otherwise.</p>
<p>With appropriate timeouts and retries at the application level, it may
end up being more reliable than IP transit over the public internet.</p>

<p>I guess you could optimize this by replacing the S3 read loop with
some kind of AWS lambda handler that remotely wakes the target
machine, but at that point it may actually be better to have that
lambda POST the contents of the packet to the remote machine. This
would let you bypass the S3 polling costs, but you'd still have to pay
for the egress traffic from lambda and the posting to S3 bit.</p>

please consider that I need to leave room for a part 2. I've already thought
about nearly anything you could have already thought about, including using
SQS, bundling multiple packets into a single S3 object, and other things that
I haven't mentioned here for brevity's sake.</p></div></div>
<h2>Shitposting so hard you create an IP conflict</h2>
<p>Something amusing about this is that it is something that technically
steps into the realm of things that my employer does. This creates a
unique kind of conflict where I can't easily retain the intellectial
property (IP) for this without getting it approved from my employer.
It is a bit of the worst of both worlds where I'm doing it on my own
time with my own equipment to create something that will be ultimately
owned by my employer. This was a bit of a sour grape at first and I
almost didn't implement this until the whole Air Canada debacle
happened and I was very bored.</p>
<p>However, I am choosing to think about it this way: I have successfully
shitposted so hard that it's a legal consideration and that I am going
to be <em>absolved of the networking sins I have committed</em> by instead
outsourcing those sins to my employer.</p>
<p>I was told that under these circumstances I could release the source
code and binaries for this atrocity (provided that I release them with
the correct license, which I have rigged to be included in both the
source code and the binary of Hoshino), but I am going to elect to not
let this code see the light of day outside of my homelab. Maybe I'll
change my mind in the future, but honestly this entire situation is so
cursed that I think it's better for me to not for the safety of
humankind's minds and wallets.</p>
<p>I may try to use the basic technique of Hoshino as a replacement for
DERP, but that sounds like a lot of effort after I have proven that
this is so hilariously unviable. It would work though!</p>

        <h2>(mobile shell)</h2>
        <p>Remote terminal application that
        allows <strong>roaming</strong>, supports <strong>intermittent connectivity</strong>, and provides intelligent <strong>local echo</strong> and line editing of user keystrokes.</p>
        <p>Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.</p>
        <p>Mosh is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS.</p>

    <a href="#techinfo">Tech Video »</a></p>
  </div>

  <div id="features">
  <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Change IP. Stay connected.</h2>
        <p>Mosh automatically roams as you move between Internet
        connections. Use Wi-Fi on the train, Ethernet in a hotel,
        and LTE on a beach: you'll stay logged in. Most network
        programs lose their connections after roaming,
        including SSH and Web apps like Gmail. Mosh
        is different.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Makes for sweet dreams.</h2>
        <p>With Mosh, you can put your laptop to sleep and wake it
        up later, keeping your connection intact. If your
        Internet connection drops, Mosh will warn you — but
        the connection resumes when network service
        comes back.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Get rid of network lag.</h2>
        <p>SSH waits for the server's reply before showing you your
        own typing. That can make for a lousy user interface. Mosh
        is different: it gives an instant response to typing,
        deleting, and line editing. It does this adaptively and
        works even in full-screen programs like emacs and vim. On
        a bad connection, outstanding predictions are underlined
        so you won't be misled.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>No privileged code. No daemon.</h2>
        <p>You don't need to be the superuser to install or run
        Mosh. The client and server are executables run by an
        ordinary user and last only for the life of the
        connection.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Same login method.</h2>
        <p>Mosh doesn't listen on network ports or authenticate
         users. The <span>mosh</span> client logs in to the server via
         SSH, and users present the same credentials (e.g.,
         password, public key) as before. Then Mosh runs the
         <span>mosh-server</span> remotely and connects to it over UDP.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Runs inside your terminal, but better.</h2>
        <p>Mosh is a command-line program, like ssh. You can use it
        inside xterm, gnome-terminal, urxvt, Terminal.app, iTerm,
        emacs, screen, or tmux. But mosh was designed from scratch
        and supports just one character set: UTF-8. It fixes Unicode
        bugs in other terminals and in SSH.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Control-C works great.</h2>
        <p>Unlike SSH, mosh's UDP-based protocol handles packet loss
          gracefully, and sets the frame rate based on network conditions. Mosh
          doesn't fill up network buffers, so Control-C always works
          to halt a runaway process.</p>

      <h3>Server binary outside path</h3>
      <pre>$ mosh <b>--server=/tmp/mosh-server</b> <i>r2d2</i></pre>

  <h3>Ending the connection</h3>

  <p>Normally, <span>logout</span> or <span>exit</span> on the remote host will close
    the session. Mosh accepts the escape sequence <code>Ctrl-^
    .</code>  (typically typed with Control-Shift-6, then a
    period) to end the connection forcibly. To send a
    literal Ctrl-^, type <code>Ctrl-^ ^</code>.</p>

  <h2>How Mosh works</h2>

  <div>
  <p>Remote-shell protocols traditionally work by conveying a
    byte-stream from the server to the client, to be interpreted
    by the client's terminal. (This includes TELNET, RLOGIN, and
    SSH.) Mosh works differently and at a different layer. With
      Mosh, the server and client both maintain a snapshot of
      the current screen state. The problem becomes one of
      state-synchronization: getting the client to the
      most recent server-side screen as efficiently as
      possible.</p>

    <p>This is accomplished using a new protocol called the
      <strong>State Synchronization Protocol</strong>, for which Mosh is the
      first application. SSP runs over UDP, synchronizing the
      state of any object from one host to another. Datagrams
      are encrypted and authenticated
      using <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/">AES-128
      in OCB3 mode</a>. While SSP takes care of the networking
      protocol, it is the implementation of the object being
      synchronized that defines the ultimate semantics of the
      protocol.</p>

    <p>Roaming with SSP becomes easy: the client sends datagrams
      to the server with increasing sequence numbers, including
      a "heartbeat" at least once every three seconds. Every time
      the server receives an authentic packet from the client
      with a sequence number higher than any it has previously
      received, the IP source address of that packet becomes the
      server's new target for its outgoing packets. By doing
      roaming “statelessly” in this manner, roaming works in and
      out of NATs, even ones that may themselves be
      roaming. Roaming works even when the client is not aware
      that its Internet-visible IP address has changed. The
      heartbeats allow Mosh to inform the user when it hasn't
      heard from the server in a while (unlike SSH, where users
      may be unaware of a dropped connection until they try to
      type).</p>

    <p>Mosh runs two copies of SSP, one in each direction of the
      connection. The connection from client to server
      synchronizes an object that represents the keys typed by
      the user, and with TCP-like semantics. The connection from
      server to client synchronizes an object that represent the
      current screen state, and the goal is always to convey the
      client to the most recent server-side state, possibly
    skipping intermediate frames.</p>

    <p>Because SSP works at the object layer and can control the
      rate of synchronization (in other words, the frame rate),
      it does not need to send every byte it receives from the
      application. That means Mosh can regulate the frames so as
      not to fill up network buffers, retaining the
      responsiveness of the connection and making sure Control-C
      always works quickly. Protocols that must send every byte
      can't do this.</p>

  <h3>Careful terminal emulation</h3>

    <p>One benefit of working at the terminal layer
      was the opportunity to build a clean UTF-8 terminal
      emulator from scratch. Mosh fixes several Unicode bugs in
      existing terminals and in SSH, and was designed as a fresh
      start to try to be robust and correct even for
      pathological inputs.</p>

  <dt>Evil escape sequences</dt>

  <dd><p>Only Mosh and GNOME Terminal have a defensible rendering when
Unicode mixes with an ECMA-48/ANSI escape sequence. The OS X Terminal
unwisely tries to normalize its input before the vt500 state machine,
causing it to misinterpret and become unusable after receiving the
following input!* (This also means the OS X Terminal's interpretation
of the incoming octet stream <strong>varies</strong> depending on how
the incoming octets are split across TCP segments, because the
normalization only looks ahead to available bytes.)</p>

<p><small>* We earlier wrote that this misbehaving sequence "crashes"
the OS X Terminal.app. This was mistaken—instead, Terminal.app
interprets the escape sequence as shutting off keyboard input, and
because of an unrelated bug in Terminal.app, it is not possible for
the user to restore keyboard input by resetting the terminal from the
menu.</small></p>

  <dt>Mosh sets IUTF8</dt>

  <dd><p>In the POSIX framework, the kernel needs to know whether
    the user is typing in an 8-bit character set or in UTF-8,
    because in canonical mode (i.e. "cooked" mode), the kernel
    needs to be able to delete a typed multibyte character
    sequence from an input buffer.  On OS X and Linux, this is
    done with the "IUTF8" termios flag.)
    (See <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665757">diagnostic
        explaining the need for this flag.</a>)</p>

    <p>Mosh sets the IUTF8 flag when possible and stubbornly refuses to start up unless the user has a
    UTF-8-clean environment. SSH does not set the IUTF8 flag, which can lead to garbage in input buffers.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

  <h3>Instant local echo and line editing</h3>

    <p>The other major benefit of working at the
      terminal-emulation layer is that the Mosh client is free
      to scribble on the local screen without lasting
      consequence. We use this to implement intelligent local
      echo. The client runs a predictive model in the background
      of the server's behavior, hypothesizing that each
      keystroke will be echoed at the cursor location and that
      the backspace and left- and right-arrow keys will have
      their traditional effect. But only when a prediction is
      confirmed by the server are these effects actually shown
      to the user. (In addition, by default predictions are only
      displayed on high-delay connections or during a network
      “glitch.”) Predictions are done in epochs: when the
      user does something that might alter the echo behavior
      — like hit ESC or carriage return or an up- or
      down-arrow — Mosh goes back into making background
      predictions until a prediction from the new batch can be
      confirmed as correct.</p>

    <p>Thus, unlike previous attempts at local echo with TELNET
      and RLOGIN, Mosh's local echo can be used everywhere, even
      in full-screen programs like emacs and vi.</p>

  <h3>Real-world benefits</h3>

<p>We evaluated Mosh using traces contributed by six users, covering
about 40 hours of real-world usage and including 9,986 total
keystrokes. These traces included the timing and contents of all
writes from the user to the host and vice versa. The users were asked
to contribute "typical, real-world sessions." In practice, the traces
include use of popular programs such as the bash shell and zsh shells,
the alpine and mutt e-mail clients, the emacs and vim text editors,
the irssi and barnowl chat clients, the links text-mode Web browser,
and several programs unique to each user.</p>

<p>To evaluate typical usage of a "mobile" terminal, we replayed the
traces over an otherwise unloaded Sprint commercial EV-DO (3G)
cellular Internet connection in Cambridge, Mass. A client-side process
played the user portion of the traces, and a server-side process
waited for the expected user input and then replied (in time) with the
prerecorded server output. We speeded up long periods with no
activity.  The average round-trip time on the link was about half a
second.</p>

<p>We replayed the traces over two different transports, SSH and Mosh,
and recorded the user interface response latency to each simulated
user keystroke. The Mosh predictive algorithm was frozen prior to
collecting the traces and was not adjusted in response to their
contents or results.</p>

<h4>The results</h4>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://mosh.org/cdfs.png" alt=""></p><h4>Cumulative distribution of keystroke response times with Sprint EV-DO (3G) Internet service</h4>
</div>

<p>Mosh reduced the median keystroke response
time from 503 ms to nearly instant (because more than 70% of the
keystrokes could be immediately displayed), and reduced the mean
keystroke response time from 515 ms to 173 ms. Qualitatively, Mosh makes
remote servers "feel" more like the local machine!</p>

  <dl>
  <dt>Q: Who wrote Mosh?</dt>

  <dd><p>Mosh was written by Keith Winstein, along with Anders Kaseorg, Quentin Smith, Richard Tibbetts, Keegan McAllister, and John Hood.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Why another remote-terminal protocol?</dt>

  <dd><p>Practical latency on the Internet is on the increase, with
    the rise of bufferbloat and sophisticated wireless links
    that optimize for throughput over delay. And roaming is more
    common than ever, now that laptops and handheld devices have
    largely displaced desktops. SSH is great, but frustrating to
    use when you want to change IP addresses or have a
    long-delay link or a dodgy connection.</p>

  <p>Moreover, TELNET had some good things going for it — a
    local-echo mode and a well-defined network virtual
    terminal. Even today, SSH doesn't properly support UTF-8
    end-to-end on a POSIX system.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Are the mosh principles relevant to other network applications?</dt>

  <dd><p>We think so. The design principles that Mosh stands for are
    conservative: warning the user if the state being displayed
    is out of date, serializing and checkpointing all
    transactions so that if there are no warnings, the user
    knows every prior transaction has succeeded, and handling expected events (like roaming from one
    WiFi network to another) gracefully.</p>

  <p>Those don't seem too controversial, but fancy apps like
  Gmail-in-Chromium or on Android still behave atrociously on
  dodgy connections or after switching IP addresses. (Have you
  ever had Gmail leave an e-mail message in "Sending..." for ten
  hours while merrily retrieving new mail and not indicating any
  kind of error? Us too.) We think there may be considerable
  room for improvement in many network user interfaces from the
  application of these values.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: I'm getting "mosh requires a UTF-8 locale." How can I fix this?</dt>

        <dd><p>To diagnose the problem, run <code>locale</code> on the local
        terminal, and <code>ssh <i>remotehost</i> locale</code>. To use Mosh,
        both sides of the connection will need to show a UTF-8 locale, like
        <code>LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"</code>.</p>

        <p>On many systems, SSH will transfer the locale-related
        environment variables, which are then inherited by
        <code>mosh-server</code>.  If this mechanism fails, Mosh (as of
        version 1.2) will pass the variables itself.  If neither
        mechanism is successful, you can do something like</p>

        <pre>mosh <i>remotehost</i> <b>--server="LANG=en_US.UTF-8 mosh-server"</b></pre>

        <p>If <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> does not exist on the remote server,
        you can replace this with a UTF-8 locale that does exist.  You
        may also need to set LANG locally for the benefit of
        <code>mosh-client</code>.  It is possible that the local and
        remote machines will need different locale names. See also <a href="https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/98">this GitHub
        ticket</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: What does the message "Nothing received from the server on UDP port 60003" mean?</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>This means that <code>mosh</code> was able to start
    <code>mosh-server</code> successfully on the remote machine, but the client is
    not able to communicate with the server.  This generally means that
    some type of firewall is
    blocking the UDP packets between the client and the server.  If you
    had to forward TCP port 22 on a NAT for SSH, then you will have to
    forward UDP ports as well.  Mosh will use the first available
    UDP port, starting at 60001 and stopping at 60999.  If you are only
    going to have a small handful of concurrent sessions on a server, then you can
    forward a smaller range of ports (e.g., 60000 to 60010).
    </p>

    <p>
    Tools like netstat, netcat, socat, and tcpdump can be useful for debugging
    networking and firewall problems.
    </p>

    <p>This problem can also be the result of a bug in glibc 2.22 that
      affects programs that link with protobuf and utempter and use
      aggressive compiler hardening flags. (<a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19861">glibc bugtracker entry</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/727">Mosh bugtracker entry</a>.) The
      problem causes mosh-server to segfault immediately on startup. We
      believe we have worked around this problem in Mosh 1.2.6, but please
      report a bug if you find otherwise.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: Why do you insist on UTF-8 everywhere?</dt>

  <dd><p>We're really not UTF-8 zealots. But it's a lot easier to
  correctly implement <strong>one</strong> terminal emulator
  than to try to do the right thing in a variety of difficult
  edge cases. (This is what GNU screen tries to do, and in our
  experience it leads to some very tricky-to-debug situations.)
  So mosh just won't start up until the user has everything
  configured for a UTF-8-clean pathway. It may be annoying, but
  it also probably reduces frustration down the
  road. (Unfortunately an 8-bit vt220 and a UTF-8 vt220 are
  different and incompatible terminal types; the UTF-8 goes
  in <strong>underneath</strong> the vt220 state machine.)</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I use a different SSH port (not 22)?</dt>

        <dd><p>As of Mosh 1.2, you can pass arguments to <code>ssh</code> like so:</p>

        <pre>mosh <i>remotehost</i> <b>--ssh="ssh -p 2222"</b></pre>

        <p>Or configure a host alias in <code>~/.ssh/config</code> with a
        <code>Port</code> directive.  Mosh will respect that too.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: I'm getting 'mosh-server not found'.</dt>

  <dd><p>Please make sure that mosh is installed on the client, and
  mosh (or at least mosh-server) is installed on the server you are
  trying to connect to.  Also, the server is expected to be available
  on your server's default login <code>PATH</code>, which is not
  usually true on OS X and BSD servers, or if you install mosh-server
  in your home directory.  In these cases please see the "Server
  binary outside path" instructions in the Usage section,
  above.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: SSH authenticates using Kerberos tickets, but Mosh asks me for a password.</dt>
        <dd><p>In some configurations, SSH canonicalizes the hostname
        before passing it to the Kerberos GSSAPI plugin.  This breaks
        for Mosh, because the initial forward DNS lookup is done by
        the Mosh wrapper script.  To work around this, invoke Mosh as</p>

        <pre>mosh <i>remotehost</i> <b>--ssh="ssh -o GSSAPITrustDns=no"</b></pre>

        <p>This <a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1008">will
        often fail</a> on a round-robin DNS setup.  In that case it is probably
        best to pick a specific host from the round-robin pool.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Why is my terminal's scrollback buffer incomplete?</dt>

        <dd><p>Mosh synchronizes only the <b>visible</b> state of the terminal.  We
are tracking this issue; see <a href="https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/2">this issue</a> and the
        others which are linked from there.  For now, the workaround is to use
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> on the remote side.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I get 256 colors?</dt>

  <dd><p>Make sure you are running mosh in a terminal that
  advertises itself as 256-color capable. (This generally means
  TERM will be xterm-256color or screen-256color-bce.)</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I type C-^, Mosh's default escape character?</dt>

  <dd><p>On keyboards with the United States layout, this can be typed
  as Ctrl-Shift-6, or often as Ctrl-6 (this depends on your OS and
  terminal emulator).  On non-US keyboards, it is often hard to find
  the right key, and sometimes it's not available at all.  If your
  keyboard has a dead key with an accent-circumflex, this is not
  likely to be the right key.  Ctrl-6 sometimes works, though.  If you
  are unable to type this character, you will need to set
  the <code>MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY</code> variable; see the Mosh man page for
  details.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How can I make the server automatically clean up dormant sessions?</dt>

  <dd><p>Please see the entries for <code>MOSH_SERVER_NETWORK_TMOUT</code>
      and <code>MOSH_SERVER_SIGNAL_TMOUT</code> in the <i>mosh-server(1)</i> man page.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: What is Mosh's security track record so far?</dt>

  <dd><p>Mosh 1.0 was released in March 2012. As of the release of Mosh
      1.4.0 in October 2022, as far as the developers are aware:

      </p><ul>
      
      <li>In the last decade, <b>no security vulnerabilities of
	any kind</b> (major or minor) have been reported in Mosh.

      </li><li>No major security vulnerabilities have <b>ever</b> been
      reported in Mosh. We define major security vulnerabilities to
      include privilege escalation, remote code execution,
      denial-of-service by a third party, etc.

      </li><li>Two denial-of-service issues were discovered and fixed in
	releases in 2012. One issue allowed a mosh-server to cause the
	mosh-client to spend excess CPU (CVE-2012-2385, fixed in Mosh
	1.2.1, released May 2012). Another issue allowed the server
	host to cause the mosh-client to send UDP datagrams to an
	incorrect address, foiling its attempt to connect (fixed in
	Mosh 1.2.3, released October 2012).
      </li></ul></dd>

      <dt>Q: How does Mosh's security compare with SSH's?</dt>
      
    <dd><p>We think that Mosh's conservative design means that its attack
      surface compares favorably with more-complicated systems like
      OpenSSL and OpenSSH. Mosh's track record has so
      far borne this out. Ultimately, however, only time will tell
      when the first serious security vulnerability is discovered in
      Mosh—either because it was there all along or because it
      was added inadvertently in development. OpenSSH and OpenSSL have
      had more vulnerabilities, but they have also been released
      longer and are more prevalent.</p>

    <p>In one concrete respect, the Mosh protocol is more secure than
      SSH's: SSH relies on unauthenticated TCP to carry the contents
      of the secure stream. That means that an attacker can end an SSH
      connection with a single phony "RST" segment. By contrast, Mosh
      applies its security at a different layer (authenticating every
      datagram), so an attacker cannot end a Mosh session unless the
      attacker can <b>continuously</b> prevent packets from reaching
      the other side. A transient attacker can cause only a transient
      user-visible outage; once the attacker goes away, Mosh will
      resume the session.</p>

    <p>However, in typical usage, Mosh relies on SSH to exchange keys
      at the beginning of a session, so Mosh will inherit the
      weaknesses of SSH—at least insofar as they affect the
      brief SSH session that is used to set up a long-running Mosh
      session.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Is Mosh affected by the 2018 <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1040.pdf">attacks against the OCB2 cipher mode</a>?</dt>

  <dd><p>Not that we know of—Mosh uses OCB3. The authors of the
paper write that the attack is not applicable to OCB3.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: Why does mosh use AES-128 for a session-key, not AES-192 or AES-256?</dt>

  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>AES-128 is more than an adequate key length for a session key.</li>

      <li>The <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/ocb-faq.htm#what-blockcipher">OCB FAQ</a> recommends AES-128.</li>

      <li>AES-128 is a bit nicer and is not subject to the related-key attacks that afflict AES-192 and AES-256. (Schneier: "the key schedule for 256-bit version is pretty lousy -- something we pointed out in our 2000 paper -- but doesn't extend to AES with a 128-bit key." See <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html">this blog post</a>.)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: Does mosh work with Amazon EC2?</dt>

  <dd><p>Yes, it works great, but please remember to open up UDP ports 60000–61000 on the EC2 firewall.</p></dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I tell if mosh is working correctly?</dt>

  <dd>
      <p>After you run <code>mosh user@server</code>, if successful you will be dropped into your login
      shell on the remote machine.

      If you want
      to check that mosh is being used instead of ssh, try typing <code>Ctrl-^ Ctrl-Z</code>
      to suspend the session (with mosh 1.2.4 or later on the client). Running <code>fg</code> will then return.

  <dt>Q: What's the difference between mosh, mosh-client, and mosh-server?   Which one do I use?</dt>

  <dd>
      <p>The <code>mosh</code> command is a wrapper script that is designed to be the primary way that
      you use mosh.  In most cases, you can simply just replace "ssh" with "mosh" in your command line.
      Behind the scenes, the <code>mosh</code> wrapper script will SSH to the server, start up
      <code>mosh-server</code>, and then close the SSH connection.  Then it will start up the
      <code>mosh-client</code> executable on the client, passing it the necessary information for
      it to connect to the newly spawned <code>mosh-server</code> instance.
      </p>

      <p>In normal usage, <code>mosh-client</code> and
      <code>mosh-server</code> don't need to be run directly.
      </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Q: How do I run the mosh client and server separately?</dt>

  <dd><p>If the <code>mosh</code> wrapper script isn't working for you, you can try running
    the <code>mosh-client</code> and <code>mosh-server</code> programs separately to
    form a connection. This can be a useful debugging technique.</p>

  <p>1. Log in to the remote host, and run <code>mosh-server</code>.</p>

  <p>It will give output like:</p>
<pre>$ mosh-server 

MOSH CONNECT <b>60004</b> <b>4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw</b>

mosh-server (mosh 1.1.3)

</pre>

  <p>2. On the local host, run:</p>
<pre>$ MOSH_KEY=<b>key</b> mosh-client <b>remote-IP</b> <b>remote-PORT</b></pre>

<p>where "key" is the 22-byte string printed by mosh-server (in this
example, "4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw"), "remote-PORT" is the port number
given by the server (60004 in this case), and "remote-IP" is the IP address of the server. You can look up the
server's IP address with "host remotehost".</p>

  <p>3. If all goes well, you should have a working Mosh connection. Information about where the process fails can help us debug why Mosh isn't working for you.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-install-truenas-on-raspberry-pi">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-install-truenas-on-raspberry-pi</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45052429">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that Joel0 in the TrueNAS community has created a <a href="https://forums.truenas.com/t/truenas-on-arm-now-available/49160/16?u=geerlingguy">fork of TrueNAS that runs on Arm</a>, I thought I'd give it a spin—on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-with-hard-drives.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-7d31be78-66b1-44d6-85c3-3c427ad83265" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7d31be78-66b1-44d6-85c3-3c427ad83265&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 with Hard Drives"></p>

<p>I currently run an <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-efficient-server-grade-arm-nas">Ampere Arm server in my rack with Linux and ZFS</a> as my primary storage server, and a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/radxas-sata-hat-makes-compact-pi-5-nas">Raspberry Pi with four SATA SSDs and ZFS</a> as backup replica in my studio. My <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/arm-nas">configuration for these Arm NASes is up on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I've been looking forward to TrueNAS support on Arm for years, though it seems the sentiment in that community was 'Arm servers aren't powerful enough to run serious storage servers'—despite myself and many others doing so for many years... but that's besides the point.</p>

<h2>On a Raspberry Pi?</h2>

<p>Yes, in fact.</p>

<p>I've found <em>numerous</em> times, running modern applications on slower hardware is an <em>excellent</em> way to expose little configuration flaws and misconceptions that lead to learning how to run the applications <em>much</em> better on more capable machines.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-nas-ssd.jpeg" width="700" height="467" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-4ed5f5d6-1d77-4c2e-b32e-4dd31135ffda" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4ed5f5d6-1d77-4c2e-b32e-4dd31135ffda&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 NAS with SSDs"></p>

<p>From my <a href="https://pidramble.com/">Pi Dramble</a> to my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/petabyte-pi-project">Petabyte Pi Project</a>, running apps intended for much more powerful hardware taught me a lot. So maybe running TrueNAS, which demands <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/13.0/gettingstarted/corehardwareguide/">8 GB of RAM and 16 GB of primary storage</a>, would be a fun learning exercise.</p>

<p>I've done it on x86 servers, but that's boring. It's <em>easy</em>. I don't learn much when a project goes off without a hitch, and I'm not forced to look closer at some of the configuration quirks.</p>

<p>You can watch the video for a full demo, or read on below:</p>

<h2>On a Raspberry Pi, there's no UEFI</h2>

<p>One glaring problem with the Raspberry Pi is no official support for UEFI, a standard way to boot computers and interface operating systems to device firmware. Raspberry Pi only <em>officially</em> supports device-tree-based Linux booting, which is much less standard. That means you can't just throw any old Linux distribution on the Pi, you have to have ones tailored to the Pi. There <em>are</em> good OSes for the Pi, like Raspberry Pi OS, based on Debian. But it's not the same as <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">grabbing Windows on Arm and installing it on my Ampere workstation</a>.</p>

<p>To get past this restriction, we have to rely on a community project, forked from <a href="https://worproject.com/">Windows on Raspberry Pi</a>. Specifically, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi">NumberOneGit's rpi5-uefi fork</a>.</p>

<p>To get your Pi 5 to support UEFI (CM5 process may be slightly different):</p>

<ol>
<li>Update the EEPROM to the 2025-06-09 release (or later - check what version you're running in Pi OS with the command <code>rpi-eeprom-update</code>):
 a. Typically, you can upgrade using <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>, <code>sudo apt full-upgrade -y</code>, or <code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a</code>. However, at the time of this writing, those methods will get you to the latest stable release (2025-05-08), so until then, use one of these methods:
 b. Manually update the bootloader with <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot"><code>usbboot</code></a> from source.
 c. Switch to the beta bootloader release channel: <code>sudo nano /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update</code>, then change <code>latest</code> to <code>beta</code>, and run <code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a</code>.
 d. Verify the bootloader version you're running with <code>rpi-eeprom-update</code> after a reboot.</li>
<li>Download the latest .zip file release from <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi/releases">rpi5-uefi Releases</a>.</li>
<li>Take a microSD card that's already formatted for the Pi (I just pulled the Pi OS card out of my Pi 5 that I just used for the EEPROM update), and clear out the contents of the FAT32 'bootfs' volume. Copy all the contents of the .zip file you downloaded into that folder (including <code>RPI_EFI.fd</code>).</li>
<li>Eject the microSD card, insert it into the Pi, and power it on with an HDMI display connected.</li>
<li>You should see a Raspberry Pi logo and the EDK2 bootloader screen appear. Unless you have NVMe or USB boot media installed, it will say "Press any key to enter the Boot Manager Menu."</li>
<li>Since I couldn't find the 'any' key, I pressed 'Enter', then I could navigate through a standard boot manager menu. In there you can configure SD card speeds, set the PCIe bus speed, etc.</li>
<li>After you've changed the settings to your liking (see some <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi?tab=readme-ov-file#linux">suggestions for Linux</a>), save and reset.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi5-uefi-boot-menu.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-9b5cafd3-b809-40ce-8dd8-6daac7197d56" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;9b5cafd3-b809-40ce-8dd8-6daac7197d56&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 UEFI Boot Menu"></p>

<h2>TrueNAS on a Pi 5</h2>

<p>Now that the Pi is booting into UEFI mode, you can install TrueNAS. To do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download a TrueNAS on Arm ISO from <a href="https://truenas-releases.jmay.us/">https://truenas-releases.jmay.us</a> (I chose <a href="https://truenas-releases.jmay.us/TrueNAS-SCALE-Fangtooth/TrueNAS-SCALE-25.04.2-aarch64.iso">25.04.2</a>).</li>
<li>Use a tool like <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Etcher</a> to write the ISO to a USB drive.</li>
<li>After Etcher finishes, eject the USB drive and insert it into the Pi (I used a USB 3 thumb drive, so I inserted it into one of the blue USB 3 ports on the Pi for maximum speed).</li>
<li>If it doesn't automatically boot to the TrueNAS installer, select the external USB drive in the UEFI boot manager and boot into the TrueNAS installer.</li>
<li>Follow the TrueNAS installer's prompts to install TrueNAS on any device other than the installer drive or the microSD card (I used a second USB flash drive plugged into the other USB 3 port). Wait for installation to complete.</li>
<li>When prompted, reboot and remove the USB drive.</li>
</ol>

<p>TrueNAS SCALE should boot up, and the first boot can take a while as many services need to generate files, configure services, and start them the first time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/truenas-raspberry-pi-5-setup-ix-etc-fail.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-5a56a1cc-dac6-405d-80d3-43c1183099c5" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;5a56a1cc-dac6-405d-80d3-43c1183099c5&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="TrueNAS installer ix-etc failure to start"></p>

<p>In my case, on first boot, the <code>ix-etc</code> service failed to start (it timed out), and its purpose is to <code>Generate TrueNAS /etc files</code>. After booting, I chose to enter the Linux console, then ran <code>systemctl start ix-etc</code>, and rebooted.</p>

<p>After a reboot, TrueNAS seemed to launch all its services without issue, including the web UI. I visited the IP address printed on the console, logged in as the admin user I set up during install, and was greeted with the TrueNAS dashboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/truenas-raspberry-pi-5.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-43bb5c4b-deff-4367-b979-304ae9f3ed55" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;43bb5c4b-deff-4367-b979-304ae9f3ed55&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="TrueNAS running on Raspberry Pi 5"></p>

<h2>Current Limitations</h2>

<p>Right now, most of the limitations are around <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-peripherals-in-uefi">missing features in UEFI mode</a>; since Raspberry Pi hasn't pushed RP1 support into the Linux kernel, and nobody's yet reverse-engineered RP1 interfaces, you can't use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fan header PWM support (no fan control)</li>
<li>CSI/DSI connections for displays/cameras</li>
<li>GPIO</li>
<li>Built-in Ethernet</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ethernet limitation is especially annoying, as you are <em>forced</em> to use an external USB Ethernet dongle, just like on most non-Qualcomm systems running Windows on Arm.</p>

<p>Andrea della Porta from SUSE is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Raspberry-Pi-5-RP1-Linux-RFC">working on upstreaming RP1 support into Linux</a> with some <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=360653">help from Raspberry Pi</a>, but progress has been a bit slow.</p>

<p>What I've been wondering lately, more and more: <em>why doesn't Raspberry Pi consider official UEFI support in the first place?</em> With or <em>without</em> Microsoft's official blessing, being able to boot vanilla Windows 11 for Arm on the Pi would be neat. Not to mention, any regular Linux Arm distro (including TrueNAS SCALE) would boot too...</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>I recently received a new hardware project, the <a href="https://github.com/kelroy1990/Homelabs-Pi-Storage">Homelabs Pi Storage server</a>, which uses a custom CM5 SATA backplane and a 3D printable enclosure for a 6-bay NAS:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/homelabs-pi-storage-server-cm5.jpeg" width="700" height="467" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-23a178a0-d361-429c-8b65-d81dad1d2162" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;23a178a0-d361-429c-8b65-d81dad1d2162&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Homelabs Pi Storage server"></p>

<p>I got TrueNAS installed on a CM5 Lite (using the same process as above), but when I installed four SATA hard drives, they spun up, but were not recognized. Right now the <a href="https://github.com/NumberOneGit/rpi5-uefi/issues/21">Pi 5 UEFI support doesn't allow for more than one PCIe device</a>, and the Homelabs Pi Storage server has a PCIe switch that branches off to 2.5 Gbps Ethernet and a 6-port SATA controller.</p>

<p>These devices all work perfectly out of the box on Raspberry Pi OS (and I was able to set up a ZFS array, getting 250 MB/s over the built-in 2.5G Ethernet—see below), but they aren't recognized currently when running under UEFI :(</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/windows-zfs-file-copy-homelabs-pi.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-87ec9e17-4873-4def-babf-7025dbf865f6" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;87ec9e17-4873-4def-babf-7025dbf865f6&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Homelabs Pi ZFS array Samba Windows 250 MB per second"></p>

<p>I'm already running vanilla ZFS under Raspberry Pi OS on my other <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/radxas-sata-hat-makes-compact-pi-5-nas">Raspberry Pi storage server</a>, and that's running on four SSDs and no hard drives. It can sustain 200 MB/sec writes, and I presume TrueNAS would be able to do the same.</p>

<p>There are also NVMe-only boards, like the <a href="https://amzn.to/41Us51s">$50 GeeekPi N16 Quad-NVMe HAT</a>, which provide a pretty small footprint all-flash server option. But again, since those boards use switch chips (because the Pi is limited to 1 PCIe lane), none of those drives would be accessible to TrueNAS as it stands today. Your best bet if you want to use <em>TrueNAS</em> instead of just managing ZFS on you own on a Pi would be to use a single-purpose HAT or SATA controller or HBA in IT mode, to connect disks directly to the Pi.</p>

<p>Because of the current UEFI limitations, I would still recommend running TrueNAS on higher-end Arm hardware (like Ampere servers). If you want to stick to an SBC, there's <a href="https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3588">UEFI firmware for RK3588 platforms</a> under active development. It may offer even more functionality for some boards, so check the <a href="https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk3588?tab=readme-ov-file#platinum">compatibility list</a>.</p>

<p>Or you could be boring and just install TrueNAS on x86, where it's fully supported ;)</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Generative Adversarial Networks refer to a family of generative models that seek to discover the underlying distribution behind a certain data generating process. This distribution is discovered through an adversarial competition between a generator and a discriminator. As we saw in an earlier introductory post on GANs, the two models are trained such that the discriminator strives to distinguish between generated and true examples, while the generator seeks to confuse the discriminator by producing data that are as realistic and compelling as possible.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the math behind GANs. My primary source of reference is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf">Generative Adversarial Nets</a> by Ian Goodfellow, et al. It is in this paper that Goodfellow first outlined the concept of a GAN, which is why it only makes sense that we commence from the analysis of this paper. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="motivating-the-loss-function">Motivating the Loss Function</h2>

<p>GAN can be seen as an interplay between two different models: the generator and the discriminator. Therefore, each model will have its own loss function. In this section, let’s try to motivate an intuitive understanding of the loss function for each.</p>

<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>

<p>To minimize confusion, let’s define some notation that we will be using throughout this post.</p>

\[\begin{multline}
\shoveleft x:  \text{Real data} \\
\shoveleft z: \text{Latent vector} \\
\shoveleft G(z): \text{Fake data} \\
\shoveleft D(x): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of real data} \\
\shoveleft D(G(z)): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of fake data} \\
\shoveleft \text{Error}(a, b): \text{Error between } a \text{ and } b\\
\end{multline}\]

<h2 id="the-discriminator">The Discriminator</h2>

<p>The goal of the discriminator is to correctly label generated images as false and empirical data points as true. Therefore, we might consider the following to be the loss function of the discriminator:</p>

\[L_D = \text{Error}(D(x), 1) + \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 0) \tag{1}\]

<p>Here, we are using a very generic, unspecific notation for $\text{Error}$ to refer to some function that tells us the distance or the difference between the two functional parameters. (If this reminded you of something like cross entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, you are definitely on the right track.)</p>

<h2 id="the-generator">The Generator</h2>

<p>We can go ahead and do the same for the generator. The goal of the generator is to confuse the discriminator as much as possible such that it mislabels generated images as being true.</p>

\[L_G = \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 1) \tag{2}\]

<p>The key here is to remember that a loss function is something that we wish to minimize. In the case of the generator, it should strive to minimize the difference between 1, the label for true data, and the discriminator’s evaluation of the generated fake data.</p>

<h2 id="binary-cross-entropy">Binary Cross Entropy</h2>

<p>A common loss function that is used in binary classification problems is binary cross entropy. As a quick review, let’s remind ourselves of what the formula for cross entropy looks like:</p>

\[H(p, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)}[- \log q(x)] \tag{3}\]

<p>In classification tasks, the random variable is discrete. Hence, the expectation can be expressed as a summation.</p>

\[H(p, q) = - \sum_{x \in \chi} p(x) \log q(x) \tag{4}\]

<p>We can simplify this expression even further in the case of binary cross entropy, since there are only two labels: zero and one.</p>

\[H(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \tag{5}\]

<p>This is the $\text{Error}$ function that we have been loosely using in the sections above. Binary cross entropy fulfills our objective in that it measures how different two distributions are in the context of binary classification of determining whether an input data point is true or false. Applying this to the loss functions in (1),</p>

\[L_D = - \sum_{x \in \chi, z \in \zeta} \log(D(x)) + \log(1 - D(G(z))) \tag{6}\]

<p>We can do the same for (2):</p>

\[L_G = - \sum_{z \in \zeta} \log(D(G(z)) \tag{7}\]

<p>Now we have two loss functions with which to train the generator and the discriminator! Note that, for the loss function of the generator, the loss is small if $D(G(z))$ is close to 1, since $\log(1) = 0$. This is exactly the sort of behavior we want from a loss function for the generator. It isn’t difficult to see the cogency of (6) with a similar approach.</p>

<h2 id="minor-caveats">Minor Caveats</h2>

<p>The original paper by Goodfellow presents a slightly different version of the two loss functions derived above.</p>

\[\max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{8}\]

<p>Essentially, the difference between (6) and (8) is the difference in sign, and whether we want to minimize or maximize a given quantity. In (6), we framed the function as a loss function to be minimized, whereas the original formulation presents it as a maximization problem, with the sign obviously flipped.</p>

<p>Then, Goodfellow proceeds by framing (8) as a min-max game, where the discriminator seeks to maximize the given quantity whereas the generator seeks to achieve the reverse. In other words,</p>

\[\min_G \max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{9}\]

<p>The min-max formulation is a concise one-liner that intuitively demonstrates the adversarial nature of thecompetition between the generator and the discriminator. However, in practice, we define separate loss functions for the generator and the discriminator as we have done above.  This is because the gradient of the function $y = \log x$ is steeper near $x = 0$ than that of the function $y = \log (1 - x)$, meaning that trying to maximize $\log(D(G(z)))$, or equivalently, minimizing $- \log(D(G(z)))$ is going to lead to quicker, more substantial improvements to the performance of the generator than trying to minimize $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$.</p>

<h2 id="model-optimization">Model Optimization</h2>

<p>Now that we have defined the loss functions for the generator and the discriminator, it’s time to leverage some math to solve the optimization problem, <em>i.e.</em> finding the parameters for the generator and the discriminator such that the loss functions are optimized. This corresponds to training the model in practical terms.</p>

<h2 id="training-the-discriminator">Training the Discriminator</h2>

<p>When training a GAN, we typically train one model at a time. In other words, when training the discriminator, the generator is assumed as fixed. We saw this in action in the <a href="https://jaketae.github.io/study/gan/">previous post</a> on how to build a basic GAN.</p>

<p>Let’s return back to the min-max game. The quantity of interest can be defined as a function of $G$ and $D$. Let’s call this the value function:</p>

\[V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \tag{10}\]

<p>In reality, we are more interested in the distribution modeled by the generator than $p_z$. Therefore, let’s create a new variable, $y = G(z)$, and use this substitution to rewrite the value function:</p>

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D(y))] \\ &amp;= \int_{x \in \chi} p_{data}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g(x) \log(1 - D(x)) \, dx
\end{align} \tag{11}\]

<p>The goal of the discriminator is to maximize this value function. Through a partial derivative of $V(G, D)$ with respect to $D(x)$, we see that the optimal discriminator, denoted as $D^*(x)$, occurs when</p>

\[\frac{p_{data}(x)}{D(x)} - \frac{p_g(x)}{1 - D(x)} = 0 \tag{12}\]

<p>Rearranging (12), we get</p>

\[D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \tag{12}\]

<p>And this is the condition for the optimal discriminator! Note that the formula makes intuitive sense: if some sample $x$ is highly genuine, we would expect $p_{data}(x)$ to be close to one and $p_g(x)$ to be converge to zero, in which case the optimal discriminator would assign 1 to that sample. On the other hand, for a generated sample $x = G(z)$, we expect the optimal discriminator to assign a label of zero, since $p_{data}(G(z))$ should be close to zero.</p>

<h2 id="training-the-generator">Training the Generator</h2>

<p>To train the generator, we assume the discriminator to be fixed and proceed with the analysis of the value function. Let’s first plug in the result we found above, namely (12), into the value function to see what turns out.</p>

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D^*) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D^*(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D^*(x))] \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right]
\end{align} \tag{13}\]

<p>To proceed from here, we need a little bit of inspiration. Little clever tricks like these are always a joy to look at.</p>

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D^*) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] \\ &amp;= - \log 4 + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log p_{data}(x) - \log \frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] \\ &amp; \quad+ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log p_g(x) - \log\frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] 
\end{align} \tag{14}\]

<p>If you are confused, don’t worry, you aren’t the only one. Basically, what is happening is that we are exploiting the properties of logarithms to pull out a $- \log4$ that previously did not exist. In pulling out this number, we inevitably apply changes to the terms in the expectation, specifically by dividing the denominator by two.</p>

<p>Why was this necessary? The magic here is that we can now interpret the expectations as Kullback-Leibler divergence:</p>

\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + D_{KL}\left(p_{data} \parallel \frac{p_{data} + p_g}{2} \right) + D_{KL}\left(p_g \parallel \frac{p_g + p_g}{2} \right) \tag{15}\]

<p>And it is here that we reencounter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Jensen-Shannon divergence</a>, which is defined as</p>

\[J(P,Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left( D(P \parallel R) + D(Q \parallel R) \right) \tag{16}\]

<p>where $R = \frac12(P + Q)$. This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence:</p>

\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + 2 \cdot D_{JS}(p_{data} \parallel p_g) \tag{15}\]

<p>The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function $V(G, D)$, we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words, $p_g$ and $p_{data}$ should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator $G$ is thus one that which is able to mimic $p_{data}$ to model a compelling model distribution $p_g$.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this post. In the next post, I plan to explore the concept of Fisher information and the Fisher matrix. It is going to be another math-heavy ride with gradients and Hessians, so keep you belts fastened!</p>

He didn't need the approval of some corporation to allow him to run code on his own machine, or distribute it for others to run on theirs. The code didn't have to run as an "app" in some restricted sandbox under Microsoft's OS (not that back then, DOS or Windows were even in any way locked down the way modern operating systems are). Documentation for all the "standard" hardware like video, keyboard, hard disks, etc. was openly available, so it didn't have to rely on proprietary drivers.</p><p>This is how it was at one time, and <i>what should have remained the standard today</i>, but instead it's turned into some utopian dream that those who grew up with "smart" devices can't even conceive as possible anymore.</p><p>Google has taken what became of this code, and turned it into an "open" system that is pretty much designed to track every aspect of people's lives in order to more effectively target them with psychological manipulation, which is what advertisements really are. And you're not really getting "free stuff" in return for this invasion either, since pretty much everything you buy includes a hidden "tax" that goes to support this massive industry.</p><p>"A supercomputer in everyone's pocket"? Yes, but it's not yours, nor can you even know what it does. Even the source code that is available is millions of lines that you couldn't inspect in all your lifetime.

<div><p>The EU has lots of laws, including some that were made after the DMA.  One of them is the CRA, which says that by the end of 2027 all app marketplaces are required to provide developer contact info to people who download software.

<div><p>Good catch.  Yes, side-loading directly from the developer website isn’t going to trigger marketplace obligations.  Those obligations still exist but are the responsibility of the developer directly.</p><p>Under the CRA, smartphones are considered to be much more critical from a security standpoint and, by the end of 2027, will have to follow an enhanced set of “best practices” to be able to enjoy a presumption of conformity.  The best practices are due to be published by December of this year.  I think Google already knows that developer attestations will be on that list and want to appear proactive instead of reactive.</p><p>The point still stands - the DMA does not exist in a vacuum.

<div><p>I think there are a few main contentions:</p><p>- The requirement, unless I'm mistaken, would tie a real-world identity of the developer to an app, who may wish to keep that separate from a pseudonym they may normally release things with.</p><p>- Unwillingness to give Google PII or just not tie a particular pseudonymous identity to that PII on Google.</p><p>- It puts absolute control in Google's hands for whether any app is allowed to run on most devices. There may be concerns about the types of decisions that may arise from this, not merely from recognized malware. Certain governments may ask Google to regulate apps allowed on such devices via this approach.</p><p>- Once this globally rolls out in 2027 it will mean the audience for apps from devs who don't agree to this will shrink dramatically. Only those presumably with AOSP based custom ROMs will be able to use those apps which may have a knock-on effect for dev motivation.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45052310"><td></td></tr><tr id="45051907"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45051907" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45051907&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45050502"></a></center></td><td><br>

Any app that runs counter to the desires of the parent of the platform can be killed and it becomes impossible to build a competitive ecosystem because the chicken &amp; egg software problem, something which open ecosystems can solve through compatibility laters, but that becomes unviable thanks to DRM and hardware integrity lockouts.</p><p>It's a nightmare scenario, our lives locked in to total corporate control. What do we get in return for that? Scammers won't be stopped by this, the key to grifting isn't technology but people. What you're suggesting is trading open platforms and open source and fortifying current marketplace monopolies for a marginal decrease in scams. For a while. Maybe. I suggest that is unbelievably stupid.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45051470"><td></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>I keep hearing what a <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/">cash</a> <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/">incinerator</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription-losing-money">AI</a> is, especially around inference. While it seems reasonable on the surface, I've often been wary of these kind of claims, so I decided to do some digging.</p>
<p>I haven't seen anyone really try to deconstruct the costs in running inference at scale and the economics really interest me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is really napkin math. I don't have any experience at running frontier models at scale, but I do know a lot about the costs and economics of running very high throughput services on the cloud and, also, some of the absolutely crazy margins involved from the hyperscalers vs bare metal. Corrections are most welcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some assumptions</h2>
<p>I'm only going to look at raw compute costs. This is obviously a complete oversimplification, but given how useful the current models are - even assuming no improvements - I want to stress test the idea that everyone is losing so much money on inference that it is completely unsustainable.</p>
<p>I've taken the cost of a single H100 at $2/hour. This is actually more than the current retail rental on demand price, and I (hope) the large AI firms are able to get these for a fraction of this price.</p>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/Pasted%20image%2020250827193941.png" alt="H100 pricing comparison"></p>
<p>Secondly, I'm going to use the architecture of DeepSeek R1 as the baseline, 671B total params with 37B active via mixture of experts. Given this gets somewhat similar performance to Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT5 I think it's a fair assumption to make.</p>
<h2>Working Backwards: H100 Math From First Principles</h2>
<h3>Production Setup</h3>
<p>Let's start with a realistic production setup. I'm assuming a cluster of 72 H100s at $2/hour each, giving us $144/hour in total costs.</p>
<p>For production latency requirements, I'm using a batch size of 32 concurrent requests per model instance, which is more realistic than the massive batches you might see in benchmarks. With tensor parallelism across 8 GPUs per model instance, we can run 9 model instances simultaneously across our 72 GPUs.</p>
<h4>Prefill Phase (Input Processing)</h4>
<p>The H100 has about 3.35TB/s of HBM bandwidth per GPU, which becomes our limiting factor for most workloads. With 37B active parameters requiring 74GB in FP16 precision, we can push through approximately 3,350GB/s ÷ 74GB = 45 forward passes per second per instance.</p>
<p>Here's the key insight: each forward pass processes ALL tokens in ALL sequences simultaneously. With our batch of 32 sequences averaging 1,000 tokens each, that's 32,000 tokens processed per forward pass. This means each instance can handle 45 passes/s × 32k tokens = 1.44 million input tokens per second. Across our 9 instances, we're looking at 13 million input tokens per second, or 46.8 billion input tokens per hour.</p>
<p>In reality, with MoE you might need to load different expert combinations for different tokens in your batch, potentially reducing throughput by 2-3x if tokens route to diverse experts. However, in practice, routing patterns often show clustering around popular experts, and modern implementations use techniques like expert parallelism and capacity factors to maintain efficiency, so the actual impact is likely closer to a 30-50% reduction rather than worst-case scenarios.</p>
<h4>Decode Phase (Output Generation)</h4>
<p>Output generation tells a completely different story. Here we're generating tokens sequentially - one token per sequence per forward pass. So our 45 forward passes per second only produce 45 × 32 = 1,440 output tokens per second per instance. Across 9 instances, that's 12,960 output tokens per second, or 46.7 million output tokens per hour.</p>
<h3>Raw Cost Per Token</h3>
<p>The asymmetry is stark: $144 ÷ 46,800M = $0.003 per million input tokens versus $144 ÷ 46.7M = $3.08 per million output tokens. That's a thousand-fold difference!</p>
<h3>When Compute Becomes the Bottleneck</h3>
<p>Our calculations assume memory bandwidth is the limiting factor, which holds true for typical workloads. But compute becomes the bottleneck in certain scenarios. With long context sequences, attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. Very large batch sizes with more parallel attention heads can also shift you to being compute bound.</p>
<p>Once you hit 128k+ context lengths, the attention matrix becomes massive and you shift from memory-bound to compute-bound operation. This can increase costs by 2-10x for very long contexts.</p>
<p>This explains some interesting product decisions. Claude Code artificially limits context to 200k  tokens - not just for performance, but to keep inference in the cheap memory-bound regime and avoid expensive compute-bound long-context scenarios. This is also why providers charge extra for 200k+ context windows - the economics fundamentally change.</p>
<h2>Real-World User Economics</h2>
<p>So to summarise, I suspect the following is the case based on trying to reverse engineer the costs (and again, keep in mind this is retail rental prices for H100s):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input processing is essentially free</strong> (~$0.001 per million tokens)</li>
<li><strong>Output generation has real costs</strong> (~$3 per million tokens)</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs map to what DeepInfra charges for R1 hosting, with the exception there is a much higher markup on input tokens.</p>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/Pasted%20image%2020250827200246.png" alt="DeepInfra R1 pricing"></p>
<h3>A. Consumer Plans</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$20/month ChatGPT Pro user</strong>: Heavy daily usage but token-limited
<ul>
<li>100k toks/day</li>
<li>Assuming 70% input/30% output: actual cost ~$3/month</li>
<li>5-6x markup for OpenAI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is your typical power user who's using the model daily for writing, coding, and general queries. The economics here are solid.</p>
<h3>B. Developer Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claude Code Max 5 user</strong> ($100/month): 2 hours/day heavy coding
<ul>
<li>~2M input tokens, ~30k output tokens/day</li>
<li>Heavy input token usage (cheap parallel processing) + minimal output</li>
<li>Actual cost: ~$4.92/month → 20.3x markup</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Claude Code Max 10 user</strong> ($200/month): 6 hours/day very heavy usage
<ul>
<li>~10M input tokens, ~100k output tokens/day</li>
<li>Huge number of input tokens but relatively few generated tokens</li>
<li>Actual cost: ~$16.89/month → 11.8x markup</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer use case is where the economics really shine. Coding agents like Claude Code naturally have a hugely asymmetric usage pattern - they input entire codebases, documentation, stack traces, multiple files, and extensive context (cheap input tokens) but only need relatively small outputs like code snippets or explanations. This plays perfectly into the cost structure where input is nearly free but output is expensive.</p>
<h3>C. API Profit Margins</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current API pricing</strong>: $3/15 per million tokens vs ~$0.01/3 actual costs</li>
<li><strong>Margins</strong>: 80-95%+ gross margins</li>
</ul>
<p>The API business is essentially a money printer. The gross margins here are software-like, not infrastructure-like.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We've made a lot of assumptions in this analysis, and some probably aren't right. But even if you assume we're off by a factor of 3, the economics still look highly profitable. The raw compute costs, even at retail H100 pricing, suggest that AI inference isn't the unsustainable money pit that many claim it to be.</p>
<p>The key insight that most people miss is just how dramatically cheaper input processing is compared to output generation. We're talking about a thousand-fold cost difference - input tokens at roughly $0.005 per million versus output tokens at $3+ per million.</p>
<p>This cost asymmetry explains why certain use cases are incredibly profitable while others might struggle. Heavy readers - applications that consume massive amounts of context but generate minimal output - operate in an almost free tier for compute costs. Conversational agents, coding assistants processing entire codebases, document analysis tools, and research applications all benefit enormously from this dynamic.</p>
<p>Video generation represents the complete opposite extreme of this cost structure. A video model might take a simple text prompt as input - maybe 50 tokens - but needs to generate millions of tokens representing each frame. The economics become brutal when you're generating massive outputs from minimal inputs, which explains why video generation remains so expensive and why these services either charge premium prices or limit usage heavily.</p>
<p>The "AI is unsustainably expensive" narrative may be serving incumbent interests more than reflecting economic reality. When established players emphasize massive costs and technical complexity, it discourages competition and investment in alternatives. But if our calculations are even remotely accurate, especially for input-heavy workloads, the barriers to profitable AI inference may be much lower than commonly believed.</p>
<p>Let's not hype the costs up so much that people overlook the raw economics. I feel everyone fell for this a decade or two ago with cloud computing costs from the hyperscalers and allowed them to become money printers. If we're not careful we'll end up with the same on AI inference.</p>

                        <h5><span>Update</span></h5>
<div><p>After evaluating the impact and community feedback, the Bitnami team has postponed the deletion of the Bitnami public catalog (<code>docker.io/bitnami</code>) until <strong>September 29th</strong>&nbsp;to give users more time to adapt to the upcoming changes.</p><p>To raise awareness before the registry deletion, we will run a series of <strong>brownouts</strong>&nbsp;over the coming weeks. During each brownout, a set of 10 container images from <code>docker.io/bitnami</code> will be temporarily unavailable for 24 hours. The scheduled brownouts are:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>August 28, 08:00 UTC → August 29, 08:00 UTC</li>
<li>September 2, 08:00 UTC → September 3, 08:00 UTC</li>
<li>September 17, 08:00 UTC → September 18, 08:00 UTC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>The list of affected applications will be published on the day of each brownout via our usual channels.</p><p>As previously announced, since August 28th, we have not published new Bitnami container images or Helm charts to Docker Hub in OCI format. The source code for containers and Helm charts remains available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.</p></div>

<h3>What's changing?</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually reside in the main Bitnami registry. Users who are currently pulling these images will need to update their pipelines, internal mirrors, and Kubernetes clusters to pull from a new location before that time. A couple of options users have:&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ol>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Switch to <a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami Secure Images</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Switch to the Bitnami Legacy Registry</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To retain existing functionality and maintain continuity of systems relying on Bitnami, we recommend switching to Bitnami Secure Images. In addition to a less disruptive transition, BSI helps strengthen your security and compliance posture by adopting the higher-quality images offered as part of BSI.&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span></p>

<h3>Switching to Bitnami Secure Images (BSI)</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable tags, long-term support versions, and more.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though a BSI subscription provides customers with the entire Bitnami Debian-based image catalog (which will continue to receive updates), we recommend users upgrade and start using the hardened Photon Linux-based images instead. These are designed to be replacement images for any of the Debian images and work with the same Helm charts.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Photon images provide many other benefits not previously available to users of Debian images, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Drastically reduced CVE count (e.g., 100+ CVEs to in some cases 0)</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Switching to Bitnami Legacy Registry</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Another option for users of Bitnami today is to switch to the historic archive registry called Bitnami Legacy. This is unsupported software that is being made available, at users' own risk, while they make plans for alternatives. As such, this is a temporary solution, and we do not plan to keep this registry around for long. It will quickly begin to accumulate vulnerabilities that are not patched and atrophy as any software frozen in time does. If this is your choice, </span><span>we strongly recommend copying the images you are using to your own registry; again, this should be considered a temporary solution. </span><span>While we think there are many better options to make before the August 28th change, this is an option of last resort for those who need more time.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Why is it a good time to consider upgrading your security and compliance for open source?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So why do all the work now to change what’s maybe been working and update the type of open source images you use? We get it, no one likes change. But the reality is the landscape of open source is changing all around us. For example, from 2019-2023, the number of malicious packages discovered has risen to more than 245,000 according to Sonatype. That’s 2x all the previous years combined. The implication is that bad actors are finding increasing opportunities to exploit open source software that is running in every major software organization around the world. Meanwhile, with the growth of AI and MCP models, open source consumption is only going to increase. So the risk profile tides are quickly rising around us, and having a better boat to be prepared for the impacts of this change is the only responsible response.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition, the </span><a href="https://www.european-cyber-resilience-act.com/#:~:text=The%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20is,throughout%20a%20product's%20life%20cycle." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Cyber Resilience Act in the EU</span></a><span> creates an impending obligation for many organizations doing business there to provide guarantees about the open source software they use in their organization. It could soon be a liability to use open source that doesn’t have the required documentation to prove it’s been sourced from a safe place and hasn’t been tampered with.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is why the launch of Bitnami Secure Images is so timely. BSI is making it easier than ever for organizations to responsibly prepare for what the future of open source software in our modern world looks like. As with many things, what started out simple has become increasingly complex and requires more care to navigate. Furthermore, BSI has one of the lowest TCOs in the industry, enabling more organizations than ever before to afford cutting-edge supply chain security. BSI is effectively democratizing security and compliance for open source so that it doesn’t require million-dollar contracts from vendors with sky-high valuations.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>What are Competitors trying to claim about Bitnami?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It’s also a great time for the competition to try and steer the narrative about Bitnami. Some have claimed that Bitnami is “pulling their free container images and Helm charts from public access”. However, if we look a little more closely at the changes Bitnami has announced, this statement is inaccurate. For one, Bitnami Helm charts continue to be an open source project, under Apache 2, freely available to the public on GitHub.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Second, what is actually changing is the built OCI artifacts. Essentially, Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive. Just ask those same competitors throwing shade at Bitnami why they have never offered to make their charts or images publicly available at the same scale Bitnami has?</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So users can continue to freely access the Helm chart source (as well as the Debian images). However, in order to sustain and support the dedicated team of engineers who maintain and build new charts and images, a subscription will be required if an organization needs the images and charts built and hosted in an OCI registry for them. And to reiterate the above again, organizations that choose this path are simultaneously upgrading their security posture and improving their OSS strategy.</span><span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>How do the changes on August 28th work?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The changes to the Bitnami repo are slated to begin on Aug 28th. They will not all be at once. Over a multi-week period, the images will be cleaned up from the registry to make room for the new ones. This is being done gradually to minimize the disruptions. However, we can’t be precise about which image will be removed at what time due to the complexity of the 84TB of OCI content that the engineering team will be dealing with. Therefore, it’s best to assume starting Aug 28th, every image used in a key business function should be addressed with an alternate registry.&nbsp;</span><span><b></b></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We’re making room in the mainline Bitnami registry so we can populate it with the free tier of Bitnami Secure Images. These hardened Photon have the same names as the Debian images, so they can’t occupy the same registry. And we want new adopters of Bitnami to start with the secure images going forward, as we believe this is the future of open-source software on the internet. In </span><a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>this FAQ</span></a>,<span> you can find more information about all the details of the upcoming changes.</span></p>

<h2 id="about">About<a href="#about" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document tracks existing procedures or proposals for integrating and
validating TLS/HTTPS certificates for Onion Services.</p>
<p>While some depends on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authorities</a> (CA) model, others rely on
alternative certification and validation procedures that does not require
built-in certificate chains in the client software or reliance on financial
transactions.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you browse the internet regularly, the connection between your
computer and a service is usually encrypted, and the safety of this
communication happens through the verification of a special type of
certificate.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://onionservices.torproject.org/technology/">Onion Services</a>, the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted by default,
which means that no additional certificates are needed.</p>
<p>But as the web and other internet technologies mature, certificates are
starting to be a requirement in order to unleash functionalities, especially in
web browsers, such as the faster connection protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a> and payment
processing.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to improve the certificate ecosystem to fully support
<a href="https://onionservices.torproject.org/technology/">Onion Services</a>.</p>
<p>This is a hard problem, and an ongoing effort, but there has been some
important work done to solve this.</p>
<p>The most relevant one should bring automation to the process of issuing
certificates for Onion Services, through an enhancement in a protocol called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#acme-for-onions">ACME for Onions</a> proposal is composed of tools and also
an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-misell-acme-onion/">Internet Draft</a>, which hopefully will turn into an
Internet Standard soon.</p>
<p>We are also looking into other, non-conflicting alternatives that can also be
used for certification, so service operators can decide which one fits best their
use case.</p>
<p>Improving the certificate functionality will put Onion Services in parity
with the modern stack of web development.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits<a href="#benefits" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It may be argued that Onion Services connections are already
<em>self-authenticated</em> -- since the public key and the URL are tied together and
the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted --, and thus making the need for HTTPS
pointless, or at most giving only an impression on users of additional security.</p>
<p>But having valid HTTPS connection in Onion Services could enable many other
enhancements, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some browser features are available only with HTTPS, like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">Secure
   Contexts</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> (CSP), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#security">Secure cookies</a>,
   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn</a>, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PaymentRequest">PaymentRequest</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user may be using a browser that isn't the Tor browser.  For
   example on iOS there is only Safari, and in such cases the browser
   will not be aware of the different semantics of security for an onion
   site, and won't allow the use of secure browser features (such as
   secure cookies). This limits the kind of web apps people can develop
   on onionsites as many modern browser APIs mentioned above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows for the usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>, since some browsers only support it if
   on HTTPS<sup id="fnref:http3-availability"><a href="#fn:http3-availability">1</a></sup>. In the future, HTTP2 and HTTP3 may only
   work with TLS, and thus valid certificates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2023-April/014833.html">It also opens up new opportunities such as payment processing</a>, <em>"as current
   PCI DSS requirements do not allow non-standard TLS"</em><sup id="fnref:pci-dss-tls"><a href="#fn:pci-dss-tls">2</a></sup> and may
   only work with certificates having some sort of validation<sup id="fnref:pci-dss-self-signed"><a href="#fn:pci-dss-self-signed">3</a></sup>.
   Payments card networks require HTTPS for a payment to be taken. So if
   someone wants to do that over an onion site they would need a TLS
   certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could be argued that this is also security-in-depth by having yet another
   layer of encryption atop of other existing encryption layers. Even if the
   theoretical gain in terms of interception and tampering resistance is not
   relevant, it would still allow for service operators to split their encryption
   keys in different servers -- like one with the Onion Service keys and a backend
   having the TLS keys, thus making a compromise in one of the servers exposing
   only the cryptographic material of one of the communication layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Tor daemon that hosts the onion site might not be the final
   computer in the chain. In larger organizations, deployment concerns
   may result in plain HTTP traveling across their network from the Tor
   daemon to the final web server. Having HTTPs protects those hops in
   the chain. This is something that distributed setups may need. The same
   could be said for a web browser using Tor SOCKS proxy somewhere else on the
   network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-web based applications, such as IMAP/POP/SMTP etc. can benefit
   from certificates being valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is simply too much software that isn't aware of onionsites,
   and trying to force HTTP-over-Onion to be as secure as HTTPS-over-TCP
   creates a compatibility mess of things which do and don't know about
   the semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is value in exposing the existence of an onion site via <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">CT
   Logs</a>. If someone navigates to the plain web version of a site, and is
   presented with a certificate containing a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for
   both the plain web and the onion site that provides a strong cryptographic
   guarantee that they are the same site. Effectively this would replace the
   Onion-Location header with something more authenticated<sup id="fnref:non-ct-logs"><a href="#fn:non-ct-logs">4</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following discussion is not yet conclusive, and the problem space may be
hard to solve.</p>

<h2 id="self-signed-certificates">Self-signed certificates<a href="#self-signed-certificates" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This proposal basically consists in allowing the use of self-signed
certificates with Onion Services:</p>
<ol>
<li>For web applications like the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>, this would consist
   in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/13410">disabling self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion
   sites</a>. As an alternative, there's also the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/Meetings/2024/Lisbon/self-auth-certs-for-onion-services">Self-authenticating TLS
   Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module</a> discussed
   below and relying on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1">Authority Information Access
   (AIA)</a> extensions, which could handle self-signed certificates matching
   the Onion Service address without the need to merge this logic directly in
   the applications, as it would remain decoupled in a PKCS#11 module, thus
   being easier to maintain.</li>
<li>For other applications -- like the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/vpn/">TorVPN</a> and third-party software --,
   this would probably require patches or documentation instructing users to
   accept non-CA signed certificates when accessing Onion Services, which is
   very hard to provide and to maintain for a wide ranging of tools.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>Supported key types</p>
<p>In this proposal, any key types supported by applications could be used.</p>
<p>In case of popular web browsers, the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a>
must be taken into account, which as of 2024-09 only allows for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a> keys.</p>
<p>It could also be possible to use self-signed certs using <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>,
which is discussed below and currently not widely supported by
browsers.</p>
</div>
<p>This proposal <em>would not provide</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A self-authentication mechanism</em> (since the certificate is self-signed).
   This have a huge weight since an important piece of security provided
   by HTTPS is not just end-to-end encryption but also authentication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Supporting self-signed certificates with Onion Services has a huge gain,
but also introduces an authentication complexity. That's why proper UI
indicators and hints are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the encryption state of the site (HTTP and various HTTPS situations).</li>
<li>For the authentication state of the site, telling how it was (not)
   authenticated.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are already sketches for <a href="https://onionservices.torproject.org/research/scenarios/certificates/">different scenarios</a> for how various user
interface hints and indicators could exist for <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> and other software
maintained by Tor, as well as existing certificate proposals that can change
the certificate landscape for Onion Services in the future, which could be
adopted by operators instead of relying on self-signed certs.</p>
<p>But all these enhancements would still limit the practical application domain
of this proposal, since it would be readily available only to a small set
of applications like <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>, except if by pursuing some standardization
such as the <a href="#same-origin-onion-certificates-sooc">SOOC</a> proposal below.</p>
<h2 id="self-signed-x509-from-onion-self-signed-by-the-onion-address">Self-signed X.509 from .onion (self-signed by the .onion address)<a href="#self-signed-x509-from-onion-self-signed-by-the-onion-address" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another option for having HTTPS in Onion Services that may be available in the
future is to use Onion Service key pair to self-validate an HTTPS certificate
using <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/ahf/onion-x509">Onion x509</a> is an example in how a CA self-signed by an .onion could
  be constructed.</li>
<li>There's also a ticket requesting to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/18696">add support for self-signed HTTPS onion
  sites derived from onion service's ed25519 key</a> in the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an overview of <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>, check <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/warner/2011/11/29/ed25519-keys/">How do Ed5519 keys work?</a>. For details

for how it implements at the Onion Services level).</p>
<p>This proposal has the advantage to not rely on Certificate Authorities, but the
disadvantage that needs additional logic both server and client side to make it
work, since a CA would needed to be installed for every visited Onion Service
using this scheme.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the current (as of 2024-09) Onion Services v3
specification does not allow the Master Onion Service identity key to be used
for purposes other than generating blinded signing keys (see Section 1.9 from
the <a href="https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3">rend-spec-v3</a>):</p>
<blockquote>

  used as the identity for a hidden service.  This key is long

<p>Also, while <a href="https://ianix.com/pub/ed25519-deployment.html#ed25519-tls">many TLS libraries support the Ed25519 signing scheme</a> used for
certificates (like in <a href="https://blog.pinterjann.is/ed25519-certificates.html">OpenSSL since version 1.1.1</a>), <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/236931/whats-the-deal-with-x25519-support-in-chrome-firefox">major web browsers

<p>In summary, implementing this proposal would require pushing at least two
specification changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A ballot with CA/B Forum about including <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> support.</li>
<li>An update in the Onion Services v3 spec, allowing the Onion Service identity
   keys to either:<ol>
<li>Also act as Certificate Authority root keys for the service.</li>
<li>Derive long-term (1 year) blinded keys to be used as a Certificate
   Authority for the service, maybe using the same approach described by
   Appendix A (<code>[KEYBLIND]</code>) from <a href="https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3">rend-spec-v3</a> but covering the needed
   use case of a long-term key, i.e, depending in a long-term nonce and not in
   <code>[TIME-PERIODS]</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's also important to avoid using the Onion Service key directly as the HTTPS
certificate. That would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose the Onion Service secret key material to more software than it's
  needed, like a web server.</li>
<li>Make it very difficult to manage offline Onion Service master keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, it's better to use the Onion Service key pair to act as a CA that then
certifies a separate key pair to be used with HTTPS.</p>
<p>Similar to the self-signed certificate proposal, this approach would have
limited adoption if only as small number of applications implement it -- such
as the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> --, except if endorsed by many stakeholders in the form of a
specification -- like the SOOC proposal discussed below.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/Meetings/2024/Lisbon/self-auth-certs-for-onion-services">Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11
module</a> proposal mentioned above, that relies on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> or
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1">Authority Information Access (AIA)</a> extensions, could also be used to work
with a X.509 certificate directly derived from the .onion key pair.</p>
<p>But contrary to the previous proposal, it would not need to use <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>: it
would support a signature scheme where an <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> private key could sign an
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a> key. This <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> signature could either be created using the .onion
private key itself or a fresh <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> subkey, thus avoiding key reuse.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Would reduce logic in the Tor Browser by a well-established API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not need to use <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> X.509 certificates: can work with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/">ECDSA</a>
  which are fully supported by major browsers according to the
  <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a>, and maybe could even work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems future-proof as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> are widely used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No reliance on the CA-model (and hence has increased censorship resistance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to use <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">CT Logs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be used by other browsers as well (such as Brave).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could be used with any software, library or Operating System with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11">PKCS#11</a>
  support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the short-to-mid term this would not be supported on OpenSSL
  (as of 2024-09, support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11">PKCS#11 modules</a> is still underway).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System-wide support would depend on how each Operating System could support
  this custom module. So could be hard to add this to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/vpn/">TorVPN</a>. But anyway,
  <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/vpn/">TorVPN</a> can't validate existing self-signed .onion certs either, as
  of 2024-09.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators currently using self-signed certs would need to migrate to new
  certificates.</p>

<h2 id="same-origin-onion-certificates-sooc">Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC)<a href="#same-origin-onion-certificates-sooc" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/alecmuffett/onion-dv-certificate-proposal">Same Origin Onion Certificates</a> (SOOC) proposal aims to specify when "in
very limited circumstances, we shall not care about signatures at all",
allowing clients to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/13410">disable self-signed certificate warnings when visiting
.onion sites</a>.</p>
<p>The main difference between the SOOC proposal and to simply start allowing
self-signed certificates is that SOOC is aimed to be an IETF proposal that
could gain momentum and hence have a greater chance to be adopt by many
different vendors.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xE5eaDMiOKphDxijK9tfIWHUB-h-fTG8tb3laofXLSc/edit#heading=h.dphbi0rss5tj">the SOOC document</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="dane-for-onion">DANE for .onion<a href="#dane-for-onion" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another option is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities</a> (DANE),
with DNS records like this to associate an Onion Service address with a given
HTTPS certificate's public key hash:</p>
<pre><code>_443._tcp.testk4ae7qr6nhlgahvyicxy7nsrmfmhigtdophufo3vumisvop2gryd.onion. TSLA 3 1 1 AB9BEB9919729F3239AF08214C1EF6CCA52D2DBAE788BB5BE834C13911292ED9
</code></pre>
<p>In order for that to work, logic should be implemented in the client software.</p>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Service operators must update this record whenever a new certificate is issued.</li>
<li>Has some <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6698#appendix-A.2.1.3">limits for wildcard certificates on specific ports</a>.</li>
<li>DANE is not widely supported, especially by web browsers.</li>
<li>It would only work for service operators willing to publish the .onion address in the DNS.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="onion-only-cas">Onion-only CAs<a href="#onion-only-cas" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This proposal consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having .onion-only CAs with name constraints (only allowing issuance for
   .onion). Services available both via DNS-based and .onion domains will need
   to have two TLS certificates in order to use this approach -- one certificate
   for the DNS-based domain (as usual) and another only for the .onion address.</li>
<li>Certification procedure would be automated, so generated .onion addresses
   could easily have it's certificates issued by this special type of CA.</li>
<li>Certification would then happen by checking a signature in a CSR and
   comparing the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Signature must be validated by
   the .onion address in the SAN.</li>
<li>So this type of CA would be mainly a basic notary that attests signatures and
   issues a corresponding certificate.</li>
<li>The name constraint for this type of CA ensures that it only issues
   certificates for .onion domains.</li>
</ol>
<p>Security considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose there's a malicious or bugged CA of this type that issues a
   certificate containing a SAN for <code>$address1.onion</code> but:<ol>
<li>Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by
   <code>$address1.onion</code>'s private key.</li>
<li>Or if allowing that another, unrelated <code>$address2.onion</code> actually signs
   this CSR.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Even if that's the case, i.e, the CA wrongly issued a certificate for
   <code>$address1.onion</code> that did not match the requirements, this certificate
   won't work in practice, since in a successful Onion Service TLS connection
   to <code>$address1.onion</code> the following must happen:<ol>
<li>The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the
   client is connected to <code>$address1.onion</code> (Onion Services connections
   are self-authenticated by the .onion address).</li>
<li>The Onion Service should then offer it's TLS certificate, which would
   not be the malicious one (except if the service is already compromised,
   but in that case the attacker would not need to forge an invalid certificate
   anyway...).</li>
<li>Then the client's TLS library tests whether the certificate chain can be
   verified and any SAN in the presented certificate matches <code>$address1.onion</code>,
   among other checks (such as expiration).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>That said, the work done by this special type of CA is only to <em>expand the
  self-authentication property</em> from the .onion address into a certificate. So
<em>the attack surface of this special type of CA may be inherently low</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a> certificates probably won't be supported by major
  browsers/clients in the foreseeable future (see discussion above at the
  <a href="#self-signed-x509-from-onion-self-signed-by-the-onion-address">Self-signed X.509 for .onion</a> section), issuance should probably follow the
  Appendix B of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline Requirements</a>.</li>
<li>The entire certification procedure could happen via Onion Services.</li>
<li>Actually the whole CA infrastructure (website, APIs, OCSP etc) could be
  interacted only via Onion Services, to reduce the attack surface and protect
  the service location.</li>
<li>Important to consider whether would be possible to organizations setup and
  maintain a Onion-only CA that's as most automated as possible, including root
  certificate packaging/distribution/rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to implement on the client side (just need to install the CA).</li>
<li>Easy to implement and maintain on Tor-native applications such as Tor
   Browser and the Tor VPN.</li>
<li>Possibly lowest attack surface than with regular CAs!</li>
<li>Largest certification expiration dates could be used (like one year).</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Might not be easy to find CAs willing to do this, or to a new one to be
   formed for this purpose.</li>
<li>Might need a merge request to include this method in the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.0.7.pdf">CA/B Baseline
   Requirements</a>, if wider acceptance is intended.</li>
<li>No guarantees that these special CAs would be installed among all clients
   and libraries.</li>
<li>Need additional security analysis.</li>

<ol>
<li>Need to check if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)</a> are needed,
   and how to handle it.</li>
<li>Need to figure out how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP Stapling</a> could happen. OSCP
   connection could be available behind an Onion Service.</li>
<li>Does sending certificates to <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">CT Logs</a> still makes sense for this special
   type of certification?</li>
<li>Needs built-in DoS/service abuse protection:<ul>
<li>An idea for that: implement a simple PoW by additionally requiring that
  service operators provide a proof-ownership of another .onion address
  made by an specific vanity address (like limited to 5 or 6 chars).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p dir="auto">bookmarks.txt is a concept of keeping bookmarks in plain text files.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Principals</h2><a id="user-content-principals" aria-label="Permalink: Principals" href="#principals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bookmarked URLs are stored in files named <code>bookmarks.txt</code>. The format is described below.</li>
<li>A "global" bookmarks file is located in the home directory (<code>$HOME/bookmarks.txt</code>).</li>

</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Format</h2><a id="user-content-format" aria-label="Permalink: Format" href="#format"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">URLs are stored one per line and could be accompanied with optional titles. Titles are separated from URLs with one space character.</p>

<p dir="auto">Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">a URL without any title</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="https://www.example.com
-----------------------
^
URL"><pre><code>https://www.example.com

<p dir="auto">The plain text nature of bookmark files allows to use any program to manage URLs.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> to select a URL and open it in the default browser:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open"><pre><span>./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open</span></pre></div>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt"><pre><span>./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is how I use bookmarks.txt:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>$HOME/bookmarks.txt</code> contains URLs useful in any context. These are "global" addresses.</li>
<li>Each project directory has "local" <code>bookmarks.txt</code> files with URLs pointing to tools specific to each project (repositories, monitoring tools, dashboards, and so on).</li>
<li>A symbolic link <code>$HOME/bin/bookmarks</code> point to <code>bin/bookmarks</code> from this directory.</li>
<li>With help of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> I have a nice menu with fuzzy search to select URLs and open them automatically.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Register recently published a story titled <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/27/popular_nodejs_utility_used_by/">Putin on the code: DoD reportedly relies on utility written by Russian dev</a>. They should be ashamed of this story. This poor open source developer is getting beat up now to score some internet points. It’s very upsetting.</p>
<p>But anyway, let’s look at some receipts.</p>
<p>If you’re not real smrt, it seems like pointing out an open source project is written by one person in a country you don’t like is a bad thing. It could be. But it also could be the software running THE WHOLE F*CKING PLANET is written by one person. In a country. But we have no idea which country. It’s not the same person mind you, but it’s one person.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Almost all open source is literally one person. What I mean by that is if you look at all the open source projects out there, and there are a lot, we see a pattern of one person no matter how we slice and dice the data.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the data. A project exists called <a href="https://ecosyste.ms/">ecosyste.ms</a> that catalogs a lot of open source. Most of it I would guess, but not all. They currently have 11.8 million open source projects in their data. You would be right to think that is a big number. I’m told anything over 15 is a big number, but it probably depends how smart you are, or think you are.</p>
<p>So what do we mean by one person is open source. What I mean is if we look at all the projects that ecosyste.ms is tracking, how many have a single person maintaining that project? It’s about 7 million. This is also a big number. 7 million open source projects are one person. It’s actually bigger than that, because of the 11.8 million projects ecosyste.ms is tracking, we don’t know how many maintainers 4 million of the projects have. A bunch of those will be one person. Here’s what a graph of this looks like</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcesecurity.io/images/post-images/1-maintainer.png"></p>
<p>I clipped the graph so it looks nicer. There are projects with hundreds of maintainers. Not a ton, but they exist.</p>
<p>Now, the clever people among us are thinking “but Josh, surely these 7 million projects are all things nobody uses, the important open source we all use has loads of maintainers!!!”</p>
<p>You would be right to think that. It’s the first thought I had back when I started to look at this data. It’s OK. You’re still in the denial stage. Hopefully you’ll reach anger by the end of this post.</p>
<p>So we’re going to use the NPM ecosystem to explain this. I use NPM because they have the richest data in ecosyste.ms to explain my point. I’ve done this same thing across multiple ecosystems and the graphs all look the same.</p>
<p>So, what does the NPM maintainer graph look like.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcesecurity.io/images/post-images/1-maintainer-npm.png">
Your first thought is probably “why is the left axis green?” It’s not an axis, it’s the single maintainer number. It’s that huge compared to literally all the other data. There are just that many single person NPM projects.</p>
<p>So now, let’s look at the number of maintainers for projects with over 1 million downloads this month.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcesecurity.io/images/post-images/1-maintainer-downloads.png"></p>
<p>This time the graph shows how many downloads projects with over 1 million downloads, and one maintainer or more than one maintainer. It was easier to show the data by creating these two buckets.</p>
<p>That’s almost a 50/50 split. Think about that. About half of the 13,000 most downloaded NPM packages are ONE PERSON. We can change the download number and the graph stays this shape. It’s not until I change downloads to 1 billion downloads that we see 1 package maintained by 1 person, and 9 packages maintained by more than 1.</p>
<p>This is open source. Open source is one person, even the popular stuff.</p>
<p>I will also add, a lot of people own more than one package. So while NPM has over 4 million single person projects, they have about 900,000 maintainers for those 4 million single person projects. This will be an important data point at the end.</p>
<p>So here’s the big conclusion. If you want to make a big deal about something, maybe it shouldn’t be what country a sole maintainer is from. Let’s face it, the Russians aren’t dumb enough to backdoor a package owned by a guy living in Russia. They’re going to do something like pretend to be from another country with a name like Jia Tan, not Boris D. Badguy. This isn’t a Rocky and Bullwinkle episode.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the conclusion</p>
<p>Open source, the thing that drives the world, the thing Harvard says has an economic value of 8.8 trillion dollars (also a big number). Most of it is one person. And I can promise you not one of those single person projects have the proper amount of resources they need. If you want to talk about possible risks to your supply chain, a single maintainer that’s grossly underpaid and overworked. That’s the risk. The country they are from is irrelevant.</p>
<p>And now if we have news stories being written about how a single person maintainer is the bad guy? That’s not cool (this is where your denial is supposed to turn into anger).</p>
<p>So what can you do about this? How can you turn your newly denial-turned-anger into action? We don’t really know unfortunately. I discussed this in a podcast episode <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/2025-06-hobbyist-thomas-depierre/">Hobbyist Maintainers with Thomas DePierre</a>. Like many hard problems, there isn’t an easy solution. But I guarantee the solution isn’t hunting down and demonizing single maintainers.</p>

Kennedy Jr. </span></p><p>Here are the emails that each of the officials sent to their CDC colleagues by Dr. Deb Houry, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, and Dr. Daniel Jernigan. </p><p><strong>Dr. Deb Houry, Deputy Director for Program and Science/Chief Medical Officer:</strong></p><p>“Over the past decade, I have had the honor of working for six CDC directors, from both Republican and Democratic administrations. To me, these leaders and my colleagues were not “Red” or “Blue,” but red, white, and blue—united in the shared purpose of protecting health and saving lives in our beloved country and globally. I have served during this time in various leadership roles, including as CDC’s senior-most career leader and lead for the transition as the current administration assumed office.</p><p>I’ve always been proud to be part of an institution that is committed to using science and data to drive our life-saving work and inform our messaging. We have worked tirelessly to enhance openness through public-facing data dashboards, providing real-time access to trends for conditions such as mpox, H5N1, measles, and overdose deaths, allowing the public to make informed decisions. Additionally, I have witnessed the rapid translation of science into action, with some Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWRs) being published within a week of an outbreak.</p><p>For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations. Vaccines save lives—this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact. Informed consent and shared decision-making must focus not only on the risks but also on the true, life-saving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities. It is, of course, important to question, analyze, and review research and surveillance, but this must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias, and considering the full weight of scientific evidence. Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of U.S. measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.</p><p>CDC must continue its work on all diseases, including noncommunicable health conditions, which include many of the leading causes of death in the US. I have seen the value of integrating these efforts with those of other CDC programs, as we did with the Zika virus. Integrating expertise from across the agency is critical to our effectiveness in addressing novel and emerging diseases. CDC has proven its value in addressing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, overdose, and mental health issues, as evidenced by the progress in reducing overdose deaths this year. However, proposed budget cuts and reorganization plans will negatively impact CDC's ability to address these conditions, worsening the nation's health.</p><p>I love this agency. Nevertheless, I have submitted my resignation today. I am committed to protecting the public’s health, but the ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency. This is a heartbreaking decision that I make with a heavy heart.</p><p>To the CDC staff, you are the reason I stayed and showed up each day during difficult times. I have done my best to provide support so that you can continue your critical work. Thank you for your continued commitment to our mission and the work you do every day.</p><p>As I move on to the next phase of my career, I will continue to advocate for the values that have always driven my work—science, data, and evidence-based solutions to public health challenges. I have been privileged to contribute to the CDC’s mission in many roles, including as Chief Medical Officer, and I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to serve alongside you.</p><p>Deb Houry, MD, MPH.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (two emails, one to colleagues, and a longer formal resignation):</strong></p><p>“It has been a great pleasure to serve in the role of Director of NCIRD. I wish I could say more in person, but wanted to make sure that you all have heard from me directly that I have submitted my resignation. I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health. You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession.</p><p>Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the right decisions for yourselves. I will send a longer email to our Center this evening or in the morning.</p><p>Demetre Daskalakis.”</p><p><em><span>And here is Dr. Daskalakis’s formal resignation letter to Dr. Houry, </span><a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" rel="">posted</a><span> on X/Twitter:</span></em></p><p>“Dear Dr. Houry, I am writing to formally resign from my position as Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), effective August 28, 2025, close of business. I am happy to stay on for two weeks to provide transition, if requested. This decision has not come easily, as I deeply value the work that the CDC does in safeguarding public health and am proud of my contributions to that critical mission. However, after much contemplation and reflection on recent developments and perspectives brought to light by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I find that the views he and his staff have shared challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency and in the service of the health of the American people. Enough is enough. While I hold immense respect for the institution and my colleagues, I believe that it is imperative to align my professional responsibilities to my system of ethics and my understanding of the science of infectious disease, immunology, and my promise to serve the American people. This step is necessary to ensure that I can contribute effectively in a capacity that allows me to remain true to my principles. I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public’s health. The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people. The data analyses that supported this decision have never been shared with CDC despite my respectful requests to HHS and other leadership. This lack of meaningful engagement was further compounded by a “frequently asked questions” document written to support the Secretary’s directive that was circulated by HHS without input from CDC subject matter experts and that cited studies that did not support the conclusions that were attributed to these authors. Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people. It is untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC. The lack of communication by HHS and other CDC political leadership that culminates in social media posts announcing major policy changes without prior notice demonstrate a disregard of normal communication channels and common sense. Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function. Some examples include the announcement of the change in the COVID-19 recommendations for children and pregnant people, the firing of scientists from ACIP by X post and an op-ed rather than direct communication with these valuable experts, the announcement of new ACIP members by X before onboarding and vetting have completed, and the release of term of reference for an ACIP workgroup that ignored all feedback from career staff at CDC. The recent term of reference for the COVID vaccine work group created by this ACIP puts people of dubious intent and more dubious scientific rigor in charge of recommending vaccine policy to a director hamstrung and sidelined by an authoritarian leader. Their desire to please a political base will result in death and disability of vulnerable children and adults. Their base should be the people they serve not a political voting bloc. I have always been first to challenge scientific and public health dogma in my career and was excited by the opportunity to do so again. I was optimistic that there would be an opportunity to brief the Secretary about key topics such as measles, avian influenza, and the highly coordinated approach to the respiratory virus season. Such briefings would allow exchange of ideas and a shared path to support the vision of “Making America Healthy Again.” We are seven months into the new administration, and no CDC subject matter expert from my Center has ever briefed the Secretary. I am not sure who the Secretary is listening to, but it is quite certainly not to us. Unvetted and conflicted outside organizations seem to be the sources HHS use over the gold standard science of CDC and other reputable sources. At a hearing, Secretary Kennedy said that Americans should not take medical advice from him. To the contrary, an appropriately briefed and inquisitive Secretary should be a source of health information for the people he serves. As it stands now, I must agree with him, that he should not be considered a source of accurate information. The intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines favoring natural infection and unproven remedies will bring us to a pre-vaccine era where only the strong will survive and many if not all will suffer. I believe in nutrition and exercise. I believe in making our food supply healthier, and I also believe in using vaccines to prevent death and disability. Eugenics plays prominently in the rhetoric being generated and is derivative of a legacy that good medicine and science should continue to shun. The recent shooting at CDC is not why I am resigning. My grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud. I am resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and his minions’ words over decades created an environment where violence like this can occur. I reject his and his colleagues’ thoughts and prayers, and advise they direct those to people that they have not actively harmed. For decades, I have been a trusted voice for the LGBTQ community when it comes to critical health topics. I must also cite the recklessness of the administration in their efforts to erase transgender populations, cease critical domestic and international HIV programming, and terminate key research to support equity as part of my decision. Public health is not merely about the health of the individual, but it is about the health of the community, the nation, the world. The nation’s health security is at risk and is in the hands of people focusing on ideological self-interest. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the opportunities for growth, learning, and collaboration that I have been afforded during my time at the CDC. It has been a privilege to work alongside such dedicated professionals who are committed to improving the health and well-being of communities across the nation even when under attack from within both physically and psychologically. Thank you once again for the support and guidance I have received from you and previous CDC leadership throughout my tenure. I wish the CDC continued success in its vital mission and that HHS reverse its dangerous course to dismantle public health as a practice and as an institution. If they continue the current path, they risk our personal well-being and the security of the United States. </p><p>Sincerely, Demetre C. Daskalakis MD MPH (he/his/him)”</p><p><strong>Dr. Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases:</strong></p><p>Colleagues: I wanted to let you know directly that I have submitted my resignation as Director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases effective tomorrow. This was a very difficult decision for me. I have had the incredible opportunity to serve the American people doing meaningful and impactful work for over 30 years.</p><p>Since 1994, I have worked at CDC with some of the most intelligent, driven, and compassionate people, working to detect, control, and prevent infectious diseases. These efforts have had significant impact mitigating illness, preventing deaths, and improving the lives of millions of people.</p><p>I believe strongly in the mission of public health and the leadership that CDC has given for almost 80 years; however, given the current context in the Department, I feel it is best for me to offer my resignation.</p><p>I am so grateful for being able to work with all of you and know that you will continue doing the highest level of science and public health.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Dan.”</p><p><span>The news of these resignations set off a firestorm in public health circles. </span><em>This is not normal. </em><span>There had been speculation that this particular trio of leaders would resign depending on how the September meeting of Secretary Kennedy’s newly-installed CDC Advisory Commitee on Immunization Practices went. There has been mounting fear that Secretary Kennedy will attempt to link vaccines to autism in a forthcoming HHS report, and that ACIP will be expected to remove many of its recommendations, some decades old, that have protected American children from death and severe illness from preventable diseases. But news of Monarez’s ouster meant that the writing was on the wall, moving these resignations up by weeks. </span></p><p>Frankly, the very future of the CDC is unknown. Thousands of good scientists and other agency officials remain. But without these key leaders—non-partisan career officials widely respected both internally and beyond—the agency is genuinely at risk of losing its ability to carry out its core mission. That’s not because any three people, (regardless of how experienced or respected they may be) are irreplaceable, but, rather, for what their departures portend. Other leaders and career scientists may also soon exit or be forced out. At some point, core mission activities that keep us safe will be at risk of being unfulfilled. </p><p>When these losses will translate to decreased safety to Americans that is noticeable is an open question.

<h2>
Joe Gebbia has no business designing government services.
</h2>
<p>
President Trump’s appointment of AirBnB co-founder Joe Gebbia as “Chief Design Officer” of the United States is a sickening travesty. It not only proves a fundamental misunderstanding of both design and governance, but an unbound commitment to corruption.
</p>
<p>
Gebbia’s directive to make government services “as satisfying to use as the Apple Store” within three years might serve as an appealing soundbite, but it quickly collapses under the slightest scrutiny: why? how? with what design army? The creation of the so-called National Design Studio and Gebbia’s appointment as its chief should raise serious questions about credentials, institutional destruction, and continued corruption.
</p>
<h2>
Design by Regulatory Arbitrage
</h2>
<p>
Gebbia’s reputation in design rests on a shaky foundation. AirBnB’s present dominance isn’t the product of real innovation. He and his friends stumbled upon an idea after listing their apartment on Craigslist for under-the-table sublease during a popular conference. They realized money could be made, and built a website to let other people do the same thing, through them, not Craig. Good on them, but renting a space is regulated differently than selling a used couch for many good reasons. What you could once attribute to the same quaint naivety of setting up a lemonade stand, you can no longer. The people who funded them knew better, and eventually, so did they.
</p>
<p>
What AirBnB does today is no different, other than the legitimization that comes with lots of capital and a slick app. But let’s be clear: The innovation was never about design, it was about collusion: spend enough to ensure that regulatory enforcement costs more; spin enough to make theft look heroic. With Y-Combinator as a launchpad, the company rapidly built its business by systematically ignoring well-established regulations in hospitality and real estate. This sounds like a perfect match for the Trump Administration, and it’s why I cannot take any of Gebbia’s commitments now at face value. His formative business experience taught him to break existing systems rather than designing better ones, and for that he was rewarded beyond anyone’s wildest imaginations.
</p>
<p>
True design requires understanding constraints, working within complex systems, and serving users’ actual needs rather than exploiting regulatory gaps. Gebbia’s track record suggests a fundamentally different approach — one that prioritizes disruption over responsibility and profit over genuine public service. I’m not sure he can differentiate between entitlement and expertise, self and service, commerce and civics.
</p>
<h2>
Institutional Vandalism
</h2>
<p>
The hubris of this appointment becomes clearer when viewed alongside the recent dismantling of <span>18F</span>, the federal government’s existing design services office. Less than a year ago, Trump and Elon Musk’s <span>DOGE</span> initiative completely eviscerated this team, which was modeled after the <span>UK</span>’s Government Digital Service and comprised hundreds of design practitioners with deep expertise in government systems. Many of us likely knew someone at <span>18F</span>. We knew how much value they offered the country. The people in charge didn’t understand what they did and didn’t care.
</p>
<p>
In other words, we were already doing what Gebbia claims he’ll accomplish in three years. The <span>18F</span> team had years of experience navigating federal bureaucracy, understanding regulatory constraints, and working within existing governmental structures—precisely the institutional knowledge required for meaningful reform.
</p>
<p>
Now we’re expected to believe that dismantling this expertise and starting over with political appointees represents progress. Will Gebbia simply rehire the <span>18F</span> professionals who were just laid off? If so, why destroy the institutional knowledge in the first place? If not, how does beginning from scratch improve upon what already existed? It doesn’t and it won’t. This appointment has more in common with Trump’s previous appointment of his son-in-law to “solve the conflict in the Middle East,” which resulted in no such thing unless meetings about hotels and real estate counts.
</p>
<p>
Gebbia knows as much about this job as Kushner did about diplomacy, which is nothing. Despite years in “design,” I suspect Gebbia knows little of anything about it, or user experience, or public service. His expertise is in drawing attention while letting robbers in the back door.
</p>
<h2>
Impossible Promises, Probable Corruption
</h2>
<p>
The timeline alone reveals the proposal’s fundamental unseriousness. Gebbia promises to reform not just the often-cited 26,000 federal websites, but all government services—physical and digital—within three years. Anyone with experience in government systems or even just run-of-the-mill website design knows this is absurd. The <span>UK</span>’s Government Digital Service, working with a much smaller governmental structure, required over a decade to achieve significant results.
</p>
<p>
But three years is plenty of time for something else entirely: securing contracts, regulatory concessions, and other agreements that benefit private interests. Gebbia may no longer run AirBnB day-to-day, but his wealth remains tied to the company. His conspicuous emergence as a Trump supporter just before the 2024 election suggests motivations beyond public service.
</p>
<p>
Trump has consistently demonstrated his willingness to use government power to benefit his businesses and those of his collaborators. There’s a growing list of “business-minded” men granted unfettered access and authority over sweeping government initiatives under Trump who have achieved nothing other than self-enrichment. AirBnB has already disrupted hospitality; their next expansion will likely require the kind of regulatory flexibility that only comes from having allies in high government positions. Now they’ve got a man on the inside.
</p>
<h2>
The Pattern of Capture
</h2>
<p>
This appointment fits a broader pattern of regulatory capture, where industries gain control over the agencies meant to oversee them. Gebbia’s role ostensibly focuses on improving government services, but it also positions him to influence regulations that could significantly impact AirBnB’s business model and expansion plans.
</p>
<p>
The company has spent years fighting local zoning laws, housing regulations, and taxation requirements. Having a co-founder in a high-level government design role—with access to federal agencies and regulatory processes—creates obvious conflicts of interest that extend far beyond website optimization.
</p>
<h2>
Beyond Personal Grievances
</h2>
<p>
<i>Full disclosure: I attended college with Joe Gebbia and quickly formed negative impressions of his character that subsequent events have only reinforced.</i>
</p>
<p>
While personal history colors perspective, the substantive concerns about this appointment stand independently: the mismatch between promised expertise and demonstrated capabilities, the destruction of existing institutional knowledge, the unrealistic timeline claims, and the predictable potential for conflicts of interest.
</p>
<p>
Government design reform is important work that requires deep expertise, institutional knowledge, and genuine commitment to public service. It deserves leaders with proven track records in complex systems design, not entrepreneurs whose primary experience involves circumventing existing regulations for private gain.
</p>
<p>
The American people deserve government services that work better. But interacting with government could not –&nbsp;and should not — be more different from buying something at the Apple Store. One is an interface layer upon society –&nbsp;an ecosystem of its own that is irreducible to a point and inextricable from the physical and philosophical world in which it exists. The other is a store. To model one after the other is the sort of idiocy we should expect from people who either understand little to nothing about how either thing should work or just don’t care. I suspect it’s both.

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances. These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored. In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners. We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus; regions implicated in respiratory interoceptive representation and the processing of emotional memories, respectively. These observed regional cerebral effects may underlie pivotal mental experiences that mediate positive therapeutic outcomes of HVB.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>High ventilation breathwork (HVB) encompasses contemplative and therapeutic practices, including Conscious Connected Breathing or Holotropic Breathwork, in which a controlled pattern of volitional breathing increases the rate or depth of ventilation and is typically accompanied by evocative music. Despite their distinct historical roots and delivery modalities, these different HVB practices share a purported ability to elicit acute extraordinary alterations in subjective experience that closely resemble the qualia of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref001">1</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref003">3</a>]. Converging evidence demonstrates the potential value of psychedelic treatments for specific difficult-to-treat psychiatric and physiological conditions [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref004">4</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref007">7</a>]. The induction of ASCs is suggested to be critical to the therapeutic action of psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref008">8</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref010">10</a>], for which HVB might therefore offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. In line with this, the popularity of HVB as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding, indexed by an increased number of scientific investigations, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref012">12</a>] for more details.</p>
<p>The therapeutic potential of HVB practices is suggested by a long cultural tradition of use to relieve symptoms of psychological distress [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref013">13</a>] and by emerging preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy from controlled trials in affective and trauma-related disorders [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref014">14</a>]. Prolonged hyperventilation/HVB reportedly elicits a wide range of effects on subjective experience that include emotional and psychedelic-like phenomena (ASCs), which range from panic-like sensations to feelings of awe and dissociative symptoms [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]. The 5D-ASC questionnaire is popularly used in ASC research to retrospectively assess such states [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. A key dimension of this scale is ‘Oceanic Boundlessness’ (OBN); a term coined by Freud in 1920 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref016">16</a>] which describes a set of related feelings including ‘spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity’ [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively and remain elusive.</p>
<p>First, we characterised the subjective experience of HVB to capture the nature and intensity of evoked experiential phenomena. From these data, we aimed to assess whether these effects could be reliably reproduced in controlled experimental settings in comparison to a remote – and more ecologically valid – condition. These findings informed the choice of the ASC variable, OBN, which was ultimately selected as the most widely reported experiential phenomena to identify the critical neurobiological effects of HVB.</p>
<p>Then we examined the effects of HVB performed by experienced breathwork practitioners in different experimental settings, and investigated peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning ASCs engendered by HVB. The neurobiological endpoints were selected based on well-characterised neurophysiological effects of hyperventilation (reviewed in [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]). Hyperventilation acutely reduces regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through interacting effects of hypocapnia, cerebral alkalosis and hypoxia, resulting in transient perturbation of neurometabolic homeostasis. Further, hyperventilation evokes allostatic changes in action-ready bodily arousal, mediated via the autonomic nervous system via the dominance of sympathetic over parasympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels. In characterising the neurobiological effects of HVB and associated ASCs, we therefore focused our measurements on two robust indices of neurometabolic and autonomic nervous control: rCBF and heart rate variability (HRV).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the relationship between the intensity of ASCs and changes in rCBF induced by HVB practices. Since we could not base our prediction of the regional specificity of such correlations on previous knowledge, we preferred to adopt a whole brain voxelwise exploratory approach. Also, as observations reported on the effects of psychedelics on autonomic nervous system activity have been contrasting [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref019">19</a>], we could not make precise predictions on the direction of association between HRV and ASCs.</p>
<p>Our study was designed to address different objectives through three inter-related experiments: (please see the methods for more details), in 1) HVB was conducted over an online video-conferencing platform with a breathwork facilitator (REMOTE setting). The aim was to characterise the subjective response to remote HVB in a home setting, and inform the choice of the ASC domain to be used as subjective endpoint. In 2), we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during HVB to identify the relationship between neural haemodynamic effects of HVB and subjective measures (MRI setting). In 3) HVB was performed in a psychophysiology lab to characterise the relationship between the psychophysiological effects of HVB (autonomic alterations, see ‘psychophysiological session 3’ for more information) and subjective measures (LAB setting).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Ethics statement</h3>
<p>This research was approved by the Research Governance and Ethics Committee (RGEC) in Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) as ERA/BSMS9AN4/2/2. Recruitment began on 24/11/2021 and ended on 03/03/2022. Participants provided written informed consent before participating.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Physically and psychiatrically healthy participants aged 18–65 years old were recruited from the local area through advertisements and flyers distributed at breathwork events, in yoga/meditation centres, and on social media. Participants were eligible to take part if they had either 10 or more experiences of fast-paced breathwork or at least 6 months of any HVB practice (as defined in [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]). They were screened online for eligibility and excluded if they were pregnant, currently experiencing any psychiatric condition (assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to ensure absence of DSM-V listed disorders) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref020">20</a>]. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of epileptic seizures, panic disorder, or syncope in prior HVB, current neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease, current pharmacological treatment, and contraindications to MRI.</p>
<p>Participants and were financially compensated £10 per hour for their time and up to £10 in travel expenses.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Breathwork modality and subjective measures</h3>
<p>HVB consisted of cyclic breathing without pausing, accompanied by progressively evocative music. This aimed to reproduce the experience of Conscious Connected Breathing, a widely adopted HVB practice typically led by a trained breathwork facilitator. In the online experimental session, instructions were provided by a breathwork facilitator (DB) who hosted the group of online participants. For the LAB and MRI setting, pre-recorded instructions by the same facilitator were delivered to participants. Specific details on breathwork instructions are presented in the supplementary index (<a href="#pone.0329411.s001">S1 Appendix</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Questionnaires</h3>
<p>Self-reported measures were consistent across the three conditions and administered online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref021">21</a>] within 30 minutes post-HVB. The selected questionnaires assessed: 1) Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, PANAS-X [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref022">22</a>]); 2) Panic–like symptoms (Panic Symptoms List, PSL [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref023">23</a>]), 3) Fear and discomfort (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>]), and 4) Symptoms of ASCs (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]).</p>
<p>Pre-session questionnaires included the VAS (scored from “0 – <em><em>no fear and discomfort”</em></em> to “100 – <em><em>complete fear and discomfort”</em></em>) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>] and the PANAS-X, which measured affect using 60 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “<em><em>1 – very slightly or not at all</em></em>” to “<em><em>5 – extremely</em></em>” [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref025">25</a>].</p>
<p>Post-session questionnaires included the VAS and PANAS-X again, as well as the 5D-ASC, which retrospectively assessed ASCs using 94 items rated via VAS [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. Questions and responses were grouped into 3 broad subscales: oceanic boundlessness (OBN) as previously mentioned, visionary restructuralisation (VRS) to examine the effect of the HVB on vision, and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) which captures the anxiety-inducing effects of the experience related to the idea of the dissolution of the self [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. The PSL, a 13-item tool used to evaluate panic symptomatology, required participants to rate each item on a five-point scale from “<em><em>0 – not at all</em></em>” to “<em><em>4 – extremely severe</em></em>”.</p>
<p>The PSL and VAS for fear/discomfort were scored based on [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref024">24</a>]: a significant panic attack was indicated by an increase in VAS fear by 50 points and 4 or more items rated above mild in the PSL (mild = 2).</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Online experimental session 1 (REMOTE)</h3>
<p>The session was conducted remotely via an online video-conferencing platform (Zoom). Preparatory information was sent to participants after screening and enrolment, including the platform link, instructions, and pre- and post-session questionnaires.</p>
<p>Participants received instructions on camera setup and were assigned personal participant numbers. They were instructed to be in a private room to avoid interruptions and to position their cameras to capture their chest and stomach for observation of full-body, continuous breaths. A breathwork facilitator remotely guided groups of participants through the 30-minute online breathwork session. Members of the research team were present online to ensure session consistency and to monitor participant engagement in HVB practice. No group experience-sharing (integration) followed the breathwork sessions to avoid memory and experience merging. Instead, participants self-integrated (processed) their session by completing retrospective questionnaires that explored the qualia of the experience within 30 minutes of concluding the session.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Neuroimaging experimental session 2 (MRI)</h3>
<p>Each participant in the neuroimaging session was scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner fitted with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution structural scans were obtained during rest using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1 MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.19 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2; total acquisition time (TA) = 5m 30s). Additionally, twenty control and label images were acquired per condition using a pCASL with background suppression following the parameter recommendation of the consensus paper [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref026">26</a>]: label duration = 2000ms, post-labelling delay (PLD) = 1800ms, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 14 ms, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 6.0 mm3, TA = 3m 22s), was acquired. A proton density (M<sub>0</sub>) image was acquired using the same readout and TR as the control and label images to estimate pcASL CBF.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0329411-g001">Fig 1</a> is a schematic presentation of the MRI experimental design. Recorded instructions (see <a href="#pone.0329411.s001">S1 Appendix</a>) guided participants to breathe through three phases: BASELINE, START, and SUSTAINED HVB. BASELINE consisted of breathing at a normal rate for 20 minutes. Participants were asked to gradually increase their ventilation rate and/or depth via recorded instructions (START HVB) for approximately 6 minutes. The SUSTAINED HVB phase started after at least 5 minutes of START HVB and once end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), measured via nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD), was stable at levels ≤20 mmHg (from a typical value of 35–40 mmHg), and was maintained for a further ~20-minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001">
              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001</a></p></div><p>Scans were performed during BASELINE (10 minutes after the scan start), at the start of HVB (immediately after initiating HVB), and during SUSTAINED HVB (after at least 6 minutes of uninterrupted breathwork).</p>
<p>SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>] and custom written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) scripts were used for image processing and statistics. Rigid-body motion correction was used to realign labelled and control images, and perfusion weighted images were calculated for the realigned control-labelled pairs by subtracting the labelled image from the control. The mean perfusion weighted images were then used to estimate CBF using the one-compartment model [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref026">26</a>] and processed to obtain partial volume-corrected [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref028">28</a>], tissue-specific (i.e., grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)) CBF images independently. The pcASL CBF images were normalized maps in MNI space using SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>]. Participants with prominent arterial transit artifacts in the CBF images, evident by the presence of strong arterial signals upon visual inspection, were excluded from the study.</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Psychophysiological session 3 (LAB)</h3>
<p>Participants in the psychophysiology study attended the psychophysiology lab at the Trafford Centre for Medical Research at BSMS. To measure beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and HRV (computed as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref029">29</a>], an electrocardiograph (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device) was applied to the torso [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref028">28</a>]. To measure EtCO<sub>2</sub>, the participant was fitted with a nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD). Following a BASELINE period during which the participant was instructed to breathe as normal to relaxing music for 10 minutes, the participant was instructed to perform HVB (see supplementary index for more information). This began as a 5-minute warm-up (START HVB) where the participant performed HVB to lower their EtCO<sub>2</sub> to ≤20 mmHg, followed by 25-minutes of HVB (SUSTAINED HVB) where EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained ≤20 mmHg, aided by recorded instructions from a trained breathwork facilitator. For analyses, the HVB period was defined as starting once EtCO<sub>2</sub> was stable below 20 mmHg and was subsequently recorded for 20 minutes. The recovery period began immediately after HVB was terminated, and participants resumed their normal breathing. Participants completed retrospective questionnaires within 30 minutes of the session’s conclusion.</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Data analysis and statistics.</h4><p><strong>Objective 1:</strong> To characterize the subjective response to HVB across different settings (REMOTE, LAB, MRI), we compared affective responses (PANAS-X scores clustered into positive and negative domains), panic-like symptoms (VAS fear/discomfort and PSL) and ASCs. For the 5D-ASC, the percentage maximum score was calculated per participant and dimension [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref030">30</a>]. Data were compared across the three experiments to test for differences in self-reported effects. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to examine the effects of setting on the mean responses within each dimension of the 5D-ASC and for the PSL, accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect using the lmer package in R; [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref031">31</a>]. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare a full model with a fixed effect of setting and a random effect of subject to a reduced model with only a random effect of subject [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref031">31</a>]. Post-hoc tests were performed using the emmeans package in R [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref032">32</a>], adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.</p>
<p>For the PANAS-X and VAS, we used an LMM analysis to examine the effects of HVB (pre- versus post-) on setting and the type of question (positive versus negative affect for PANAS; discomfort versus fear for VAS), accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect. We explored two-way interactions between all the variables and post-hoc tests using the same methods as the previous analyses [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref032">32</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Objective 2:</strong> In order to test the correlations between HVB-induced ASCs and rCBF effects, two contrasts between HVB time points (see MRI experimental design in <a href="#pone-0329411-g001">Fig 1</a>) were studied using paired-samples t-tests in SPM12 [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref027">27</a>]: contrast 1) between BASELINE and START HVB grey matter CBF; contrast 2) between BASELINE and SUSTAINED HVB grey matter CBF. Following this, voxel-wise maps of changes in pcASL rCBF (ΔrCBF) were calculated for the contrasts between BASELINE versus SUSTAINED HVB, and START versus SUSTAINED HVB. These ΔrCBF maps were then used for voxelwise correlation analysis with the OBN score, selected as the highest-rated 5D-ASC dimension. Voxel clusters were considered significant at a cluster-forming threshold of p &lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 3:</strong> To investigate changes in cardiac autonomic drive during HVB and their relationship to the intensity of ASCs, we calculated change in HRV (ΔRMSSD) and HR. Heartbeat timing data were imported from the Firstbeat Bodyguard device into Kubios 3.5.0 HRV scientific 4.1.0 for processing. Raw data contained substantial noise from chest movement. After an initial phase of artefact removal, interbeat interval (IBI) data were smoothed using an automatic noise detection filter at a medium threshold [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref033">33</a>]. A repeated measures ANCOVA with contrasts for different orders of an equation was conducted using HRV and OBN (5D-ASC selected from objective 1) as covariates to explain HRV variance over time, with polynomial contrast applied to identify linear and complex patterns, allowing us to characterise dynamic trends in HRV responses to HVB.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2><p>Self-reported data from 42 participants were analysed, comprising 31 unique individuals. Study participants enrolled in one to three experimental sessions: n = 15 (age 42.9 ± 12.6 years, 5 females) for the online experimental session; n = 8 (age 41 ± 13.02 years, 2 females) for the session conducted within the psychophysiology lab; and n = 19 (age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 females) for the MRI experimental session. There were different participants in each condition (3 repeated all conditions, 5 participants participated in 2 conditions, see <a href="#pone.0329411.s005">S1 Fig</a> for key subjective effects of repeated participants). No adverse events, including panic attacks, were reported across all experimental settings.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Subjective effect results</h3>
<p>Generally, measures of fear and discomfort were low in all conditions (<a href="#pone-0329411-g002">Fig 2</a>, panel C). LMM analyses identified only a significant two-way interaction between HVB and question type (fear and discomfort), with post-hoc tests showing a significant increase in discomfort post-HVB. These results indicate that perceived discomfort increased during HVB, while perceived fear remained stable across settings.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>MRI results</h3>
<p>Datasets from 13 participants (mean age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 female) were included in the analysis. Voxel clusters showing statistically significant CBF reductions occupied 12% and 28.5% of global grey matter volume at START and SUSTAINED HVB, respectively. Global CBF was reduced by 30.5% during START (36.2 ± 12.4 ml/100g/min) and 41.6% during SUSTAINED HVB (30.5 ± 8.5 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).</p>
<p>We first identified a region of cortex where HVB-evoked reduction in perfusion (ΔrCBF from BASELINE to SUSTAINED) correlated with the magnitude of ASC in the OBN dimension. This cluster encompassed left parietal operculum/posterior insula (PO/INS) (<a href="#pone-0329411-g003">Fig 3</a>). Here, rCBF in PO/INS was reduced by 7.7% during the START period of HVB (43.7 ± 10 ml/100g/min) and 18.9% during SUSTAINED HVB (38.4 ± 12.7 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Our study is the first that aims to characterise the relationship between the intensity of ASCs induced by HVB practices and associated central and autonomic nervous system effects, via changes in pcASL rCBF and HRV, respectively. Our findings identified significant correlations that might indicate possible neurobiological substrates of HVB-evoked ASCs, accompanied by music. First, our findings demonstrated that the experience of HVB can be safely reproduced across different experimental settings. The pattern of self-reported experiences elicited within the MRI scanner and psychophysiology lab were analogous to those experienced at home (a more natural and comfortable environment).</p>
<p>During all experimental sessions, participants reported a trend-level reduction in ratings of fear and negative emotions. Additionally, no adverse reactions or panic attacks were experienced by any participants. However, there was a mild increase in discomfort ratings and mild panic-like symptoms were reported during the MRI session – although these were not associated to increased anxiety or panic attacks and might have been evoked by the physical constraints of being inside the MRI chamber. This experience conflicts typical breathwork practice. The observed increase in physical discomfort alongside reductions in fear and negative affect may reflect a hormetic effect, whereby transient physiological or emotional stressors promote longer-term psychological resilience [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref035">35</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref036">36</a>].</p>
<p>Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by OBN, which is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. Although differences in OBN scores across conditions were not statistically significant, participants in the LAB condition reported noticeably higher scores compared to MRI and REMOTE sessions. This trend suggests that the in-person experience and controlled, quiet environment of the LAB may have enhanced the immersive and evocative qualities of the breathwork experience. In contrast, the MRI setting—despite also involving in-person contact —may have been less conducive due to scanner noise and physical constraints. Finally, the REMOTE condition, which involved no in-person interaction and took place in participants varied home environments, received the lowest OBN ratings. These findings point to the importance of ‘set and setting’, e.g., [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref037">37</a>], a concept well-established in psychedelic research in shaping ASCs and subjective response. These results may indicate that physical context and interpersonal presence play a critical role in breathwork outcomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, OBN is reportedly the most accurate predictor of antidepressant actions of psychedelic substances [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref009">9</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref038">38</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref040">40</a>]. In the present study, the magnitude of the OBN experience induced by HVB was comparable to that elicited by serotonergic psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref041">41</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref042">42</a>], reinforcing observations of other breathwork studies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref001">1</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Fast-paced hyperventilation induces cardiovascular sympathetic activation (with relative cardiovagal parasympathetic withdrawal) and cerebral vasoconstriction, the latter is a consequence of respiratory alkalosis, resulting from reduced plasma CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>, which elevates blood pH [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref043">43</a>]. Ergo, we focused our analysis on correlations between OBN and changes in HRV (for which decreases capture pro-sympathetic shifts in cardiac autonomic balance) and CBF (where regional reductions reflect cerebrovascular vasoconstriction). Importantly, decreased EtCO<sub>2</sub> is implicated as a critical factor in catalysing stronger, deeper ASCs during breathwork and may predict subacute psychological and physiological outcomes [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref044">44</a>].</p>
<p>Our experiments identified that HVB engendered substantive time-dependent decreases in pcASL CBF. The reduction of rCBF relative to BASELINE in a cluster localized within left posterior insula and left parietal operculum predicted the intensity of OBN. This region encompasses primary interoceptive cortex and represents the state of cardiorespiratory arousal, and is consequently engaged in higher-order respiratory control. Correspondingly, neural activity here is enhanced by chemo-stimulated increases in ventilation [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref045">45</a>]. More broadly, this insular-parietal region supports the integration of somatosensory information as well as the cortical representation of afferent respiratory and bodily signals [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref046">46</a>], for example in the emergence of conscious motor intentions [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref047">47</a>]. It is also implicated in high-level integrative processes which merge external and internal stimuli [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref048">48</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref049">49</a>] that contribute to a coherent, embodied representation of self [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref050">50</a>].</p>
<p>These roles are relevant to the interpretations of our finding that rCBF reductions within the PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB predicted the intensity of self-reported OBN experience. The construct of OBN is closely related to feelings of depersonalization, sense of unity and blissful state [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref016">16</a>], and our findings align with the notion that abnormal integration of signals in the posterior insula cortex can result in abnormal body ownership. Studies on ecstatic epilepsy, a rare focal epilepsy, show that the insula is involved in ASC-like experiences, including “heightened self-awareness, mental clarity and unity with everything that exists, accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being” [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref051">51</a>]. These overlap with the OBN construct, as assessed in the 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref015">15</a>]. Picard and Craig [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref052">52</a>] hypothesised the involvement of the insula in the genesis of ecstatic epilepsy given its role in interoception and self-consciousness, confirmed by intracerebral electrode recordings [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref053">53</a>]. Seizures in the mesiotemporal region propagated to the dorsal anterior insula coincide with ecstatic symptoms [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref054">54</a>] and stimulation of the mid-dorsal insula region evoked experiences akin to oceanic psychedelic effects [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref055">55</a>]. The interruption of interoceptive predictive coding during anterior insula seizures may underlie the ecstatic experience, emphasizing its pivotal role in mystical and psychedelic states [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref051">51</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref052">52</a>].</p>
<p>We then ran an exploratory subsequent analysis (<a href="#pone-0329411-g005">Fig 5</a>) to explore the correlations between sub-dimensions of the 11D-ASC relevant to OBN [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>], namely ‘disembodiment’, ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, and CBF reductions induced by HVB relative to BASELINE. We found that scores of ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, but not ‘disembodiment’ were associated with CBF reductions (see <a href="#pone.0329411.s002">S1</a>-<a href="#pone.0329411.s004">S3 Tables</a> for details), which concurs with the notion discussed above, specifically pointing to an involvement of the insula in the genesis of blissful feelings. Of note, 5-HT2A– targeting compounds such as psilocybin, renowned for therapeutic utility, are known to induce CBF decreases in different brain regions that correlate with the intensity of psychedelic experiences [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref056">56</a>]. Studies found reduced CBF in the insula following psilocybin administration, though it was not linked to the subjective effects assessed via the 5D-ASC [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref057">57</a>].</p>
<p>CBF reductions occur rapidly following decreased EtCO<sub>2</sub> and can be reliably detected in response to very brief periods of hyperventilation. Conversely, the profound experiential changes in emotion and thought processes tend to emerge gradually, and correspondingly psychedelic phenomenology appears contingent on the length of the breathwork session [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref058">58</a>]. Our investigation therefore compared HVB-evoked effects during late (SUSTAINED) and early (START) phases of HVB to focus specifically on the haemodynamic changes that occurred once the subjective effects had emerged. By contrasting the START and SUSTAINED phases of hyperventilation, we identified a region of right amygdala/anterior hippocampus, where the intensity of subjective experience (OBN as a covariate) positively correlated with CBF changes. Here, increased rCBF predicted the most intense OBN experience, despite the global reduction in CBF. One possible explanation is that this amygdalo-hippocampal CBF increase reflected increased regional neural activation associated with emergent expression of intense subjective effects. These regions are well established as being specialized for emotion (amygdala) and memory (hippocampus) processing. Their reciprocal interactions enable the formation of episodic representations, integrating the emotional significance and interpretation of memories [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref059">59</a>]. Interestingly, increased right amygdala blood-oxygen level-dependent responses to emotional faces in functional MRI (fMRI) have been identified in patients with treatment-resistant depression following administration of psilocybin, predictive of clinical improvements at 1 week. The authors posit that this indicates psilocybin aids individuals’ ability to confront, reappraise, and improve emotional responsiveness [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref060">60</a>]. Though speculative, these findings may indicate that HVB facilitates the processing of emotionally salient memories, which is proposed to be an essential therapeutic element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref061">61</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref062">62</a>], consistent with promising results from clinical trials of HVB applied as a therapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref063">63</a>]. Our finding of increased CBF in the hippocampal region also indicates that a single session of intense hyperventilation selectively alters perfusion to the hippocampus, similar to the effects observed after 20 minutes of hypocapnia-inducing moderate exercise [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref064">64</a>]. This finding was interpreted as indicative of short-term metabolic adaptation to the high energy demands of hippocampal neurons, rather than reflecting the effects of mechanical vascular changes [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref064">64</a>].</p>
<p>HRV is a physiological index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart. The observed reduction in HRV reflects sympathetic activation and withdrawal of parasympathetic drive [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref065">65</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref067">67</a>], consistent with an action-ready state of psychophysiological engagement. As previously described, OBN characteristically entails a deeply felt positive mood linked to the experience of unity with the self and the world, and in its extreme, is experienced as a mystical or religious experience [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref017">17</a>]. Our finding that OBN ratings were related to changes in HRV over time echoes observations from other relevant modalities of ASC induction, such as self-induced cognitive trance [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref068">68</a>] or 5-HT agonists, such as LSD [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref069">69</a>–<a href="#pone.0329411.ref071">71</a>] or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref072">72</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref073">73</a>]. Nevertheless, the observed association with a positive mood contrasts the wide acceptance of reduced HRV as an index of stress and negative affective states. During HVB, the physiological state of the body exceeds typical homeostatic boundaries, and the autonomic correlates of this may reinforce a dissociative psychological state of positive affect in line with the premise of hormesis, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>] for more.</p>
<p>This exploratory work is preliminary and limited by a small sample size and a lack of an independent control condition that may, in our neuroimaging session, have prevented us from separating the contributions of haemodynamic effects secondary to CO<sub>2</sub> changes from neural activation. We also acknowledge the possibility that our whole brain voxelwise approach has led to reduced sensitivity to detect significant correlations relative to an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. In addition, from a methodological perspective, it may be argued that the lack of control group exposed only to music may prevent dissociation of the effects of auditory stimuli (the ambient track) and the effects of HVB. Listening to upbeat music does stimulate ventilation and this should be controlled in the future. Helpful input from lived experience populations indicates that music is a powerful support to therapeutic applications of HVB. In choosing our design, we elected not to “dissect” the music component from HVB, as we preferred to consider HVB as a contemplative practice accompanied by music as a whole – and to test it in its entirety [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref074">74</a>]. Importantly, both studies [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0329411.ref075">75</a>] have dissected the effect of music and breathwork, and elucidate that music is not the main factor in triggering ASCs. This reveals that music alone is unlikely to engender significant ASCs of the magnitude reported in this research. It is also argued that the reductionist approach of breaking down a contemplative practice to dissect an “active ingredient” is less preferable than testing a practice in its entirety [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref074">74</a>]. Conjointly, psychedelic therapy sessions do not adhere to one specific psychotherapeutic model, though one consistent feature of the experience is listening to music. During psychedelic therapy sessions, patients are urged to centre their attention inwardly whilst supine and listening to a carefully selected playlist. It is suggested that music can help facilitate therapeutic experiences. As such, we are looking for CBF changes that correspond with ASCs, induced by HVB with music. We elected to proceed to treat the experience as whole, hence no control for music. More hypothesis-driven work is certainly required within the neuroscience of breathwork.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our study focused on experienced HVB practitioners and therefore our results may not be generalisable; though this is also a strength as it ensured our practitioners were able to reach the desired state without adverse outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to directly assess relevant mechanisms of therapeutic actions, as our subjective measures did not include clinical parameters relevant to traumatic memories or other forms of psychological distress. Moreover, ASCs initiated by breathwork are inherently dynamic, thus dynamic phenomenological tools, such as those employed by Lewis-Healey et al., [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref058">58</a>] may be more sensitive and informative.</p>
<p>Our imaging approach was also limited by the absence of correction for physiological noise caused by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This is crucial for most physiological fMRI applications for reducing signal artifacts. However, physiological fluctuations (including respiratory frequency and volume changes) can still introduce signal variations in ASL data, but we believe that our approach remains robust. Our analysis inherently averages over multiple cardiac cycles, which helps mitigate the effects of physiological noise on CBF quantification, and although respiration-induced signal changes are observed in some pcASL studies, they are largely associated with motion rather than direct vascular effects [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref076">76</a>]. This does not fully eliminate the influence of an overall increase in HR, respiratory rate, or other physiological parameters during changes in breathing conditions—factors that may also impact labelling efficiency and arterial transit times. These considerations are relevant not only to our study, but to other ASL studies where complex, interconnected factors can influence ASL signal and CBF. Practical constraints limit the extent to which additional physiological measurements can be incorporated, particularly in a study as complex as ours. These constraints include scanning time and the potential stress on participants. Furthermore, measuring CBF at the start of the SUSTAINED HVB rather than at the end or during is not ideal, yet, it may capture the physiological ‘trigger condition’ for entry into ASCs, which can continue irrespective of specific physiological threshold conditions, see [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>] for more.</p>
<p>A further key reason for choosing not to adopt a method of correction for EtCO<sub>2</sub> was a high risk of regressing out our primary signal of interest. One plausible mechanistic hypothesis inspiring our work is that ASCs evoked by HVB practices directly result from alterations in EtCO<sub>2</sub> and the resulting cerebral pH, causing downstream effects on neuronal function [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref011">11</a>]. Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> related physiological signals are likely correlated with experimental effects that were the focus of our investigation, in line with recent work by others [<a href="#pone.0329411.ref002">2</a>] and regressing out these signals would severely impact our sensitivity to study the relationship between haemodynamic effects and ASCs. An additional reason is that our measures of EtCO<sub>2</sub> (collected by nasal cannula and capnograph) have been occasionally incomplete during the end of HVB sessions when EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels had reached particularly low levels, and we felt that application of correction methods using incomplete physiological data would have risked introducing major artifacts.</p>
<p>Additionally, we observed prominent arterial transit time (ATT) artifacts in 6 out of 19 participants. These artifacts were characterized by strong arterial signals in the CBF images, which led to their exclusion from the analysis. ATT artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of perfusion measurements, as they indicate that labelled blood has not yet reached the capillary beds. To address this issue in future research, capturing blood flow dynamics at different delay times through a multi-PLD ASL protocol would reduce the impact of ATT artifacts and increase precision of assessment of cerebral perfusion.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, our exploratory experiments suggest that circuitries supporting the integration of interoceptive representations and processing of affective memories are putative neurobiological substrates of HVB-induced ASCs. Our findings indicate directions for future research towards a better understanding of HVB and ultimately harnessing such practices for future therapeutic applications.</p>
