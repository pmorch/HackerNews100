            The outage – in the middle of Chile’s summer, when temperatures in Santiago are around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) – has affected some 8 million homes, President Gabriel Boric said in an address to the nation on Tuesday evening.

            The National Disaster Prevention and Response Service said 14 of the country’s 16 regions were impacted by the blackout, which began Tuesday afternoon.

            But Chilean Interior Minister, Carolina Tohá, acknowledged in a news conference that the service still had ongoing problems and that 220,000 customers remain without power. She also added that 100% of public transport services had been restored, and that the state of emergency would be lifted later.

            Tohá also said an investigation had been opened to establish what caused the outage. “One thing is the original failure that the company had (…) and another thing is how that system responds once the incident occurs.”

            The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile’s grid operator, earlier said a high-voltage backbone transmission line, that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to Santiago in the country’s central valley, had been disrupted, leading to the blackout. It did not say what caused the disruption.

            The president said the state of emergency aimed to “guarantee the safety” of citizens as the outage may last into the night. Authorities also announced a curfew in effect from 10 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Automattic is facing a class action lawsuit over its feud with WP Engine, with a cybersecurity expert accusing CEO Matt Mullenweg of waging “nuclear war” against the hosting company at the expense of hundreds of thousands of its customers.</p>



<p>Ryan Keller, who runs Ohio-based cybersecurity business SecureSight, has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of WP Engine customers in the United States. The complaint alleges that Automattic deliberately sabotaged WP Engine’s business by blocking access to critical WordPress.org services, causing disruption, security risks, and financial harm.</p>



<p>The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accuses Automattic of multiple counts of tortious interference and violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law. Keller is seeking financial damages for affected businesses and a permanent injunction to prevent Automattic from using its control over WordPress.org to interfere with competitors.</p>



<p>The class action covers all WP Engine customers in the U.S. who had active hosting plans between September 24, 2024, and December 10, 2024, a period when WP Engine lost access to plugin updates, security patches, and other essential services. The lawsuit claims that “hundreds of thousands” of WP Engine customers were affected.</p>



<p>Keller has retained two class action law firms—Schubert Jonckheer &amp; Kolbe, based in San Francisco, and Tycko &amp; Zavareei, which has offices in California and Washington, D.C. Schubert Jonckheer &amp; Kolbe’s most significant tech-related case resulted in a $22.5 million settlement for AdWords advertisers who alleged Google placed their ads on low-quality parked domains and error pages in violation of California law, benefiting approximately 1.1 million class members. In the past year, Tycko &amp; Zavareei has won class action cases against Apple and Meta, securing a combined $72.5 million in settlements.</p>



<p>Mullenweg has publicly defended his actions in recent months, arguing that he acted to protect WordPress and safeguard its long-term future. In his keynote address at WordCamp US 2024, Mullenweg accused WP Engine and its private equity backer, Silver Lake, of exploiting WordPress without giving enough back to the open source project. It was later revealed that Automattic had demanded that WP Engine pay an 8% licensing fee to use the WordPress trademarks.</p>



<p>But Keller’s lawsuit argues that Mullenweg weaponized his control over WordPress.org, cutting off WP Engine’s access to cripple its business and steer customers toward Automattic-owned hosting brands, including WordPress.com and Pressable. The complaint claims Automattic and Mullenweg publicly pressured WP Engine customers to leave by listing them on the <a href="https://wordpressenginetracker.com/">WordPress Engine Tracker website</a>, while Automattic-owned hosting brands directly solicited them with incentives to migrate.</p>



<p>The lawsuit describes Automattic and Mullenweg’s conduct as an abuse of the open-source internet architecture, alleging that “a single individual (Matt Mullenweg) exercises apparent singular control over what they claim to be more than 40% of all websites in the world through his personal website (WordPress.org).” It calls this level of control “an appalling deception” that is “contrary to every conceivable public policy.”</p>



<p>It also disputes Automattic’s justification for blocking WP Engine’s access, arguing that “a trademark dispute, even if legitimate, is not cause for the deliberate sabotage of the websites of innocent third-party individuals and companies who merely used WPE services.” The complaint calls Automattic’s trademark claims a “pretext” for harming WP Engine and its customers.</p>



<p>The lawsuit challenges Automattic’s influence over WordPress.org, arguing that its ability to block WP Engine’s access without oversight exposes a governance issue in WordPress, where a single company can control who has access to critical WordPress infrastructure.</p>



<p>Keller, who pays $3,300 per year for WP Engine’s Scale Plan, says he had to spend time and money managing security risks and considering alternative hosting providers. The lawsuit claims many small businesses were left in limbo, unsure whether WP Engine could provide stable service or if migrating would be worth the cost and disruption.</p>



<p>A case management conference is scheduled for May 22, 2025, in San Francisco before Judge Peter H. Kang, with both sides required to meet and discuss potential settlement options by May 1 and submit case management filings by May 15.</p>



<p><em>The Repository</em> contacted Keller for comment but hasn’t heard back yet.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Conventional self-attention mechanisms incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences. We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.

<p>A venture capital-backed “AI performance monitoring system for factory workers” is proposing what appears to be dehumanizing surveillance of factories, where machine vision tracks workers’ hand movements and output so a boss can look at graphs and yell at them about efficiency.</p><p>In a launch video demoing the product, Baid and Mohta put on a skit showing how Optifye.ai would be used by factory bosses.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The YC deleted video for sweatshop startup Optifye <a href="https://t.co/vCJvm2HTce?ref=404media.co">pic.twitter.com/vCJvm2HTce</a></p>— Adam Lerman (@AdamLerman5) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“Ugh, it’s workspace 17. Workspace 17 is the bottleneck. The worst performing workspace here,” one of the bosses says, while watching a video of a man making clothing in a factory. “Hey number 17, what’s going on man? You are in red,” he says. “I have been working all day,” the person playing the worker says. “Working all day?” the line boss replies. “You haven’t hit your hourly output even once today. And you have 11.4% efficiency, this is really bad!”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just been a rough day,” the “worker” replies. “Rough day?” the boss says, looking at a calendar full of red days. “More like a rough month.”&nbsp;</p><p>Optifye.ai, launched by Duke University computer science students Vivaan Baid and Kushal Mohta, is backed by Y Combinator, <a href="https://archive.is/GtuTi?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">according to the company’s site</a>. On their <a href="https://archive.is/Qu09c?ref=404media.co"><u>Y Combinator company profile</u></a>, they write that both of their families run manufacturing plants, where they’ve been exposed to factory working conditions since they were children. “I've been around assembly lines for as long as I can remember,” Baid wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohta wrote, “My family also runs several manufacturing plants in various industries, which has given me unrestricted access to assembly lines since I was 15.”&nbsp;</p><p>They hope to sell cameras to factory owners to use on assembly lines, their website says, and “use computer vision to tell supervisors who's working and who's not in real-time.”</p><p>Y Combinator deleted its recent Linkedin and X posts congratulating the company on launching.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXex26pUs8TaRaVO2vdq6klwTPae_pOM-aPnusQ-7taTTHHXcV3knsBxpl1boHfEFumrOfXZigYa0kti6H4K0JPvkpEpC3IOlHXj-SnYvPhf1RQ2lSmW0zOxFIo-rv8snT7FOLJF?key=Yrtm75ZzgcMcjAeui5ZPpzJb" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="553"></figure><p>On their Y Combinator profile, Baid and Mohta outline who gets what out of installing micromanaging AI surveillance on assembly lines. Owners gets “accurate real-time factory, line, and worker productivity metrics,” production heads get “line-wise and worker-wise metrics,” shopfloor supervisors get to “identify who/what is causing inefficiency in the line and fix the problem on the go.” For the workers? They get the tantalizing benefit of being “held accountable for good or bad performance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Worker surveillance is already happening across industries. After the rise of remote work, companies started tracking workers’ productivity based on mouse movements, so <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mouse-mover-jiggler-app-keep-screen-on-active/?ref=404media.co"><u>workers started using “mouse jigglers”</u></a> so they could walk away from their computers and use the bathroom in peace. In Amazon warehouses, workers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/internal-documents-show-amazons-dystopian-system-for-tracking-workers-every-minute-of-their-shifts/?ref=404media.co"><u>are tracked and punished</u></a> for not meeting grueling expectations and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64384287?ref=404media.co"><u>bathroom breaks are timed</u></a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/press-releases/amazon-and-walmarts-excessive-warehouse-surveillance-erodes-workers-rights-seriously-harms-worker-health-and-safety/?ref=404media.co"><u>more injuries and less safe working conditions</u></a>. Optifye.ai’s approach and pitch, however, stands out because of the way its founders seem to embrace cruelty to workers in the name of productivity.</p><p>Optifye.ai and Y Combinator did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A demo from Optifye.ai, a member of Y Combinator’s current cohort, sparked a social media backlash that ended up with YC deleting it off its socials.</p>

<p>Optifye says it’s building software to help factory owners know who’s working — and who isn’t — in “real-time” thanks to AI-powered security cameras it places on assembly lines, according to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/MsF-optifye-ai-ai-performance-monitoring-for-factory-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its YC profile</a>.</p>







<p>On Monday, YC posted an <a href="https://www.optifye.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Optifye</a> demo video <a href="https://x.com/ycombinator/status/1894115085087297921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on X</a> (and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300050840852086786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>), according to a snapshot saved by TechCrunch.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTMq-ODhXLtY2JDWikMdXdp6o4jlLkHg5xXTYDREiRWqkcSWBGIgLdQCgQYjZKd2V8GcrW3of_qFAGFUa2We8LRxxKuHu6YHhDqkFZGVPf-Ff3qR5gg3rk4cpOeip04-U_WOMuMA?key=C-bSOu1zTaIchlPR-5L0iKfx" alt=""></figure>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The video</a> shows Optifye co-founder Kushal Mohta acting as the boss of a garment factory, calling a supervisor — in reality his co-founder Vivaan Baid — about a low-performing worker known only as “Number 17.”</p>

<p>“Hey Number 17, what’s going on man? You’re in the red,” Baid asks the worker, who responds that he’s been working all day.</p>

<p>“Working all day? You haven’t hit your hourly output even once and you had 11.4% efficiency. This is really bad,” Baid retorts.</p>

<p>After checking Optifye’s dashboard, the supervisor looks at the output of “Number 17” for 15 days, decides that the worker has been underperforming and calls the worker out on it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Rough day? More like a rough month,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clip was heavily criticized on X, where @VCBrags <a href="https://x.com/vcbrags/status/1894454286370709858?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called it</a> “sweatshops-as-a-service” and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954">another</a> deemed it “computer vision sweatshop software.” It also <a href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sparked criticism</a> on Y Combinator’s own link sharing site Hacker News.</p>

<p>Not everyone was critical, though. Eoghan McCabe, the CEO of customer support startup Intercom, <a href="https://x.com/eoghan/status/1894412092415017270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted that</a> anyone complaining better stop buying products made in China and India.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Indeed, it’s not too difficult to find tech companies in China <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1816116508256549836&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">touting</a> a “sleep detection” camera that uses computer vision to spot sleeping workers, for example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way, YC ended up deleting the demo video from its socials, but not before it was <a href="https://x.com/archiexzzz/status/1894285551064285449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saved</a> by <a href="https://x.com/cdolan92/status/1894216778126959027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several</a> accounts.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Neither YC nor Optifye.ai responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video’s likely unintended virality showcases growing anxieties over the rise of AI, especially in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most Americans oppose using AI to track workers’ desk time, movements, and computer use, a Pew poll <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/04/20/americans-views-on-use-of-ai-to-monitor-and-evaluate-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found in 2023</a>. This is a segment of surveillance products sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/20/ai-mistakes-bossware/">called “bossware.”</a></p>

<p>That hasn’t stopped VCs from funding the space, though. Invisible AI, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/invisible-ai-raises-15m-to-stick-worker-monitoring-cameras-in-factories/">raised $15 million in 2022</a> to stick worker-monitoring cameras in factories, too. </p>

<p>Protests at Tesla stores are gaining momentum across the US as people are fighting back against Elon Musk’s government takeover, and the hate is spreading to owners.</p>



<p>Last week, we reported on a new effort to organize protests at Tesla stores worldwide, but primarily in North America.</p>



<p>There were significant turnouts to disrupt Tesla operations by picketing in front of dozens of stores.</p>



<p>But the movement is ongoing, and there were protests against this weekend and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/teslatakedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more planned for the coming weeks</a>:</p>	
	



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-2.58.27%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>Many of the protests from this weekend appeared to be bigger than the last ones.</p>



<p>There was a big turnout at a Tesla store in Seattle that reportedly ended up closing the location:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There were reportedly as many as 200 people who gathered to protest Elon Musk at the Fort Lauderdale store in Florida:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-3.15.24%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>There are dozens of similar examples at Tesla stores all around the US and Canada, and the movement is now spreading to Europe.</p>



<p>These protests have been peaceful, and people are justifying going after Tesla for being Elon Musk’s piggy bank.</p>



<p>However, the growing negative sentiment against Tesla also attracts criminal activities like vandalism, and sometimes against Tesla owners rather the company itself.</p>



<p>Tesla owners, especially Cybertruck owners, have been increasingly reporting animosity from other road users, and in some cases, Tesla vehicles are getting tagged by anti-fascism graffiti.</p>



<p>In one case in California, a vandal put isolating foam into the charge connectors of a few charging stalls, rendering them useless.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-3.36.51%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=837" alt=""></figure>




	<p>A couple of Supercharger stalls in Utah were graffitied—pictured above. Tesla said that it would remove the graffiti today and that it will “press charges for vandalism at Superchargers.”</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>The blowback is more significant than I thought it would be. I thought things would end last weekend, but not only was this weekend’s protest bigger, but it sounds like now there are more being planned.</p>



<p>I couldn’t confirm if they were indeed able to close the store in Seattle, but if that’s true, that’s also a direct impact on Tesla’s operation.</p>



<p>It’s just sad that some vandals are going after Tesla owners. That’s just stupid to me. A</p>

<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM is a library designed for clean and efficient FP8 General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) with fine-grained scaling, as proposed in <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3">DeepSeek-V3</a>. It supports both normal and Mix-of-Experts (MoE) grouped GEMMs. Written in CUDA, the library has no compilation need during installation, by compiling all kernels at runtime using a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, DeepGEMM exclusively supports NVIDIA Hopper tensor cores. To address the imprecise FP8 tensor core accumulation, it employs CUDA-core two-level accumulation (promotion). While it leverages some concepts from <a href="https://github.com/nvidia/cutlass">CUTLASS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/include/cute">CuTe</a>, it avoids heavy reliance on their templates or algebras. Instead, the library is designed for simplicity, with only one core kernel function comprising around <strong>~300 lines of code</strong>. This makes it a clean and accessible resource for learning Hopper FP8 matrix multiplication and optimization techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various matrix shapes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We test all shapes potentially used in DeepSeek-V3/R1 inference (including both prefilling and decoding, but without tensor parallelism) on H800 with NVCC 12.8. All speedup metrics are calculated in comparison to our internally and carefully optimized implementation based on CUTLASS 3.6.</p>

<p dir="auto">This library exclusively contains GEMM kernels. It requires the LHS scaling factor to be TMA-aligned and transposed, and it only supports the NT format (non-transposed LHS and transposed RHS). For transposition or other FP8 casting operations, please implement or fuse them into prior kernels independently. While the library provides some simple PyTorch utility functions, these may result in slower performance, but our primary focus is on optimizing the GEMM kernels themselves.</p>

<p dir="auto">To perform a basic non-grouped FP8 GEMM, call the <code>deep_gemm.gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt</code> function. For more details, please refer to the function documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout)</h4><a id="user-content-grouped-gemms-contiguous-layout" aria-label="Permalink: Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout)" href="#grouped-gemms-contiguous-layout"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike traditional grouped GEMMs in CUTLASS, DeepGEMM groups only the M-axis, while N and K must remain fixed. This design is tailored for scenarios where experts in an MoE model share the same shape.</p>
<p dir="auto">For training forward passes or inference prefilling, where each expert may process a varying number of tokens, we concatenate these tokens into a single tensor, referred to as the "contiguous" layout. Note that each expert segment must be aligned to the GEMM M block size (<code>get_m_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information, please refer to the <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_contiguous</code> function documentation.</p>

<p dir="auto">During the inference decoding phase, when CUDA graph is enabled and the CPU is unaware of the number of tokens each expert receives, we support masked grouped GEMMs. By providing a mask tensor, the kernel computes only the valid portions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_masked</code> for this purpose and consult the relevant documentation. An example usage is to use the output of low-latency kernels from <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP">DeepEP</a> as input.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Utilities</h4><a id="user-content-utilities" aria-label="Permalink: Utilities" href="#utilities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The library provides some utility functions besides the above kernels:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>deep_gemm.set_num_sms</code>: set the maximum SM count to use</li>
<li><code>deep_gemm.get_num_sms</code>: get the current SM maximum count</li>

<li><code>deep_gemm.get_col_major_tma_aligned_tensor</code>: get a column-major TMA-aligned tensor</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The library also provides some environment variables, which may be useful:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DG_CACHE_DIR</code>: string, the cache directory to store compiled kernels, <code>$HOME/.deep_gemm</code> by default</li>
<li><code>DG_NVCC_COMPILER</code>: string, specified NVCC compiler path; will find in <code>from torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME</code> by default</li>

<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM employs a fully <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/jit">Just-In-Time</a> (JIT) design, with no compilation required at installation. All kernels are compiled at runtime using a lightweight JIT implementation. This approach offers several advantages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>GEMM shapes, block sizes, and the number of pipeline stages are treated as compile-time constants
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Saving registers</li>
<li>Compilers may do more optimizations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic selection of block sizes, number of warpgroups, optimal pipeline stages, and TMA cluster size
<ul dir="auto">
<li>But without auto-tuning, the optimal one is deterministically selected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full unrolling of the MMA pipelines, providing compilers with more optimization opportunities
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Very important for small shapes</li>
<li>Refer to <code>launch_k_iterations</code> in <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/include/deep_gemm/fp8_gemm.cuh">the kernel file</a> for details</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Overall, JIT significantly improves performance for small shapes, similar to the approach of the <a href="https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/">Triton</a> compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unaligned block sizes 🐳</h4><a id="user-content-unaligned-block-sizes-" aria-label="Permalink: Unaligned block sizes 🐳" href="#unaligned-block-sizes-"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For certain shapes, block sizes aligned to powers of 2 can lead to underutilized SMs. For instance, with <code>M=256, N=7168</code>, a typical block size assignment of <code>BLOCK_M=128, BLOCK_N=128</code> results in only <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 128) = 112</code> out of 132 SMs being utilized. To address this, we support unaligned block sizes like 112, enabling <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 112) = 128</code> SMs to work in such scenarios. Implementing this technique alongside fine-grained scaling requires careful optimization but ultimately delivers performance gains.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FFMA SASS interleaving 🐳</h4><a id="user-content-ffma-sass-interleaving-" aria-label="Permalink: FFMA SASS interleaving 🐳" href="#ffma-sass-interleaving-"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We observe a performance improvement in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/54_hopper_fp8_warp_specialized_gemm">the CUTLASS FP8 kernel</a> between NVCC 12.2 and 12.3. By comparing the compiled SASS, we discover that one bit in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/eefa171318b79cbe2e78514d4cce5cd0fe919d0c/include/cutlass/gemm/collective/fp8_accumulation.hpp#L73">a series of <code>FADD</code> instructions</a> is flipped in an interleaving pattern.
After referencing some open-source <a href="https://github.com/cloudcores/CuAssembler/blob/master/CuAsm/CuControlCode.py#L46">CUDA assembler</a> implementations, we identified that this bit controls <code>yield</code>, which may enhance warp-level parallelism (just a guess, yielding the current warp and let other warps work).</p>
<p dir="auto">To leverage this, we develop <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/jit/interleave_ffma.py">a similar script</a> to modify the <code>FFMA</code> instructions in the compiled binary. Besides simply modifying the <code>yield</code> bit, we also flip the <code>reuse</code> bit (registers cannot be reused if the warp is yielded). This adjustment improves performance (10%+ in some cases) for fine-grained scaling FP8 GEMMs by creating more opportunities to overlap MMA instructions with promotion <code>FFMA</code> instructions.</p>

<p>Check out the discussion of this post on
                <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43177931">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>We have news! <b>EdgeDB</b> is rebranding as Gel, more on that below.</p>
<p>Let's talk about something else first.</p>
<p>Something fascinating has been happening recently.  PostgreSQL seems to be
            quietly <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-database">eating</a> the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/106">database world</a>.
            It's not just topping the charts, its adoption momentum is accelerating.
            What's going on?  The answer is right there in the PostgreSQL.org's tagline:</p>
<div><p>The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database</p></div>
<p>It's not just an empty marketing boast.  It's <b>meaningful</b>.  Let's unpack,
            starting with what I think is the most important and consequential bit:
            <b>Open Source</b>.</p>
<p>Regardless of source availability, most database systems on the market today
            (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL</a>) are developed by a commercial entity.
            Postgres is <em>different</em>.  It got bootstrapped at Berkeley as a
            <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/postgres.html">research project</a> and released under a very liberal
            MIT-like license.  A decently-sized user base formed and after the university
            stopped making new releases, the project (newly-renamed as PostgreSQL) was
            picked up by a group of motivated hackers and that's how Postgres as we know
            it still gets developed and released today.</p>
<p>Arguably, this makes PostgreSQL the <em>only</em> mainsteam database system that is
            truly open-source.  It can't be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/16/sun-picks-up-mysql-for-1-billion-open-source-is-a-legitimate-business-model/">bought</a> or
            <a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">license-rug-pulled</a> and this creates a kind of <em>trust</em>
            that can't be emulated in any other way.</p>
<p>I'm aware that the above might sound a bit funny coming from a
                co-founder of a VC-backed startup.  Gel is Apache-licensed and
                we're about to future-proof that, stay tuned for a blog post.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the <b>Advanced</b> bit.</p>
<p>When the POSTGRES project was begun at Berkeley in 1985, extensibility and
            modularity were made the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/16856.16888">cornerstones of its design</a>.
            This is possibly one of the main factors that made PostgreSQL successful.
            Custom data types, index types and operators were there since the inception.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL is a relational database at it's core, but with the ability to store
            (and index) JSON, spatial data, time series, vectors, it's arguably multimodal.
            Postgres might not be the <em>best</em> tool in any given use case, but it's <em>good
                enough</em>.  Being able to run just one DBMS instead of 10 and do all the things
            you want to do is great! (Which is why, I think, most vector database startups
            are probably not going to make it in the long run.)</p>
<p>Also, building Postgres extensions is fun and nowadays you can even do it in
            <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">Rust</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to actually running queries, PostgreSQL's query planner/optimizer
            is decidedly state-of-the-art.  Given how much more compressed and expressive
            EdgeQL (Gel's query language) is compared to SQL, it's quite easy to write
            queries that translate to hundreds of kilobytes of SQL and Postgres usually
            chews through that without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL is the cleanest and most documented C project of this scale, and the
            sheer quality of the codebase is what gives Postgres all of the powers mentioned
            above while also keeping it extremely stable and secure.</p>
<p>So, yes, Postgres <em>is</em> the world's most advanced open source relational database
            (sorry, Sam!).  What's even more fascinating is that Postgres seems to have been
            elevated to a sort of a <em>de-facto standard</em>.  Have you noticed how almost every
            recent database startup claims or strives for PostgreSQL wire-protocol and SQL
            dialect compatibility?  CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, and even <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/postgresql-interface">Google Spanner</a> all either speak PostgreSQL exclusively or as an option.
            Oh, and you don't even need to build a whole new database from scratch to
            achieve compute and storage elasticity, just replace Postgres' storage layer
            like AWS Aurora or Neon did and you're good!</p>
<div data-section-id="supercharged-postgres-is-the-future" id="supercharged-postgres-is-the-future">

<p>OK, so Postgres is awesome (and that is likely not news for you), but why such
                a long intro to a rebrand announcement?  It's because this is not just a
                rebrand, but also a good moment to reflect on what Gel really _is_ and where
                it fits in the Postgres ecosystem and the larger market of software
                infrastructure.</p>
<p>Where Aurora and Neon replace PostgreSQL's storage layer, Gel replaces the
                <em>frontend</em> layer.  To oversimplify, Gel to Postgres is what TypeScript is to
                JavaScript, and our business is that we write intelligent compilers for data
                schemas and queries and run the outputs in Postgres efficiently.</p>
<p>Here lies an important point: TypeScript has been very successful in initial
                adoption because it provided full compatibility with vanilla JS and allows
                for incremental adoption.  On the other hand, Gel historically required
                complete buy-in.  We are changing this today.</p>
<p>In Gel 6.0 we are introducing full support for SQL—not just in PostgreSQL
                protocol mode, but natively in the Gel protocol as well!  Additionally, Gel is
                now fully supported in Drizzle (thanks, guys!). Guides will be available
                shortly on how to use Prisma and SQLAlchemy with Gel.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the future of Gel?  More compilers, more Postgres,
                more ecosystem integration.</p>
<p>OK, a quick Q&amp;A on the rebrand is also in order.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="why-the-rebrand" id="why-the-rebrand">
<h2 id="why-the-rebrand">Why the Rebrand?</h2>
<p><b>Clarity</b></p>
<p>The name "EdgeDB" is cool, but it carries some misleading connotations. "Edge"
                has led some to believe we are an edge computing database or a pure graph
                database—when in fact, EdgeDB is neither.</p>
<p><b>Simplicity</b></p>
<p>We wanted something short, memorable, and frictionless.  Gel is easy to say,
                easy to type, and, most importantly, embodies how we see our platform:
                flexible, cohesive, and built to allow integrating software with databases
                seamlessly.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="what-s-changing-and-what-s-not" id="what-s-changing-and-what-s-not">
<h2 id="what-s-changing-and-what-s-not">What's Changing (and What's Not)?</h2>
<p>Nothing changes aside from the name, we're still the same company, same team,
                same mission.</p>
<p>All tools and libraries are now available under the new name (just
                substitute <code>edgedb</code> with <code>gel</code>).  For compatibility we are shipping
                shims, symlinks and transition packages under the old name, so nothing
                should break.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="wrapping-up" id="wrapping-up">

<p>This week is release week, keep an eye out for some more cool announcements
                coming from our corner!</p>
<p>If you are new to Gel, the <a href="https://www.geldata.com/blog/edgedb-1-0%20blog-edgedb-1-0#blog-edgedb-1-0"><span>1.0 release announcement</span></a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In Framework's first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that's an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There's also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64GB of RAM for $1,599.&nbsp;If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.</p>
<p>None of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they're priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860500-REG/asus_rnuc14srku7169aui_republic_of_gamers_nuc.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=665d398fca4517ecc9d75e33332b247f">starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing</a> and comes with half as much RAM. It's also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics—the Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.</p>
<p>The volume of the Framework Desktop's first-party case is just 4.5 liters—for reference, <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshroom-s-v2">the SSUPD Meshroom S</a> is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple's Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn't breaking records, but it's definitely tiny. </p>

      Despite the non-upgradeability of the main components, Framework has tried to stick to existing standards where it can by using a flex ATX power supply, ATX headers on the motherboard, regular 120 mm fans that can be changed out, and of course the mini ITX form factor itself.

<p>So the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. "If the Series S could run Windows, I'd buy it in a second" is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.</p>
<p>But it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it's so much&nbsp;<em>less</em> upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they're soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you've bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.</p>
