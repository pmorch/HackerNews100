      <p>
        Just in time for holiday tech-support sessions, here's what to know about passkeys.
      </p>

      
    </div>
</header>


  

  
      
    
    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?</p>
<h2>Elegant, yes, but usable?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 specification</a> and the overlapping <a href="https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2019/webauthn/">WebAuthn predecessor</a> that underpin passkeys are nothing short of pure elegance. Unfortunately, as support has become ubiquitous in browsers, operating systems, password managers, and other third-party offerings, the ease and simplicity envisioned have been undone—so much so that they can't be considered usable security, a term I define as a security measure that's as easy, or only incrementally harder, to use as less-secure alternatives.</p>
<p>"There are barriers at each turn that guide you through a developer's idea of how you should use them," William Brown, a software engineer specializing in authentication, wrote in an online interview. "None of them are deal-breaking, but they add up."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Passkeys are now supported on <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys-directory/">hundreds of sites</a> and roughly a <a href="https://passkeys.dev/device-support/">dozen</a> operating systems and browsers. The diverse ecosystem demonstrates the industry-wide support for passkeys, but it has also fostered a jumble of competing workflows, appearances, and capabilities that can vary greatly depending on the particular site, OS, and browser (or browser agents such as native iOS or Android apps). Rather than help users understand the dizzying number of options and choose the right one, each implementation strong-arms the user into choosing the vendor's preferred choice.</p>
<p>The experience of logging into PayPal with a passkey on Windows will be different from logging into the same site on iOS or even logging into it with Edge on Android. And forget about trying to use a passkey to log into PayPal on Firefox. The payment site doesn't support that browser on any OS.</p>
<p>Another example is when I create a passkey for my LinkedIn account on Firefox. Because I use a wide assortment of browsers on platforms, I have chosen to sync the passkey using my 1Password password manager. In theory, that choice allows me to automatically use this passkey anywhere I have access to my 1Password account, something that isn't possible otherwise. But it's not as simple as all that.</p>
<p>When I look at the passkey in LinkedIn settings, it shows as being created for Firefox on Mac OS X 10, even though it works on all the browsers and OSes I'm using.</p>

<p>Why is LinkedIn indicating otherwise? The answer is that there's no way for LinkedIn to interoperate flexibly with the browsers and OSes and vice versa. Per the FIDO2 and WebAuthn specs, LinkedIn knows only the browser and OS I used when creating the credential. 1Password, meanwhile, has no way to coordinate with LinkedIn to ensure I'm presented with consistent information that will help me keep track of this. Suddenly, using passkeys is more confusing than it needs to be for there to be utility to ordinary users.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Things get more complicated still when I want to log into LinkedIn on Firefox for Android, and am presented with the following dialog box.</p>
<figure>

  </div>

      </figure>

<p>At this point, I don't know if it's Google or Firefox that's presenting me with this non-intuitive response. I just want to open LinkedIn using the passkey that's being synced by 1Password to all my devices. Somehow, the mysterious entity responsible for this message (it's Google in this case) has hijacked the process in an attempt to convince me to use its platform.</p>
<p>Also, consider the experience on <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, a site that demonstrates how the standard works under different scenarios. When a user wants to enroll a physical security key to log in on macOS, they receive a dialog that steers them toward using a passkey instead and to sync it through iCloud.</p>

      </figure>

<p>The user just wants to enroll a security key in the form of a USB dongle or smartphone and can be used when logging in on any device. But instead, macOS preempts this task with directions for creating a passkey that will be synced through iCloud. What's the user to do? Maybe click on the "other options" in small text at the very bottom? Let's try and see.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img width="761" height="778" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-02.png" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-02.png 761w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-02-640x654.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px">

      The dialog box that appears after clicking "other options."

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Wait, why is it still offering the option for the passkey to be synced in iCloud, and how does that qualify as "other options"? And why is the most prominent suggestion that the user "continue with Touch ID"? It isn't until selectng "security key" that the user will see that option they wanted all along—to store the credential on a security key. Only after this step—now three clicks in—does the light on a USB security key begin blinking, and the key is finally ready to be enrolled.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>The dueling dialogs in this example are by no means unique to macOS.</p>

<h2>Too many cooks in the kitchen</h2>
<p>"Most try to funnel you into a vendor's sync passkey option, and don't make it clear how you can use other things," Brown noted. "Chrome, Apple, Windows, all try to force you to use their synced passkeys by default, and you have to click through prompts to use alternatives."</p>
<p>Bruce Davie, another software engineer with expertise in authentication, agreed, writing in an <a href="https://systemsapproach.org/2024/10/14/can-passkeys-replace-passwords/">October post</a> that the current implementation of passkeys "seems to have failed the 'make it easy for users' test, which in my view is the whole point of passkeys."</p>
<p>In April, Son Nguyen Kim, the product lead for the free <a href="https://proton.me/pass">Proton Pass</a> password manager, penned a post titled <a href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-passkey">Big Tech passkey implementations are a trap</a>. In it, he complained that passkey implementations to date lock users into the platform they created the credential on.</p>
<p>“If you use Google Chrome as your browser on a Mac, it uses the Apple Keychain feature to store your passkeys,” he wrote. "This means you can’t sync your passkeys to your Chrome profile on other devices.” In an email last month, Kim said users can now override this option and choose to store their passkeys in Chrome. Even then, however, "passkeys created on Chrome on Mac don’t sync to Chrome in iPhone, so the user can’t use it seamlessly on Chrome on their iPhone."</p>
<p>Other posts reciting similar complaints are <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/passwords-have-problems-but-passkeys-have-more-95285df9">here</a> and <a href="https://joshcgrossman.com/2024/02/08/one-does-not-simply-implement-passkeys/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In short, there are too many cooks in the kitchen, and each one thinks they know the proper way to make pie.</p>
<p>I have put these and other criticisms to the test over the past four months. I have used them on a true heterogeneous environment that includes a MacBook Air, a Lenovo X1 ThinkPad, an iPhone, and a Pixel running Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, and on the phones, a large number of apps, including those for LinkedIn, PayPal, eBay, Kayak, Gmail, Amazon, and Uber. My objective has been to understand how well passkey-based authentication works over the long term, particularly for cross-platform users.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I fully agree that syncing across different platforms is much harder than it should be. So is the messaging provided during the passkey enrollment phase. The dialogs users see are dictated arbitrarily by whatever OS or browser has control at the moment. There's no way for previously made configuration choices to be communicated to tailor dialog boxes and workflow.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming: There's no programming interface for Apple, Google, and Microsoft platforms to directly pass credentials from one to the other. The FIDO2 standard has devised a clever method in an attempt to bridge this gap. It typically involves joining two devices over a secure BLE connection and using a QR code so the already-authenticated device can vouch for the trustworthiness of the other. This process is easy for some people in some cases, but it can quickly become quirky and prone to failure, particularly when fussy devices can't connect over BLE.</p>
<p>In many cases, however, critics overstate the severity of these sorts of problems. These are definitely things that unnecessarily confuse and complicate the use of passkeys. But often, they're one-time events that can be overcome by creating multiple passkeys and bootstrapping them for each device. From then on, these unphishable, unstealable credentials live on both devices, in much the way some users allow credentials for their Gmail or Apple ID to be stored in two or more browsers or password managers for convenience.</p>
<p>More helpful still is using a cross-platform password manager to store and sync passkeys. I have been using 1Password to do just that for a month with no problems to report. Most other name-brand password managers would likely perform as well. In keeping with the FIDO2 spec, these credentials are end-to-end encrypted.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Halfway house for password managers</h2>
<p>With my 1Password account running on my devices, I had no trouble using a passkey to log into any enrolled site on a device running any browser. The flow was fast and intuitive. In most cases, both iOS and Android had no problem passing the key from 1Password to an app for Uber, Amazon, Gmail, or another site. Signing into phone apps is one of the bigger hassles for me. Passkeys made this process much easier, and it did so while also allowing me the added security of MFA.</p>
<p>This reliance on a password manager, however, largely undermines a key value proposition of passkeys, which has been to provide an entirely new paradigm for authenticating ourselves. Using 1Password to sync a password is almost identical to syncing a passkey, so why bother? Worse still, the majority of people still don't use password managers. I'm a big believer in password managers for the security they offer. Making them a condition for using a passkey would be a travesty.</p>
<p>I'm not the first person to voice this criticism. David Heinemeier Hansson said much the same thing in September.</p>
<p>"The problem with passkeys is that they're essentially a halfway house to a password manager, but tied to a specific platform in ways that aren't obvious to a user at all, and liable to easily leave them unable to access ... their accounts," <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/passwords-have-problems-but-passkeys-have-more-95285df9">wrote</a> the Danish software engineer and programmer, who created Ruby on Rails and is the CTO of web-based software development firm 37signals. "Much the same way that two-factor authentication can do, but worse, since you're not even aware of it."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let's take a simple example. You have an iPhone and a Windows computer. Chrome on Windows stores your passkeys in Windows Hello, so if you sign up for a service on Windows, and you then want to access it on iPhone, you're going to be stuck (unless you're so forward thinking as to add a second passkey, somehow, from the iPhone will on the Windows computer!). The passkey lives on the wrong device, if you're away from the computer and want to login, and it's not at all obvious to most users how they might fix that.</p>
<p>Even in the best case scenario, where you're using an iPhone and a Mac that are synced with Keychain Access via iCloud, you're still going to be stuck, if you need to access a service on a friend's computer in a pinch. Or if you're not using Keychain Access at all. There are plenty of pitfalls all over the flow. And the solutions, like scanning a QR code with a separate device, are cumbersome and alien to most users.</p>
<p>If you're going to teach someone how to deal with all of this, and all the potential pitfalls that might lock them out of your service, you almost might as well teach them how to use a cross-platform password manager like 1Password.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Undermining security promises</h2>
<p>The security benefits of passkeys at the moment are also undermined by an undeniable truth. Of the hundreds of sites supporting passkeys, there isn't one I know of that allows users to ditch their password completely. The password is still mandatory. And with the exception of Google's Advanced Protection Program, I know of no sites that won't allow logins to fall back on passwords, often without any additional factor. Even then, all bug Google APP accounts can be accessed using a recovery code.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This fallback on phishable, stealable credentials undoes some of the key selling points of passkeys. As soon as passkey adoption poses a meaningful hurdle in account takeovers, threat actors will devise hacks and social engineering attacks that exploit this shortcoming. Then we're right back where we were before.</p>
<p>Christiaan Brandt, co-chair of the FIDO2 technical working group and an identity and security product manager at Google, said in an online interview that most users aren't ready for true passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>"We have to meet users where they are," he wrote. "When we tested messaging for passkeys, users balked at 'replace your password with passkeys,' but felt much more comfortable with more softened language like "you can now use a passkey to log in to your account too.' Over time, we most definitely plan to wean users off phishable authentication factors, but we anticipate this journey to take multiple years. We really can only do it once users are so comfortable with passkeys that the fallback to passwords is (almost) never needed."</p>
<p>A design choice further negating the security benefits of passkeys: Amazon, PayPal, Uber, and no small number of other sites supporting passkeys continue to rely on SMS texts for authentication even after passkeys are enrolled.</p>
<p>SMS-based MFA is among the weakest form of this protection. Not only can the texts be phished, but they're also notoriously vulnerable to SIM swaps, in which an adversary gains control of a target's phone number. As long as these less-secure fallbacks exist, passkeys aren't much more than security theater.</p>
<p>I still think passkeys make sense in many cases. I'll say more about that later. First, for a bit more context, readers should know:</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Passkeys are defined in the WebAuthn spec as a "discoverable credential," historically known as a "resident key." The credential is in the form of a private-public key pair, which is created on the security key, which can be in the form of a FIDO-approved secure enclave embedded into a USB dongle, smartphone, or computer. The key pair is unique to each user account. The user creates the key pair after proving their identity to the website using an existing authentication method, typically a password. The private key never leaves the security key.</p>
<p>Going forward, when the user logs in, the site sends a security challenge to the user. The user then uses the locally stored private key to cryptographically sign the challenge and sends it to the website. The website then uses the public key it stores to verify the response is signed with the private key. With that, the user is logged in.</p>
<p>Under the FIDO2 spec, the passkey can never leave the security key, except as an encrypted blob of bits when the passkey is being synced from one device to another. The secret key can be unlocked only when the user authenticates to the physical key using a PIN, password, or most commonly a fingerprint or face scan. In the event the user authenticates with a biometric, it never leaves the security key, just as they never leave Android and iOS phones and computers running macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>Passkeys can be stored and synced using the same mechanisms millions of people already use for passwords—a password manager such as Bitwarden, Apple iCloud, Google Password Manager, or Microsoft's cloud. Just like passwords, passkeys available in these managers are end-to-end encrypted using tried and true cryptographic algorithms.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The advent of this new paradigm was supposed to solve multiple problems at once—make authenticating ourselves online easier, eliminate the hassle of remembering passwords, and all but eradicate the most common forms of account takeovers.</p>
<p>When not encumbered by the problems mentioned earlier, this design provides multifactor authentication in a single stroke. The user logs in using something they have—the physical key, which must be near the device logging in. They must also use something they know—the PIN or password—or something they are—their face or fingerprint—to complete the credential transfer. The cryptographic secret never leaves the enclave embedded into the physical key.</p>
<h2>What to tell Uncle Charlie?</h2>
<p>In enterprise environments, passkeys can be a no-brainer alternative to passwords and authenticators. And even for Uncle Charlie—who has a single iPhone and Mac, and logs into only a handful of sites—passkeys may provide a simpler, less phishable path forward. Using a password manager to log into Gmail with a passkey ensures he's protected by MFA. Using the password alone does not.</p>
<p>The takeaway from all of this—particularly for those recruited to provide technical support this week but also anyone trying to decide if it's time to up their own authentication game: If a password manager isn't already a part of the routine, see if it's viable to add one now. Password managers make it practical to use a virtually unlimited number of long, randomly generated passwords that are unique to each site.</p>
<p>For some, particularly people with diminished capacity or less comfort being online, this step alone will be enough. Everyone else should also, whenever possible, opt into MFA, ideally using security keys or, if that's not available, an authenticator app. I'm partial to 1Password as a password manager, Authy as an authenticator, and security keys from Yubico or Titan. There are plenty of other suitable alternatives.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I still think passkeys provide the greatest promise yet for filling the many security pitfalls of passwords and lowering the difficulty of remembering and storing them. For now, however, the hassles of using passkeys, coupled with their diminished security created by the presence of fallbacks, means no one should feel like a technophobe or laggard for sticking with their passwords. For now, passwords and key- or authenticator-based MFA remain essential.</p>
<p>With any luck, passkeys will someday be ready for the masses, but that day is not (yet) here.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">This is a (slightly) more active fork of <a href="https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate">curl-impersonate</a>.
Differences include:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Encrypted Client Hello(ECH) support introduced in Chrome 119.</li>
<li>ZSTD compression support introduced in Chrome 123.</li>
<li>X25519Kyber768 curve introduced in Chrome 124.</li>
<li>More options for impersonation Akamai http/2 fingerprints, especially for Safari.</li>
<li>Upgrade to more recent version of curl, 8.7.1 as of April, 2024.</li>
<li>Ability to change extension orders and enable/disable TLS grease.</li>
<li>(In progress) Single binary to support both Webkit-based and Gecko-based browsers, i.e. Chrome and Firefox.</li>

<p dir="auto">A special build of <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl</a> that can impersonate the four major browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox(In progress). <code>curl-impersonate</code> is able to perform TLS and HTTP handshakes that are identical to that of a real browser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>curl-impersonate</code> can be used either as a command line tool, similar to the regular curl, or as a library that can be integrated instead of the regular libcurl. See <a href="#Basic-usage">Usage</a> below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you use an HTTP client with a TLS website, it first performs a TLS handshake. The first message of that handshake is called Client Hello. The Client Hello message that most HTTP clients and libraries produce differs drastically from that of a real browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the server uses HTTP/2, then in addition to the TLS handshake there is also an HTTP/2 handshake where various settings are exchanged. The settings that most HTTP clients and libraries use differ as well from those of any real browsers.</p>
<p dir="auto">For these reasons, some web services use the TLS and HTTP handshakes to fingerprint which client is accessing them, and then present different content for different clients. These methods are known as <a href="https://lwthiker.com/networks/2022/06/17/tls-fingerprinting.html" rel="nofollow">TLS fingerprinting</a> and <a href="https://lwthiker.com/networks/2022/06/17/http2-fingerprinting.html" rel="nofollow">HTTP/2 fingerprinting</a> respectively. Their widespread use has led to the web becoming less open, less private and much more restrictive towards specific web clients</p>
<p dir="auto">With the modified curl in this repository, the TLS and HTTP handshakes look <em>exactly</em> like those of a real browser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How?</h2><a id="user-content-how" aria-label="Permalink: How?" href="#how"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To make this work, <code>curl</code> was patched significantly to resemble a browser. Specifically, The modifications that were needed to make this work:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compiling with BoringSSL, Google's TLS library, which is used by Chrome and Safari.</li>
<li>Modifying the way curl configures various TLS extensions and SSL options.</li>
<li>Adding support for new TLS extensions.</li>
<li>Changing the settings that curl uses for its HTTP/2 connections.</li>
<li>Running curl with some non-default flags, for example <code>--ciphers</code>, <code>--curves</code> and some <code>-H</code> headers.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The resulting curl looks, from a network perspective, identical to a real browser.</p>

Notes:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Chromium-based browsers all share the same fingerprints, except for the <code>User-Agent</code> header and <code>sec-ch-ua-platform</code> header. They will not be updated unless this assumption changed. Use your own header if you need to impersonate <code>Edge</code>, <code>Chrome Android</code> etc.</li>
<li>The original Safari fingerprints in the upstream fork are <a href="https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate/issues/215" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/lwthiker/curl-impersonate/issues/215/hovercard">not correct</a>.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic usage</h2><a id="user-content-basic-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Basic usage" href="#basic-usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For each supported browser there is a wrapper script that launches <code>curl-impersonate</code> with all the needed headers and flags. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org"><pre><code>curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can add command line flags and they will be passed on to curl. However, some flags change curl's TLS signature which may cause it to be detected.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that the wrapper scripts use a default set of HTTP headers. If you want to change these headers, you may want to modify the wrapper scripts to fit your own purpose.</p>

<p dir="auto">Pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available at the <a href="https://github.com/yifeikong/curl-impersonate/releases">GitHub releases</a> page. Before you use them you may need to install zstd and CA certificates:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ubuntu - <code>sudo apt install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-dev</code></li>
<li>Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS - <code>yum install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-devel</code></li>
<li>Archlinux - <code>pacman -S ca-certificates zstd</code></li>
<li>macOS - <code>brew install ca-certificates zstd</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The pre-compiled binaries contain libcurl-impersonate and a statically compiled curl-impersonate for ease of use.</p>
<p dir="auto">The pre-compiled Linux binaries are built for Ubuntu systems. On other distributions if you have errors with certificate verification you may have to tell curl where to find the CA certificates. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org --cacert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"><pre><code>curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org --cacert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

<p dir="auto"><code>libcurl-impersonate.so</code> is libcurl compiled with the same changes as the command line <code>curl-impersonate</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It has an additional API function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="CURLcode curl_easy_impersonate(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *target,
                               int default_headers);"><pre><span>CURLcode</span> <span>curl_easy_impersonate</span>(<span>struct</span> <span>Curl_easy</span> <span>*</span><span>data</span>, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>target</span>,
                               <span>int</span> <span>default_headers</span>);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can call it with the target names, e.g. <code>chrome123</code>, and it will internally set all the options and headers that are otherwise set by the wrapper scripts.
If <code>default_headers</code> is set to 0, the built-in list of  HTTP headers will not be set, and the user is expected to provide them instead using the regular <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER</code></a> libcurl option.</p>
<p dir="auto">Calling the above function sets the following libcurl options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION</code></li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSLVERSION</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_EC_CURVES</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_NPN</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPN</code></li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTPBASEHEADER</code>, if <code>default_headers</code> is non-zero (this is a non-standard HTTP option created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP2_PSEUDO_HEADERS_ORDER</code>, sets http2 pseudo header order, for exmaple: <code>masp</code> (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP2_SETTINGS</code> sets the settings frame values, for example <code>1:65536;3:1000;4:6291456;6:262144</code> (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP2_WINDOW_UPDATE</code> sets intial window update value for http2, for example <code>15663105</code> (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPS</code>, <code>CURLOPT_SSL_SIG_HASH_ALGS</code>, <code>CURLOPT_SSL_CERT_COMPRESSION</code>, <code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_TICKET</code> (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_PERMUTE_EXTENSIONS</code>, whether to permute extensions like Chrome 110+. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_TLS_GREASE</code>, whether to enable the grease behavior. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_TLS_EXTENSION_ORDER</code>, explicit order or TLS extensions, in the format of <code>0-5-10</code>. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note that if you call <code>curl_easy_setopt()</code> later with one of the above it will override the options set by <code>curl_easy_impersonate()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using CURL_IMPERSONATE env var</h3><a id="user-content-using-curl_impersonate-env-var" aria-label="Permalink: Using CURL_IMPERSONATE env var" href="#using-curl_impersonate-env-var"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If your application uses <code>libcurl</code> already, you can replace the existing library at runtime with <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> (Linux only). You can then set the <code>CURL_IMPERSONATE</code> env var. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 my_app"><pre><code>LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 my_app
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>CURL_IMPERSONATE</code> env var has two effects:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>curl_easy_impersonate()</code> is called automatically for any new curl handle created by <code>curl_easy_init()</code>.</li>
<li><code>curl_easy_impersonate()</code> is called automatically after any <code>curl_easy_reset()</code> call.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This means that all the options needed for impersonation will be automatically set for any curl handle.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you need precise control over the HTTP headers, set <code>CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no</code> to disable the built-in list of HTTP headers, then set them yourself with <code>curl_easy_setopt()</code>. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no my_app"><pre><code>LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no my_app
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> method will NOT WORK for <code>curl</code> itself because the curl tool overrides the TLS settings. Use the wrapper scripts instead.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes on dependencies</h3><a id="user-content-notes-on-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink: Notes on dependencies" href="#notes-on-dependencies"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you intend to copy the self-compiled artifacts to another system, or use the <a href="#pre-compiled-binaries">Pre-compiled binaries</a> provided by the project, make sure that all the additional dependencies are met on the target system as well.

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>My talk explores the trajectory of iOS spyware from the initial discovery of Pegasus in 2016 to the latest cases in 2024.</p>

<p>The talk will start with an analysis how exploits, infection vectors and methods of commercial spyware on iOS have changed over time.</p>

<p>The second section of the talk is all about advances in detection methods and the forensic sources which are available to discover commercial spyware. This talk will also include a Case Study about the discovery and analysis of BlastPass (one of the latest NSO Exploits).</p>

<p>The third part will discuss technical challenges and limitations of the detections methods and data sources.</p>

<p>Finally, I will conclude the talk with open research topics and suggestions what Apple or we could technically do to make the detection of commercial spyware better.</p>

<p>The commercial spyware landscape on iOS has evolved significantly since the discovery of Pegasus in 2016. In this talk, we’ll explore that evolution through four main areas:</p>

<p>1. Spyware Evolution (2016-2024): By analyzing key exploits, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), infection vectors, and indicators of compromise (IOCs), we’ll trace how spyware has advanced in sophistication, highlighting changes that have led to today’s complex threats.
<br>2. Advancements in Detection: As spyware has grown more sophisticated, so too have detection capabilities. We’ll review the main actors, public organizations and tools that have shaped spyware detection. This part will also include a case study on my discovery and analysis of a sample NSO‘s BlastPass Exploit chain.
<br>3. Current and Future Challenges: Looking forward, we’ll examine the pressing challenges in spyware detection and speculate on how commercial spyware might evolve in response to new security measures and technologies.
<br>4. Recommendations for Research and Detections: Finally, I’ll offer recommendations for advancing research and detection methods and capabilities to combat commercial spyware.</p>

<p>Attendees will gain a comprehensive view of the past, present, and future of spyware on iOS, along with actionable strategies for future research and collaboration.</p>

<p dir="auto">KAG is a logical reasoning and Q&amp;A framework based on the <a href="https://github.com/OpenSPG/openspg">OpenSPG</a> engine and large language models, which is used to build logical reasoning and Q&amp;A solutions for vertical domain knowledge bases.  KAG can effectively overcome the ambiguity of traditional RAG vector similarity calculation and the noise problem of GraphRAG introduced by OpenIE.  KAG supports logical reasoning and multi-hop fact Q&amp;A, etc., and is significantly better than the current SOTA method.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal of KAG is to build a knowledge-enhanced LLM service framework in professional domains, supporting logical reasoning, factual Q&amp;A, etc. KAG fully integrates the logical and factual characteristics of the KGs. Its core features include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Knowledge and Chunk Mutual Indexing structure to integrate more complete contextual text information</li>
<li>Knowledge alignment using conceptual semantic reasoning to alleviate the noise problem caused by OpenIE</li>
<li>Schema-constrained knowledge construction to support the representation and construction of domain expert knowledge</li>
<li>Logical form-guided hybrid reasoning and retrieval to support logical reasoning and multi-hop reasoning Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2.1 Knowledge Representation</h2><a id="user-content-21-knowledge-representation" aria-label="Permalink: 2.1 Knowledge Representation" href="#21-knowledge-representation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the context of private knowledge bases, unstructured data, structured information, and business expert experience often coexist. KAG references the DIKW hierarchy to upgrade SPG to a version that is friendly to LLMs.</p>
<p dir="auto">For unstructured data such as news, events, logs, and books, as well as structured data like transactions, statistics, and approvals, along with business experience and domain knowledge rules, KAG employs techniques such as layout analysis, knowledge extraction, property normalization, and semantic alignment to integrate raw business data and expert rules into a unified business knowledge graph.</p>

<p dir="auto">This makes it compatible with schema-free information extraction and schema-constrained expertise construction on the same knowledge type (e. G., entity type, event type), and supports the cross-index representation between the graph structure and the original text block.</p>
<p dir="auto">This mutual index representation is helpful to the construction of inverted index based on graph structure, and promotes the unified representation and reasoning of logical forms.</p>

<p dir="auto">KAG proposes a logically formal guided hybrid solution and inference engine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The engine includes three types of operators: planning, reasoning, and retrieval, which transform natural language problems into problem solving processes that combine language and notation.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this process, each step can use different operators, such as exact match retrieval, text retrieval, numerical calculation or semantic reasoning, so as to realize the integration of four different problem solving processes: Retrieval, Knowledge Graph reasoning, language reasoning and numerical calculation.</p>

<p dir="auto">The KAG framework includes three parts: kg-builder, kg-solver, and kag-model. This release only involves the first two parts, kag-model will be gradually open source release in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">kg-builder implements a knowledge representation that is friendly to large-scale language models (LLM). Based on the hierarchical structure of DIKW (data, information, knowledge and wisdom), IT upgrades SPG knowledge representation ability, and is compatible with information extraction without schema constraints and professional knowledge construction with schema constraints on the same knowledge type (such as entity type and event type), it also supports the mutual index representation between the graph structure and the original text block, which supports the efficient retrieval of the reasoning question and answer stage.</p>
<p dir="auto">kg-solver uses a logical symbol-guided hybrid solving and reasoning engine that includes three types of operators: planning, reasoning, and retrieval, to transform natural language problems into a problem-solving process that combines language and symbols. In this process, each step can use different operators, such as exact match retrieval, text retrieval, numerical calculation or semantic reasoning, so as to realize the integration of four different problem solving processes: Retrieval, Knowledge Graph reasoning, language reasoning and numerical calculation.</p>

                            <p>You might be familiar with terms like additive and subtractive mixing. True pigment mixing is a complex combination of both. When you push paints out of a tube and mix them, the light entering the substance starts bouncing around. It gets repeatedly scattered and absorbed, and that's how the final color is made. The process is called subsurface scattering.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p>From an un-bylined post from OpenAI’s board of directors on Friday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/meta-says-it-is-making-progress-with-ai-as-spending-grows-8737166">hundreds</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/deepmind-ceo-says-google-will-spend-more-than-100-billion-on-ai">of</a> <a href="https://carboncredits.com/larry-ellisons-100-billion-bet-nuclear-power-to-drive-oracles-ai-revolution/">billions</a> <a href="https://artsmart.ai/blog/how-much-has-microsoft-invested-in-ai/">of</a> dollars
that major companies are now investing into AI development show
what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the
mission. We once again need to raise more capital than we’d
imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital,
need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My take on OpenAI is that both of the following are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenAI currently offers, by far, the best product experience of any AI chatbot assistant.</li>
<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/26/zuck-open-source-ai">There is no technical moat</a> in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter of an investment bubble.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors mistakenly thought investing in Netscape was a way to bet on the future of the open internet and the World Wide Web in particular. Investing in OpenAI today is a bit like that — generative AI technology has a bright future and is transforming the world, but it’s wishful thinking that the breakthrough client implementation is going to form the basis of a lasting industry titan.</p>

<p>There’s even a loosely similar origin story. Netscape started life as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">Mosaic</a>, a free-of-charge  browser that debuted in January 1993 and instantly revolutionized the nascent-but-still-obscure World Wide Web by adding support for images. Mosaic was developed and released by a team led by Marc Andreessen at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications">NCSA</a>). A year later Andreessen and his team left NCSA and, with Silicon Graphics founder James Clark, founded Netscape Communications Corporation, using the Mosaic browser as the foundation for Netscape Navigator. OpenAI’s whole “<em>forget about this being a public-benefit thing, let’s make it a for-profit thing</em>” transition is very reminiscent of the Mosaic-to-Netscape transition.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is that Netscape <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netscape-ipo-ignited-the-boom-taught-some-hard-lessons-20058518550">went public quickly</a>, and that’s when the investment money poured in. NCSA Mosaic debuted in January 1993 and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netscape-ipo-ignited-the-boom-taught-some-hard-lessons-20058518550">Netscape’s IPO</a> was just 2.5 years later, in August 1995. OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars already — <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsofts-financial-disclosures-show-how-openai-is-fueling-growth-and-taking-a-toll-on-profits/">$13 billion from Microsoft alone</a> — while still in this uncertain transition from an ostensibly not-for-profit foundation to a totally-for-profit company. </p>

<p>OpenAI’s board now stating “We once again need to raise more capital than we’d imagined” less than three months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-6-6b-and-is-now-valued-at-157b/">after raising another $6.6 billion</a> at a valuation of $157 billion sounds alarmingly like a Ponzi scheme — an argument akin to “<em>Trust us, we can maintain our lead, and all it will take is a never-ending stream of infinite investment.</em>”</p>

    </p>
    
    
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
    <p>The Cody Computer is an 8-bit home computer intended to be built as a DIY project. Inspired by
      (but not compatible with) the Commodore home computers of the 1980s, it's built around the
      <a href="https://wdc65xx.com/integrated-circuit">Western Design Center's 65C02 and 65C22</a>
      and the 
      <a href="https://www.parallax.com/propeller-1/">Parallax Propeller</a>
      microcontroller. It doesn't compete with your modern computer or even the new incarnations of 
      old computers. Named in honor of a good little boy who preferred museums, rockets, and 
      computer chips to chew-sticks and squeak-toys, it's just supposed to be simple, silly, fun,
      and perhaps a little bit educational.</p>
    <p>The electronics were designed using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> and the
      mechanical components developed using <a href="https://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> and
      <a href="https://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. 
      The assembly-language software was written using the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/">64tass</a>
      assembler, while BASIC programs were written using the bespoke Cody BASIC interpreter.
      All design files and software are released under the GPLv3 license. If you don't build one
      yourself, perhaps it'll give you ideas for a work of your own.</p>
    <p>Detailed project information is available in <a href="https://www.codycomputer.org/TheCodyComputerBook.pdf">The Cody Computer Book</a>, a
      freely downloadable PDF currently available to review as a draft copy. Additional content 
      covering Cody BASIC programming, assembly-language programming, and electronics projects
      for the Cody Computer will (hopefully) be available in the future. Any future content will also be
      available online and without charge.</p>
        
    <h2>Features</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Easy-to-assemble computer built around the modern 65C02, 65C22, and P8X32A.</li>
      <li>3D-printed mechanical components and keyboard with 3D-printed custom keycap set.</li>
      <li>Boots to "Cody BASIC" and supports assembly language cross-development using 64tass.</li>
      <li>160x200 NTSC video graphics loosely inspired by the VIC-II's multicolor mode.</li>
      <li>Audio peripheral implementing a limited subset of Commodore SID functionality.</li>
      <li>Expansion/cartridge port, two buffered UARTs, and Atari-style joystick connectors.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>BRUSSELS — Belgium will ban the sale of disposable electronic cigarettes as of Jan. 1 on health and environmental grounds in a groundbreaking move for European Union nations.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-40289-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Health minister Frank Vandenbroucke said the inexpensive e-cigarettes had turned into a health threat since they are an easy way for teenagers to be drawn into smoking and get hooked on nicotine.</p>   <p>"Disposable e-cigarettes is a new product simply designed to attract new consumers," he said in an interview.</p>   <p>"E-cigarettes often contain nicotine. Nicotine makes you addicted to nicotine. Nicotine is bad for your health. These are fact," Vandenbroucke added.</p>   <p>Because they are disposable, the plastic, battery and circuits are a burden on the environment. On top of that, "they create hazardous waste chemicals still present in what people throw away," Vandenbroucke said.</p>   
   <p>The health minister said he also targeted the disposable e-cigarettes because reusable ones could be a tool to help people quit smoking if they cannot find another way.</p>   <p>Australia outlawed the sale of " vapes" outside pharmacies earlier this year in some of the world's toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes. Now Belgium is leading the EU drive.</p>   <p>"We are the first country in Europe to do so," Vandenbroucke said.</p>   <p>He wants tougher tobacco measures in the 27-nation bloc.</p>   <p>"We are really calling on the European Commission to come forward now with new initiatives to update, to modernize, the tobacco legislation," he said.</p>   <p>There is understanding about Belgium's decision, even in some shops selling electronic cigarettes, and especially on the environmental issue.</p>   <p>Once the cigarette is empty, "the battery is still working. That's what is terrible, is that you could recharge it, but you have no way of recharging it," said Steven Pomeranc, owner of the Brussels Vapotheque shop. "So you can imagine the level of pollution it creates."</p>   <p>A ban usually means a financial loss to the industry, but Pomeranc said he thinks it will not hurt too much.</p>   <p>"We have a lot of alternative solutions which are also very easy to use," he said. "Like this pod system, which are pre-filled with liquid, which can just be clipped into the rechargeable e-cigarette. So we will simply have a shift of clients towards this new system."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        

<p>I am a Computer Hardware professional. I started working with computer technology in the early eighties. I have seen the evolution of technology starting with closed platforms like the game console era and then the move toward open platforms like the <a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-1/" target="_blank">Home Computer Golden Age</a>. In the last 5 or 10 years, I have witnessed technology changes that are slowly moving away from open hardware designs towards hardware that is locked down and can’t be modified by the user.  For more articles on this subject, see my  <a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/categories/deceptivetechnology/" target="_blank">DeceptiveTechnology</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="is-dell-limiting-access-to-drivers-and-designing-bios-to-minimize-os-changes">Is Dell limiting access to drivers and designing BIOS to minimize OS changes?</h2>

<p>In the last few years, I have noticed a trend where Dell does not provide RST storage drivers for NVME SSDs (the software that allows a user to cleanly install an operating system from media) on Laptops and Desktops. Normally, you can just go into the BIOS, switch from NVME Raid to ACHI, and be done with it—or can you?</p>

<p>I recently purchased a Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7640 Laptop with a BIOS that does not have an option to change to an AHCI storage configuration. Without the RST storage driver not being made available on Dell’s website, and no ability to switch to ACHI, you cannot reinstall Windows in a clean state from a installation disk because the install requires that the RST driver be manually loaded befoe it can see the storage device.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell-inspiron-16-plus-bios-storage-configuration-missing-ahci-mode.jpeg" alt="Dell Inspiron 16plus bios storage configuration missing AHCI mode"></p>

<p>Normally, you would see this screen that allows you to switch storage modes
<img src="https://www.scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell-inspiron-3030-bios-storage-configuration.jpeg" alt="Dell Inspiron 3030 bios storage configuration AHCI mode"></p>

<p>I tried the key combinations to enable advanced BIOS configuration that worked on previous models, but no dice. Is it a coincidence that Dell has not been releasing the RST storage drivers for most of these models in the last couple of years, and is now deciding that the BIOS storage configuration should not be changable?</p>

<p>If you check Dell’s website for drivers, you probably will not see RST drivers for many models listed. I checked the driver listing for my model and so far I don’t see it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell.com-support-storage-driver-listings-lack-RST.resized.jpeg" alt="Dell.com Support Storage Driver Listings Lack RST"></p>

<p>Here is a different model with no RST listing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell.com-support-storage-driver-listings-lack-RST-different-model.jpeg" alt="Dell.com Support Storage Driver Listings Lack RST Differnt Model"></p>

<p>You can try to find drivers online, based on the hardware id’s, especially from Intel’s website, but they don’t always work for your particular model. I even tried to extract the drivers from the OS but I wasn’t able to find a .inf configuration profile to make it work.</p>

<p>These changes effectively prevents a user from cleanly reinstalling the operating system from media. The only option, that I can see, is to install from the service partition on the device, or from Dell’s BIOS re-installation technology, which contains bloatware, targeted advertising, and data collection.</p>

<p>I’m open to being wrong, please let me know if I am missing something.</p>

<p>Short of evidence to the contrary. I believe this is one small part of a bigger and long-term planned effort within the PC hardware and software industries to control the user experience for consumer hardware. Apple is also moving in this direction with the MacOS by limiting non-approved software from being installed. Yes, you can work around it, but it’s getting harder and harder to do so with every iteration of the Operating System.</p>

<p>We are slowly being boiled to the point of no return. We need some kind of consortium for users to represent our interests otherwise in 10 or 20 years we will have very limited choice when it comes to computer technology.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Last month, I spent 2 weeks in China - I visited Beijing, Chengdu, Emeishan, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou.</p><p>I have no illusions about "understanding" China. I've only spent 2 weeks there. This trip is a beginning, not a capstone, of my curiosity about China. And I hope to share what I learn with you via future podcast episodes.</p><p>It’s funny how China has basically the inverse problem as America. We subsidize demand and restrict supply. They subsidize supply and restrict demand. We can’t rebuild fallen bridges. They build bridges to nowhere. In the most desirable cities in this country, every random Victorian house and park bench is a historic site that can’t be disturbed. There, they’ll bulldoze a 500 year old temple to build an endless skyscraper complex that no one wants to live in.</p><p>My overwhelming first impression was: wow this place is so fucking big. Travel often teaches you things about a country which you honestly should have intuited even without visiting. Obviously, I knew that China is a big country, with over 1.4 billion people. But it was only after I visited that the visceral scale of the biggest cities was impressed upon me.</p><p>Even in Emeishan, a city of just half a million people (considered a quaint countryside town by Chinese standards), we found a Buddhist temple of staggering proportions. The scale was almost comical - we'd enter what seemed like an impressively large compound, only to discover it was merely the entrance to an even grander structure right behind it. This pattern repeated 5 or 6 times, each subsequent building larger and more ornate than the last, like some kind of inverse nesting dolls.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3205969,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4c80ed-b1ca-4782-b30a-6f4133a48bf0_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>This must have been structure number 2 or 3?</figcaption></figure></div><p>I asked a monk at the temple how they funded this massive site in a city of just half a million people. He told us that it was simply through donations. We probed further about how such an enormous project could have been financed by just ordinary people's donations. He responded, "We've got a lot of supporters, dude", and changed the topic.</p><p>Chongqing is by far the coolest city I've ever visited. It's this insane cyberpunk multi-level metropolis of over 20 million people. I wouldn't know how to begin describing it, but there's a bunch of great YouTube videos which will show you what I mean. I got a really nice nice 2-floor hotel room that overlooked two rivers and one of the most insane skylines in the world for 60 bucks - highly recommend visiting Chongqing if you get the chance.</p><p>In 1995, astronomers pointed Hubble at a seemingly empty patch of sky the size of a grain of sand held at arm's length. Instead of emptiness, the 10-day exposure revealed over 3,000 galaxies. Every speck of light in the image was an entire galaxy containing billions of stars. When I went atop the tallest building in Chongqing and looked out over the city, I thought about the Hubble image. You could zoom in on any direction you'd find - behind the fog and mist, beyond even perhaps the horizon - another skyscraper, each containing hundreds or thousands of people living or working.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12811026-40ed-4787-8447-67fa59919542_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12811026-40ed-4787-8447-67fa59919542_4032x3024.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12811026-40ed-4787-8447-67fa59919542_4032x3024.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12811026-40ed-4787-8447-67fa59919542_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12811026-40ed-4787-8447-67fa59919542_4032x3024.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a4dd8f8-8fc5-4b04-93f1-d540170ac5fd_3024x4032.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a4dd8f8-8fc5-4b04-93f1-d540170ac5fd_3024x4032.heic 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a4dd8f8-8fc5-4b04-93f1-d540170ac5fd_3024x4032.heic" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a4dd8f8-8fc5-4b04-93f1-d540170ac5fd_3024x4032.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a4dd8f8-8fc5-4b04-93f1-d540170ac5fd_3024x4032.heic 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bb643a9-f5ca-43c8-b7d8-50ad7518b9f9_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bb643a9-f5ca-43c8-b7d8-50ad7518b9f9_4032x3024.heic 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bb643a9-f5ca-43c8-b7d8-50ad7518b9f9_4032x3024.heic" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bb643a9-f5ca-43c8-b7d8-50ad7518b9f9_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bb643a9-f5ca-43c8-b7d8-50ad7518b9f9_4032x3024.heic 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p>We took a 12-hour village train from Chongqing to Shanghai. I'm embarrassed to say that my only experience with the actual countryside was via the windows of this train. Still, the sights were quite interesting. We saw again and again small paddy farms surrounding a handful of 5-10 story skyscraper, plopped in the seeming middle of nowhere. They looked quite shoddy, but it's quite interesting that even in the countryside, many people lived in large buildings instead of their own small homes. I couldn't hop off the train and confirm, but I saw many towns that looked quite ghostly - no actually visible people anywhere.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2287698,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad23033-78a3-44ef-8484-a2314dc7121b_4032x3024.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Outside of Beijing and Shanghai (and sometimes even within), you can tell that these skyscrapers were put up by a country with a GDP per capita of $10,000 (and potentially half or quarter than when many of these buildings were put up). America and Europe put up a ton of beautiful buildings in the early 20th century when their GDP per capita was similar to China's - one could even argue that those older structures are more aesthetic than anything we're building today in the West. Not so in China. These endless rows of skyscrapers, put up in the construction frenzy of the last few decades, are ugly - boxes of mostly concrete with visible blight and discoloration all over them. If the great construction binge is indeed over, it'll be a shame that China's infrastructure was built out during a period of particularly uninspired architecture.</p><p>Beijing's urban design looks like something straight out of James Scott's "Seeing Like a State". The city is dominated by these enormous apartment complexes - blocks of 10 adjacent 30-story buildings demarcated by 8-lane roads. The government buildings follow the same pattern: huge structures divided by extremely wide boulevards. This layout seems designed partly for social control - during zero-COVID, authorities could lock down 10,000 people by simply guarding a few entrance gates. The wide roads would also make it easy to move military forces through the city. The only break from this pattern are the Hutongs, Beijing's old historic neighborhoods. But even these weren't spared completely - only a fraction survived Beijing's rapid modernization push. Dare I say that China is too YIMBY?</p><p>I got quite mixed messages about the state of public opinion in China. This is to be expected in a society where you can't establish common knowledge. One person told me that the new generation is quite nationalist, unlike the older reform generation which personally experienced the catastrophes of Mao and the tangible benefits of liberalization. He made the rather insightful point that this tilt in Chinese public opinion increasingly gives lie to the American talking point, "We're against the CCP, not the Chinese people." In fact, he went on to say that the current regime is way more liberal than what would result from an election in China.</p><p>Another person told me that these Chinese nationalists were only a vocal minority, similar to the wokes in America circa 2020. While they make up only about 10% of the population, they aggressively shout down others on Weibo (China's Twitter equivalent). Most people find them annoying but feel uncomfortable confronting them directly. This matches what a student who graduated from a top university there told me - the vast majority of his classmates are simply apolitical. And in our own interactions with locals, we saw little evidence of widespread nationalism. In fact, when my Chinese-speaking trip mate would mention he was from the UK to taxi drivers, they would often respond enthusiastically: "Oh wonderful, we love the UK!"</p><p>There were very few foreigners. In Beijing I might have seen half a dozen cumulatively across entire seas of people. In Chengdu and Chongqing, I barely remember seeing any (which is a real shame, because Chongqing is a truly incredible tourist destination). So rare apparently are tourists that in Chengdu and Chongqing we got asked for selfies many times.</p><p><span>Outside of Shanghai, almost nobody spoke English. If I went again, I would definitely try to crash course some basic Chinese beforehand. This language barrier did led to some interesting encounters. At a park in Chengdu, an old man reading a book called </span><em>Medical English</em><span> asked us to join him for tea. He was mostly just trying to practice his English. He said he loves foreigners, and that his favorite period of life was the 80s and 90s - "We love Deng!".</span></p><p>My trip mate's friend's grandmother was incredibly gracious in hosting us for a dinner while we were in Emeishan. We saw a beautiful Uighur rug hanging on their wall. The grandfather pointed it out and explained, “We have amazing relationships with minorities here in China.” I don't think this was some theatrical attempt to contradict Western propaganda. It seemed like he genuinely didn’t know what is said about the treatment of Uighurs in the West. He was just trying to show his visitors something cool he had.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg" width="3384" height="2996" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2996,&quot;width&quot;:3384,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2168998,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8adb8d3e-2963-4f36-9455-fc1c75de5d3b_3384x2996.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We kept trying to ask them about their personal experiences over the last seven decades as China has grown and changed. but the grandfather kept responding with lengthy monologues about military history. Here is a representative exchange:</p><p>Me (who doesn’t speak Chinese) to my trip mate (who does): Ask them about what job they had when they first moved near Chengdu.</p><p>[The grandfather speaks in Chinese for 10 minutes. I get a bit impatient and whisper to my trip mate asking what he’s saying]</p><p>My trip mate: He's saying that the mountains around Chengdu make it a perfect base of retreat in case of an invasion, which Mao was worried about during the Sino Soviet split.</p><p>Me: What?! Why didn’t you ask him about the first job he had?</p><p>My trip mate: I did!!</p><p>Grandpas are the same everywhere.</p><p>People say that Xi is establishing a cult of personality. This may be true within the CCP cadres, but I saw no evidence of it in public. I don't think I saw a single picture of Xi anywhere - not on any billboards, screens, or walls. People didn't really bring Xi up in conversations. I saw some pictures of Mao, but mostly in museums (or in one case at a tea farm he apparently used to frequent). The hammer and sickle was also a rare sight, mostly displayed on government buildings.</p><p>There are indeed cameras everywhere. This is gonna sound super naive - but I genuinely don't understand why. There's no crime. I know you'll say it's to prevent protests. Which might make sense for major streets, but even random alleyway corners will have a couple of cameras. Are they really trying to prevent someone from fomenting insurrection between 2 garbage cans? Beijing in particular had police officers at attention at what seemed like every street corner.</p><p>One recent student I talked to said that they understand they don't have freedoms here, but they're willing to take the tradeoff in favor of safety - they don't want school shootings. I thought this was quite silly - not only because there's no reason political freedom ought to lead to school shootings, but mostly because school shootings are such a statistically marginal experience. But I realized this is exactly the way we treat any hints of public protests in China. Just as school shootings are featured heavily in the media but aren't actually something you're likely to personally encounter, so too with protests against the CCP. You are overwhelmingly unlikely to spontaneously encounter them.</p><p>People were quite willing to chat openly in public places about problems in the country and with the regime. Including people who seemed to have a lot to lose. Almost everyone I talked to would acknowledge the economy was bad, and many were willing to implicate the government's decisions. Some even casually brought up Tiananmen or the Cultural Revolution. One person was even willing to discuss the odds of regime change at a public restaurant - though he may been have an especially careless fellow.</p><p>To be clear, it's an authoritarian system, and I certainly would feel uncomfortable doing what I'm doing there, but it definitely isn't North Korea.</p><p>In a shopping mall in Chongqing, a couple of high schoolers came up to us in order to get selfies. It felt like the perfect opportunity to learn about young adult life in China. So I whipped out the Translate app in WeChat and proceeded, rather clumsy, to make small talk. I asked them what they did in their free time. They said they watched 2-3 hours of TikTok every day. I asked them what videos they'd watch. They said it's a whole bunch of "sexy girls". I laughed because I thought they were joking. But I asked one of them to pull out his phone. We he scrolled past the first 10 videos on his feed and they were indeed all just "sexy girls".</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:21374535,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35dcd7fe-cf0a-4b88-9535-45e6713ff223_3024x4032.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>These guys love sexy girls</figcaption></figure></div><p>We chatted up quite a lot of young people on night life streets. I was struck by how many young people expressed feeling stressed or overwhelmed. We met a musician in Chengdu who was writing songs about youth anxiety. We chatted up some modeling school students - even they complained about the intense pressure they felt. We met a guy who had studied in Australia but returned to China during COVID. He explained that many of his friends with prestigious degrees are moving away from Shanghai and Beijing - Yes, the pay there can be twice as high as in second or third tier cities. But the competitiveness is insane. And in order to actually land the high skilled positions, they have to work truly insane hours (9-9-6 is not a myth). He said that many of his friends were opting for these less ambitious lower-paying careers in smaller cities, where the rent is lower and the pressure is manageable.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png" width="1352" height="1296" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1296,&quot;width&quot;:1352,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2704281,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae058be0-5a01-4868-8ab5-c9c7baa20f3e_1352x1296.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Karaoke in Shanghai</figcaption></figure></div><p>Speaking of which - we really need to do a better job with Chinese students studying abroad in America. These students will likely end up in influential positions back home, yet colleges treat them basically like cash cows. They often arrive bombarded with propaganda about America, which is reinforced by the prevalent discourse at universities. And they find themselves isolated by language barriers and cultural differences. Giving these future leaders a genuinely positive experience in America might be the best thing we can do to improve US-China relations in the long run.</p><p>I'm still puzzled by how China can have both a demographic collapse and massive youth unemployment. You'd think with fewer young people being born, the ones who are around would be in high demand. One explanation I heard while there is that there are plenty of menial jobs available, but today's educated youth - who've gone through high school and college - just won't take the low-skilled positions their parents and grandparents did. Meanwhile, there's a real shortage of the high-skilled jobs that would actually match their education and aspirations. It's a mismatch between the jobs available and the jobs young people feel qualified for and willing to do.</p><p>I kept asking young people about the public intellectual landscape in China - who are their equivalents of Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Lex Friedman, and Sam Harris? The sense I got is that this kind of popular intellectual ecosystem just doesn't exist there. Sure, there are viral Bilibili videos from professors talking about practical matters like how to manage your finances. But grand takes about what's happening in the world and what we should do about it? Not much going on.</p><p>I met a couple of EAs in China - they're exceptionally rare. When we asked them why it's so hard to spread EA or similar worldviews there, they said people just aren't into that organizing decisions using some ideological lens. They're much more concerned with practical, tangible matters. One talking point I heard again and again is that, "China is still a developing country." The implication seemed to be that China can't afford to pursue costly idealistic programs around climate change, social safety nets, or international aid - it needs to focus on basic economic development first.</p><p>By far the most inconvenient thing about visiting China is internet access. As a foreigner, basically all the websites you might find useful are behind the firewall. Even for websites that aren't blocked by the Great Firewall, I just didn't have anything even close to what you might call high-speed internet. This was true across my entire travel, including my burner SIM card from ChinaMobile or the WiFi at fancy hotels in Beijing or Shanghai. We released an episode of my podcast during this trip - because of the low bandwidth, my editor and I were just sending screenshots to each other throughout the night instead of hopping on a video call. The VPN situation is worse than I thought it would be . I happened to be lucky enough to download one of the VPNs that sometimes works before the trip. It was still pretty slow and unreliable. Astrill or Mullvad might actually result in a connection 75% of the time - often they would cause WeChat and Alipay to crash (which is rather inconvenient since you basically need those apps open all the time to navigate China). Very possible that I was fucking something up. But between these internet issues and the need to use a burner phone and laptop, I would be quite reluctant to use China as a remote work location.</p><p>I am super hesitant to say anything here, because I am extremely unconfident about what's actually happening. Treat this just as some tentative notes from a few conversations.</p><p>I've cut out a whole bunch of stuff about AI in this section because I'm not sure if my initial assessment is correct.  I hope to make podcast episodes over the next few months which provide a better researched account than I can supply here.</p><p>The biggest surprise from talking to Chinese VCs people at AI labs was how capital constrained they felt. Moonshot AI, one of China's leading AI labs, raised $1 billion at a $3 billion valuation. Meanwhile, just xAI's new cluster alone will cost $3-4 billion.</p><p>The tech ecosystem feels quite shell shocked from the 2021 crackdown. One VC half-jokingly asked if I could help him get his money out of China. If you keep your money in China, you're basically stuck choosing between terrible options. You can either accept a measly 2% yield from state banks, or throw it into China's perpetually struggling stock market. This helps explain why valuations for Chinese companies are chronically low - the exit opportunities just suck. Even if you build (or invest in) something great, there's no guarantee the company will be able to raise the next round. And even if you do raise again and succeed, the government might randomly cancel your IPO. And even if you somehow make it to the public markets, Chinese equities have been performing terribly anyways. It's a good reminder of how easy it is to completely wreck an innovation ecosystem that depends on risk-taking investors.</p><p>In China, liberal pro-Western voices are often censored or shouted down. If I was the US President, and I wanted to win hearts and minds in China, here's what I'd do. In every single speech where I'm talking about China, I'd make a conspicuous effort to complement Chinese people, Chinese values, and Chinese culture. I'd talk about how my Chinese staffers are the smartest and most hardworking people I've ever worked with (which honestly is probably true). I'd talk about how much my daughter is obsessed with ancient Chinese dresses. I'd talk about how I'm learning Mandarin in my free time, and have a live "Aw shucks" conversation in Mandarin.</p><p>These clips would go viral on Bilibili and TikTok. And they'd probably stay up because it would just be a weird thing to censor. The CCP might even think that these displays of affection aggrandize them. But in reality, showing our admiration for Chinese people and their achievements (who genuinely are fucking killing it everywhere where they're not held down by communism), undermines the central narrative of the regime - that the West is hell bent on holding Chinese people back, that they have no respect or understanding of their culture, and that the CCP is a necessary bulwark against these imperialists.</p><p>On a totally unrelated note, so many people I met in China are in fact super talented and hard working. Someone connected me with the CEO of a company that manufactures life sciences equipment. He told me that before he started this company, he used to be a repairman for foreign imported machines, traveling 200 days a year with a screwdriver to wherever one had broken down. In 2013, he designed and started manufacturing his own machines, building more and more advanced designs, and now they've just built out a $60 million factory 1.5 hours from Shanghai. I asked him what the hardest part of ramping up production is - apparently constructing factories is just not an issue - tons of construction firms can make you a new facility quite reliably (along with the adjacent dorm room building for workers).</p><p><span>Noah Smith has a good </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-much-can-you-really-learn-about" rel="">blog post</a><span> about what one can't learn from travel - you're not going to learn about the risk of a war or the state of the AI race by gazing at skylines or chatting up taxi drivers. Of course you can learn about those things by talking to the people in China who are most proximal to those decisions. But if you have access to them, surely you can also get them on the Zoom call. And fwiw, this should you update you in favor of more Zoom calls, not less travel - during the trip I realized how much I could have already learned about China by meeting the listeners I have in China (who are unusually high quality, presumably because of the restrictions they have to get through to get to my content).</span></p><p><span>Incidentally, if you're in China (and especially if you work on anything related to AI) please email me at </span><a href="mailto:hello@dwarkeshpatel.com" rel="">hello@dwarkeshpatel.com</a><span>. I'm keen for people to reach out and suggest guests to chat about China. Especially keen to better understand the Chinese political system, and how decisions about mega projects, arms races, and technology investment will be made at the brink of AGI.</span></p><p>So what's the point of travel? What about the in person experience can't be replaced by books, travel vlogs, and Zoom calls? For me, it's something like, what becomes salient to you. I started asking questions about China I hadn't even thought to ask about America.</p><p>Another thing I noticed is more personal. Two weeks of being AFK, and of having the excuse of using a burner phone to put off messages, helped me clear the cache of thoughts about sponsorships, logistics, growth, hiring, and a bunch of other practical minutiae. My shower thoughts wandered away from upcoming negotiations and towards interesting rabbit holes.</p><p>It's a good reminder that what's lacking in life is not time. It's focus. If you're working on what matters, you can advance leaps and bounds in 8 hours. And if you're just clearing the slog, you can spend a lifetime staying in the same place.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1991218,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb66771-f2bb-4d91-899f-5490463cd90b_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
