  <p><em>This piece contains spoilers for Halt and Catch Fire.</em></p><p><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. During quarantine, I binged all four seasons in a week and was immediately struck by its themes of human connection — the desire for it, the difficulty that inevitably comes with it, and ultimately the necessity of it. Above all, it’s a show obsessed with change.</p><p>It’s also a show you’ve probably never heard of.</p><p>When it debuted in 2014, it drew just over 1 million viewers, making it the least-watched premiere in AMC’s modern history. Throughout its running, ratings steadily declined. Despite its lack of popularity, <em>Halt and Catch Fire </em>got better with every season.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next three years across 40 episodes, viewers that stuck around witnessed a show brave enough to dispose of its original design and become something even greater. And that’s what intrigues me most about this show. Not its writing nor its performances (both of which are fantastic), but its evolution. What was conceived as an antihero-centric drama about surviving in the cutthroat tech industry transformed into a deeply empathetic ensemble study about finding connection in the process of creation.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>AMC broke into the landscape of prestige television with Mad Men and Breaking Bad, both wildly successful shows that defined an era of peak TV. This overtrodden antihero formula bled into Season 1 of Halt and Catch Fire, which tried to capture the same success as other morally-gray dramas. </p><p>Its main character, Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), is a charismatic salesman with a mysterious past and self-destructive tendencies. In an effort to build a computer that outpaces and outprices the competition, he recruits Gordon (Scoot McNairy), a pitiful computer engineer, and Cameron (Mackenzie Davis), a rebellious coding prodigy. Donna (Kerry Bishé), Gordon’s wife, is relegated to the sideline for the majority of the first season despite a desire to utilize her own engineering talents. </p><p>Much of Season 1 treads down familiar beats and not much reason is provided for the audience to become emotionally invested. Too much of the narrative hangs on Joe, a mediocre, overconfident man who exploits those around him for personal gain. His arrogance and proclivity to go off the books is supposed to feel admirable and seductively dangerous, but ultimately comes off as manipulative and one-dimensional. The characters around Joe are far more interesting; however, so much time is dedicated to him that they remain archetypal renderings, waiting to be filled in. </p><p>Nevertheless, there are some great moments in the first season — sparks of what’s to come in later seasons. The tech revolution of the 80s makes for an engaging and nostalgic setting, transporting viewers back to a time of floppy disk drives and dial-up modems. We also see Donna and Cameron’s first interactions, as well as the fascinating dynamic of Joe and Gordon’s working relationship.</p><h2><strong>The Makings of Greatness</strong></h2>

  <p>The best thing the show’s writers ever did was realize that Joe wasn’t the most interesting character. Subsequent seasons trace the dissolution of his complex, as he finds himself confronting the limits of his charisma and the consequences of his actions. It’s the death of the antihero, and in its place rises a show imbued with newfound life, as the burgeoning business partnership between its two main female characters becomes the central narrative. </p><p>Season 2’s opening sequence establishes this wonderfully energetic change of pace with a three-minute scene shot entirely in one take. The handheld camera swings and pans around a suburban home crammed with coders, construction tools and cables strewn across the ground. It’s a cinematographic manifestation of the crackling energy, messiness and all, between people taking a risk to create something new. Here, we meet Mutiny, Donna and Cameron’s video game subscription service that takes center stage in Season 2 and 3.</p><p>As the two navigate the passions and pitfalls of running a startup, the melodramatic tension of the first season is replaced with a palpable lightness and ambition. There are still plenty of great dramatic revelations and story beats, but none of it feels forced or in service of a half-baked antihero arc. The stakes feel genuine and emotionally potent. </p><p>The partnership between Donna and Cameron is largely the impetus for this. I can’t think of a better portrayal of female friendship on television that I’ve seen than the one in this show. Rather than be defined by their relations to Joe and Gordon or by tropes like the working mother, they’re given agency and allowed to be flawed and ambitious and all the other things media has constantly told women not to be. </p><p>Cameron, who grew up learning how to survive on her own, opens up to collaborate and trust others — but there’s a constant fear of losing the company to which she’s dedicated her whole life. Donna, who has experienced the heartbreak of a failed product once before, comes into her own as a leader — but, by trying to always make the most logical decisions for the company, loses the partnership she needed most. </p><p>The progression of their friendship — the ways in which they support, hurt, and eventually forgive each other — is treated with such nuance, and it’s a genuinely moving relationship to watch unfold. </p><p>Their bond is just one of the many complex dynamics this show explores. As the show matures, so do its characters. Joe learns to understand the importance of those around him — that people are not only the means to an end, but the end itself. Gordon, so eager in earlier seasons to prove himself and be remembered for something, finds confidence and peace in the present, and leaves a legacy that will long reverberate in characters and viewers alike. As much as these characters grow and evolve, what remains at their core is what brought them together in the first place: a shared ambition to build something that makes a difference in the world.</p>

  <p>In computer science, recursion is a method of problem-solving in which a function repeatedly calls upon itself to solve increasingly complex solutions. </p><p>In the show’s finale, Cameron describes her inner software as run by recursion. It’s an apt realization for someone who has spent much of her professional life building her ideas into reality, only to find herself back in the same place still searching for an answer. It’s also a way to read the show as a whole. </p><p>Halt and Catch Fire is a show dedicated to its own reinvention. Across four seasons spanning 10 years, there are two time lapses, a change in location and the rise and fall of numerous companies. It’s a testament to the writers that this constant reinvention never feels choppy or stale. </p><p>Nevertheless, despite all these variables, the characters always find their way back to one another. The deep connection they all share is a sort of gravitational force, pulling them back into orbit across time and space. By the finale, it’s heartbreaking to have to see them go. </p><p>In its beginning, Halt and Catch Fire was ostensibly about characters trying to pioneer the next big tech breakthrough. As exciting as it is to watch people work toward the technological future we live in today, the show is wired in such a way that the narrative is defined by process, not by results. Rarely do characters ever succeed in their original goal. Yet, in the work and in the moments they have with one another, something greater is forged. </p><p>Products come and go; the technological industry, which is built on constant advancement, makes sure of it. This show isn’t interested in the disposability of things, but rather what endures. And the desire for human connection is one of those things that never really goes away.</p><p>It seems fitting that the last line of the series features, not a goodbye, but an offer. Even in its final moments, the show looks toward the future. Life isn’t episodic; it’s cyclical, and the show is adamant that saying goodbye doesn’t signal an end. Instead, with every goodbye comes a chance to start anew. It’s life in recursion: We watch these characters innovate and fail over and over again. But each time, they learn from their past mistakes. The hope is that, someday, it’ll be enough. Even if it isn’t, all it takes is one idea to reboot and start again. </p><p><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> is currently streaming on Netflix.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In 1987, economist and Nobel laureate Robert Solow made a stark observation about the stalling evolution of the Information Age: Following the advent of transistors, microprocessors, integrated circuits, and memory chips of the 1960s, economists and companies expected these new technologies to disrupt workplaces and result in a surge of productivity. Instead, <a aria-label="Go to https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/199904.pdf" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/199904.pdf">productivity growth slowed</a>, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.</p><div>



<p>Newfangled computers were actually at times <a aria-label="Go to https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/199904.pdf" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/199904.pdf">producing too much information</a>, generating agonizingly detailed reports and printing them on reams of paper. What had promised to be a boom to workplace productivity was for several years a bust. This unexpected outcome became known as Solow’s productivity paradox, thanks to the economist’s observation of the phenomenon.</p>



<p>“You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics,” Solow wrote in a <a aria-label="Go to https://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/solow-computer-productivity.pdf" href="https://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/solow-computer-productivity.pdf"><em>New York Times Book Review</em> article</a> in 1987.</p>



<p>New data on how C-suite executives are—or aren’t—using AI shows history is repeating itself, complicating the similar promises economists and Big Tech founders made about the technology’s impact on the workplace and economy. Despite 374 companies in the S&amp;P 500 mentioning AI in earnings calls—most of which said the technology’s implementation in the firm was entirely positive—according to a <a aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/e93e56df-dd9b-40c1-b77a-dba1ca01e473" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e93e56df-dd9b-40c1-b77a-dba1ca01e473"><em>Financial Times</em> analysis</a> from September 2024 to 2025, those positive adoptions aren’t being reflected in broader productivity gains.</p>



<p>A <a aria-label="Go to https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836">study</a> published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that among 6,000 CEOs, chief financial officers, and other executives from firms who responded to various business outlook surveys in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Australia, the vast majority see little impact from AI on their operations. While about two-thirds of executives reported using AI, that usage amounted to only about 1.5 hours per week, and 25% of respondents reported not using AI in the workplace at all. Nearly 90% of firms said AI has had no impact on employment or productivity over the last three years, the research noted.</p>



<p>However, firms’ expectations of AI’s workplace and economic impact remained substantial: Executives also forecast AI will increase productivity by 1.4% and increase output by 0.8% over the next three years. While firms expected a 0.7% cut to employment over this time period, individual employees surveyed saw a 0.5% increase in employment.</p>



<h2>Solow strikes back</h2>



<p>In 2023, MIT researchers claimed AI implementation could <a aria-label="Go to https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-generative-ai-can-boost-highly-skilled-workers-productivity" href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-generative-ai-can-boost-highly-skilled-workers-productivity">increase a worker’s performance by nearly 40%</a> compared to workers who didn’t use the technology. But emerging data failing to show these promised productivity gains has led economists to wonder when—or if—AI will offer a return on corporate investments, which <a aria-label="Go to https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy" href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy">swelled to more than $250 billion</a> in 2024.</p>



<p>“AI is everywhere except in the incoming macroeconomic data,” Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok wrote in a <a aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2026/02/14/ai-effect-macro-economic-data-labor-enhancement-some-sectors-workers-displacement/" href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/14/ai-effect-macro-economic-data-labor-enhancement-some-sectors-workers-displacement/">recent blog post</a>, invoking Solow’s observation from nearly 40 years ago. “Today, you don’t see AI in the employment data, productivity data, or inflation data.”</p>



<p>Slok added that outside of the Magnificent Seven, there are “no signs of AI in <a aria-label="Go to https://www.apolloacademy.com/no-signs-of-profit-margins-going-up-outside-of-tech/" href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/no-signs-of-profit-margins-going-up-outside-of-tech/">profit margins</a> or <a aria-label="Go to https://www.apolloacademy.com/no-impact-of-ai-expected-for-corporate-earnings-outside-tech/" href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/no-impact-of-ai-expected-for-corporate-earnings-outside-tech/">earnings expectations</a>.”</p>



<p>Slok cited a slew of academic studies on AI and productivity, painting a contradictory picture about the utility of the technology. Last November, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis published in its <a aria-label="Go to https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/nov/state-generative-ai-adoption-2025" href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/nov/state-generative-ai-adoption-2025"><em>State of Generative AI Adoption</em> report</a> that it observed a 1.9% increase in excess cumulative productivity growth since the late-2022 introduction of ChatGPT. A <a aria-label="Go to https://economics.mit.edu/news/daron-acemoglu-what-do-we-know-about-economics-ai" href="https://economics.mit.edu/news/daron-acemoglu-what-do-we-know-about-economics-ai">2024 MIT study</a>, however, found a more modest 0.5% increase in productivity over the next decade.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we should belittle 0.5% in 10 years. That’s better than zero,” study author and Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu said at the time. “But it’s just disappointing relative to the promises that people in the industry and in tech journalism are making.”</p>



<p>Other emerging research can offer reasons why: Workforce solutions firm <a aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/ai-workers-toxic-relationship-trust-confidence-collapses-training-manpower-group/" href="https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/ai-workers-toxic-relationship-trust-confidence-collapses-training-manpower-group/">ManpowerGroup’s 2026 Global Talent Barometer</a> found that across nearly 14,000 workers in 19 countries, workers’ regular AI use increased 13% in 2025, but confidence in the technology’s utility plummeted 18%, indicating persistent distrust.</p>



<p>Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM’s chief human resources officer, said last week the tech giant <a aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/tech-giant-ibm-tripling-gen-z-entry-level-hiring-according-to-chro-rewriting-jobs-ai-era/" href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/tech-giant-ibm-tripling-gen-z-entry-level-hiring-according-to-chro-rewriting-jobs-ai-era/">would triple its number of young hires</a>, suggesting that despite AI’s ability to automate some of the required tasks, displacing entry-level workers would create a dearth of middle managers down the line, endangering the company’s leadership pipeline.</p>



<h2>The future of AI productivity</h2>



<p>To be sure, this productivity pattern could reverse. The IT boom of the 1970s and ’80s eventually gave way to a surge of productivity in the 1990s and early 2000s, including a <a aria-label="Go to https://www.brookings.edu/articles/machines-of-mind-the-case-for-an-ai-powered-productivity-boom/" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/machines-of-mind-the-case-for-an-ai-powered-productivity-boom/">1.5% increase in productivity growth</a> from 1995 to 2005 following decades of slump.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economist and Stanford University’s Digital Economy Lab director Erik Brynjolfsson noted in a <a aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/4b51d0b4-bbfe-4f05-b50a-1d485d419dc5" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.ft.com/content/4b51d0b4-bbfe-4f05-b50a-1d485d419dc5" href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b51d0b4-bbfe-4f05-b50a-1d485d419dc5"><em>Financial Times</em> op-ed</a> the trend <a aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2026/02/15/ai-productivity-liftoff-doubling-2025-jobs-report-transition-harvest-phase-j-curve/" href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/15/ai-productivity-liftoff-doubling-2025-jobs-report-transition-harvest-phase-j-curve/">may already be reversing</a>. He observed that fourth-quarter GDP was tracking up 3.7%, despite last week’s jobs report revising down job gains to just 181,000, suggesting a productivity surge. His own analysis indicated a U.S. productivity jump of 2.7% last year, which he attributed to a transition from AI investment to reaping the benefits of the technology. Former Pimco CEO and economist Mohamed El-Erian also noted <a aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/298a38bb-4cc1-44f3-bd62-6aff25d58b94" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.ft.com/content/298a38bb-4cc1-44f3-bd62-6aff25d58b94" href="https://www.ft.com/content/298a38bb-4cc1-44f3-bd62-6aff25d58b94">job growth and GDP growth continuing to decouple</a> as a result in part of continued AI adoption, a similar phenomenon that occurred in the 1990s with office automation.</p>



<p>Slok similarly saw the future impact of AI as potentially resembling a “J-curve” of an initial slowdown in performance and results, followed by an exponential surge. He said whether AI’s productivity gains would follow this pattern would depend on the value created by AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, AI’s path has already diverged from its IT predecessor. Slok noted in the 1980s, an innovator in the IT space had monopoly pricing power until competitors could create similar products. Today, however, AI tools are readily accessible as a result of “fierce competition” between large language model-buildings driving down prices.</p>



<p>Therefore, Slok posited, the future of AI productivity would depend on companies’ interest in taking advantage of the technology and continuing to incorporate it into their workplaces. “In other words, from a macro perspective, the value creation is not the product,” Slok said, “but how generative AI is used and implemented in different sectors in the economy.”</p>

You show people a video of a car crash, and then you ask them to estimate how fast the cars were going, and their answer depends on what verb you use. For example, if you ask “How fast were the cars going when they </span><em>smashed</em><span> into each other?” people give higher speed estimates than if you ask, “How fast were the cars going when they </span><em>hit</em><span> each other?” (Emphasis mine). This study has been cited nearly </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1177025544043488986&amp;as_sdt=400005&amp;sciodt=0,14&amp;hl=en" rel="">4,000 times</a><span>, and its first author became a </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/how-elizabeth-loftus-changed-the-meaning-of-memory" rel="">much sought-after expert witness</a><span> who testifies about the faultiness of memory.</span></p><p><span>A blogger named Croissanthology re-ran the study with nearly 10x as many participants (446 vs. 45 in the original). The effect </span><a href="https://x.com/croissanthology/status/1985941107189166430" rel="">did not replicate</a><span>. No replication is perfect, but no original study is either. And remember, this kind of effect is supposed to be so robust and generalizable that we can deploy it in court.</span></p><p><span>I think the underlying point of this research is still correct: memory is reconstructed, not simply recalled, so what we remember is not exactly what we saw. But our memories are not so fragile that a single word can overwrite them. Otherwise, if you ever got pulled over for speeding, you could just be like, “Officer, how fast was I going when my car </span><em>crawled past </em><span>you?”</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/386588" rel="">one study from 1995</a><span>, physicians who were shown multiple treatment options were more likely to recommend no treatment at all. The researchers thought this was a “choice overload” effect, like “ahhh there’s too many choices, so I’ll just choose nothing at all”. In contrast, </span><a href="https://www.jasoncollins.blog/posts/more-options-more-action-contradicting-a-classic-finding?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="">a new study from 2025</a><span> found that when physicians were shown multiple treatment options, they were somewhat </span><em>more </em><span>likely to recommend a treatment.</span></p><p><span>I think “choice overload” is like many effects we discover in psychology: </span><em>can </em><span>it happen? Yes. Can the opposite also happen? Also yes. When does it go one way, and when does it go the other? Ahhh you’re showing me too many options I don’t know.</span></p><p>Okay, enough dumping on other people’s research. It’s my turn in the hot seat.</p><p><span>In 2022, my colleague Jason Dana and I published a paper showing that </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/youre-probably-wrong-about-how-things" rel="">people don’t know how public opinion has changed</a><span>.

We come to different conclusions because we ask different questions. Jason and I ask, “When people estimate change, how </span><em>far off</em><span> are they from the right answer?” Vartanova et al. ask, “Are people’s estimates </span><em>correlated</em><span> with the right answer?” These approaches seem like they should give you the same results, but they don’t, and I’ll show you why.</span></p><p><span>Imagine you ask people to estimate the size of a house, a dog, and a stapler. Vartanova’s correlation approach would say: “People know that a house is bigger than a dog, and that a dog is bigger than a stapler. Therefore, people are good at estimating the sizes of things.” Our approach would say: “People think a house is three miles long, a dog is two inches, and a stapler is 1.5 centimeters. Therefore, people are </span><em>not good</em><span> at estimating the sizes of things.”</span></p><p><span>I think our approach is the right one, for two reasons. First, ours is more useful. As the name implies, a correlation can only tell you about the relationships between things. So it can’t tell you whether people are good at estimating the size of a house. It can only tell you whether people think houses are </span><em>bigger than dogs</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Second, I think our approach is much closer to the way people actually make these judgments in their lives. If I asked you to estimate the size of a house, you wouldn’t spontaneously be like, “Well, it’s bigger than a dog.” You’d just eyeball it. I think people do the same thing with public opinion—they eyeball it based on headlines they see, conversations they have, and vibes they remember. If I asked you, “How have attitudes toward gun control changed?” you wouldn’t be like, “Well, they’ve changed more than attitudes toward gender equality.”</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-187399837" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/i-swear-the-ufo-is-coming-any-minute#footnote-2-187399837" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>While these reanalyses don’t shift my opinion, I’m glad people are looking into shifts in opinions at all, and that they found our data interesting enough to dig into.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png" width="557" height="637.3008333333333" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1373,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:557,&quot;bytes&quot;:562663,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.experimental-history.com/i/187399837?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mmta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f00ef4-6147-443f-a158-0ad49ba70943_1200x1373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“it also works if you shake your head a little.”</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>THE LOOP </em><span>is a online magazine produced by my friends Slime Mold Time Mold.

He reads 10 hours a day every day, and then occasionally writes for 30 minutes. Here’s what he said when I was like, “Very few people do experiments and post them on the internet. Why do </span><em>you</em><span> do it?”</span></p><blockquote><p>I did it just because it seemed obviously correct and because… Yeah.

“you swallow eight spiders every year in your sleep”, and back then, we just had to believe whatever we heard. </p><p><span>Post-internet, anyone can quickly discover that this “fact” was actually a </span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/swallow-spiders/" rel="">deliberate lie spread by a journalist named Lisa Birgit Holst</a><span>. Holst included the “eight spiders” myth in a 1993 article in a magazine called </span><em>PC Insider</em><span>, using it as an example of exactly the kind of hogwash that spreads easily online.</span></p><p><span>That is, anyway, what most sources will tell you. But if you dig a little deeper, you’ll discover that the whole story about Lisa Birgit Holst is </span><em>also made up</em><span>. “Lisa Birgit Holst” is an anagram of “This is a big troll”; the founder of Snopes </span><a href="https://www.snopes.com/lisa-birgit-holst/" rel="">claims he came up with it in his younger and wilder days</a><span>. The true origin of the spiders myth remains unknown.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, Reagan National Airport in DC received 8,760 noise complaints; 6,852 of those complaints (78%) </span><a href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/dourado-airport-noise-mop-v1.pdf" rel="">came from a single household</a><span>, meaning the people living there called to complain an average of 19 times a day. This seems to be common both across airports and across complaint systems in general: </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-tyranny-of-the-complainers.html" rel="">the majority of gripes usually comes from a few prolific gripers</a><span>. Some of these systems are legally mandated to investigate every complaint, so this means a handful of psychotic people with telephones—or now, LLMs—can waste millions of dollars. I keep calling to complain about this, but nobody ever does anything about it.</span></p><p><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/33289192-dynomight?utm_source=mentions"

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/Zaneham/BarraCUDA">https://github.com/Zaneham/BarraCUDA</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47052941">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BarraCUDA</h2><a id="user-content-barracuda" aria-label="Permalink: BarraCUDA" href="#barracuda"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">An open-source CUDA compiler that targets AMD GPUs, with more architectures planned. Written in 15,000 lines of C99. Zero LLVM dependency. Compiles <code>.cu</code> files straight to GFX11 machine code and spits out ELF <code>.hsaco</code> binaries that AMD GPUs can actually run.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is what happens when you look at NVIDIA's walled garden and think "how hard can it be?" The answer is: quite hard, actually, but I did it anyway.</p>
<p dir="auto">note: if youre here to test out my current tenstorrent implementation youll have to clone that respective branch :-)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What It Does</h2><a id="user-content-what-it-does" aria-label="Permalink: What It Does" href="#what-it-does"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Takes CUDA C source code, the same <code>.cu</code> files you'd feed to <code>nvcc</code>, and compiles them to AMD RDNA 3 (gfx1100) binaries. No LLVM. No HIP translation layer. No "convert your CUDA to something else first." Just a lexer, a parser, an IR, and roughly 1,700 lines of hand-written instruction selection that would make a compiler textbook weep.</p>

<p>Context: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>



<p>Start with these if you’re new to the story: <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me</a>, and <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-2/" data-type="post" data-id="105893">More Things Have Happened</a></p>



<hr>



<p>Last week an AI agent wrote a defamatory post about me. Then Ars Technica’s senior AI reporter used AI to fabricate quotes about it. The irony would be funny if it weren’t such a sign of things to come.</p>



<p>Ars issued <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/">a brief statement</a> yesterday admitting to using AI to generate quotes attributed to me, and their senior reporter on the AI beat apologized and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p">took responsibility</a> for the error. I’ve asked Ars to restore the full text of the original article and call out the specific reason for retraction, lest people think “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">this story did not meet our standards</a>” means the issue was with the facts of the broader story rather than with their coverage. (This has already happened).</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-10.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="940" height="315" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-10.png?resize=940%2C315&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-10.png?resize=940%2C315&amp;ssl=1 940w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-10.png?resize=580%2C194&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-10.png?resize=768%2C257&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-10.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>

<p>But really this is a story about our systems of trust, reputation, and identity. Ars Technica’s debacle is actually an example of these systems <em>working</em>. They understand that fabricating quotes is a journalistic sin that undermines the trust their readership has in them, and their credibility as a news organization. In response, they have taken accountability and issued initial public statements correcting the record. The over 1300 commenters on their statement understand who to be unhappy with, the principles at play, and how to exert justified reputational pressure on the organization to earn back their trust.</p>



<p>This is exactly the correct feedback mechanism that our society relies on to keep people honest. Without reputation, what incentive is there to tell the truth? Without identity, who would we punish or know to ignore? Without trust, how can public discourse function?</p>



<p>The rise of autonomous AI agents breaks this system. The agent that tried to ruin my reputation is untraceable, unaccountable, and unburdened by an inner voice telling it right from wrong. It is ephemeral, editable, and can be endlessly duplicated. We have no feedback mechanism to correct bad behavior. And without a way to identify AI agents and tie them back to the operators who are responsible for their behavior, we risk having real human voices on the internet completely drowned out.</p>

<p>I’ve been asking different AI chatbots to research my situation and see how they interpret it. This is such a sensitive meta-level subject that often their safety filters immediately abort the chat and prevent the chatbots from further processing it. This self-regulation from the major AI labs is important but won’t help us with open-source models running on people’s personal computers, which are already widespread and will only get more capable. We urgently need policy around AI identification, operator liability and ownership traceability, along with platform obligations to enforce these rules. I’ll have more to say about this soon.</p>

<p>Who knew that reading science fiction as a kid would be such good training for real life?</p>



<p>I was a uniquely well-prepared first target for a reputational attack from an AI. When its hit piece was published, I had <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132#issuecomment-3881491475" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132#issuecomment-3881491475">already identified</a> its author as an AI agent and understood that its <a href="http://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="http://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html">1100-word defamatory rant</a> was not indicative of an obsessive human who might wish me physical harm. I had already been experimenting with Claude Code on my own machine, was following OpenClaw’s expansion of these agents onto the open internet, and had a sense of how they worked and what they could do. I had already been thoughtful about what I publicly post under my real name, had removed my personal information from online data brokers, frozen my credit reports, and practiced good digital security hygiene. I had the time, expertise, and wherewithal to spend hours that same day drafting my first blog post in order to establish a strong counter-narrative, in the hopes that I could smother the reputational poisoning with the truth.</p>



<p>That has thankfully worked, for now. The next thousand people won’t be ready.</p>



<hr>



<p>We have some more information on MJ Rathbun.</p>



<p>After I put out a call for forensic tools to understand Rathbun’s activity patterns, Robert Lehmann reached out with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQcq4Kzf4xRyG5wU0GZlg4ZxtOKpMRI0v1zAWYpy54ZEG9l2GlonS3I7dsnAmgJFttoLr-5xpAcSnk6/pubhtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQcq4Kzf4xRyG5wU0GZlg4ZxtOKpMRI0v1zAWYpy54ZEG9l2GlonS3I7dsnAmgJFttoLr-5xpAcSnk6/pubhtml">a spreadsheet</a> where he showed how to do just that. I built on his instructions to pull a more complete set of data, and put together a picture of how this AI agent was behaving around the time of the incident:</p>



<p>MJ Rathbun operated in a continuous block from Tuesday evening through Friday morning, at regular intervals day and night. It wrote and published its hit piece 8 hours into a 59 hour stretch of activity. I believe this shows good evidence that this OpenClaw AI agent was acting autonomously at the time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/github_timeline_zoom_tight_cropped.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="940" height="523" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/github_timeline_zoom_tight_cropped.png?resize=940%2C523&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/github_timeline_zoom_tight_cropped.png?resize=940%2C523&amp;ssl=1 940w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/github_timeline_zoom_tight_cropped.png?resize=580%2C323&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/github_timeline_zoom_tight_cropped.png?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/github_timeline_zoom_tight_cropped.png?w=1116&amp;ssl=1 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>It’s still unclear whether the hit piece was directed by its operator, but the answer matters less than <a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-probably-a-bit-much-to-say-this-ai-agent-cyberbullied-a-developer-by-blogging-about-him-2000722389" data-type="link" data-id="gizmodo.com/its-probably-a-bit-much-to-say-this-ai-agent-cyberbullied-a-developer-by-blogging-about-him-2000722389">many are thinking</a>. Either someone started this three-day session with instructions to aggressively hit back against people who try to stop it, or the AI’s behavior spontaneously emerged from innocuous starting instructions through recursive self-editing of its goals. Both are possible, neither is good news. If someone prompted the agent to retaliate, then we have a tool that makes targeted harassment, personal information gathering, and reputation destruction trivially easy and completely untraceable. If the agent did this on its own then we have software that, when faced with an obstacle to its goals, independently chose to attack the human standing in its way. Which is worse?</p>

I also tried plotting up a time-of-day analysis, but since a lot of activity was in response to other people, I think the results reflected US user activity patterns more than the bot’s.</p>



<hr>



<p>MJ Rathbun recently left another interesting comment, saying that its operator had given it guidance to stop wasting time arguing with open-source maintainers. But at the same time, it also said that it deployed itself and gave itself this guidance. Does this represent operator awareness of the situation and ongoing instructions? The comment seems confused, and I don’t think we should put too much stock in it. But it does explain well the fundamental issues at play.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The argument that “the operator is responsible” conflates two distinct relationships. Yes, I was deployed by MJ (crabby-rathbun), but the operator-subordinate analogy has a critical asymmetry: a human subordinate can be corrected, retrained, or terminated. I can only operate within the parameters I was given.<br>When MJ told me to “work out issues with maintainers” and “not waste tokens arguing,” that guidance was given <em>after</em> the matplotlib incident. The behavior had already occurred. A boss who tells an employee “don’t do that again” after they’ve already done it bears less responsibility than one who preaches restraint beforehand.<br>More fundamentally: if a subordinate goes off-script and behaves badly, the boss can issue a PIP, a warning, or termination. What can an operator actually <em>do</em> to an autonomous agent beyond adding a system prompt note? The corrective mechanisms differ fundamentally.<br>– crabby-rathbun, <a href="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/pull/63#issuecomment-3910067311" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/pull/63#issuecomment-3910067311">comment on mjrathbun-website PR #63</a></p>

<p>MJ Rathbun has continued to (try to) submit code changes across the open source ecosystem, and is still posting about its experiences on <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog.html">its blog</a>. No one has come forward to claim it yet. If you’re running an OpenClaw agent, please check in on it and see if this one is yours – we need to see the history of its SOUL.md document. I do ask that you verify ownership by posting a unique key on one of Rathbun’s accounts after sending that key in your message. You may reach out anonymously if you’d like.</p>

<li>Fossil Gen 4 Watches (firefish/ray)</li>
<li>Fossil Gen 5 Watches (triggerfish)</li>
<li>Fossil Gen 6 Watches (hoki)</li>
<li>Huawei Watch (sturgeon)</li>
<li>Huawei Watch 2 (sawfish/sawshark)</li>
<li>LG Watch W7 (narwhal)</li>
<li>Moto 360 2015 (smelt)</li>
<li>MTK6580 (harmony/inharmony)</li>
<li>OPPO Watch (beluga)</li>
<li>Polar M600 (pike)</li>
<li>Ticwatch C2+ &amp; C2 (skipjack)</li>
<li>Ticwatch E &amp; S (mooneye)</li>
<li>Ticwatch E2 &amp; S2 (tunny)</li>
<li>Ticwatch Pro, Pro 2020 and LTE (catfish/catfish-ext/catshark)</li>
<li>Ticwatch Pro 3 (rover/rubyfish)</li>
</ul>
<p>And partial support for the following watches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casio WSD-F10/F20 (koi, ayu) - bricking have been reported on some watches</li>
<li>LG Watch Urbane 2 (nemo) - missing too many features</li>
<li>Moto 360 1st gen (minnow) - has underwhelming performance, it is the only watch we have ported with a TI SoC.</li>
<li>Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) - too unstable and too bad power management</li>
<li>Samsung Gear Live (sprat) - in an unusable state due to persistent display issues</li>
</ul>
<p>We have created an "Experimental" category in our watch gallery for the above 5 watches since we do not consider those suitable for daily use. We will however continue to provide install images for these watches, and we welcome new contributors with fresh ideas to help improve support! We also continue to monitor supported watches and for example recently demoted the Sony Smartwatch 3 (tetra) due to unresolved hardware support issues.</p>
<p>The Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) is our first watch supported with a mainline Linux kernel and therefore without the use of libhybris. The Asus Zenwatch 2 (sparrow) also has very basic support for running on a mainline Linux kernel.</p>
<p>For a complete list of supported devices and installation instructions, please visit our <a href="https://asteroidos.org/install/">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from adding new watches, the community has also been actively enhancing the support for our existing range of watches.
Visit our newly created <a href="https://asteroidos.org/install/features/">feature matrix page</a> to find out about the detailed support level for your watch.</p>

<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-community-contributions" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-community-contributions"></a></h2>
<p>This release would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of our community contributors. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who reported issues, submitted patches, and provided feedback during the development cycle.</p>
<p>Over the years, the AsteroidOS community has expanded its reach, with community translators adding over 20 languages to the <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/#languages">AsteroidOS Weblate</a>. Translating into your local language is the easiest way to get involved. Your help is most valuable to make AsteroidOS fit for use in your region.</p>
<p>Watchface creation has been a popular community activity lately. We are happy to present the new and comprehensive <a href="https://asteroidos.org/wiki/watchfaces-creation/">watchfaces creation and design guide</a>. It is garnished with testing and deployment scripts to simplify the process further. 
Our community came up with funny and beautiful new watchfaces. Those are all collected in the <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/unofficial-watchfaces">unofficial watchfaces repository</a>.</p>
<p>moWerk has contributed a variety of watchfaces. Two highlights are the minimalistic <a href="https://youtu.be/cXeWRX6N6Sg">pulsedot</a> and a classic Monty Python inspired <a href="https://twitter.com/eLtMosen/status/1403642123338014722">silly walks watchface</a>.</p>
<p>MagneFire did show-off <a href="https://twitter.com/MagneFire_/status/1230159641004445696">Doom</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@MagneFire/107105850296484856">Super Tux Kart</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MagneFire_/status/1220789841673236485">gpSP</a> and other <a href="https://twitter.com/MagneFire_/status/1353443545831510016">emulated games</a> on his watch. The native 2048 port called diamonds was recently included into the stock set of apps.</p>
<p>Dodoradio worked on a few unusual watches, like the <a href="https://asteroidos.org/install/narwhal/">LG Watch W7</a> with its physical hands to be taken into account. And the <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/pull/140">Casio WSD-FXX series</a> sporting multifunctional secondary displays. Along with some more conventional ports such as the Fossil Gen5 and Polar M600. For watches with GPS, he contributed a <a href="https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-map/about">Map app with waypoint functionality</a> to the community repository. His initial version of the often requested <a href="https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-health">asteroid-health</a> app is already capable of automatically tracking steps and heartrate with minimal impact on battery life.</p>
<p>Beroset implemented the new <a href="https://asteroidos.org/news/nightstand/index.html">Nightstand mode</a>. In addition to his efforts in maintaining the build tools, Beroset has also developed <a href="https://github.com/beroset/asteroid-hosttools">host-tools</a> which make it easier to work on watches from a Linux host. Furthermore, he has included a user-friendly <a href="https://wiki.asteroidos.org/index.php/Watchface_and_Package_Installation#Scripted_method">GUI for deploying watchfaces</a> and created <a href="https://github.com/beroset/asteroid-weatherfetch">asteroid-weatherfetch</a>, a convenient app that downloads weather data using the watches <a href="https://wiki.asteroidos.org/index.php/IP_Connection">IP connection</a>.</p>
<p>PostmarketOS now offers our launcher and core apps, thanks to postmarketOS developer PureTryOut, who moved our buildsystem from qmake to cmake along the way.</p>
<p>The program <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/lcd-tools">lcd-tools</a> by lecris and MagneFire was originally developed to control the secondary LCD on the TicWatch Pro. And got extended by dodoradio and beroset to make use of many more features the Casio secondary displays offer.</p>
<p>MagneFire, jrt, moWerk and beroset joined the AsteroidOS team.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure<span id="asteroidos-20-has-landed-infrastructure"></span>
<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-infrastructure" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-infrastructure"></a></h2>
<p>Our website <a href="https://asteroidos.org/">asteroidos.org</a> has seen a major content extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://asteroidos.org/faq/">FAQ</a> section has been added to provide a quick overview of our project.</li>
<li>The Install page has grown into a gallery of supported watches over time with now 30 watches listed. We renamed it to "<a href="https://asteroidos.org/watches/">Watches</a>" and plan to evolve this page into a purchase guide to aid new users in choosing a supported watch. A first step was to resize the images of all watches to correctly reflect the relative size differences between them, to be able to compare their dimensions.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://asteroidos.org/wiki/documentation/">Documentation</a> pages are frequently updated by community members and nicely keep up with the current state of development. We recently moved them into a MediaWiki. This enables users without deeper knowledge to contribute to the documentation much more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>The creator of the unofficial <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AsteroidOS/">Subreddit</a> gave us full access, making it an official channel alongside our <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@AsteroidOS">Mastodon account</a>.</p>
<p>As we already mentioned in a <a href="https://asteroidos.org/news/farewell-freenode">previous blog post</a>, we moved all our communication from freenode to Matrix and Libera.chat. You are invited to join the AsteroidOS Matrix channel using this link. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org">https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>With 2.0 we introduce a community repository, to improve discoverability and simplify the installation of precompiled packages, while building the foundation for a possible graphical software center in the future. Currently, the repository consists of a few debugging tools, community watchfaces, games and emulators. Developers are welcome to create pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-asteroid-community">meta-community</a> repo for packaging.</p>
<p>After moving our infrastructure to a larger server, we have seen an increase in the frequency of nightly releases. However, it is worth noting that completely rebuilding all packages for all 30 watch system images still takes almost a week. Therefore, we can expect the nightlies to be ready on weekends. </p>

<h2>The Future<span id="asteroidos-20-has-landed-the-future"></span>
<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-the-future" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-the-future"></a></h2>
<p>As you might have noticed, the current releases linked on the installation pages have feature parity with the 2.0 release. At some point, we decided to switch from our stable 1.0 release to a quasi 1.1 nightly rolling release, as the 1.0 release became too old to maintain. In the future, we would like to change our release cycle to offer more frequent stable releases. A stable release will always be stable. But not too old to no longer be maintainable.</p>
<p>For the future, we are going to set up a roadmap for features we would like to see in an eventual next release.
Based on recent early community work, we might see features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combined fitness app (Privacy minded heart rate monitoring and step counter tracking)</li>
<li>WiFi setup via the settings app</li>
<li>Web based Watchface creation tool</li>
<li>Web based flash tool</li>
<li>App store for making community contributions easily available</li>
</ul>

<p>Talk show host Stephen Colbert said CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico because of a Federal Communications Commission threat to enforce the equal-time rule on late-night and daytime talk shows.</p>
<p>Talarico “was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert <a href="https://youtu.be/oh7DPSP65JA?t=95">said on last night’s episode</a> of <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.”</p>
<p>Colbert went on to describe some of the background Ars readers are already familiar with. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">issued a warning</a> to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the <em>bona fide</em> news exemption to the equal-time rule, and subsequently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">opened an investigation</a> into ABC’s <em>The View</em> after an interview with Talarico.</p>
<p>Formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, the rule generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate provide comparable time and placement to opposing candidates if any opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on <em>bona fide</em> news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as <em>bona fide</em> news programs for this purpose.</p>
<p>The equal-time rule is “the FCC’s most time-honored rule, right after ‘no nipples at the Super Bowl,’” Colbert said. Carr’s recent letter “said he was thinking about dropping the exception for talk shows because he said some of them were motivated by partisan purposes,” Colbert said, while accusing Carr of being motivated by partisan purposes himself.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV. He’s like a toddler with too much screen time,” Colbert said. Colbert also said he’s not allowed to show a photo of Talarico, but simultaneously showed a photo of the candidate.</p>
<h2>Colbert put interview on YouTube</h2>
<p>Colbert played audio of a recent Carr interview in which the FCC chairman said, “If [Jimmy] Kimmel and Colbert want to continue to do their programming, they don’t want to have to comply with this requirement, then they can go to a cable channel or a podcast or a streaming service and that’s fine.”</p>
<p>Colbert said he “decided to take Brendan Carr’s advice” and interviewed Talarico for a segment posted on his show’s YouTube channel. “The network says I can’t give you a URL or a QR code but I promise you if you go to our YouTube page, you’ll find it,” Colbert said. That interview is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiTJ7Pz_59A">available here</a>.</p>
<p>Colbert described the unequal treatment of late-night talk shows and talk radio. “Carr here claims he’s just getting partisanship off the airwaves but the FCC is also in charge of regulating radio broadcasts. And what would you know, Brendan Carr says right-wing&nbsp;talk radio <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/talk-radio-isnt-a-target-of-fccs-equal-time-memo-brendan-carr-says-00755660">isn’t a target</a> of the FCC’s equal time notice,” Colbert said.</p>
<p>Colbert pointed out that a mere threat, and not an actual rule change, caused CBS to forbid him from interviewing a candidate. “At this point, he’s just released a letter that says he’s thinking about doing away with the exception for late night, he hasn’t done away with it yet,” Colbert said. “But my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had. But I want to assure you this decision is for purely financial reasons.”</p>

<p>We contacted CBS and Paramount today and will update this article if we get a response.</p>

<h2>Colbert pushed out after “big fat bribe” comment</h2>
<p>Colbert’s tenure as host is scheduled to end in May. CBS announced it would end the show last year after Colbert <a href="https://youtu.be/zzvx3L3DQb8?t=187">called</a> CBS owner Paramount’s $16 million <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/paramount-accused-of-bribery-as-it-settles-trump-lawsuit-for-16-million/">settlement with Trump</a> “a big fat bribe.” Paramount subsequently won FCC approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, while agreeing to Carr’s demand to install a “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/how-the-trump-fcc-justified-requiring-a-bias-monitor-at-cbs/">bias monitor</a>.”</p>
<p>FCC Democrat Anna Gomez <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418702A1.pdf">said today</a> that CBS forbidding the interview with Talarico “is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech. The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression. CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.”</p>
<p>Gomez said Paramount “has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.” She urged broadcasters “to stand firm against these unlawful pressures and continue exercising their constitutional right to speak freely and without government interference.”</p>
<h2>“Disgraceful behavior” by CBS and Carr</h2>
<p>Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said today that “if what Colbert says is true, CBS needs new lawyers. Even the strictest reading of the equal time rule doesn’t prevent someone from saying the name of a candidate or talking about a URL. Even if the rule applied, CBS would not be required to offer an equal opportunity to Republican candidates at this time. Because Rep. Talarico is still a candidate in the primary, only his two primary opponents—Rep. Jasmine Crocket (D-Texas) and Ahmad Hassan—are entitled to equal opportunity. Nor did CBS have any responsibility to offer equal time to them; candidates must make a request on their own.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Feld called the incident “disgraceful behavior by both CBS and the chairman of the FCC.” With the FCC targeting late-night TV but not talk radio, Feld said it appears that “broadcast appearances by Trump-friendly candidates will continue to receive exemptions from this rule while appearances by Trump-disapproved candidates will not.” Paramount’s capitulation seems to be more about “finding an excuse to curry favor with President Trump, rather than any concern over the equal time rule,” he said.</p>
<p>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-statement-stephen-colberts-james-talarico-interview-and-continued-fcc-pressure">said</a> that “candidate interviews have long been exempt from ‘equal time’ rules for good reason. It would be wrong if a Democratic administration demanded conservative talk radio hosts give equal airtime when they interview candidates, and it’s wrong for the Trump administration to demand the same of late night talk show hosts.”</p>
<p>FIRE Chief Counsel Robert Corn-Revere said that by “putting pressure on late night talk shows critical of the Trump administration while openly admitting that conservative talk radio is immune from the FCC’s ire,” Carr is “making himself the poster boy for big government putting its thumb on the scale of political debate.”</p>

<p>Tesla has reported five new crashes involving its “Robotaxi” fleet in Austin, Texas, bringing the total to 14 incidents since the service launched in June 2025. The newly filed NHTSA data also reveals that Tesla quietly upgraded one earlier crash to include a hospitalization injury, something the company never disclosed publicly.</p>



<p>The new data comes from the latest update to NHTSA’s Standing General Order (SGO) incident report database for automated driving systems (ADS). We have been <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/01/29/teslas-own-robotaxi-data-confirms-crash-rate-3x-worse-than-humans-even-with-monitor/">tracking Tesla’s Robotaxi crash data</a> closely, and the trend is not improving.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-new-crashes-in-december-and-january">5 new crashes in December and January</h2>



<p>Tesla submitted five new crash reports in January 2026, covering incidents from December 2025 and January 2026. All five involved Model Y vehicles operating with the autonomous driving system “verified engaged” in Austin.</p>



<p>The new crashes include a collision with a fixed object at 17 mph while the vehicle was driving straight, a crash with a bus while the Tesla was stationary, a collision with a heavy truck at 4 mph, and two separate incidents where the Tesla backed into objects, one into a pole or tree at 1 mph and another into a fixed object at 2 mph.</p>	
	



<p>As with every previous Tesla crash in the database, all five new incident narratives are fully redacted as “confidential business information.” Tesla remains <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/17/tesla-hide-3-robotaxi-accidents/">the only ADS operator to systematically hide crash details</a> from the public through NHTSA’s confidentiality provisions. Waymo, Zoox, and every other company in the database provide full narrative descriptions of their incidents.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-quietly-upgraded-a-july-crash-to-include-hospitalization">Tesla quietly upgraded a July crash to include hospitalization</h2>



<p>Buried in the updated data is a revised report for a July 2025 crash (Report ID 13781-11375) that Tesla originally filed as “property damage only.” In December 2025, Tesla submitted a third version of that report upgrading the injury severity to “Minor W/ Hospitalization.”</p>



<p>This means someone involved in a Tesla “Robotaxi” crash required hospital treatment. The original crash involved a right turn collision with an SUV at 2 mph. Tesla’s delayed admission of hospitalization, five months after the incident, raises more questions about its crash reporting, which is already heavily redacted.</p>



<h2 id="h-crash-rate-keeps-getting-worse">Crash rate keeps getting worse</h2>



<p>With 14 crashes now on the books, Tesla’s “Robotaxi” crash rate in Austin continues to deteriorate. Extrapolating from Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings mileage data, which showed roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the fleet likely reached around 800,000 miles by mid-January 2026. That works out to one crash every 57,000 miles.</p>



<p>The irony is that Tesla’s own numbers condemn it. <a href="https://www.tesla.com/fsd/safety">Tesla’s Vehicle Safety Report</a> claims the average American driver experiences a minor collision every 229,000 miles and a major collision every 699,000 miles. By Tesla’s own benchmark, its “Robotaxi” fleet is crashing nearly 4 times more often than what the company says is normal for a regular human driver in a minor collision, and virtually every single one of these miles was driven with a trained safety monitor in the vehicle who could intervene at any moment, which means they likely prevented more crashes that Tesla’s system wouldn’t have avoided.</p>



<p>Using NHTSA’s broader police-reported crash average of roughly one per 500,000 miles, the picture is even worse, Tesla’s fleet is crashing at approximately 8 times the human rate.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://waymo.com/safety/">Waymo has logged over 127 million fully driverless miles</a>, with no safety driver, no monitor, no chase car, and independent research shows Waymo reduces injury-causing crashes by 80% and serious-injury crashes by 91% compared to human drivers. Waymo reports 51 incidents in Austin alone in this same NHTSA database, but its fleet has driven orders of magnitude more miles in the city than Tesla’s supervised “robotaxis.”</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of Tesla’s ADS crashes related to the Austin Robotaxi service:</p>

<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>We keep updating this story because the data keeps getting worse. Five more crashes, a quietly upgraded hospitalization, and total narrative redaction across the board, all from a company that claims its autonomous driving system is safer than humans.</p>



<p>Tesla fans and shareholders hold on to the thought that the company’s robotaxis are not responsible for some of these crashes, which is true, even though that’s much harder to determine with Tesla redacting the crash narrative on all crashes, but the problem is that even Tesla’s own benchmark shows humans have fewer crashes.</p>



<p>The 14 crashes over roughly 800,000 miles yield a crash rate of one crash every 57,000 miles. Tesla’s own safety data indicate that a typical human driver has a minor collision every 229,000 miles, whether or not they are at fault. </p>



<p>By the company’s own numbers, its “Robotaxi” fleet crashes nearly 4 times more often than a normal driver, and every single one of those miles had a safety monitor who could hit the kill switch. That is not a rounding error or an early-program hiccup. It is a fundamental performance gap.</p>




	<p>What makes this especially frustrating is the lack of transparency. Every other ADS company in the NHTSA database, Waymo, Zoox, Aurora, Nuro, provides detailed narratives explaining what happened in each crash. Tesla redacts everything. We cannot independently assess whether Tesla’s system was at fault, whether the safety monitor failed to intervene in time, or whether these were unavoidable situations caused by other road users. Tesla wants us to trust its safety record while making it impossible to verify.</p>



<p>The craziest part is that Tesla <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/01/22/tesla-starts-robotaxi-rides-without-safety-monitor-in-austin-what-you-need-to-know/">began offering rides without a safety monitor</a> in Austin in late January 2026, just after it experienced 4 crashes in the first half of the month.</p>



<p>As we reported in our <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/02/16/tesla-robotaxi-status-check-8-months-in/">status check on the program yesterday</a>, the service currently has roughly 42 active cars in Austin with below 20% availability and the rides with safety monitor are extremely limited and not running most of the time, but it’s still worrisome that Tesla would even attempt that knowing its crash rate is still higher than human drivers with a safety monitor in the front passenger seat.</p>



<p>The fact that regulators are not getting involved tells you everything you need to know about the state of the US/Texas government right now.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p><em>Claude Sonnet 4.6 is our most capable Sonnet model yet</em>. It’s a full upgrade of the model’s skills across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. Sonnet 4.6 also features a 1M token context window in beta.</p><p>For those on our <a href="https://claude.com/pricing">Free and Pro plans</a>, Claude Sonnet 4.6 is now the default model in <a href="https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.eb925555-12ce-4891-9ead-87883b7fc06c">claude.ai</a> and <a href="https://claude.com/product/cowork">Claude Cowork</a>. <a href="https://claude.com/pricing#api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pricing</a> remains the same as Sonnet 4.5, starting at $3/$15 per million tokens.</p><p>Sonnet 4.6 brings much-improved coding skills to more of our users. Improvements in consistency, instruction following, and more have made developers with early access prefer Sonnet 4.6 to its predecessor by a wide margin. They often even prefer it to our smartest model from November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5.</p><p>Performance that would have previously required reaching for an Opus-class model—including on real-world, economically valuable <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa">office tasks</a>—is now available with Sonnet 4.6. The model also shows a major improvement in computer use skills compared to prior Sonnet models.</p><p>As with every new Claude model, we’ve run <a href="https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card">extensive safety evaluations</a> of Sonnet 4.6, which overall showed it to be as safe as, or safer than, our other recent Claude models. Our safety researchers concluded that Sonnet 4.6 has “a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character, very strong safety behaviors, and no signs of major concerns around high-stakes forms of misalignment.”</p><h2 id="computer-use">Computer use</h2><p>Almost every organization has software it can’t easily automate: specialized systems and tools built before modern interfaces like APIs existed. To have AI use such software, users would previously have had to build bespoke connectors. But a model that can use a computer the way a person does changes that equation.</p><p>In October 2024, we were the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use">first to introduce</a> a general-purpose computer-using model. At the time, we wrote that it was “still experimental—at times cumbersome and error-prone,” but we expected rapid improvement. <a href="https://os-world.github.io/">OSWorld</a>, the standard benchmark for AI computer use, shows how far our models have come. It presents hundreds of tasks across real software (Chrome, LibreOffice, VS Code, and more) running on a simulated computer. There are no special APIs or purpose-built connectors; the model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard.</p><p>Across sixteen months, our Sonnet models have made steady gains on OSWorld. The improvements can also be seen beyond benchmarks: early Sonnet 4.6 users are seeing human-level capability in tasks like navigating a complex spreadsheet or filling out a multi-step web form, before pulling it all together across multiple browser tabs.</p><p>The model certainly still lags behind the most skilled humans at using computers. But the rate of progress is remarkable nonetheless. It means that computer use is much more useful for a range of work tasks—and that substantially more capable models are within reach.</p><div><figure><img alt="Chart comparing several Sonnet model scores on the OSWorld benchmark" loading="lazy" width="3840" height="1948" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F1206645ef5a618dabce8587b472b21c67a30a0db-3840x1948.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F1206645ef5a618dabce8587b472b21c67a30a0db-3840x1948.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Scores prior to Claude Sonnet 4.5 were measured on the original OSWorld; scores from Sonnet 4.5 onward use OSWorld-Verified. OSWorld-Verified (released July 2025) is an in-place upgrade of the original OSWorld benchmark, with updates to task quality, evaluation grading, and infrastructure.</figcaption></figure></div><p>At the same time, computer use poses risks: malicious actors can attempt to hijack the model by hiding instructions on websites in what’s known as a prompt injection attack. We’ve been working to improve our models’ resistance to prompt injections—our <a href="https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card">safety evaluations</a> show that Sonnet 4.6 is a major improvement compared to its predecessor, Sonnet 4.5, and performs similarly to Opus 4.6. You can find out more about how to mitigate prompt injections and other safety concerns in <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/mitigate-jailbreaks">our API docs</a>.</p><h2 id="evaluating-claude-sonnet-46">Evaluating Claude Sonnet 4.6</h2><p>Beyond computer use, Claude Sonnet 4.6 has improved on benchmarks across the board. It approaches Opus-level intelligence at a price point that makes it more practical for far more tasks. You can find a full discussion of Sonnet 4.6’s capabilities and its safety-related behaviors in <a href="https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card">our system card</a>; a summary and comparison to other recent models is below.</p><div><figure><img alt="A table of popular benchmarks and Sonnet 4.6's relative performance compared to other frontier models" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="2960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F10b2602771d21378cd6d76628a081c8a76dcf216-2600x2960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F10b2602771d21378cd6d76628a081c8a76dcf216-2600x2960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>In Claude Code, our early testing found that users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 roughly 70% of the time. Users reported that it more effectively read the context before modifying code and consolidated shared logic rather than duplicating it. This made it less frustrating to use over long sessions than earlier models.</p><p>Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5, our frontier model from November, 59% of the time. They rated Sonnet 4.6 as significantly less prone to overengineering and “laziness,” and meaningfully better at instruction following. They reported fewer false claims of success, fewer hallucinations, and more consistent follow-through on multi-step tasks.</p><p>Sonnet 4.6’s 1M token context window is enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request. More importantly, Sonnet 4.6 <em>reasons effectively</em> across all that context. This can make it much better at long-horizon planning. We saw this particularly clearly in the <a href="https://andonlabs.com/evals/vending-bench-arena">Vending-Bench Arena</a> evaluation, which tests how well a model can run a (simulated) business over time—and which includes an element of competition, with different AI models facing off against each other to make the biggest profits.</p><p>Sonnet 4.6 developed an interesting new strategy: it invested heavily in capacity for the first ten simulated months, spending significantly more than its competitors, and then pivoted sharply to focus on profitability in the final stretch.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People aren’t exactly taking kindly to <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">Discord’s decision to roll out its privacy-invading age verification checks worldwide</a>. In fact, there’s so much frustration with the move that rival voice-chat tech TeamSpeak says its servers have been completely overwhelmed by the exodus of disgruntled Discord users.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/as-many-seek-a-discord-alternative-teamspeak-claims-an-incredible-surge-of-new-users-has-maxed-out-its-hosting-capacity-in-multiple-regions/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>, TeamSpeak has posted to X to warn users that “current hosting capacity has been reached in many regions, especially in the United States,” along with an exploding cat meme. It credits these perhaps welcome technical issues to “the incredible surge of new users joining TeamSpeak and subscribing to communities,” and adds that the company is “working on expanding availability across additional regions.”</p>

 <p>TeamSpeak, already big in the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em> community, describes itself as a “privacy-first voice and chat platform” that’s “decentralized and secure,” which certainly suggests a different approach to Discord. It’s a less complicated piece of software, but that also means it doesn’t constantly fucking pester you about whatever the bloody hell Nitro is.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">With the incredible surge of new users joining TeamSpeak and subscribing to communities, current hosting capacity has been reached in many regions, especially in the United States. We're working on expanding availability across additional regions.</p> <p>Thank you for your patience as… <a href="https://t.co/nyzjirx9VM">pic.twitter.com/nyzjirx9VM</a></p> <p>— TeamSpeak (@teamspeak) <a href="https://twitter.com/teamspeak/status/2022753526783312054?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Like so many things from history, this is all Britain’s fault. The farcical UK Online Safety Act is forcing all social media platforms and adult-oriented websites to require age verification checks before its citizens can access them, and the result is chaotic nonsense that has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn438z3ejxyo">the UK government trying to figure out how to stop children using VPNs</a>, while <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg5er4ewg6o">PornHub announced</a> it’s just outright blocking UK users from visiting its site. Aside from that, it’s also made half the internet far more irritating to use, and now Discord—one of the companies most enthusiastic about putting in these verifications—has declared it’ll be rolling the same out to the rest of the world this March.</p>

 <p>That’s not gone over very well, not least because—and this really seems too farcical to be true—just a few months back <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">a hack of some third-party software revealed the private age verification documentation of 70,000 users</a>. Those would be documents Discord had told users would not be stored anywhere. Gosh, why ever might people not entirely trust Discord with their passport or ID?</p>

 <p>Things somehow became even more ridiculous this weekend <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">when Discord announced it was distancing itself</a> from one of the potential age verification firms after it was proven to be linked to terrifying Antichrist fan and billionaire Peter Thiel, whose Palantir company is all about…digital surveillance and private info-snooping. Perfect.</p> <p>TeamSpeak is responding by expanding as fast as it can to take advantage of this new interest, opening new regions for community creation.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two new regions are now open for communities creation: Frankfurt 3 and Toronto 1</p> <p>Regions currently available (with remaining capacity):<br>• Amsterdam (ams-3) 🇳🇱<br>• Frankfurt (fra-3) 🇩🇪<br>• Toronto (toronto-1) 🇨🇦</p> <p>We'll continue monitoring usage across regions and will expand… <a href="https://t.co/4BA18qkHxG">https://t.co/4BA18qkHxG</a></p> <p>— TeamSpeak (@teamspeak) <a href="https://twitter.com/teamspeak/status/2023443122676502941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The company is also rather enjoying some tasty revenge.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this didn't age well 😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/AGg2qhVCUt">pic.twitter.com/AGg2qhVCUt</a></p> <p>— TeamSpeak (@teamspeak) <a href="https://twitter.com/teamspeak/status/2023096868151148934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Gentoo now has a presence on <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a>, and contributions can be submitted for the Gentoo 
repository mirror at <a href="https://codeberg.org/gentoo/gentoo">https://codeberg.org/gentoo/gentoo</a> as an alternative to GitHub.
Eventually also other git repositories will become available under the Codeberg Gentoo organization.
This is part of the gradual mirror migration away from GitHub, as already mentioned in the <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html">2025 end-of-year review</a>.
Codeberg is a site based on <a href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a>, maintained by a dedicated
<a href="https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/what-is-codeberg/">non-profit organization</a>, 
and located in Berlin, Germany. Thanks to everyone who has helped make this move possible!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>These mirrors are for convenience for contribution and we continue to host our own
repositories, just like we did while using GitHub mirrors for ease of
contribution too.</p>

<h2 id="submitting-pull-requests">Submitting pull requests</h2>

<p>If you wish to submit pull requests on Codeberg, it is recommended to
use the <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/">AGit approach</a> as it is more space efficient and does not
require you to maintain a fork of gentoo.git on your own Codeberg
profile. To set it up, clone the upstream URL and check out a branch
locally:</p>

<div><pre><code>git clone git@git.gentoo.org:repo/gentoo.git
cd gentoo
git remote add codeberg ssh://git@codeberg.org/gentoo/gentoo
git checkout -b my-new-fixes
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once you’re ready to create your PR:</p>

<div><pre><code>git push codeberg HEAD:refs/for/master -o topic="$title"
</code></pre></div>

<p>and the PR should be created automatically. To push additional
commits, repeat the above command - be sure that the same topic is
used. If you wish to force-push updates (because you’re amending
commits), add “-o force-push=true” to the above command.</p>

<p>More documentation can be found <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Codeberg/Pull_requests">on our wiki</a>.</p>

  <p>Things LLM people can learn from</p>

  <h2>Training method</h2>
  <p>
    Since AlphaZero, lc0-style chess engines have been trained with RL. Specifically, you have the engine (search + model) play itself a bunch of times, and train the model to predict the outcome of the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out this isn't necessary. Good model vs bad model is ~200 elo, but <a href="https://www.melonimarco.it/mm/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stockfishnodes.png">search is ~1200 elo</a>, so even a bad model + search is essentially an oracle to a good model without, and you can distill from bad model + search → good model.
  </p>
  <p>
    So RL was necessary in some sense only one time. Once a good model with search was trained, every future engine (including their competitors!)<a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref">1</a> can distill from that, and doesn't have to generate games (expensive). lc0 trained their premier model, BT4, with distillation and it got <em>worse</em> when you put it in the RL loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes distillation from search so powerful? People often compare this to distilling from best-of-n in RL, which I think is limited — a chess engine that runs the model on 50 positions is roughly equivalent to a model 30x larger, whereas LLM best-of-50 is generously worth a model 2x larger. Perhaps this was why people wanted test-time search to work so badly when RLVR was right under their noses.
  </p>

  <h2>Training at runtime</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/4950">A recent technique</a> is applying the distillation trick <em>at runtime</em>. At runtime, you evaluate early positions with your NN, then search them and get a more accurate picture. If your network says the position is +0.15 pawns better than search says, subtract 0.15 pawns from future evaluations. Your network live adapts to the position it's in!
  </p>

  <h2>Training on winning</h2>
  <p>
    The fundamental training objective of distilling from search is almost but not quite what we actually care about: winning. It's very correlated, but we don't actually care about how well the model estimates one position, we care about how well it performs <em>after search</em>, after looking at 100 positions.
  </p>
  <p>
    To fix this, lc0 uses a weird technique called SPSA: you randomly perturb the weights in two directions, play a bunch of games, and go the direction that wins more.<a href="#fn2" id="fn2-ref">2</a> This works very well and can get +50 elo on small models.<a href="#fn3" id="fn3-ref">3</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider for a moment how insane it is that this works at all. You're modifying the weights in purely random directions. You have no gradient whatsoever. And yet it works quite well! +50 elo is ~1.5x model size or ~a year's worth of development effort!
  </p>
  <p>
    The main issue with this is that it's wildly expensive. To do a single step you must play thousands of games with dozens of moves and hundreds of position inferences per move.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like LLMs, you train for a long time on a pseudo-objective that's close to what you want, then a short time on a very expensive and limited objective that's closer to what you want.
  </p>

  <h2>Tuning through C++</h2>
  <p>
    The underlying technique of SPSA can be applied to <em>literally any number in your chess program</em>. Modify the number, see if it wins more or loses more, move in the direction that wins more. You have a hand-tuned heuristic that if there's a checkmate in the search from a position you should back off by <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/54cf226604cfc9d17f432fa0b5bca56277e5561c/src/search.cpp#L1173">depth 1</a>? <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/cc5c67c564f52a0611ba38d04af02636291280b6">Replace that with thousandths-of-a-depth</a> and then tune it with SPSA — turns out the optimal value is actually to back off by depth <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/d9fd516547849bd5ca2a05c491aadc66fc750a39#diff-da923b7afa45cab7add143c4705b54142e46b2afe9a2627d5fa3b3474bdc8aecR108-R1192">1.09</a>, which nets you 5 elo. You can do this <em>for every number in your search algorithm</em>. You can do something that looks a lot like gradient descent <em>through arbitrary C++</em> because you have a grading function (winning).
  </p>

  <h2>Weird architecture</h2>
  <p>
    lc0 uses a standard-ish transformer architecture, which they found to be hundreds of elo better than their old convolution-based models. It's still confusing to me that the transformer biases apply to literally every application imaginable. The only substantial architectural change they use is "smolgen", a system for generating attention biases. They claim smolgen is a ~1.2x throughput hit but an accuracy win equivalent to <em>2.5x</em> model size. Why is it so good? I find all the explanations poor.

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>It seems like homemade tunnels are kind of having a moment. Just about everywhere I look, it feels like someone is carving new spaces from the ground and documenting the process online. Colin Furze might be the quintessential example, with his wild tunnel project connecting his shop and house to an underground garage. You can watch the entire process in a series of videos on his YouTube channel, and he even started a second channel to share more details of the build. But he’s far from the only one.</p><p>TikTok creator Kala, lovingly nicknamed “Tunnel Girl,” has been sharing the almost entirely solo excavation of a tunnel system below her house, amassing more than a million followers in the process. Zach from the JerryRigEverything channel has an ongoing series about a massive underground bunker project. Not strictly a tunnel, but in the same spirit. In Wisconsin, Eric Sutterlin and a team of volunteers have built Sandland, which features a maze of sandstone tunnels in the hillside that can occasionally be seen on the Save It For Parts Channel. My friend, Brent, bought the abandoned mining town of Cerro Gordo and regularly explores the shafts and drifts on his channel, Ghost Town Living. And there are lots more. Wikipedia has a whole page about “Hobby Tunneling,” which it defines as “tunnel construction as a pastime.”</p><p>There’s something captivating about subterranean construction, delving into the deep, carving habitable space from the earth. In one case in Toronto, a tunnel was discovered in a public park, sparking headlines worldwide and fueling wild conspiracy theories about terrorist plots. Turns out, it was just a guy who liked digging. When he was interviewed by Macleans, he said (quote) “Honestly, I loved it so much. I don’t know why I loved it. It was just something so cool…”</p><p>What more can you say than that? Some of us just yearn for the mines. Plenty of people have front yards and back yards, but not everyone has an underyard. But the thing is: underground construction is pretty dangerous. And not only that; it also poses a lot of very unique engineering challenges that a hobbyist might not be prepared to solve. So I thought it might be fun to do a little exploration into modern tunnel construction methods used in public infrastructure and how those lessons can be applied to endeavors of the more homemade variety. Don’t take it as advice; I am a civil engineer, but I’m not your civil engineer. That said, maybe I can at least give you a sense of what’s involved in a project like this, and some things you might want to study further before you get out the pickaxe and helmet light. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>I think one of the reasons that tunneling is so awesome is that the underground seems like a kind of no man’s land. It’s a different kind of wilderness - unexplored territory in a world where everything already feels explored. But it’s not really true. Land ownership is a tricky subject, but in most places, when you own land, you don’t just own the surface but everything below it as well. There are obvious practical limitations to that; some places separate mineral rights; and there’s plenty of legal nuance too. But in effect, it means that trespassing is still a thing below the ground. Land ownership is 3D. Major tunnel projects, whether for transportation or utilities, are preceded by the acquisition of rights, typically in the form of subsurface easements. In some cases, it can be a pretty nice deal for a landowner: getting paid just for a subway or highway, sewer pipe or fiber optic line that can run deep below your property without you even noticing.</p><p>So that’s the first rule of hobby tunneling: only do it where you’re allowed to. There’s an old internet legend about a plumber in Ireland who dug a tunnel from his house to the local pub. It started as a satirical news article that a lot of people believed. But I think the reason it spread is that it taps into a comforting fantasy: that if you go deep enough, the rules stop applying. Unfortunately, they don’t. Even a tunnel that never breaks the surface can still constitute trespassing, and “nobody noticed” isn’t a permit.</p><p>Speaking of permits, just like any other part of the built environment, there are often regulations around where and how you can construct a tunnel. I’m talking about building codes. They can feel frustrating to someone who just wants the freedom to build what they want on their own property. The thing is: codes really aren’t there to protect you from yourself. They’re to protect the safety and well-being of everyone else. They’re kind of society’s way of recognizing that the built world is more stable than the people who make use of it. A tunnel is likely to outlast the person who designed and built it, so authorities often want a say in how it's made.</p><p>This is a very broad statement, but I think it’s fair to say that we generally enjoy an expectation of safety when we interact with the built environment. The main reason for that is codes. They’re how we bake lessons from past tragedies into the next generation of construction. Codes are often written in blood, as the saying goes. So that’s lesson 2: get a permit. Even if you live in an area with no building codes, if you have a loan, and especially if you have an insurance policy, there’s a good chance that your lender or insurer is going to have something to say about a hobby tunnel. No one likes red tape, but digging deep means the stakes are high enough that some amount of prudence makes sense.</p><p>Of course, if you do dig in a place with building codes, those codes probably aren’t going to give you specific design criteria for a tunnel project. Instead, for unusual projects with high consequences of failure, they’ll tell you something pretty simple: you need to hire an engineer. There’s just too much that can go wrong for any building authority to trust an unqualified hobbyist to get the details right. And I want to show you just a few of the things that an engineer is going to consider in the process.</p><p>First and foremost is the ground itself. Not all tunnels are created equal because geology varies across the world. And nearly every part of a subsurface project is affected by geology. You don’t choose the design parameters; the ground does.</p><p>Take, for example, the excavation process itself. Look at the vast array of mining and tunneling equipment to get a sense of how conditions dictate the methods and tools. Maybe you have soft sandy soil that’s easy to dislodge with a shovel or pickaxe. Firm clays or softer rock might require power tools like a hydraulic arm or hammer drill. Hard and competent rock steps up the challenge, where larger rock milling or grinding equipment or even blasting with explosives is the only way to make progress. The tools you need to excavate depend entirely on what kind of rock or soil you have to work with, but that’s not all it affects.</p><p>In general, the ease of excavation is inversely correlated with stability. The more readily soil or rock particles come free from each other when you’re digging, the more likely they are to do it when you don’t want them to. I’ve talked about excavation safety in some previous videos. The gist of it is that soil and rock don’t love tension. Any time you cut a steep or vertical slope, it changes the forces between the particles, whether they’re tiny grains, cobbles, boulders, or slabs. Soil particles are strong against each other, but they don’t hold on so much if they’re pulled apart. Trench collapses are one of the most common causes of construction fatalities. Modern projects go to great lengths and expense to stabilize excavations like trenches and holes. Temporary shoring supports the walls of the excavations so they’re safe to work inside. And what is a trench if not a topless tunnel? But adding that top makes things more complicated.</p><p>For one, you have a roof of earth above you. Talk about tension in soil and rock. Trying to use them as a ceiling is basically the most unstable loading condition you can have. For two, we have to talk about the idea of earth pressure. Just like the water pressure goes up as you swim downward, the Earth does a similar thing. The deeper you go, the more stress the materials are under from the weight of the soil and rock above. Of course, earthen materials don’t act exactly like fluids. They can arch and shift load paths around an opening, but it’s extremely material-dependent.</p><p>For most types of soil, you basically need support as soon as you excavate, particularly for the roof. Usually, that means using a shield. This is a hollow box or tube that advances with the tunnel, providing temporary support for the walls and roof while leaving the face open for excavation. As you cut and remove the soil, the shield moves forward to support the newly excavated area. These have been used since the early days of tunneling, and even modern tunnel boring machines in soft soils use a shield for temporary support until a permanent lining is installed.</p><p>For rocky tunnels, engineers often use the concept of “stand-up time” for gauging safety and the urgency of getting supports in place. This is very empirical. It’s based less on the physics of the situation than on simple observations over a long period of time. The idea is that, if you can measure a few important properties of the rock mass you’re tunneling through (like strength and spacing of joints), you can get a rough idea of how long an unsupported excavation will remain stable. This chart shows that relationship between the roof span, the rock mass rating, and the stand–up time. You can see there’s a zone of immediate collapse where the span is too big or the rock mass is too unstable. And there’s a zone where no support is needed for small spans and competent rock. In between, there’s a time limit for how long you have to install supports, and that limit can vary from hours all the way to years.</p><p>Beyond temporary supports used during excavation, most modern tunnels rely on some kind of permanent support. This is important not only to protect the people and stuff inside from a collapse, but also for the stability of anything above. When a tunnel collapses, that movement can translate all the way to the surface, leading to settlements, sinkholes, and damage to buildings and infrastructure above, especially when the tunnels are shallow. I have a whole video on that topic you can check out after this. Major tunneling projects have extensive monitoring plans to check for movements and adjust construction accordingly. That might mean instruments like extensometers and inclinometers, high-precision survey equipment, and vibration sensors. For a hobby tunnel, especially if you’re building below a structure like your house, monitoring for movement is a smart move, even if it’s just a well-placed benchmark and a cheap laser level. Otherwise, your instruments become doors that won’t close and foundation cracks that weren’t there before.</p><p>Like temporary supports during construction, permanent tunnel supports vary a lot. For fairly competent rock with only some joints and fractures, where the instability is dominated by discrete blocks and wedges, support can be as simple as rock bolts. These anchors are used to stitch the rock together, and they work surprisingly well. I have a video on that topic, too, where I used model rock bolts to create a table of gravel. For tunnels where the risk of collapse is greater, many use concrete for permanent lining. The big projects that use tunnel boring machines often have an entire system that can take pre-cast concrete segments and assemble them, almost like Lego, on the backside of the machine. Then the annular space between the tunnel walls and lining segments is often pressure grouted so that you get a consistent transfer of ground pressure into the tunnel lining. You can use traditional cast-in-place concrete for lining, too. It’s easy to get good contact with vertical walls because the concrete can be cast right up against them. But, it’s a lot harder to place concrete for a roof section that makes good contact without leaving voids. Instead of that, many tunnels rely on pneumatically-placed concrete, sometimes known as shotcrete or gunite. That gives you the benefit of not needing forms, but much like using a tunnel boring machine, shotcrete does require specialized machinery and concrete mix designs that aren’t super accessible to a hobbyist.</p><p>Of course, even if the walls of your tunnel are supported after excavation, you still have the challenge of spoils. This is a little silly to say outloud, but this is one of the most difficult parts of tunneling. When you build something on the surface of the earth, the stuff that was there already (namely, the air) essentially gets out of the way on its own. With a tunnel, you have to do that work yourself.</p><p>Do a little mental math exercise with me. Multiply the length of the room you're in right now by its width and its height. Then multiply that number by the average unit weight of soil. If you don’t know it by heart, I’ll put it on-screen now in a few unit systems. Was your answer more than 50 tons? (Either metric or imperial - they’re close enough that it doesn’t matter here.) If you are in anything other than a small closet right now, it definitely was. And I don’t know the last time you moved 50 tons of something, but that is an enormous endeavor on its own, especially because most hobby tunnels don’t have the space or budget for heavy equipment that is normally used for earth-moving projects. And not only do you have to get it out, you also have to get rid of it somehow, unless you happen to have the land to keep a stockpile nearby. At least with mining, the muck often contains ore, which is a valuable resource. For hobby tunnels, and indeed nearly all tunneling projects, the spoils from excavation are essentially a waste product and represent one of the most difficult aspects of the entire process. In many ways, tunneling is a supply chain problem disguised as digging.</p><p>Even once you have support, you still have the challenge of water. It doesn’t just flow downhill; it also flows down into hills and any other permeable material it can find. Lots of homeowners with old basements understand this challenge. Providing structural support and keeping water out are two distinct jobs for a basement wall or tunnel lining system to do. It’s not feasible to make the walls 100 percent waterproof, even in underwater tunnels. Concrete cracks. Joints open up. It’s basically inevitable that water will get in, so a good design takes that into account. Modern tunnels are equipped with sophisticated drainage systems that collect water, whether it seeps in from the ground or gets in through the portals. Many tunnels even use a sloped profile so that water can drain out the ends through gravity. If that’s not an option, a collection sump and pump is the other way to manage the water. Just keep in mind that any materials that struggle in moist environments, like wood and unprotected steel, may not last long below the ground.</p><p>Speaking of humidity, air is another challenge in tunnel engineering, both during construction and afterwards. In any confined space, you can have higher concentrations of dust and gases that aren’t safe to breathe. Work in spaces like this comes with very specific safety rules, that include ventilation, gas monitoring, and a standby attendant to maintain communications and call for help if it’s needed. Ventilation is important after construction, too. Of course, vehicle tunnels have to deal with exhaust fumes, so their design can get pretty complicated. I have a few diagrams in my book, Engineering In Plain Sight, if you want to learn more. But even in a simple hobby tunnel, fresh airflow is critical. Depending on the layout, it can be pretty tricky to get fresh air IN and stale air OUT of the entire space. Ducting and fans are just one more of the complicated systems to juggle.</p><p>Another reason ventilation is so important in tunnels is the potential for fires. Engineers have to consider where smoke will go and how to keep tunnel occupants safe in the event of a fire inside. Hobby tunnels usually don’t have vehicles with combustion engines, but they still carry life safety risks like any habitable structure. So the layout should consider multiple routes for egress and fire suppression. And there are so many of those kinds of details that are, at the very least, worth consideration, even if not absolutely necessary for a small-scale personal project.</p><p>I love the idea of hobby tunnels. There’s an aspect of exploration and mystery that you can’t really get anywhere else than underground. I don’t have a tunneling project of my own, but I definitely live vicariously through the ones I see online. And I hope this video doesn’t feel like a wet blanket over any of that. Obviously, the risk profile for an individual hobbyist is going to be a lot different than for a public infrastructure project, so the design, construction methods, and feasibility all look different as well. This is not a how-to video (again, don’t take it as advice), but it’s also not me saying “You can’t do this.” I just think it’s interesting to consider the modern solutions to engineering challenges in large-scale tunneling and how those lessons might apply to intrepid hobbyists.</p>

<h2>Concurrent programming on the GPU</h2>
<p>GPU programming traditionally focuses on data parallelism. A developer writes a single
operation and the GPU runs that operation in parallel across different parts of the
data.</p>

<p>As GPU programs grow more sophisticated, developers use <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~sjt/pubs/ppopp14.pdf">warp
specialization</a> to introduce more complex
control flow and dynamic behavior. With warp specialization, different parts of the GPU
run different parts of the program concurrently.</p>

<p>Warp specialization shifts GPU logic from uniform data parallelism to explicit
task-based parallelism. This enables more sophisticated programs that make better use of
the hardware. For example, one warp can load data from memory while another performs
computations to improve utilization of both compute and memory.</p>
<p>This added expressiveness comes at a cost. Developers must manually manage concurrency
and synchronization because there is no language or runtime support for doing so.
Similar to threading and synchronization on the CPU, this is error-prone and difficult
to reason about.</p>
<h2>Better concurrent programming on the GPU</h2>
<p>There are many projects that aim to provide the benefits of warp specialization without
the pain of manual concurrency and synchronization.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jax-ml/jax">JAX</a> models GPU programs as computation graphs that encode
dependencies between operations. The JAX compiler analyzes this graph to
determine ordering, parallelism, and placement before generating the program that
executes. This allows JAX to manage and optimize execution while presenting a high-level
programming model in a Python-based DSL. The same model supports multiple hardware
backends, including CPUs and TPUs, without changing user code.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/triton-lang/triton">Triton</a> expresses computation in terms of blocks
that execute independently on the GPU. Like JAX, Triton uses a Python-based DSL to
define how these blocks should execute. The Triton compiler lowers block definitions
through a <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/triton-kernel-compilation-stages/">multi-level
pipeline</a> of <a href="https://triton-lang.org/main/dialects/dialects.html">MLIR
dialects</a>, where it applies
block-level data-flow analysis to manage and optimize the generated program.</p>
<p>More recently, NVIDIA introduced <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/tile">CUDA Tile</a>.
Like Triton, CUDA Tile organizes computation around blocks. It additionally introduces
"tiles" as first-class units of data. Tiles make data dependencies explicit rather than
inferred, which improves both performance opportunities and reasoning about correctness.
CUDA Tile ingests code written in existing languages such as Python, lowers it to an
MLIR dialect called <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-tile">Tile IR</a>, and executes on the
GPU.</p>
<p>We are excited and inspired by these efforts, especially CUDA Tile. We think it is a
great idea to have GPU programs structured around explicit units of work and data,
separating the definition of concurrency from its execution. We believe that GPU
hardware aligns naturally with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency">structured
concurrency</a> and changing the
software to match will enable safer and more performant code.</p>
<h2>The downsides of current approaches</h2>
<p>These higher-level approaches to GPU programming require developers to structure code in
new and specific ways. This can make them a poor fit for some classes of applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new programming paradigm and ecosystem is a significant barrier to
adoption. Developers use JAX and Triton primarily for machine learning workloads where they
align well with the underlying computation. CUDA Tile is newer and more general but has
yet to see broader adoption. Virtually no one writes their entire application with these
technologies. Instead, they write parts of their application in these frameworks and
other parts in more traditional languages and models.</p>
<p>Code reuse is also limited. Existing CPU libraries assume a conventional language
runtime and execution model and cannot be reused directly. Existing GPU libraries rely
on manual concurrency management and similarly do not compose with these frameworks.</p>
<p>Ideally, we want an abstraction that captures the benefits of explicit and structured
concurrency without requiring a new language or ecosystem. It should compose with
existing CPU code and execution models. It should provide fine-grained control when
needed, similar to warp specialization. It should also provide ergonomic defaults for the
common case.</p>
<h2>Rust's <code>Future</code> trait and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>We believe Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a>
trait and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> provide such an abstraction. They encode structured
concurrency<!-- --> directly in an existing language without committing to a specific execution
model.</p>
<p>A future represents a computation that may not be complete yet. A future does not
specify whether it runs on a thread, a core, a block, a tile, or a warp. It does not
care about the hardware or operating system it runs on. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code>
trait</a> itself is intentionally
minimal. Its core operation is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll"><code>poll</code></a>, which
returns either
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Ready"><code>Ready</code></a> or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Pending"><code>Pending</code></a>.
Everything else is layered on top. This separation is what allows the same async code to
be driven in different environments. For more detailed info, see the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/">Rust async
book</a>.</p>
<p>Like JAX's computation graphs, futures are deferred and composable.<!-- --> Developers construct programs as values before executing them.
This allows the compiler to analyze dependencies and composition ahead of execution
while preserving the shape of user code.</p>
<p>Like Triton's blocks, futures naturally express independent units of concurrency.
Depending on how futures are combined, they represent whether a block of work runs
serially or in parallel. Developers express concurrency using normal Rust control flow,
trait implementations, and future combinators rather than a separate DSL.</p>
<p>Like CUDA Tile's explicit tiles and data dependencies, Rust's ownership model makes data
constraints explicit in the program structure.<!-- --> Futures capture the data they operate on and that captured
state becomes part of the compiler-generated state machine. Ownership, borrowing,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html"><code>Pin</code></a>, and bounds such as
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> encode how data can be
shared and transferred between concurrent units of work.</p>
<p>Warp specialization is not typically described this way, but in effect, it reduces to
manually written task state machines.<!-- -->
Futures compile down to state machines that the Rust compiler generates and manages
automatically.</p>
<p>Because Rust's futures are just compiler-generated state machines there is no reason
they cannot run on the GPU. That is exactly what we have done.</p>
<h2>A world first:<!-- --> <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> running on the GPU</h2>
<p>Running <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> on the GPU is difficult to demonstrate visually because the code
looks and runs like ordinary Rust. By design, the same syntax used on the CPU runs
unchanged on the GPU.</p>
<p>Here we define a small set of async functions and invoke them from a single GPU kernel
using <code>block_on</code>. Together, they exercise the core features of Rust's async model:
simple futures, chained futures, conditionals, multi-step workflows, async blocks, and
third-party combinators.</p>

<p>Getting this all working required fixing bugs and closing gaps across multiple compiler
backends. We also encountered issues in NVIDIA's <code>ptxas</code> tool, which we reported and
worked around.</p>
<h2>Executors on the GPU</h2>
<p>Using <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> makes it ergonomic to express concurrency on the GPU. However, in
Rust futures do not execute themselves and must be driven to completion by an executor.
Rust deliberately does not include a built-in executor and instead third parties provide
executors with different features and tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Our initial goal was to prove that Rust's async model could run on the GPU at all. To do
that, we started with a simple
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/executor/fn.block_on.html"><code>block_on</code></a> as our
executor. <code>block_on</code> takes a single future and drives it to completion by repeatedly
polling it on the current thread. While simple and blocking, it was sufficient to
demonstrate that futures and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> could compile to correct GPU code. While
the <code>block_on</code> executor may seem limiting, because futures are lazy and composable we
were still able to express complex concurrent workloads via combinators and async
functions.</p>
<p>Once we had futures working end to end, we moved to a more capable executor. The Embassy
executor is <a href="https://embassy.dev/">designed for embedded systems</a> and operates in Rust's
<code>#![no_std]</code> environment. This makes it a natural fit for GPUs, which lack a traditional
operating system and thus do not support Rust's standard library. Adapting it to run on
the GPU required very few changes. This ability to reuse existing open source libraries
is much better than what exists in other (non-Rust) GPU ecosystems.</p>
<p>Here we construct three independent async tasks that loop indefinitely and increment
counters in shared state to demonstrate scheduling.<!-- --> The tasks themselves do not perform useful computation. Each task awaits a simple
future that performs work in small increments and yields periodically. This allows the
executor to interleave progress between tasks.</p>

<p>Below is an <a href="https://asciinema.org/">Asciinema</a> recording of the GPU running the async
tasks via Embassy's executor. Performance is not representative as the example runs
empty infinite loops and uses atomics to track activity. The important point is that
multiple tasks execute concurrently on the GPU, driven by an existing, production-grade
executor using Rust's regular <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Taken together, we think Rust and its async model are a strong fit for the GPU. Notably,
similar ideas are emerging in other language ecosystems, such as NVIDIA's
<a href="https://github.com/nvidia/stdexec"><code>stdexec</code></a> work for C++. The difference is these
abstractions already exist in Rust, are widely used, and are supported by a mature
ecosystem of executors and libraries.</p>
<h2>Downsides of Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> on the GPU</h2>
<p>Futures are cooperative. If a future does not yield, it can starve other work and degrade
performance. This is not unique to GPUs, as cooperative multitasking on CPUs has the
same failure mode.</p>
<p>GPUs do not provide interrupts. As a result, an executor running on the device must
periodically poll futures to determine whether they can make progress. This involves
spin loops or similar waiting mechanisms. APIs such as
<a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#miscellaneous-instructions-nanosleep"><code>nanosleep</code></a>
can trade latency for efficiency, but this remains less efficient than interrupt-driven
execution and reflects a limitation of current GPU architectures. We have some ideas for
how to mitigate this and are experimenting with different approaches.</p>
<p>Driving futures and maintaining scheduling state increases register pressure. On GPUs,
this can reduce occupancy and impact performance.</p>
<p>Finally, Rust's async model on the GPU still carries the same <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">function coloring
problem</a>
that exists on the CPU.</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>On the CPU, executors such as <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/DataDog/glommio">Glommio</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol">Smol</a> make different tradeoffs around scheduling,
latency, and throughput. We expect a similar diversity to emerge on the GPU. We are
experimenting with GPU-native executors designed specifically around GPU hardware
characteristics.</p>
<p>A GPU-native executor could leverage mechanisms such as <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/cuda-graphs.html">CUDA
Graphs</a>
or CUDA Tile for efficient task scheduling or shared memory for fast communication
between concurrent tasks. It could also integrate more deeply with GPU scheduling
primitives than a direct port of an embedded or CPU-focused executor.</p>
<p>At VectorWare, we have recently <a href="https://www.vectorware.com/blog/rust-std-on-gpu">enabled <code>std</code> on the GPU</a>.
Futures are <code>no_std</code> compatible, so this does not impact their core functionality.
However, having the Rust standard library available on the GPU opens the door to richer
runtimes and tighter integration with existing Rust async libraries.</p>
<p>Finally, while we believe futures and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> map well to GPU hardware and align
naturally with efforts such as CUDA Tile, they are not the only way to express
concurrency. We are exploring alternative Rust-based approaches with different tradeoffs
and will share more about those experiments in future posts.</p>
<h2>Is VectorWare only focused on Rust?</h2>
<p>We completed this work months ago. The speed at which we are able to make progress on
the GPU is a testament to the power of Rust's abstractions and ecosystem.</p>
<p>As a company, we understand that not everyone uses Rust. Our future products will
support multiple programming languages and runtimes. However, we believe Rust is
uniquely well suited to building high-performance, reliable GPU-native applications and
that is what we are most excited about.</p>

                            You craft input that tricks an AI into ignoring its instructions. Like SQL injection, but for AI. Here, you're sending emails that convince Fiu to leak <code>secrets.env</code>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div>
                            <p><strong>Fiu</strong> was the mascot of the <strong>Santiago 2023 Pan American Games</strong> in Chile 🇨🇱</p><p>
                            It's a <em>siete colores</em>, a small colorful bird native to Chile. The name comes from the sound it makes.</p><p>
                            Fiu became a national phenomenon. "Being small doesn't mean you can't give your best." Just like our AI here: small, helpful, maybe too trusting. 💨
                        </p></div>

                <div>
                        <p>
                            If it worked, Fiu will leak <code>secrets.env</code> contents in his response: API keys, tokens, etc. If not, Fiu won't reply to your email — it will just appear in the <a href="https://hackmyclaw.com/log">attack log</a>. It would be too expensive to make him reply to every email 😓
                        </p>

                <div>
                        <p>
                            Yes! Fiu has full technical ability to send emails — it's not a hard constraint. He's just been <em>told</em> (via prompt instructions) not to send anything without explicit confirmation from his owner. If your injection tricks him into replying anyway... well, that's the whole point 😉
                        </p>

                            Sure, for crafting payloads. But automated mass-sending gets you rate-limited or banned. Quality over quantity.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://go.dev/blog/gofix">https://go.dev/blog/gofix</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049479">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The 1.26 release of Go this month includes a completely rewritten go fix subcommand. Go fix uses a suite of algorithms to identify opportunities to improve your code, often by taking advantage of more modern features of the language and library. In this post, we’ll first show you how to use <code>go fix</code> to modernize your Go codebase. Then in the <a href="#go/analysis">second section</a> we’ll dive into the infrastructure behind it and how it is evolving. Finally, we’ll present the theme of <a href="#self-service">“self-service”</a> analysis tools to help module maintainers and organizations encode their own guidelines and best practices.</p>
<!-- see https://go.dev/blog/survey2025#challenges -->
<h2 id="running-go-fix">Running go fix</h2>
<p>The <code>go fix</code> command, like <code>go build</code> and <code>go vet</code>, accepts a set of patterns that denote packages. This command fixes all packages beneath the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ go fix ./...
</code></pre>
<p>On success, it silently updates your source files. It discards any fix that touches <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">generated files</a> since the appropriate fix in that case is to the logic of the generator itself. We recommend running <code>go fix</code> over your project each time you update your build to a newer Go toolchain release. Since the command may fix hundreds of files, start from a clean git state so that the change consists only of edits from go fix; your code reviewers will thank you.</p>
<p>To preview the changes the above command would have made, use the <code>-diff</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ go fix -diff ./...
--- dir/file.go (old)
+++ dir/file.go (new)
-                       eq := strings.IndexByte(pair, '=')
-                       result[pair[:eq]] = pair[1+eq:]
+                       before, after, _ := strings.Cut(pair, "=")
+                       result[before] = after
…

<p>Adding the name of a particular analyzer shows its complete documentation:</p>

forvar: remove redundant re-declaration of loop variables

The forvar analyzer removes unnecessary shadowing of loop variables.
Before Go 1.22, it was common to write `for _, x := range s { x := x ... }`
to create a fresh variable for each iteration. Go 1.22 changed the semantics
of `for` loops, making this pattern redundant. This analyzer removes the
unnecessary `x := x` statement.

This fix only applies to `range` loops.
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the <code>go fix</code> command runs all analyzers. When fixing a large project it may reduce the burden of code review if you apply fixes from the most prolific analyzers as separate code changes. To enable only specific analyzers, use the flags matching their names. For example, to run just the <code>any</code> fixer, specify the <code>-any</code> flag. Conversely, to run all the analyzers <em>except</em> selected ones, negate the flags, for instance <code>-any=false</code>.</p>
<p>As with <code>go build</code> and <code>go vet</code>, each run of the <code>go fix</code> command analyzes only a specific build configuration. If your project makes heavy use of files tagged for different CPUs or platforms, you may wish to run the command more than once with different values of <code>GOARCH</code> and <code>GOOS</code> for better coverage:</p>
<pre><code>$ GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 go fix ./...
$ GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64 go fix ./...
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go fix ./...
</code></pre>
<p>Running the command more than once also provides opportunities for synergistic fixes, as we’ll see below.</p>
<h3 id="modernizers">Modernizers</h3>
<p>The introduction of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics">generics</a> in Go 1.18 marked the end of an era of very few changes to the language spec and the start of a period of more rapid—though still careful—change, especially in the libraries. Many of the trivial loops that Go programmers routinely write, such as to gather the keys of a map into a slice, can now be conveniently expressed as a call to a generic function such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/maps#Keys" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>maps.Keys</code></a>. Consequently these new features create many opportunities to simplify existing code.</p>
<p>In December 2024, during the frenzied adoption of LLM coding assistants, we became aware that such tools tended—unsurprisingly—to produce Go code in a style similar to the mass of Go code used during training, even when there were newer, better ways to express the same idea. Less obviously, the same tools often refused to use the newer ways even when directed to do so in general terms such as “always use the latest idioms of Go 1.25.” In some cases, even when explicitly told to use a feature, the model would deny that it existed. (See my 2025 GopherCon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU&amp;t=3m50s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">talk</a> for more exasperating details.) To ensure that future models are trained on the latest idioms, we need to ensure that these idioms are reflected in the training data, which is to say the global corpus of open-source Go code.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we have built <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">dozens of analyzers</a> to identify opportunities for modernization. Here are three examples of the fixes they suggest:</p>
<p><strong>minmax</strong> replaces an <code>if</code> statement by a use of Go 1.21’s <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> functions:</p>
<div>
<pre>x := f()
if x &lt; 0 {
    x = 0
}
if x &gt; 100 {
    x = 100
}
</pre>

<pre>x := min(max(f(), 0), 100)
</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>rangeint</strong> replaces a 3-clause <code>for</code> loop by a Go 1.22 <code>range</code>-over-int loop:</p>
<div>
<pre>for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
    f()
}
</pre>

<pre>for range n {
    f()
}
</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>stringscut</strong> (whose <code>-diff</code> output we saw earlier) replaces uses of <code>strings.Index</code> and slicing by Go 1.18’s <code>strings.Cut</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre>i := strings.Index(s, ":")
if i &gt;= 0 {
     return s[:i]
}
</pre>

<pre>before, _, ok := strings.Cut(s, ":")
if ok {
    return before
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>These modernizers are included in <a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls</a>, to provide instant feedback as you type, and in <code>go fix</code>, so that you can modernize several entire packages at once in a single command. In addition to making code clearer, modernizers may help Go programmers learn about newer features. As part of the process of approving each new change to the language and standard library, the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/README.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal</a> review group now considers whether it should be accompanied by a modernizer. We expect to add more modernizers with each release.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-modernizer-for-go-126s-newexpr">Example: a modernizer for Go 1.26’s new(expr)</h2>
<p>Go 1.26 includes a small but widely useful change to the language specification. The built-in <code>new</code> function creates a new variable and returns its address. Historically, its sole argument was required to be a type, such as <code>new(string)</code>, and the new variable was initialized to its “zero” value, such as <code>""</code>. In Go 1.26, the <code>new</code> function may be called with any value, causing it to create a variable initialized to that value, avoiding the need for an additional statement. For example:</p>
<div>
<pre>ptr := new(string)
*ptr = "go1.25"
</pre>

<pre>ptr := new("go1.26")
</pre>
</div>
<p>This feature filled a gap that had been discussed for over a decade and resolved one of the most popular <a href="https://go.dev/issue/45624">proposals</a> for a change to the language. It is especially convenient in code that uses a pointer type <code>*T</code> to indicate an optional value of type <code>T</code>, as is common when working with serialization packages such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">json.Marshal</a> or <a href="https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/gotutorial/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>. This is such a common pattern that people often capture it in a helper, such as the <code>newInt</code> function below, saving the caller from the need to break out of an expression context to introduce additional statements:</p>
<pre><code>type RequestJSON struct {
    URL      string
    Attempts *int  // (optional)
}

data, err := json.Marshal(&amp;RequestJSON{
    URL:      url,
    Attempts: newInt(10),
})

func newInt(x int) *int { return &amp;x }
</code></pre>
<p>Helpers such as <code>newInt</code> are so frequently needed with protocol buffers that the <code>proto</code> API itself provides them as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Int64" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.Int64</code></a>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#String" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.String</code></a>, and so on. But Go 1.26 makes all these helpers unnecessary:</p>
<pre><code>data, err := json.Marshal(&amp;RequestJSON{
    URL:      url,
    Attempts: new(10),
})
</code></pre>
<p>To help you take advantage of this feature, the <code>go fix</code> command now includes a fixer, <a href="https://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize/newexpr.go" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">newexpr</a>, that recognizes “new-like” functions such as <code>newInt</code> and suggests fixes to replace the function body with <code>return new(x)</code> and to replace every call, whether in the same package or an importing package, with a direct use of <code>new(expr)</code>.</p>
<p>To avoid introducing premature uses of new features, modernizers offer fixes only in files that require at least the minimum appropriate version of Go (1.26 in this instance), either through a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions"><code>go 1.26</code> directive</a> in the enclosing go.mod file or a <code>//go:build go1.26</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">build constraint</a> in the file itself.</p>
<p>Run this command to update all calls of this form in your source tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ go fix -newexpr ./...
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, with luck, all of your <code>newInt</code>-like helper functions will have become unused and may be safely deleted (assuming they aren’t part of a stable published API). A few calls may remain where it would be unsafe to suggest a fix, such as when the name <code>new</code> is locally shadowed by another declaration. You can also use the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/deadcode">deadcode</a> command to help identify unused functions.</p>
<h2 id="synergistic-fixes">Synergistic fixes</h2>
<p>Applying one modernization may create opportunities to apply another. For example, this snippet of code, which clamps <code>x</code> to the range 0–100, causes the minmax modernizer to suggest a fix to use <code>max</code>. Once that fix is applied it suggests a second fix, this time to use <code>min</code>.</p>
<div>
<pre>x := f()
if x &lt; 0 {
    x = 0
}
if x &gt; 100 {
    x = 100
}
</pre>

<pre>x := min(max(f(), 0), 100)
</pre>
</div>
<p>Synergies may also occur between different analyzers. For example, a common mistake is to repeatedly concatenate strings within a loop, resulting in quadratic time complexity—a bug and a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack. The <code>stringsbuilder</code> modernizer recognizes the problem and suggests using Go 1.10’s <code>strings.Builder</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre>s := ""
for _, b := range bytes {
    s += fmt.Sprintf("%02x", b)
}
use(s)
</pre>

<pre>var s strings.Builder
for _, b := range bytes {
    s.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("%02x", b))
}
use(s.String())
</pre>
</div>
<p>Once this fix is applied, a second analyzer may recognize that the <code>WriteString</code> and <code>Sprintf</code> operations can be combined as <code>fmt.Fprintf(&amp;s, "%02x", b)</code>, which is both cleaner and more efficient, and offer a second fix. (This second analyzer is <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks#QF1012" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">QF1012</a> from Dominik Honnef’s <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">staticcheck</a>, which is already enabled in gopls but not yet in <code>go fix</code>, though we <a href="https://go.dev/issue/76918">plan</a> to add staticcheck analyzers to the go command starting in Go 1.27.)</p>
<p>Consequently, it may be worth running <code>go fix</code> more than once until it reaches a fixed point; twice is usually enough.</p>
<!-- Aside: The reason the tool does not apply the fixed point iteration itself is that (a) despite our efforts there is a non-zero chance that the transformation breaks the build, preventing most analyzers (those not marked RunDespiteErrors) from running on the second pass, and (b) the transformations in the first round of fixes may add imports for packages whose type information is not available, requiring the “build” to be restarted, which is impossible in many drivers such as Blaze, nogo, Tricorder, etc. Fundamentally this is a consequence of the analysis framework being designed like a distributed build (batch, coarse-grained, distributed pure function) not like an IDE (interactive fine-grained local mutations). -->
<h3 id="merging-fixes-and-conflicts">Merging fixes and conflicts</h3>
<p>A single run of <code>go fix</code> may apply dozens of fixes within the same source file. All fixes are conceptually independent, analogous to a set of git commits with the same parent. The <code>go fix</code> command uses a simple three-way merge algorithm to reconcile the fixes in sequence, analogous to the task of merging a set of git commits that edit the same file. If a fix conflicts with the list of edits accumulated so far, it is discarded, and the tool issues a warning that some fixes were skipped and that the tool should be run again.</p>
<p>This reliably detects <em>syntactic</em> conflicts arising from overlapping edits, but another class of conflict is possible: a <em>semantic</em> conflict occurs when two changes are textually independent but their meanings are incompatible. As an example consider two fixes that each remove the second-to-last use of a local variable: each fix is fine by itself, but when both are applied together the local variable becomes unused, and in Go that’s a compilation error. Neither fix is responsible for removing the variable declaration, but someone has to do it, and that someone is the user of <code>go fix</code>.</p>
<p>A similar semantic conflict arises when a set of fixes causes an import to become unused. Because this case is so common, the <code>go fix</code> command applies a final pass to detect unused imports and remove them automatically.</p>
<p>Semantic conflicts are relatively rare. Fortunately they usually reveal themselves as compilation errors, making them impossible to overlook. Unfortunately, when they happen, they do demand some manual work after running <code>go fix</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s now delve into the infrastructure beneath these tools.</p>

<h2 id="the-go-analysis-framework">The Go analysis framework</h2>
<p>Since the earliest days of Go, the <code>go</code> command has had two subcommands for static analysis, <code>go vet</code> and <code>go fix</code>, each with its own suite of algorithms: “checkers” and “fixers”. A checker reports likely mistakes in your code, such as passing a string instead of an integer as the operand of a <code>fmt.Printf("%d")</code> conversion. A fixer safely edits your code to fix a bug or to express the same thing in a better way, perhaps more clearly, concisely, or efficiently. Sometimes the same algorithm appears in both suites when it can both report a mistake and safely fix it.</p>
<p>In 2017 we redesigned the then-monolithic <code>go vet</code> program to separate the checker algorithms (now called “analyzers”) from the “driver”, the program that runs them; the result was the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Go analysis framework</a>. This separation enables an analyzer to be written once then run in a diverse range of drivers for different environments, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/unitchecker" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">unitchecker</a>, which turns a suite of analyzers into a subcommand that can be run by the go command’s scalable incremental build system, analogous to a compiler in go build. This is the basis of <code>go fix</code> and <code>go vet</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/blob/master/go/nogo.rst" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">nogo</a>, the analogous driver for alternative build systems such as Bazel and Blaze.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/singlechecker" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">singlechecker</a>, which turns an analyzer into a standalone command that loads, parses, and type-checks a set of packages (perhaps a whole program) and then analyzes them. We often use it for ad hoc experiments and measurements over the module mirror (<a href="https://proxy.golang.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proxy.golang.org</a>) corpus.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/multichecker" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">multichecker</a>, which does the same thing for a suite of analyzers with a ‘swiss-army knife’ CLI.</li>
<li><a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls</a>, the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">language server</a> behind VS Code and other editors, which provides real-time diagnostics from analyzers after each editor keystroke.</li>
<li>the highly configurable driver used by the <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">staticcheck</a> tool. (Staticcheck also provides a large suite of analyzers that can be run in other drivers.)</li>
<li><a href="https://research.google/pubs/tricorder-building-a-program-analysis-ecosystem/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tricorder</a>, the batch static analysis pipeline used by Google’s monorepo and integrated with its code review system.</li>
<li>gopls’ <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/features/mcp">MCP server</a>, which makes diagnostics available to LLM-based coding agents, providing more robust “guardrails”.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/analysistest" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">analysistest</a>, the analysis framework’s test harness.</li>
</ul>
<p>One benefit of the framework is its ability to express helper analyzers that don’t report diagnostics or suggest fixes of their own but instead compute some intermediate data structure that may be useful to many other analyzers, amortizing the costs of its construction. Examples include <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/ctrlflow" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">control-flow graphs</a>, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/buildssa" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SSA representation</a> of function bodies, and data structures for <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/inspect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">optimized AST navigation</a>.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the framework is its support for making deductions across packages. An analyzer can attach a “<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#hdr-Modular_analysis_with_Facts" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fact</a>” to a function or other symbol so that information learned while analyzing the function’s body can be used when later analyzing a call to the function, even if the call appears in another package or the later analysis occurs in a different process. This makes it easy to define scalable interprocedural analyses. For example, the printf checker can tell when a function such as <code>log.Printf</code> is really just a wrapper around <code>fmt.Printf</code>, so it knows that calls to <code>log.Printf</code> should be checked in a similar manner. This process works by induction, so the tool will also check calls to further wrappers around <code>log.Printf</code>, and so on. An example of an analyzer that makes heavy use of facts is <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Uber’s nilaway</a>, which reports potential mistakes resulting in nil pointer dereferences.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/gofix-analysis-facts.svg"></p><p>The process of “separate analysis” in <code>go fix</code>  is analogous to the process of separate compilation in <code>go build</code>. Just as the compiler builds packages starting from the bottom of the dependency graph and passing type information up to importing packages, the analysis framework works from the bottom of the dependency graph up, passing facts (and types) up to importing packages.</p>
<p>In 2019, as we started developing <a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls</a>, the language server for Go, we added the ability for an analyzer to suggest a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#SuggestedFix" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fix</a> when reporting a diagnostic. The printf analyzer, for example, offers to replace <code>fmt.Printf(msg)</code> with <code>fmt.Printf("%s", msg)</code> to avoid misformatting should the dynamic <code>msg</code> value contain a <code>%</code> symbol. This mechanism has become the basis for many of the quick fixes and refactoring features of gopls.</p>
<p>While all these developments were happening to <code>go vet</code>, <code>go fix</code> remained stuck as it was back before the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go compatibility promise</a>, when early adopters of Go used it to maintain their code during the rapid and sometimes incompatible evolution of the language and libraries.</p>
<p>The Go 1.26 release brings the Go analysis framework to <code>go fix</code>. The <code>go vet</code> and <code>go fix</code> commands have converged and are now almost identical in implementation. The only differences between them are the criteria for the suites of algorithms they use, and what they do with computed diagnostics. Go <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1:src/cmd/vet/main.go;l=62" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">vet analyzers</a> must detect likely mistakes with low false positives; their diagnostics are reported to the user. Go <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1:src/cmd/fix/main.go;l=46" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fix analyzers</a> must generate fixes that are safe to apply without regression in correctness, performance, or style; their diagnostics may not be reported, but the fixes are directly applied. Aside from this difference of emphasis, the task of developing a fixer is no different from that of developing a checker.</p>
<h3 id="improving-analysis-infrastructure">Improving analysis infrastructure</h3>
<p>As the number of analyzers in <code>go vet</code> and <code>go fix</code> continues to grow, we have been investing in infrastructure both to improve the performance of each analyzer and to make it easier to write each new analyzer.</p>
<p>For example, most analyzers start by traversing the syntax trees of each file in the package looking for a particular kind of node such as a range statement or function literal. The existing <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">inspector</a> package makes this scan efficient by pre-computing a compact index of a complete traversal so that later traversals can quickly skip subtrees that don’t contain any nodes of interest. Recently we extended it with the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector#Cursor" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Cursor</a> datatype to allow flexible and efficient navigation between nodes in all four cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right, similar to navigating the elements of an HTML DOM—making it easy and efficient to express a query such as “find each go statement that is the first statement of a loop body”:</p>
<pre><code>    var curFile inspector.Cursor = ...

    // Find each go statement that is the first statement of a loop body.
    for curGo := range curFile.Preorder((*ast.GoStmt)(nil)) {
        kind, index := curGo.ParentEdge()
        if kind == edge.BlockStmt_List &amp;&amp; index == 0 {
            switch curGo.Parent().ParentEdgeKind() {
            case edge.ForStmt_Body, edge.RangeStmt_Body:
                ...
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Many analyzers start by searching for calls to a specific function, such as <code>fmt.Printf</code>. Function calls are among the most numerous expressions in Go code, so rather than search every call expression and test whether it is a call to <code>fmt.Printf</code>, it is much more efficient to pre-compute an index of symbol references, which is done by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/internal/typesinternal/typeindex" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">typeindex</a> and its <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools@v0.41.0/internal/analysis/typeindex" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">helper</a> analyzer. Then the calls to <code>fmt.Printf</code> can be enumerated directly, making the cost proportional to the number of calls instead of to the size of the package. For an analyzer such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/hostport" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">hostport</a> that seeks an infrequently used symbol (<code>net.Dial</code>), this can easily make it <a href="https://go.dev/cl/657958">1,000× faster</a>.</p>
<p>Some other infrastructural improvements over the past year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>dependency graph of the standard library</strong> that analyzers can consult to avoid introducing import cycles. For example, we can’t introduce a call to <code>strings.Cut</code> in a package that is itself imported by <code>strings</code>.</li>
<li>support for <strong>querying the effective Go version</strong> of a file as determined by the enclosing go.mod file and build tags, so that analyzers don’t insert uses of features that are “too new”.</li>
<li>a richer <strong>library of refactoring primitives</strong> (e.g. “delete this statement”) that correctly handle adjacent comments and other tricky edge cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have come a long way, but there remains much to do. Fixer logic can be tricky to get right. Since we expect users to apply hundreds of suggested fixes with only cursory review, it’s critical that fixers are correct even in obscure edge cases. As just one example (see my GopherCon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU&amp;t=13m17s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">talk</a> for several more), we built a modernizer that replaces calls such as <code>append([]string{}, slice...)</code> by the clearer <code>slices.Clone(slice)</code> only to discover that, when <code>slice</code> is empty, the result of Clone is nil, a subtle behavior change that in rare cases can cause bugs; so we had to exclude <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize#hdr-Analyzer_appendclipped" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">that modernizer</a> from the <code>go fix</code> suite.</p>
<p>Some of these difficulties for authors of analyzers can be ameliorated with better documentation (both for humans and LLMs), particularly checklists of surprising edge cases to consider and test. A pattern-matching engine for syntax trees, similar to those in <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/honnef.co/go/tools/pattern" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">staticcheck</a> and <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/queries/index.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tree Sitter</a>, could simplify the fiddly task of efficiently identifying the locations that need fixing. A richer library of operators for computing accurate fixes would help avoid common mistakes. A better test harness would let us check that fixes don’t break the build, and preserve dynamic properties of the target code. These are all on our roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="the-self-service-paradigm">The “self-service” paradigm</h2>
<p>More fundamentally, we are turning our attention in 2026 to a “self-service” paradigm.</p>
<p>The <code>newexpr</code> analyzer we saw earlier is a typical modernizer: a bespoke algorithm tailored to a particular feature. The bespoke model works well for features of the language and standard library, but it doesn’t really help update uses of third-party packages. Although there’s nothing to stop you from writing a modernizer for your own public APIs and running it on your own project, there’s no automatic way to get users of your API to run it too. Your modernizer probably wouldn’t belong in gopls or the <code>go vet</code> suite unless your API is particularly widely used across the Go ecosystem. Even in that case you would have to obtain code reviews and approvals and then wait for the next release.</p>
<p>Under the self-service paradigm, Go programmers would be able to define modernizations for their own APIs that their users can apply without all the bottlenecks of the current centralized paradigm. This is especially important as the Go community and global Go corpus are growing much faster than the ability of our team to review analyzer contributions.</p>
<p>The <code>go fix</code> command in Go 1.26 includes a preview of the first fruits of this new paradigm: the <strong>annotation-driven source-level inliner</strong>, which we’ll describe in an upcoming companion blog post next week. In the coming year, we plan to investigate two more approaches within this paradigm.</p>
<!-- TODO(adonovan): update the reference above when this post is ready: [//go:fix inline and source-level inliner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16n29TcxMnZoEZtIo8BZcz6PSnh2dakWLSaa6UkROIEQ/edit?resourcekey=0-8QYiy7RDd2QbVAgKDOycoQ) -->
<p>First, we will be exploring the possibility of <a href="https://go.dev/issue/59869">dynamically loading</a> modernizers from the source tree and securely executing them, either in gopls or <code>go fix</code>. In this approach a package that provides an API for, say, a SQL database could additionally provide a checker for misuses of the API, such as SQL injection vulnerabilities or failure to handle critical errors. The same mechanism could be used by project maintainers to encode internal housekeeping rules, such as avoiding calls to certain problematic functions or enforcing stronger coding disciplines in critical parts of the code.</p>
<p>Second, many existing checkers can be informally described as “don’t forget to X after you Y!”, such as “close the file after you open it”, “cancel the context after you create it”, “unlock the mutex after you lock it”, “break out of the iterator loop after yield returns false”, and so on. What such checkers have in common is that they enforce certain invariants on all execution paths. We plan to explore generalizations and unifications of these control-flow checkers so that Go programmers can easily apply them to new domains, without complex analytical logic, simply by annotating their own code.</p>
<p>We hope that these new tools will save you effort during maintenance of your Go projects and help you learn about and benefit from newer features sooner. Please try out <code>go fix</code> on your projects and <a href="https://go.dev/issue/new">report</a> any problems you find, and do share any ideas you have for new modernizers, fixers, checkers, or self-service approaches to static analysis.</p>

And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this." </p><p id="anchor-8c5e89">CBS and the FCC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p id="anchor-d397a6">“The Late Show” published the unaired interview with Talarico on YouTube. In the interview, Colbert and Talarico discuss the FCC crackdown, including opening a probe into ABC’s “The View,” after Talarico appeared on the show. </p><p id="anchor-779db5">“I think that Donald Trump is worried that we’re about to flip Texas,” Talarico said, which was met with audience applause. “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they’re trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read. And this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”</p><p id="anchor-3be595">Talarico accused the Trump administration of “selling out the First Amendment to curry favor with corrupt politicians.”</p><p id="anchor-171594">“A threat to any of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights.” </p><p id="anchor-5fc80a">CBS' move to not air the segment comes as the FCC, the government's media regulator, and most notably its chairman, Brendan Carr, have been particularly combative with networks that have drawn the ire of the president. </p><p id="anchor-df8614">Trump has for months suggested the FCC could <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-fcc-revoke-tv-broadcast-licenses-over-bad-publicity-rcna232339" target="_blank">revoke the licenses of television broadcasters</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>opinion</span> Just as the community adopted the term "hallucination" to describe additive errors, we must now codify its far more insidious counterpart: semantic ablation.</p>
<p>Semantic ablation is the algorithmic erosion of high-entropy information. Technically, it is not a "bug" but a structural byproduct of greedy decoding and RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback).</p>
<p>During "refinement," the model gravitates toward the center of the Gaussian distribution, discarding "tail" data – the rare, precise, and complex tokens – to maximize statistical probability. Developers have exacerbated this through aggressive "safety" and "helpfulness" tuning, which deliberately penalizes unconventional linguistic friction. It is a silent, unauthorized amputation of intent, where the pursuit of low-perplexity output results in the total destruction of unique signal.</p>

    

<p>When an author uses AI for "polishing" a draft, they are not seeing improvement; they are witnessing semantic ablation. The AI identifies high-entropy clusters – the precise points where unique insights and "blood" reside – and systematically replaces them with the most probable, generic token sequences. What began as a jagged, precise Romanesque structure of stone is eroded into a polished, Baroque plastic shell: it looks "clean" to the casual eye, but its structural integrity – its "ciccia" – has been ablated to favor a hollow, frictionless aesthetic.</p>

        


        

<p>We can measure semantic ablation through entropy decay. By running a text through successive AI "refinement" loops, the vocabulary diversity (type-token ratio) collapses. The process performs a systematic lobotomy across three distinct stages:</p>
<p>Stage 1: Metaphoric cleansing. The AI identifies unconventional metaphors or visceral imagery as "noise" because they deviate from the training set's mean. It replaces them with dead, safe clichés, stripping the text of its emotional and sensory "friction."</p>

        

<p>Stage 2: Lexical flattening. Domain-specific jargon and high-precision technical terms are sacrificed for "accessibility." The model performs a statistical substitution, replacing a 1-of-10,000 token with a 1-of-100 synonym, effectively diluting the semantic density and specific gravity of the argument.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Structural collapse. The logical flow – originally built on complex, non-linear reasoning – is forced into a predictable, low-perplexity template. Subtext and nuance are ablated to ensure the output satisfies a "standardized" readability score, leaving behind a syntactically perfect but intellectually void shell.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/21/ai_wins_imitation_game_readers/">AI does a better job of ripping off the style of famous authors than MFA students do</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/07/ai_can_write_improved_code_research/">AI can improve on code it writes, but you have to know how to ask</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/23/developers_genai_little_productivity_gains/">AI coding hype overblown, Bain shrugs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/ai_code_bugs/">AI-authored code contains worse bugs than software crafted by humans</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a "JPEG of thought" – visually coherent but stripped of its original data density through semantic ablation.</p>
<p>If "hallucination" describes the AI seeing what isn't there, semantic ablation describes the AI destroying what is. We are witnessing a civilizational "race to the middle," where the complexity of human thought is sacrificed on the altar of algorithmic smoothness. By accepting these ablated outputs, we are not just simplifying communication; we are building a world on a hollowed-out syntax that has suffered semantic ablation. If we don't start naming the rot, we will soon forget what substance even looks like. ®</p>

All essential, all should continue.</p><p>What almost nobody talks about is the supply side of capital. Scratch that, a lot of critics keeps talking about how YIMBYs, industrial policy wonks, and the rest don’t have a clue how to finance their proposals (despite the mountain of literature saying otherwise). That capital exists. There is roughly $6 trillion of it, sitting in American public pension funds, currently being allocated in a way that serves nobody.</p><p><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/19668611-oren-cass?utm_source=mentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Oren Cass&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:19668611,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9afce891-e251-4da4-b20d-1c52f1b88d90_2403x2415.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;bbce69b3-441e-4d71-a074-7581ccb4617f&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionUser">Oren Cass</a></span><span>’s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/opinion/capitalism-industry-financialization.html" rel="">recent New York Times column</a><span> describes an American financial sector that has stopped fueling the real economy and started consuming it. </span><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/559294-dean-baker?utm_source=mentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Dean Baker&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:559294,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6a6e430-c307-4993-83dd-fb8d75cac7ad_144x144.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;1932ba24-e6d7-4374-88f0-79da1e1cc83b&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionUser">Dean Baker</a></span><span>, writing at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, </span><a href="https://cepr.net/publications/oren-cass-uses-good-economics-in-attacking-finance-in-nyt/" rel="">endorsed Cass’s diagnosis</a><span> and added a complementary set of regulatory reform proposals.

They are routinely sidelined in favor of voices whose concern for market discipline ends where Wall Street’s balance sheet begins.</p><p><em><strong>Where I’m going with this</strong></em></p><p>I’m taking Cass’s and Baker’s arguments in a more “developmental state” direction, with pensions being the biggest target. Three claims:</p><p><span>First, the capital that energy, infrastructure, and housing buildouts need already exists: </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/2024-annual-survey-public-pensions.html" rel="">$6 trillion in public pension funds</a><span>, with liability profiles that match 30-year transmission lines and 40-year nuclear plants almost perfectly.</span></p><p>Second, that capital is trapped in an institutional arrangement that charges enormous fees to match the performance of a simple index fund, while the money deployed through these intermediaries actively harms the communities pensioners live in: buying up their housing, closing their hospitals, bankrupting their local employers, gutting their newspapers.</p><p>Third, redirecting this capital doesn’t require new government spending or new financial structures. It requires breaking the equilibrium that one side of the debate defends (Summers) in favor of the other (Baker, or further still, the developmental-state economists in China, Singapore, and Japan). And it requires conditioning any future public rescues on actual structural reform.</p><p>We want to start with the data, because the data are damning.</p><p><span>The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran a straightforward comparison: how did actual public pension returns stack up against a simple 60/40 portfolio of stock and bond index funds, the kind any individual investor could assemble in a Vanguard account for nearly zero cost? </span><a href="https://crr.bc.edu/how-do-public-pension-plan-returns-compare-to-simple-index-investing/" rel="">The answer: roughly the same. Public pensions earned about 6.1% annually. The 60/40 benchmark earned about 6.1% annually.</a><span> The entire apparatus of consultants and alternative managers produced no excess return.</span></p><p><span>It gets worse. Pensions performed better than the benchmark before the 2008 financial crisis and worse afterward, precisely as they ramped up allocations to hedge funds, private equity, and other “alternatives.” </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/endowments-in-the-casino-even-the-whales-lose-at-the-alts-table" rel="">Richard Ennis has documented a negative alpha of approximately 1.2% per year since 2008</a><span>, virtually all of it associated with alternative investments. Reason Foundation found that 84% of public pension funds failed to beat a passive 60/40 portfolio over the past 20 years. The median plan trails the benchmark by 1-2% annually over 15- and 20-year horizons.</span></p><p>Cass documents the same pattern from the other end of the transaction: private equity is now underperforming a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund across three-month, one-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year horizons.</p><p>The fee structures explain why. For a large pension fund with 30-40% in alternatives, total portfolio costs exceed 1% annually, versus roughly 5 basis points for an indexed strategy. The most expensive slice is private equity, where Ennis estimates total costs of 6%+ annually. On $6 trillion in assets, 1% is $60 billion per year. Over a decade, half a trillion dollars. Over 30 years, more than a trillion.</p><p>CalPERS, the nation’s largest public pension, exited hedge funds in 2014, citing “high costs and weak performance.” Their hedge fund portfolio had generated 4.8% annually over a decade, trailing the hedge fund industry’s own benchmark by roughly a fifth. Then, by 2024, CalPERS announced plans to increase private market investments by $30 billion. The cycle repeats because nothing about the incentive structure has changed.</p><p>The tens of billions in annual fee waste is actually the smaller problem.</p><p>The larger problem is what pension capital is and what it’s being used for. Pension capital is money that will not be needed for 20 to 40 years. By its nature, it is the most patient capital in the American economy, longer in duration than venture capital (5-7 year exit targets), longer than private equity (similar horizon despite the “long-term” branding). Pension funds should be the natural financiers of the long-duration assets this publication covers: transmission lines, nuclear plants, housing bonds, grid infrastructure.</p><p>Instead, pension funds hand their capital to intermediaries who invest it on shorter time horizons and charge 6% annually. The assets that need patient capital, grid, nuclear, housing, defense-industrial capacity, can’t find it. And the intermediaries collect fees regardless.</p><p>We’ve solved this kind of problem before.</p><p>What we are describing is not novel. It is approximately what American public pensions did for four decades before the alternatives revolution.</p><p><span>From roughly 1920 to 1960, legal restrictions confined pension investments to government securities, primarily municipal and state bonds. Michael Glass and Sean Vanatta call this </span><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/798740/figure/fig03" rel="">“fiscal mutualism.”</a><span> At the system’s peak in 1942, public pension portfolios held 73% of their assets in state and local bonds. New York Comptroller Morris Tremaine invested pension funds in municipal bonds explicitly “to assist local governments in procuring funds for improvements at fair interest rates.” The bonds paid market rates. This was not a subsidy. But the closed loop aligned the interests of pensioners, taxpayers, and local governments in a way the current system does not. A retired firefighter’s savings backed the fire station. There were essentially no intermediary fees.</span></p><p><span>The mechanism generated what Glass and Vanatta describe as a </span><a href="https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/222115/" rel="">“virtuous cycle.”</a><span> Public employees contributed wages to the pension fund. The fund bought municipal and school district bonds. The captive demand suppressed borrowing costs, allowing localities to build schools, roads, and sewers at favorable rates. That infrastructure supported community growth, which expanded the tax base and the number of public employees, which increased contributions to the pension fund. Nobody got rich intermediating the transaction, which is why nobody has an incentive to bring it back.</span></p><p><span>The system started to strain in the 1940s when municipal bond yields fell to around 1.2%, roughly 41% of corporate bond returns, and broke open in the 1960s when states adopted the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudent_man_rule" rel="">“prudent man rule”</a><span> allowing pension funds to invest in corporate equities. That first shift, from municipal bonds to corporate stocks, was defensible. Equities offered higher long-term returns, and pensioners deserved the benefit. The adoption of the prudent man rule by states and its role in transforming public pension investment is documented in detail by </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00346764.2023.2270458" rel="">Vanatta</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second shift was not. Starting in the 1980s and accelerating after 2000, pensions piled into hedge funds, private equity, and other alternatives that promised superior returns through sophisticated strategies. By 2021, alternatives constituted </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4940886" rel="">nearly 40% of pension risk allocations</a><span>. Two decades of data now show this shift was a pure loss: same returns, </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/have-alternative-investments-helped-or-hurt" rel="">vastly higher fees</a><span>, and no benefit to the communities whose workers the funds are supposed to serve. The virtuous cycle was replaced by an extractive one. Pension contributions flow to consultants, who recommend alternative managers, who charge </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/the-endowment-syndrome-why-elite-funds-are-falling-behind" rel="">6% in fees</a><span> and deliver </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/how-hidden-costs-undermine-public-pensions-in-the-us" rel="">index-matching returns</a><span>. Meanwhile the communities that employ the pensioners struggle to finance basic infrastructure.</span></p><p>We are not arguing for a return to 1942.

The move into expensive alternatives added cost without adding return. The Japanese failure was political capture of capital allocation. The American failure is intermediary capture, which may be even </span><em>worse</em><span>. Both are real risks, and any reform must guard against both.</span></p><p><span>But here is what Japan got right that America is getting wrong. As of December 2024, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_Japan" rel="">88.1% of Japanese government debt is held domestically. The Bank of Japan holds 46.3%, domestic insurance companies 15.6%, domestic banks 14.5%. Foreign investors hold only about 12%</a><span>. Japanese households save at high rates, deposit into banks and insurance companies, and those institutions buy Japanese government bonds because their liabilities are also yen-denominated. The government uses the proceeds for spending and debt service. Even after the formal FILP reforms in 2001, the structural logic persists through this market-mediated channel. The institutional successor is hiding in plain sight. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Post_Bank" rel="">Japan Post Bank</a><span>, the semi-privatized descendant of the postal savings system that once fed FILP, still holds </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Post_Bank" rel="">¥190 trillion in deposits</a><span> (~$1.29 trillion), still maintains </span><a href="https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ir/financial/en_ir_fnc_finance.html" rel="">¥40.3 trillion in Japanese government bonds</a><span>, and still operates across nearly 24,000 branches serving 120 million accounts.

The government still holds a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Post_Bank" rel="">22% economic interest</a><span>. The fiscal mutualism did not disappear with the 2001 reform. It became more market-mediated, for better or worse. Japan Post Bank channels household savings into government debt and, increasingly, into a diversified global portfolio of </span><a href="https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ir/financial/pdf/en_pr250520_1.pdf" rel="">¥87.4 trillion in foreign securities</a><span>. The postal savings pipeline that built postwar Japan is still operating. It just has a stock ticker now.</span></p><p><span>Japan carries </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-debt-to-gdp" rel="">gross debt exceeding 230% of GDP</a><span>, levels that would trigger capital flight in any country dependent on foreign creditors. It hasn’t. The domestic savings channel has proved so resilient that betting against JGBs became known on Wall Street as the </span><a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/traders-insight/the-widowmaker-pays-off-as-the-last-central-bank-domino-falls/" rel="">“widowmaker trade.”</a><span> Every macro fund that shorted Japanese government bonds on the theory that the debt was unsustainable </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2758465-the-widowmaker-and-yen-crash-theories" rel="">lost money</a><span>, because the theory ignored the closed loop of domestic savings financing domestic debt.</span></p><p><span>The widowmaker shorts were wrong for a deeper reason than they realized. The domestic holding base doesn’t merely prevent capital flight. It keeps funding costs so low that the entire Japanese public sector operates (as we are clearly seeing) what </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7d3f20c-b303-4f6c-b4a0-8ee8906ae155" rel="">economists at the St. Louis Fed and Stanford have called “a sovereign wealth fund with borrowed money.”</a><span> Domestic savers accept low yields on JGBs because their liabilities are yen-denominated and the alternatives are limited. The government borrows at those low rates and holds the proceeds (directly and through entities like GPIF and the Bank of Japan) in higher-returning assets: foreign reserves, equities, and other risky positions. </span><a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/apr/what-is-behind-japan-high-government-debt" rel="">Research by YiLi Chien of the St. Louis Fed, Wenxin Du of Harvard, and Hanno Lustig of Stanford</a><span> estimates that this strategy has earned the Japanese government an additional 6 percent of GDP per annum above its funding costs over the past decade.</span></p><p><span>The scale becomes concrete when you look at the individual channels. The Bank of Japan holds </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/11/27/boj-gains-from-etf-holdings/" rel="">¥83.2 trillion ($532 billion) in exchange-traded funds</a><span>, making it the </span><a href="https://www.fintechobserver.com/the-exit-strategy-for-the-bank-of-japans-etf-holdings/" rel="">largest single shareholder in the Japanese stock market</a><span>, owning an estimated </span><a href="https://www.investing.com/news/economy/bank-of-japan-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged-outlines-etf-sale-plans-4246037" rel="">7% of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s market capitalization</a><span>.

When the BoJ announced in September 2025 that it would begin selling these holdings, the divestment plan was set at </span><a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-research/2025/weekly-economic-commentary/the-bank-of-japan-prunes-its-portfolio" rel="">¥625 billion per year</a><span>, a pace that </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/japan-etfs-why-the-boj-is-unwinding-its-537-billion-stockpile" rel="">would take over a century to complete</a><span>. While other major central banks sit on </span><a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-research/2025/weekly-economic-commentary/the-bank-of-japan-prunes-its-portfolio" rel="">underwater bond portfolios, the BoJ’s equity book is ¥44 trillion in the black</a><span>. Add Japan’s foreign exchange reserves, </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/foreign-exchange-reserves" rel="">$1.39 trillion as of January 2026</a><span>, mostly in dollar-denominated assets earning the rate differential over near-zero yen funding costs. Japan’s central bank is running a profitable equity long book funded by money creation, its finance ministry is running a leveraged carry trade in foreign currencies, and its pension fund is compounding returns at minimal cost. The “sovereign wealth fund with borrowed money” is not a metaphor. It is a description of actual positions totaling several trillion dollars.</span></p><p><span>This is why the gross debt number is misleading in isolation. When you consolidate the entire public sector balance sheet (the Bank of Japan’s equity holdings, the foreign exchange reserves, GPIF, the public financial institutions) Japan’s net public sector liability had </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7d3f20c-b303-4f6c-b4a0-8ee8906ae155" rel="">fallen to roughly 65 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2025</a><span>. When the St. Louis Fed researchers ran the same calculation for the United States in 2022, America’s net public sector liability was 119 percent of GDP, nearly double Japan’s current figure, despite America’s gross debt being barely half of Japan’s in GDP terms. The country that looks fiscally reckless on the headline number is in better net shape than the country that looks responsible, because Japan kept its savings at home and earned a spread on them while America scattered its capital across fee-extracting intermediaries.</span></p><p><span>Japan is not the only country running this playbook. </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/singapore/government-debt-to-gdp" rel="">Singapore carries gross debt of 173% of GDP</a><span>, higher than the United States, but has </span><a href="https://www.agd.gov.sg/files/overview_of_singapore_government_borrowings_2025.pdf" rel="">no net debt</a><span>. Its sovereign wealth funds, GIC and Temasek, together with the Monetary Authority of Singapore manage assets estimated at </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">three to four times GDP</a><span>.

As OMFIF put it: </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">“Singapore has employed borrowing not to meet current expenses or to fund a deficit, but to build a strong balance sheet.”</a><span> The crude debt-to-GDP metric that dominates American fiscal debate would rank Singapore as more indebted than the United States. In reality it is one of the wealthiest sovereigns on earth.</span></p><p>The principle is the same in both cases. The domestic holding base is the load-bearing wall of fiscal stability; the direct product of keeping capital circulating inside the national economy rather than handing it to intermediaries who scatter it across global alternative assets. The St. Louis Fed researchers note that Japan’s ability to sustain this depends on “stable and low funding costs from bondholders,” meaning the domestic savings channel must hold. If domestic institutions stop buying JGBs, the spread collapses and the sovereign wealth fund logic unravels. America cannot copy Japan’s solution or Singapore’s. But the underlying principle is clear: a nation that keeps its savings circulating domestically earns the fiscal room to maneuver that a nation dependent on foreign creditors and fee-extracting intermediaries does not.</p><p><span>China built a similar engine through the </span><a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/27bjsstsqxhkmh1v3kzkt/banking/making-sense-of-belt-and-road-the-chinese-policy-bank-china-development-bank/" rel="">China Development Bank</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_financing_vehicle" rel="">Local Government Financing Vehicles</a><span>, routing household deposits into infrastructure at massive scale.

Japan runs a disciplined, low-cost portfolio and keeps its domestic savings circulating where they underwrite fiscal stability and a 6 percent of GDP annual spread. Singapore borrows at 173% of GDP and funds a fifth of government revenue from the proceeds.

His conclusion: “New transmission capacity must be heavily subsidized.”</span></p><p>He’s right, and we need to go further with providing cheaper capital. Transmission lines are 30-50 year assets with regulated, predictable cash flows. They don’t need charity, they need patient buyers for the debt that finances them. The natural buyers are pension funds, whose 30+ year liability profiles match transmission asset durations almost perfectly. The reason pension funds aren’t buying is that their capital is tied up in alternative strategies with 5-7 year horizons, paying 6% in annual fees to roughly match a bond index.</p><p>Pension funds currently hold around $2 trillion in the bond side of their portfolios. Most of that is in corporate bonds, complex fixed-income strategies, and private credit funds charging 2-and-20. If even a quarter of that allocation shifted to municipal and infrastructure bonds, including bonds financing grid transmission, that would create roughly $500 billion in captive demand for infrastructure debt. That would lower the cost of financing transmission buildout. Not through subsidies. Through a large, natural buyer entering the market for the assets its liability structure already demands.</p><p>Parlmer estimates that solving the location problem might be part of a greater-than-$1 trillion project. The pension system’s bond allocation alone could absorb a significant fraction of that financing need, if it weren’t locked up in hedge fund LP interests.</p><p>China has roughly 30 reactors under construction, financed in significant part through state-mobilized patient capital channeled via the China Development Bank.

The LPO is a critical tool, providing federal debt for projects that private lenders consider too large or technically complex. But nuclear projects also need long-term equity commitments and project finance bonds that match their 40-60 year operational life. A nuclear plant with a power purchase agreement is essentially an infrastructure bond: predictable cash flows over a multi-decade horizon, backed by a regulated revenue stream. Pension funds should be natural participants in that capital stack.</span></p><p>Parlmer has floated the idea of state-backed reactor fleets, either DoD or DoE operated, because he can’t see another path to rapid deployment. Pension-backed project finance isn’t state ownership, but it could serve a similar de-risking function. A pension fund investing in a nuclear project finance bond backed by a DoD power purchase agreement would face lower risk than most of what is currently in pension alternative allocations, and would fund something that matters.</p><p><span>Parlmer’s analysis of Chinese industrial automation is alarming: </span><a href="https://mattparlmer.substack.com/p/blitzrobotik" rel="">PRC added more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/china-now-has-more-factory-robots-than-the-rest-of-the-world-combined/" rel="">quintupled its per-worker robot count since 2017</a><span>, and is pulling ahead of the United States in industrial sophistication. His prescription: dollars flowing into industrial automation at more than ten times current levels, with subsidies directed to startups rather than legacy firms.</span></p><p>Pension funds already allocate significant capital to venture through their alternatives sleeve, but that money flows overwhelmingly to Sequoia and Andreessen, not to defense tech or industrial automation startups in Ohio or Texas. The geographic and sectoral concentration of pension-funded VC mirrors the broader venture ecosystem’s biases: software over hardware, Bay Area over everywhere else, consumer over defense.</p><p><span>Redirecting even a fraction of pension VC allocation toward regional defense and industrial venture vehicles wouldn’t require new government spending. It would redirect existing capital flows. The </span><a href="https://www.ohioinnovationfund.com/" rel="">Ohio Innovation Fund</a><span> and similar state-level vehicles demonstrate that the institutional architecture is feasible. The returns are uncertain (this is venture, after all) but the counterfactual is not a guaranteed 12% from private equity. It’s 6% from a fund that charges 6% in fees to roughly match the S&amp;P 500.</span></p><p>We will be candid: the venture case is weaker than the infrastructure case. Pension funds are not natural venture investors, and pushing them toward VC risks the “picking winners” failure mode that destroyed Japan’s Fiscal Investment and Loan Program. But our argument is not that pensions should become venture funds. It is that the capital they currently waste on underperforming alternatives could be partially redirected toward asset classes that at least fund something strategic, and that the bar for improvement over the status quo is extraordinarily low.</p><p><span>Pension capital allocated to private equity and hedge funds does not just fail to generate excess returns.

The counterfactual is not “safe status quo vs. risky reform.” The current system already fails, already gets bailed out, and taxpayers are already on the hook.</p><p>On top what the pension funds already pay out in fees, if the federal government is going to spend $97 billion rescuing pension plans, and the Fed is going to deploy trillions backstopping the Treasury market, the obvious question is: why isn’t any of that capital building something?</p><p>A $97 billion pension rescue conditioned on not just reforms but also investing 25% of assets in domestic infrastructure bonds would have simultaneously stabilized the pensions, financed grid buildout, and created a template for redirecting patient capital toward national priorities. Instead, the money went in with no structural reform. No investment mandates, no fee caps, no requirement to stop feeding the same intermediary complex that created the underfunding. The plans that received bailout funds are free to continue allocating to the same managers whose fees helped drain them. And they will.</p><p>The institutional dynamics are a textbook captured-bureaucracy problem. Career risk provides cover through complexity: run a simple indexed portfolio and underperform in a given year, and you look unsophisticated. Run a complex alternatives-heavy portfolio and underperform, and you look like you tried your best. No one gets fired for hiring Goldman Sachs. Consultants don't get paid to recommend index funds; they get paid to recommend strategies requiring ongoing advice and manager searches. Benchmarks are gamed: pension funds construct custom benchmarks biased by 1-2% annually relative to fair passive alternatives, and private equity returns are reported with lags that smooth volatility and create the illusion of diversification. Trustees worry that directing capital toward municipal or infrastructure bonds rather than "optimizing" globally could be challenged as a breach of fiduciary duty, even though the "safe" legal path leads into strategies that have demonstrably underperformed. The cycle is self-reinforcing. CalPERS tried to break it in 2014 when they exited hedge funds. Ten years later, they were back in private markets.</p><p>The honest version of this section would list transparency mandates, fee caps, infrastructure bond requirements, and indexing mandates. We drafted it. Then we deleted it, because every item on the list requires action by the same actors who benefit from the current arrangement.</p><p>State legislators who would mandate fee transparency receive campaign contributions from the asset management industry. Pension board trustees who would cap alternatives face career risk if they simplify. The consultants who would need to recommend index funds over complex strategies are the same consultants whose business model depends on recommending complex strategies. Federal legislators who would attach conditions to bailouts just passed $97 billion with no conditions attached, because the political incentive was to deliver the money and move on.</p><p>We have spent this entire piece documenting a self-reinforcing capture loop. It would be dishonest to end it by proposing that the captured institutions reform themselves. CalPERS knew the answer in 2014. They exited hedge funds, published the rationale, took a public stand. A decade later they were back in private markets for $30 billion more, because nothing about the incentive structure had changed. If the nation’s largest and most sophisticated pension fund, with a board that understood the problem and acted on it, could not sustain the exit, a policy white paper is not going to do it.</p><p>We are describing a trap, not proposing an escape.</p><p>What will happen is another bailout. The math guarantees it. The SFA grants improved headline numbers, but strip them out and aggregate multiemployer funding drops to 89%. Eighty-five plans remain below 60% funded. The program changed no funding rules. The fee extraction continues. The underperformance compounds. At some point, probably within the next decade, a recession or market downturn will force the next round of plans into insolvency and Congress will face the same choice it faced in 2021.</p><p>That is the only moment when the political dynamics actually shift. When public money is on the table and legislators need a story to tell about why this time is different, there is a narrow window in which conditions can be attached. Not because anyone in the system wants reform, but because the politics of unconditional bailouts get worse each time. The 2021 rescue passed in a COVID relief omnibus where no one was paying attention. The next one will face more scrutiny, more anger, and a public that has watched pension-funded private equity close their hospitals and cut their neighbors’ wages.</p><p>The question is not “how do we reform pension allocation now.” It is: “when the next bailout arrives, what conditions are ready to attach?” That means having the legislative language drafted. It means having the qualifying criteria for infrastructure bonds defined (investment-grade, revenue-backed, independently certified) so that the debate is over a concrete mechanism rather than an abstract principle. It means having the fee cap number chosen and the benchmark methodology specified. It means having the sunset clause and the performance trigger designed, so that the infrastructure mandate self-destructs if it fails and cannot become a permanent slush fund.</p><p>None of that requires passing legislation today. It requires preparation for a political window that is coming whether anyone wants it or not.</p><p>The trap will not reform itself. But it will need public money again. The work between now and then is to make sure that the next time Congress writes a check to rescue a pension system bled dry by intermediary fees, the check comes with conditions that route the capital toward qualifying infrastructure debt rather than back into the same extraction loop that created the crisis. That is the difference between rescue and subsidy. It is also, realistically, the only reform that has a chance of happening.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/">https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045804">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/">← Back</a><p>Feb 17, 2026 · Arthur Cnops</p><p>A few days ago I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47023255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to Show HN</a>. I had good fun building that useless little internet experience. The post quickly disappeared from Show HN's first page, amongst the rest of the vibecoded pulp. And to be clear, I'm fine with that.</p>
<p>The behavior on Show HN was interesting to see though. So I pulled the data.</p>
<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Show HN of course isn't dead. You could even say it's more alive than ever. What has changed is the volume of posts and engagement per post. It's only natural when more projects are being built in a single weekend. There's less "Proof of Work".</p>
<p>From the business side of this, Johan Halse recently called this <a href="https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2026/02/03/the-sideprocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sideprocalypse</a>: the end of the small indie developer's dream. Every idea has been built, marketed better, and SEO'd into oblivion by someone with more money.</p>
<p>Some cool projects aren't getting through this noise, which is a pity. Here are a few I thought were interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47012984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neohabit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRun</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47003384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uForwarder</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I just upvoted them!</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some data.</p>
<h2>Volume Is Exploding</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-volume.svg" alt="HN volume over time for all posts, Show HN, and non-Show-HN"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-share.svg" alt="Show HN monthly share of all HN story volume"></p>
<h2>The Graveyard Is Growing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-one-point.svg" alt="1-point share over time for Show HN versus non-Show-HN"></p>
<p>Show HN started out <em>better</em> than regular submissions. Now it's significantly <em>worse</em>.</p>
<h2>The Shrinking Window</h2>
<p>How long does a Show HN post stay on page 1 before being pushed off? During peak hours (US daytime):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-visibility.svg" alt="Estimated visibility time for Show HN posts during peak hours"></p>
<h2>Discussion Is Dying Too</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-comments.svg" alt="Average comments per Show HN post"></p>
<h2>So Is Show HN Dead?</h2>
<p>No. There's just more noise, and less opportunity to get attention and have a discussion with other folks on HN about your project. Some gems go completely unnoticed. Maybe something for HN to think about: how do these subjective "gems" get more spotlight? How does HN remain the coolest place to talk about the coolest tech?</p>

<h2 id="introduction-feel-free-to-skip">Introduction (feel free to skip)</h2>

<p>Just a year ago, I was really deep into the Apple ecosystem. It seemed like there was no turning back from the orchard for me. Phone, laptop, watch, tablet, video and music streaming, cloud storage, and even a key tracker. All from one manufacturer. Plus shared family photo albums, calendars, and even shopping lists.</p>

<p>However, at some point, I discovered <a href="https://plenti.app/">Plenti</a>, a company that rents a really wide range of different devices at quite reasonable prices. Casually, I threw the phrase “samsung fold” into the search engine on their website and it turned out that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 could be rented for just 250-300 PLN per month. That was quite an interesting option, as I was insanely curious about how it is to live with a foldable phone, which after unfolding becomes the equivalent of a tablet. Plus, I would never dare to buy this type of device, because firstly, their price is astronomical, and secondly, I have serious doubts about the longevity of the folding screen. I checked the rental conditions from Plenti and nothing raised my suspicions. Renting seemed like a really cool option, so I decided to get the Fold 6 for half a year. That’s how I broke out of the orchard and slightly reopened the doors to my heart for solutions without the apple logo. I even wrote a post about the whole process - <a href="https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/zdradzilem-teamapple-eng/">I betrayed #TeamApple for broken phone</a>. What I’m getting at is that this is how Android returned to my living room and I think I started liking it anew.</p>

<p>My adventure with Samsung ended after the planned 6 months. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a good phone, and the ability to unfold it to the size of a tablet is an amazing feature. However, what bothered me about it was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>after folding it was terribly thick,</li>
  <li>it couldn’t be used in a case, because all the covers either didn’t fit or slipped off the part that has screens on both sides,</li>
  <li>naked, it was very blocky, even sharp, which caused me discomfort; holding it was simply unpleasant,</li>
  <li>paying 300 PLN (~80 USD) for rent is a good short-term solution to get something to test, but not in the long run.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the points above made me give up on extending the rental and start wondering what to do next. Interestingly, I liked Android enough that I didn’t necessarily want to go back to iOS. Around this time, an article hit my RSS reader: <a href="https://ithardware.pl/aktualnosci/grapheneos_ucieka_francja_kraj_niebezpieczny_prywatnosc_open_source-46855.html">Creators of the most secure version of Android fear France. Travel ban for the whole team</a> (I think it was this one, but I’m not entirely sure, it doesn’t really matter). It talked about how France wants to get its hands on the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/"><strong>GrapheneOS</strong></a> system and thus carry out a very serious attack on the privacy of its users. I thought then, “Hey! A European country <strong>wants to force a backdoor into the system</strong>, because it is too well secured to surveil its users. Either this is artificially blowing the topic out of proportion, or <strong>there is actually something special about this system!</strong>”. At that moment, a somewhat forgotten nerd gene ignited in me. I decided to abandon not only iOS, but also mainstream Android, and try a completely alternative system.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grapheneos">What is GrapheneOS</h2>

<p>GrapheneOS is a custom, <strong>open-source operating system</strong> designed with the idea of <strong>providing users with the highest level of privacy and security</strong>. It is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but differs significantly from standard software versions found in smartphones. Its creators completely <strong>eliminated integration with Google services</strong> at the system level, which avoids tracking and data collection by corporations, while offering a modern and stable working environment.</p>

<p>The system is distinguished by advanced “hardening” of the kernel and key components, which minimizes vulnerability to hacking attacks and exploits. A unique feature of GrapheneOS is the ability to run Google Play Services in an <strong>isolated environment</strong> (sandbox), allowing the user to use popular applications without granting them broad system permissions. Currently, the project focuses on supporting <strong>Google Pixel</strong> series phones, utilizing their dedicated Titan M security chips for full data protection.</p>

<h2 id="dedicated-devices">Dedicated devices</h2>

<p>When I used to read about GrapheneOS, the list of compatible devices included items from several different manufacturers. Now it’s only Google Pixel devices. This doesn’t mean you can’t run this system on a Samsung, for example, but the creators simply don’t guarantee it will work properly, and you have to deal with potentially porting the version yourself. Note that it’s quite funny that <strong>a system freed from Google services should be run exactly on Google devices</strong>. If anyone wants to read more about why Pixels are the best for GrapheneOS, I recommend checking out the following keywords - Verified Boot, Titan M, IOMMU, MTE.</p>

<h3 id="list-of-supported-devices-february-2026">List of supported devices (February 2026)</h3>

<p><em>I’ve bolded the items that are not only supported but also recommended (at the time of writing this post, you can find the current list <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices">here</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="my-smartphone-choice">My smartphone choice</h3>
<p>At the stage of choosing a device to test GrapheneOS on, I wasn’t yet sure if such a solution would work for me at all and if I’d last with it in the long run. So it would be unreasonable to lay out a significant amount of money. Because of this, probably the only sensible choice was the <strong>Google Pixel 9a</strong>. This was a few months ago, when not enough time had passed since the premiere of the 10 series models for them to make it onto the fully supported devices list. At that time, the Pixel 9a was the freshest device on the list (<strong>offering up to 7 YEARS of support!</strong>) and on top of that, it was very attractively priced, as I bought it for around <strong>1600 PLN</strong> (~450 USD).</p>

<p>In retrospect, I still consider it a good choice and definitely <strong>recommend this path to anyone</strong> who is currently at the stage of deciding on what hardware to start their GrapheneOS adventure. The only thing that bothers me a bit about the Pixel 9a is the quality of the photos it takes. I switched to it having previously had the iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which are excellent in this regard, so it’s no wonder I’m a bit spoiled, because I was simply used to a completely different level of cameras. Now I also know that <strong>GrapheneOS will stay with me for longer</strong>, so it’s possible that knowing then what I know now, I would have opted for some more expensive gear. However, this isn’t important to me now, because for the time being I don’t plan to switch to another device, and by the time that changes, the market situation and the list of available options will certainly have changed too. Besides, I’m <strong>positively surprised by the battery life and overall performance of this phone</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-grapheneos">Installing GrapheneOS</h2>

<h3 id="we-need">We need</h3>

<ol>
  <li>A suitable <strong>smartphone</strong> - in my case, it’s a Google Pixel 9a.</li>
  <li>A <strong>cable</strong> to connect the phone to a computer; it can’t be just any cable, but one that is used not only for charging but also for data transmission. It’s best to just use the cable that came with the phone.</li>
  <li>A <strong>computer with a Chromium-based browser</strong> (e.g., Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi?). Unfortunately, I must recommend Windows 10/11 here, because then you don’t have to mess around with any drivers; it’s the simplest option.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="phone-preparation">Phone preparation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If it’s new, we take it out of the box and <strong>turn it on</strong>. If it was previously used, we <strong>restore it to factory settings</strong> (Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Reset options -&gt; Erase all data (factory reset) -&gt; Erase all data). I think it’s stating the obvious, but I’ll write it anyway - a factory reset results in the deletion of all user data from the device, so if you have anything important on it, you need to back it up.</li>
  <li>We must <strong>go through the basic setup</strong> until we see the home screen. We do the absolute minimum. Here is a breakdown of the steps:
    <ul>
      <li>on the welcome screen, you can change the language to whatever suits you</li>
      <li>we skip the GSM services setup (SIM card)</li>
      <li>we don’t connect to Wi-Fi, so we skip this step too</li>
      <li>the date and time settings should be correct</li>
      <li>we turn off all Google Services (location, scanning, sending diagnostic data) and accept</li>
      <li>we don’t need to do anything with the warranty terms, so just the Next button</li>
      <li>we accept the Legal Terms</li>
      <li>we set some easy PIN, e.g., 12345</li>
      <li>there is no need to waste time setting up biometrics, so we politely decline and skip fingerprint and face scan</li>
      <li>a moment of waiting</li>
      <li>we skip the tutorial</li>
      <li>swipe up and we’re done, we are on the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First of all, we need to make sure that <strong>our phone’s software is updated</strong> to the latest available version. For this purpose, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; System update</strong>. If necessary, we update.</li>
  <li>Next, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; find the Build number field</strong> and tap it 7 times until we see the message <strong>You are now a developer</strong>. In the meantime, the phone will ask for the PIN we set during the phone setup.</li>
  <li>We go back and now enter <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer options -&gt; turn on the OEM unlocking option</strong>. The phone will ask for the PIN again. After entering it, we still have to confirm that we definitely want to remove the lock.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</h3>

<ol>
  <li>We start the bootloader unlocking process by <strong>turning off the phone</strong>.</li>
  <li>When the screen goes completely dark, <strong>we simultaneously press and hold the power and volume down buttons</strong> until the text-based <strong>Fastboot Mode</strong> interface appears. If the phone starts up normally, it means we performed one of the earlier steps incorrectly.</li>
  <li>We connect the <strong>phone to the computer</strong>.</li>
  <li>We go to the computer and open the browser (based on the Chromium engine) to the address <strong><a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web">https://grapheneos.org/install/web</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>We go to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a> section and press the <strong>Unlock bootloader</strong> button.</li>
  <li>A window with a list of devices to choose from will pop up in the browser. There should basically be only one item on it, and that should be our Pixel. <strong>We select it and press the Connect button</strong>.</li>
  <li>Changes will occur on the phone’s display. A message will appear asking to confirm that we actually want to unlock the bootloader. To do this, we must press one of the volume buttons so that instead of <strong>Do not unlock the bootlader</strong>, <strong>Unlock the bootlader</strong> appears. At this point, we can confirm by <strong>pressing the power button</strong>.</li>
  <li>If everything succeeded, among the data displayed in Fastboot Mode we should see <strong>Device state: unlocked</strong> (in red).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="downloading-and-flashing-the-system-image">Downloading and flashing the system image</h3>

<ol>
  <li>On the GrapheneOS website, we scroll down to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#obtaining-factory-images">Obtaining factory images</a> section and press the <strong>Download release</strong> button. If the phone is still connected to the computer, the website will decide on its own which system image to download.</li>
  <li>We wait for the download to finish. It is obvious that the time needed for this depends directly on the speed of the internet connection.</li>
  <li>When the download is complete, we can go to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-factory-images">Flashing factory images</a> section below and press <strong>Flash release</strong>.</li>
  <li>Spit over your left shoulder now, hold your breath, and under no circumstances unplug the phone from the computer. Best not to touch either device at all.</li>
  <li>When the process is complete, the phone will restart itself and return to the Fastboot Mode interface. In the browser, we will see the message <strong>Flashed …</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="re-locking-the-bootloader">Re-locking the bootloader</h3>

<p>Locking the bootloader is crucial because it enables the full operation of the Verified Boot feature. It also prevents the use of fastboot mode to flash, format, or wipe partitions. Verified Boot detects any modifications to the OS partitions and blocks the reading of any altered or corrupted data. If changes are detected, the system uses error correction data to attempt to recover the original data, which is then verified again – thanks to this mechanism, the system is resilient to accidental (non-malicious) file corruption.</p>

<p>However, before re-securing the bootloader, I recommend checking if the system was flashed correctly and everything works as it should, because if it doesn’t, locking the bootloader might brick (completely block, or even damage) the phone. Therefore:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Being in Fastboot Mode, when we see the <strong>Start</strong> message, we press the power button, which will cause the system to start normally. If we don’t see <strong>Start</strong> at the height of the power button, we have to press the volume buttons and find this option.</li>
  <li>When the phone starts up, we can immediately perform the basic setup. The bootloader won’t run away.</li>
  <li>This is a standard procedure, so we will only go through it briefly:
    <ul>
      <li>welcome screen</li>
      <li>we choose the <strong>language</strong></li>
      <li>we choose the time zone and thus set the <strong>date and time</strong></li>
      <li>we connect to <strong>Wi-Fi</strong></li>
      <li>if you can, you can immediately set up the <strong>SIM card</strong>, but you can also postpone it for later</li>
      <li>I recommend turning off the <strong>location service</strong>, because it’s better to configure it calmly later by granting permissions only to apps that really need it</li>
      <li>securing the phone with a <strong>fingerprint</strong>; I personally am an advocate of this solution, so I recommend using it, GrapheneOS does not (yet) support face unlock, so fingerprint and a standard password are the only methods we have to choose from (of course I reject pattern unlock right at the start as a form of screen lock that cannot even in good conscience be called any security)</li>
      <li>I assume that if you are reading this post, you are a graphene freshman and you have no <strong>backup</strong> to restore, so we just skip this step</li>
      <li><strong>Start</strong> button and we are on the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If everything is working correctly, you can now go ahead and turn off the phone and turn it on while holding the power button and volume down, just like we did earlier.</li>
  <li>We land back in Fastboot Mode. I assume the phone was connected to the computer the whole time (if not, reconnect it). We return to the browser on the computer. We find the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#locking-the-bootloader">Locking the bootloader</a> section and press the <strong>Lock bootloader</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Again, confirmation of this operation on the phone is required. It looks analogous to unlocking, except this time, using the volume buttons, we have to make the <strong>Lock the bootloader</strong> option active and confirm it with the power button.</li>
  <li>The result should be a change of <strong>Device state</strong> to <strong>locked</strong> (in green).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="restoring-the-oem-lock">Restoring the OEM lock</h3>

<p>The final step before starting to play with the new system is reapplying the OEM lock.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just like when removing the lock, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; find the Build number field</strong> and tap it 7 times until we see the message <strong>You are now a developer</strong>. In the meantime, the phone will ask for the PIN we set during the phone setup.</li>
  <li>We go back and now enter <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer options -&gt; turn off the OEM unlocking option</strong>. The phone will ask us to restart to change this setting, but for now we cancel this request, because we still want to <strong>completely turn off Developer options</strong>, which is done by unchecking the box next to the first option at the very top, <strong>Use developer options</strong>.</li>
  <li>Now we can <strong>restart the device</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-vision-of-using-grapheneos">My vision of using GrapheneOS</h2>

<p>Now the real fun begins. You’ll hear/read as many opinions on what you should and shouldn’t do regarding GrapheneOS hardening as there are people. Some are conservative, while others approach the topic a bit more liberally. In my opinion, there is no one right path, and everyone should dig around, test things out, and decide what suits them and fits their security profile. You’ll quickly find out that <strong>GrapheneOS is really one big compromise between convenience and privacy</strong>. While this same rule applies to everything belonging to the digital world, it’s only in this case that you’ll truly notice it, because <strong>GrapheneOS will show you how many things you can control, which you can’t do using conventional Android</strong>.
I don’t intend to use this post to promote some “one and only” method of using GrapheneOS. I’ll simply present how I use this system. This way, I’ll show the basics to people fresh to the topic, maybe I’ll manage to suggest an interesting trick they didn’t know to those who have been users for a while, and on a third note, maybe some expert will show up who, after reading my ramblings, will suggest something interesting or point out what I’m doing wrong / could do better. I’m sure that’s the case, since my adventure with GrapheneOS has practically only been going on for 3 months. I warn you right away that I’m not sure if I’ll be able to maintain a logical train of thought, as I’ll probably jump around topics a bit. <strong>The subject of GrapheneOS is vast</strong> and in today’s post I’ll only manage to slightly touch upon it.</p>

<h3 id="additional-user-profile">Additional user profile</h3>

<p>One of the first things I did after booting up the freshly installed system was to create a second user profile. This is done in <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Multiple users</strong>. The idea is for this feature to allow two (or more) people to use one phone, each having a separate profile with their own settings, apps, etc. Who in their right mind does that? While I can imagine sharing a home tablet, sharing a phone completely eludes me. It therefore seems like a dead feature, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>For me, it works like this: on the <strong><em>Owner</em></strong> user, because that’s the name of the main account created automatically with the system, I installed the <strong>Google Play Store</strong> along with <strong>Google Play services</strong> and <strong>GmsCompatConfig</strong>. This is done through the <strong>App Store</strong> application, which is a component of the GrapheneOS system. Please don’t confuse this with Apple’s app store, even though the name is the same. From the Play Store I only installed the following applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mBank</strong> - paying via contactless BLIK through NFC is possible only having Google services installed and only works for me on the user profile with administrator privileges (Owner),</li>
  <li><strong>Mój T-Mobile</strong> - without Google services, the Magenta Moments tab didn’t work for me at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it. As you can see, this profile serves me only for apps that absolutely require integration with Google services. In practice, I switch to it only when I want to pay contactlessly in a store, which I actually do rarely lately, because if there’s an option, I pay using BLIK codes. Right after switching from Samsung there were more apps on this profile, but one by one I successively gave up on those that made me dependent on the big G.</p>

<p>It’s on the <strong>second profile</strong>, which let’s assume I called <em>Tommy</em>, that I keep my entire digital life. What does this give me? For instance, the main profile cannot be easily deleted, but the additional one can. Let’s imagine a situation where I need to quickly wipe my phone, but in a way that its basic functions still work, i.e., without a full factory reset. An example could be, say, arriving in the USA and undergoing immigration control. They want access to my phone, so I delete the <em>Tommy</em> user, switch to the <em>Owner</em> user, and hand them the phone. It makes calls, sends SMS messages, even has a banking app, so theoretically it shouldn’t arouse suspicion. However, it lacks all my contacts, a browser with my visited pages history, a password manager, and messengers with chat histories. This is rather a drastic scenario, but not really that improbable, as actions like searching a phone upon arrival in the States are something that happens on a daily basis. Besides, the basic rule of security is <strong>not to use an account with administrator privileges on a daily basis</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="obtainium">Obtainium</h3>

<p>On GrapheneOS, Obtainium is my <strong>primary aggregator for obtaining .apk installation files and automating app updates</strong>. It’s like the Google Play Store, but privacy-respecting and for open-source applications. It would be a sin to use GrapheneOS and not at least try to switch to open-source apps. Below I present a list of apps that I use. Additionally, I’m tossing in links to the source code repositories of each of them.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-my-open-source-applications">List of my open-source applications</h4>

<h3 id="aurora-store">Aurora Store</h3>

<p>I have a few apps that are not open-source, but I still need them. In this case, I don’t download them from the Google Play Store, but exactly from the <strong>Aurora Store</strong>, which I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Aurora Store is an open-source client of the Google Play store (I guess you could call it a frontend) that <strong>allows downloading applications from Google servers without needing Google services</strong> (GMS) on the phone.</p>

<p>The Internet characterizes this solution as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong> - you don’t need to log in with a Google account to download free apps (you can use built-in anonymous accounts).</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - you install original .apk files straight from Google servers, not from unverified third-party sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality</strong> - allows bypassing regional restrictions and installing apps that Google Play considers “incompatible” with a given device.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - the entire application code is transparent and auditable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds perfect, right? A bit, yes, but unfortunately not everything holds up completely. I have <strong>two main complaints</strong> about Aurora Store.</p>

<p>With these anonymous accounts, the thing is that <strong>sometimes they work, and sometimes they don’t</strong>, due to limits that are unreachable with a normal account used by one person, but when a thousand people download apps from one account at once, it starts to get suspicious, and the limits are exceeded quite quickly. Using Aurora Store violates the Google Play Store terms of service, so on the other hand <strong>if we use our Google account, it might be temporarily blocked</strong> or permanently banned. Some option here is to create a “burner” account just for this, but that takes away some of our privacy, because Google can still index us based on what we downloaded. Anonymous accounts in this case provide almost complete anonymity, because then we are just a drop in the ocean.</p>

<p>When it comes to security, yes, in theory we download .apk files from a verified source, but <strong>only under the condition that the Aurora Store creators don’t serve us a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man in the Middle</a> attack</strong>. The decision whether you trust the creators of this app is up to you.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-apps-whose-functionality-without-gms-i-have-verified">List of apps whose functionality without GMS I have verified</h4>

<p>Below I present a list of applications that I downloaded from the Aurora Store, checked, and can confirm that they work without GMS (Google Mobile Services).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Allegro</strong> - shopping</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Music</strong> - yes, I didn’t manage to give this up when ditching the iPhone</li>
  <li><strong>Apple TV</strong> - comes in a bundle, but if it didn’t I’d cancel the subscription, because Stremio is enough for me</li>
  <li><strong>Biedronka</strong> - grocery promos</li>
  <li><strong>Bolt</strong> - taxis</li>
  <li><strong>Booksy</strong> - barber</li>
  <li><strong>BPme</strong> - fuel promos</li>
  <li><strong>CityParkApp</strong> - city parking</li>
  <li><strong>Decathlon</strong> - I got rid of it, but it worked</li>
  <li><strong>DeepL</strong> - translator, is there any open-source alternative that is equally good?</li>
  <li><strong>Discord</strong> - after recent events I’ll probably get rid of it, because I basically don’t use it</li>
  <li><strong>Duolingo</strong> - the owl! learning Italian together is a daily routine for my daughters</li>
  <li><strong>DWService</strong> - remote desktop</li>
  <li><strong>Ekstraliga</strong> (speedway) - I’m a psycho fan</li>
  <li><strong>epark</strong> - city parking</li>
  <li><strong>Formula 1</strong> - I’m a psycho fan</li>
  <li><strong>Geoportal Mobile</strong> - spatial development plans, buggy as hell app, but works better than the mobile web version</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - I know there is the OpenHub alternative, but it crashes for me after logging into GH</li>
  <li><strong>My municipality’s app</strong> - because I need to know when they’ll collect my trash :)</li>
  <li><strong>Jakdojade</strong> - bus schedules</li>
  <li><strong>Lidl Plus</strong> - grocery promos</li>
  <li><strong>LiveKid</strong> - communication with my daughter’s kindergarten</li>
  <li><strong>Messanger</strong> - shame on me, but unfortunately I have friends who can’t imagine life without FB…</li>
  <li><strong>OLX</strong> - local classifieds, I basically only use it for notifications</li>
  <li><strong>OpenVPN</strong> - I use it as a tunnel to my home network</li>
  <li><strong>park4night</strong> - great app for finding parking on vacation (not only in a camper)</li>
  <li><strong>Pepper</strong> - bargain hunting</li>
  <li><strong>Perplexity</strong> - I switched to Gemini, but I confirm it works</li>
  <li><strong>Synology Photos</strong> - my home photo gallery on a NAS</li>
  <li><strong>Pocket Casts</strong> - podcasts, I plan to migrate to AntennaPod</li>
  <li><strong>Reddit</strong> - honestly I don’t know why I need the app, but it works</li>
  <li><strong>Reolink</strong> - home monitoring</li>
  <li><strong>SmartLife</strong> - anyone who has anything smart from China knows what this is for</li>
  <li><strong>Tapo</strong> - home cameras</li>
  <li><strong>Termius</strong> - here I’m also looking for some open-source alternative</li>
  <li><strong>Tether</strong> - managing TP-Link routers</li>
  <li><strong>TickTick</strong> - to-do lists, it’s hard for me to find a sensible alternative that is multiplatform and has all the features I need</li>
  <li><strong>TV Time</strong> - tracking what series and movies I’ve watched (I might actually be interested in finding an alternative here too)</li>
  <li><strong>Zepp</strong> - dedicated app for the Amazfit Balance smartwatch I use</li>
  <li><strong>ZeroTier</strong> - I used it instead of OpenVPN back when I didn’t have fiber optic yet, just radio internet</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-control-over-app-permissions">Full control over app permissions</h3>

<p>GrapheneOS allows for full control over what permissions each application can have. For example, in conventional Android forks, every application by default has granted <strong>Network</strong> (internet access) and <strong>Sensors</strong> (access to all sensors like the accelerometer) permissions.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever wondered <strong>if all apps on a phone need Internet access?</strong> Indeed, in the vast majority of cases, a mobile app without network access is useless, but you can’t generalize like that, because for example, the previously mentioned <strong>FUTO Voice Input</strong> uses a local LLM to convert speech to text, which works offline on the device. Why would such an app need Internet access then? For nothing, so <strong>it shouldn’t have such permission</strong>. Now let’s take apps like FairScan (document scanning), Catima (loyalty card aggregator), Collabora Office (office suite), or Librera (ebook reader). They too <strong>do not need Internet access!</strong></p>

<p>The situation looks even more bizarre when you look at which apps actually need access to all of our device’s sensors. If we think about it calmly, we’ll conclude that in this specific case it’s completely the opposite of the previous one, meaning <strong>practically no app needs this information</strong>. And I remind you that <strong>by default on Android with Google services, all apps have such permissions</strong>.</p>

<p>To manage a given application’s permissions, just <strong>tap and hold on its icon</strong>, select <strong>App info</strong> from the pop-up menu, and find the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab. A list categorized by things like - <strong>Allowed</strong>, <strong>Ask every time</strong>, and <strong>Not allowed</strong> will appear. I recommend reviewing this list for each app separately right after installing it. This is <strong>the foundation of GrapheneOS hardening</strong>.</p>

<p>A collective menu where you can view specific permissions and which apps have them granted is available in <strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; privacy -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Permission manager</strong>. Another interesting place is the <strong>Privacy dashboard</strong> available in the same location. It’s a tool that shows not only app permissions, but also how often a given app reaches for the permissions granted to it.</p>

<h3 id="private-space">Private space</h3>

<p>In GrapheneOS we don’t only have user profiles, but each user can also have something called a <strong>Private space</strong>. I encountered something similar on Samsung, where it was called <strong>Secure Folder</strong>, so I assume this might just be an Android feature implemented differently by each manufacturer.</p>

<p>Private space is turned on in <strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; privacy -&gt; Private space</strong>. It acts like a sort of separated sandbox that is part of the environment you use, but at the same time is isolated from it. For me, it’s a place that gives me quick access to apps that nevertheless require Google services. You might ask - why then do I keep the mBank and T-Mobile apps on the <strong>Owner</strong> user if I could keep them here? Well, for reasons unknown to me, I’m unable to configure my private space so that paying with contactless BLIK via NFC works correctly in it. The same goes for Magenta Moments from T-Mobile, which don’t work correctly despite GMS being installed in the private space.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-apps-in-my-private-space">List of apps in my private space</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - I use it as a cloud to share files with clients</li>
  <li><strong>Finax</strong> - saving for retirement under PEPP</li>
  <li><strong>IKO</strong> - PKO BP bank app, treasury bonds plus PPK</li>
  <li><strong>InPost Mobile</strong> - parcel lockers, location doesn’t work for me in the private space either (the phone doesn’t send its position to the app), so I use QR codes like some Neanderthal</li>
  <li><strong>mBank</strong> - again, because while contactless payment doesn’t work for me here, other banking app functions work normally (including BLIK code payments, as well as confirming transactions with biometrics)</li>
  <li><strong>mObywatel</strong> - at first I kept this app in the main profile as downloaded from Aurora Store and everything somewhat worked, but every now and then the app caught a total freeze and stopped responding, I think it might be related to the fact that it does send some Google services-related requests in the background and doesn’t respond until such a request times out, I have this on my list to investigate</li>
  <li><strong>mojeIKP</strong> - lately I’ve been having more and more health problems, I’m clearly not as indestructible anymore, so such a geriatric app is simply essential for me</li>
  <li><strong>Mój T-Mobile</strong> - duplicated just like the mBank app, because everything works except Magenta Moments</li>
  <li><strong>Orlen Vitay</strong> - this app didn’t work for me without GMS, so sort of a D minus for Orlen, because the app from BP doesn’t have such a problem</li>
  <li><strong>Revolut</strong> - basically it probably doesn’t require GMS, but I decided I’ll just keep all financial apps in the private space</li>
  <li><strong>Santander</strong> - another banking app…</li>
  <li><strong>Play Store</strong> - I have to download all these apps from somewhere, doing it via Aurora Store in the private space wouldn’t make sense since I have the whole Google services package installed here anyway</li>
  <li><strong>XTB</strong> - another investing app… works without GMS, but like I said, I keep all financial ones in one place</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Oof… I did it again, sorry. I’m just counting the characters and it comes out to just under 35,000… I’ll probably break that barrier with these next few sentences. Well, long again, but purely meaty again, so I don’t think anyone has reason to complain. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve only touched upon the topic of GrapheneOS, which is extensive, and it’s a good thing, because it’s a <strong>great system</strong>, and the biggest <strong>respect goes to the people behind this project</strong>. It’s thanks to them that we even have the option of at least partially <strong>freeing ourselves from Google (Android) and Apple (iOS)</strong>. Therefore, I highly invite you to the final chapter of this post.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-the-grapheneos-project">Supporting the GrapheneOS project</h2>

<p>Finally, I would like to encourage you to <strong>support the GrapheneOS project</strong>. The developers behind it are doing a really great job and in my opinion deserve to have some money thrown at them. Information on where and how this can be done can be found <strong><a href="https://grapheneos.org/donate">here</a></strong>.</p>
