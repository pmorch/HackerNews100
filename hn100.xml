  <article>
    <p>Now that I’ve been retired for a couple of days, I think I can finally tell this story of how I was – very briefly – <strong><a href="mailto:steve@next.com">steve@next.com</a></strong></p>
<p>And Steve Jobs sent me an email saying <strong>“Great idea, thank you."</strong></p>
<p>Wait, what? What was the great idea?</p>
<h2 id="new-guy-at-next">new guy at NeXT</h2>
<p>In October of 1991, I was a new Systems Engineer at NeXT.  NeXT, of course, was the company Steve Jobs had founded after leaving Apple in 1985, and which <a href="https://blog.hayman.net/2021/12/20/apple-next-years-ago-today.html">eventually merged back into Apple</a> in 1996.  I was one of three employees in Canada, and I think NeXT had about 400 people total.</p>
<h2 id="nextmail">NeXTMail</h2>
<p>Mail on the NeXT Computer was pretty amazing in 1991.  Multimedia!  Fonts!  Attachments!  Sounds!  It’s hard to overstate how cool that was compared to the command line plain-text email everybody was used to.
Every NeXT user got this email from Steve when they started up their computer.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2082/2025/welcome-to-the-next-world.jpg" alt="Welcome to the NeXT World." title="Welcome to the NeXT World.jpg" width="432" height="600">
<p>That message included an attachment of what NeXT called <em>Lip Service</em>, the crazy idea that you could embed an audio file inside an email message.  Crazy.</p>
<audio controls="">
  <source src="https://blog.hayman.net/uploads/2025/sj.m4a" type="audio/mp4">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<h2 id="i-have-an-idea">i have an idea</h2>
<p>NeXT automatically set every employee up with a first-initial last-name address in the usual way, so I was <code>shayman@next.com</code>, and the big guy was <code>sjobs@next.com</code>.</p>
<p>A few colleagues had somehow acquired cooler email aliases - single letter things, or their first name, or a nickname or an easier to spell version, or whatever.  Turns out NeXT had set up some sort of form where you could request an email alias that would redirect to whatever your real email address was.</p>
<p>I also noticed that even though there were seven or eight people at NeXT named <em>Steve</em>, nobody was using the email alias <code>steve@next.com</code>.</p>
<p>So late one Friday night, two weeks into the job, I figured, naively, what the heck, nobody else seems to want it, so I filled in the form asking for <code>steve@next.com</code> to be forwarded to me, <code>shayman@next.com</code>.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind was a vague idea that maybe somebody would have to approve this.  But no, it all got set up automatically, and …</p>
<h2 id="that-was-a-bad-idea">that was a bad idea</h2>
<p>well, suddenly a whole cavalcade of misdirected email was winding up in my inbox.  People sent to <code>steve@next.com</code> who <em>thought</em> they were writing to Steve Jobs, and ordinarily it would have bounced back and they’d realize they’d mistyped the address.  I’m getting email from reporters, from other CEOs, from finance people …</p>
<p>Of course I didn’t read any of it.</p>
<p>But I did start panicking.  OMG I’m going to get fired, this was a terrible idea, I should have foreseen this, what am I going to do now? Once they find out, I’m done!</p>
<h2 id="frantic-backpedalling">frantic backpedalling</h2>
<p>As a last desperate gasp, I filled in the form AGAIN, but this time asking for <code>steve@next.com</code> to be forwarded to <code>sjobs@next.com</code> instead of me.</p>
<p>And that went through. Phew.  I figured I better fess up and tell Steve Jobs what I’d done, so I sent him an email, saying approximately</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Hi - I'm new here. I did something dumb and  
set up a mail alias so that steve@next.com  
would go to me.   
This was a bad idea, I'm sorry.   
I've changed it to steve@next.com goes to you,   
not to me. I think that makes more sense.  

My apologies.    
Signed, new guy.
</code></pre><h2 id="a-reply-i-will-cherish">a reply i will cherish</h2>
<p>and I got this response.  This was the only email I ever personally received from Steve Jobs.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2082/2025/stevenext.com.jpg" alt="Email from SJ to me saying 'Great idea, thank you.'" title="steve@next.com.jpg" width="573" height="518">
<p><strong>From: Steve Jobs</strong><br>
<strong>To: Steve Hayman</strong><br>
Great idea, thank you.</p>
<p>I’ve often thought I should print and frame this email, and let people wonder what the Great Idea was.  “We should merge back with Apple!”  “How about a music player that fit in your pocket?”  “We should build something with a touch screen.”    no, nothing quite that cool, but still, it’s one of my favourite messages.</p>
<h2 id="postscript">postscript</h2>
<p>I started my career with an email from Steve Jobs, and I ended with one from Tim Cook. I’ve been a pretty lucky guy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Chicago native Cardinal Prevost elected pope, takes name Leo XIV"><div>
			<p>VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, the Chicago-born prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops under Pope Francis, was elected the 267th pope May 8 and took the name Pope Leo XIV.</p>
<p>He is the first North American to be elected pope and, before the conclave, was the U.S. cardinal most mentioned as a potential successor of St. Peter.</p>
<p>The white smoke poured from the chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at 6:07 p.m. Rome time and a few minutes later the bells of St. Peter’s Basilica began to ring.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes later the Vatican police band and two dozen members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard marched into St. Peter’s Square. They soon were joined by the marching band of the Italian Carabinieri, a branch of military police, and by units of the other branches of the Italian military.</p>

</div>
<p>As soon as news began to spread, people from all over Rome ran to join the tens of thousands who were already in the square for the smoke watch. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri was among them.</p>
<p>French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, protodeacon of the College of Cardinals, appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at 7:12 p.m. He told the crowd: “I announce to you a great joy. We have a pope (‘Habemus papam’),” saying the cardinal’s name in Latin and announcing the name by which he will be called.</p>
<p>Cardinals over the age of 80, who were not eligible to enter the conclave, joined the crowd in the square. Among them were Cardinals Seán P. O’Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston; Donald W. Wuerl, the retired archbishop of Washington; and Marc Ouellet, retired prefect of the Congregation for Bishops.</p>
<p><a href="https://catholicreview.org/u-s-cardinals-resume-demeanor-land-him-on-papabile-lists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A longtime missionary in Peru, the 69-year-old pope holds both U.S. and Peruvian citizenship.</a></p>
<p>La Repubblica, the major Italian daily, described him April 25 as “cosmopolitan and shy,” but also said he was “appreciated by conservatives and progressives. He has global visibility in a conclave in which few (cardinals) know each other.”</p>
<p>That visibility comes from the fact that as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops for the past two years, he was instrumental in helping Pope Francis choose bishops for many Latin-rite dioceses, he met hundreds of bishops during their “ad limina” visits to Rome and was called to assist the world’s Latin-rite bishops “in all matters concerning the correct and fruitful exercise of the pastoral office entrusted to them.”</p>
<p>The new pope was serving as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, when Pope Francis called him to the Vatican in January 2023.</p>
<p>During a talk at St. Jude Parish in Chicago in August, the then-cardinal said Pope Francis nominated him “specifically because he did not want someone from the Roman Curia to take on this role. He wanted a missionary; he wanted someone from outside; he wanted someone who would come in with a different perspective.”</p>
<p>In a March 2024 interview with Catholic News Service, he said Pope Francis’ decision in 2022 to name three women as full members of the dicastery, giving them input on the selection of bishops “contributes significantly to the process of discernment in looking for who we hope are the best candidates to serve the church in episcopal ministry.”</p>
<p>To deter attitudes of clericalism among bishops, he said, “it’s important to find men who are truly interested in serving, in preaching the Gospel, not just with eloquent words, but rather with the example and witness they give.”</p>

</div>
<p>In fact, the cardinal said, Pope Francis’ “most effective and important” bulwark against clericalism was his being “a pastor who preaches by gesture.”</p>
<p>In an interview in 2023 with Vatican News, then-Cardinal Prevost spoke about the essential leadership quality of a bishop.</p>
<p>“Pope Francis has spoken of four types of closeness: closeness to God, to brother bishops, to priests and to all God’s people,” he said. “One must not give in to the temptation to live isolated, separated in a palace, satisfied with a certain social level or a certain level within the church.”</p>
<p>“And we must not hide behind an idea of authority that no longer makes sense today,” he said. “The authority we have is to serve, to accompany priests, to be pastors and teachers.”</p>
<p>As prefect of the dicastery then-Cardinal Prevost also served as president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, where nearly 40% of the world’s Catholics reside.</p>
<p>A Chicago native, he also served as prior general of the Augustinians and spent more than two decades serving in Peru, first as an Augustinian missionary and later as bishop of Chiclayo.</p>
<p>Soon after coming to Rome to head the dicastery, he told Vatican News that bishops have a special mission of promoting the unity of the church.</p>
<p>“The lack of unity is a wound that the church suffers, a very painful one,” he said in May 2023. “Divisions and polemics in the church do not help anything. We bishops especially must accelerate this movement toward unity, toward communion in the church.”</p>
<p>In September, a television program in Peru reported on the allegations of three women who said that then-Bishop Prevost failed to act against a priest who sexually abused them as minors. The diocese strongly denied the accusation, pointing out that he personally met with the victims in April 2022, removed the priest from his parish, suspended him from ministry and conducted a local investigation that was then forwarded to the Vatican. The Vatican said there was insufficient evidence to proceed, as did the local prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>Pope Leo was born Sept. 14, 1955, in Chicago, Illinois. He holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the Augustinian-run Villanova University in Pennsylvania and joined the order in 1977, making his solemn vows in 1981. He holds a degree in theology from the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago and a doctorate from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.</p>
<p>He joined the Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985 and largely worked in the country until 1999 when he was elected head of the Augustinians’ Chicago-based province. From 2001 to 2013, he served as prior general of the worldwide order. In 2014, Pope Francis named him bishop of Chiclayo, in northern Peru, and the pope asked him also to be apostolic administrator of Callao, Peru, from April 2020 to May 2021.</p>
<p>The new pope speaks English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese and can read Latin and German.</p>

<p>Reservoir sampling is a technique for selecting a fair random sample when you
don't know the size of the set you're sampling from. By the end of this essay
you will know:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you would need reservoir sampling.</li>
<li>The mathematics behind how it works, using only basic operations:
subtraction, multiplication, and division. No math notation, I promise.</li>
<li>A simple way to implement reservoir sampling if you want to use it.</li>

<h2 id="sampling-when-you-know-the-size"><a href="#sampling-when-you-know-the-size">#</a>
Sampling when you know the size</h2>
<p>In front of you are 10 playing cards and I ask you to pick 3 at random. How do
you do it?</p>
<p>The first technique that might come to mind from your childhood is to mix them
all up in the middle. Then you can straighten them out and pick the first 3.
You can see this happen below by clicking "Shuffle."</p>

<p>Every time you click "Shuffle," the chart below tracks what the first 3 cards
were.</p>
<s-card-select-bar-chart id="random-shuffle-chart" target="random-shuffle">
</s-card-select-bar-chart>
<p>At first you'll notice some cards are selected more than others, but if you
keep going it will even out. All cards have an equal chance of being selected.
This makes it "fair."</p>
<p>Click "Shuffle 100 times" until the chart evens out.  You can reset the chart if
you'd like to start over.</p>

<p>This method works fine with 10 cards, but what if you had 1 million cards?
Mixing those up won't be easy. Instead, we could use a random number generator
to pick 3 indices. These would be our 3 chosen cards.</p>

<p>We no longer have to move all of the cards, and if we click the "Select" button
enough times we'll see that this method is just as fair as the mix-up method.</p>
<s-card-select-bar-chart id="random-select-chart" target="random-select">
</s-card-select-bar-chart>

<p>I'm stretching the analogy a little here. It would take a long time to count
through the deck to get to, say, index 436,234. But when it's an array in
memory, computers have no trouble finding an element by its index.</p>
<p>Now let me throw you a curveball: what if I were to show you 1 card at a time,
and you had to pick 1 at random?</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="confused">
  How many cards are you going to show me?
</s-dog>
<p>That's the curveball: you don't know.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="default">
  Can I hold on to all the cards you give me and then pick 1 after you stop?
</s-dog>
<p>No, you can only hold on to 1 card at a time. You're free to swap your card
with the newest one each time I show you a card, but you can only hold one and
you can't go back to a card you've already seen.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="concerned">
  Then it's impossible! Why would I ever need to do this anyway?
</s-dog>
<p>Believe it or not, this is a real problem and it has a real and elegant
solution.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you're building a log collection service. Text logs, not
wooden ones. This service receives log messages from other services and
stores them so that it's easy to search them in one place.</p>
<p>One of the things you need to think about when building a service like this is
what do you do when another service starts sending you way too many logs.  Maybe
it's a bad release, maybe one of your videos goes viral. Whatever the reason, it
threatens to overwhelm your log collection service.</p>
<p>Let's simulate this. Below you can see a stream of logs that experiences
periodic spikes. A horizontal line indicates the <h->threshold</h-> of logs per
second that the log collection service can handle, which in this example is 5
logs per second.</p>
<!--
Yes, this is not web scale.
-->


<p>You can see that every so often, logs per second spikes above the
<h->threshold</h->. One way to deal with this is "sampling." Deciding to send
only a fraction of the logs to the log collection service.  Let's send 10% of
the logs.</p>
<p>Below we will see the same simulation again, but this time logs that don't get
sent to our log collection service will be greyed out. The graph has 2 lines: a
black line tracks <h->sent logs</h->, the logs that are sent to our log
collection service, and a grey line tracks <h->total logs</h->.</p>


<p>The rate of <h->sent logs</h-> never exceeds the <h->threshold</h->, so we never
overwhelm our log collection service. However, in the quieter periods we're
throwing away 90% of the logs when we don't need to!</p>
<p>What we really want is to send <em>at most</em> 5 logs per second.  This would mean
that during quiet periods you get all the logs, but during spikes you discard
logs to protect the log collection service.</p>
<p>The simple way to achieve this would be to send the first 5 logs you see each
second, but this isn't fair. You aren't giving all logs an equal chance of being
selected.</p>
<h2 id="sampling-when-you-don-t-know-the-size"><a href="#sampling-when-you-don-t-know-the-size">#</a>
Sampling when you don't know the size</h2>
<p>We instead want to pick a fair sample of all the logs we see each second. The
problem is that we don't know how many we will see. Reservoir sampling is an
algorithm that solves this exact problem.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="confused">
  1 second isn't a long time, can't we just store all the messages we see and
  then use the select method from way back up there?
</s-dog>
<p>You <em>could</em>, but why live with that uncertainty?  You'd be holding on to an
unknown number of logs in memory. A sufficiently big spike could cause you
problems.  Reservoir sampling solves this problem, and does so without ever
using more memory than you ask it to.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our curveball of me showing you 1 card at a time.  Here's a
recap of the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'll draw cards one at a time from a deck.</li>
<li>Each time I show you a card, you have to choose to hold it or discard it.</li>
<li>If you were already holding a card, you discard your held card before
replacing it with the new card.</li>
<li>At any point I can stop drawing cards and whatever card you're holding is the
one you've chosen.</li>
</ol>
<p>How would you play this game in a way that ensures all cards have been given an
equal chance to be selected when I decide to stop?</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="triumphant">
  How about we flip a coin every new card? If it's heads, we keep the card we
  have. If it's tails, we swap it out for the new card.
</s-dog>
<p>You're on the right track. Let's have a look at how the coin flip idea plays out
in practice. Below you see a deck of cards. Clicking "Deal" will draw a card and
50% of the time it will go to the <h->discard pile</h-> on the right, and 50% of
the time it will become your <h->held card</h-> in the center, with any
previously held card moving to the discard pile.</p>

<p>The problem is that while the <h->hold</h-> vs <h->discard</h-> counts are
roughly equal, which feels fair, later cards are much more likely to be held
when I stop than earlier cards. The first card drawn has to win 10 coin flips to
still be in your hand after the 10th card is drawn. The last card only has to
win 1.</p>
<p>Scrub the slider below to see how the chances change as we draw more cards. Each
bar represents a card in the deck, and the height of the bar is the chance we're
holding that card when I stop. Below the slider are the chances we're
holding the first card drawn vs. the last card drawn.</p>

<p>Anything older than 15 cards ago is has a less than 0.01% chance of being held
when I stop.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="concerned">
  You said I was on the right track! How can this be the right track when I'm
  more likely to win the lottery than to be holding the card I saw 24 draws ago?
</s-dog>
<p>Because believe it or not, we only have to make one small change to this idea
to make it fair.</p>
<p>Instead of flipping a coin to decide if we'll hold the card or not, instead we
give each new card a <code>1/n</code> chance of being held, where <code>n</code> is the number of
cards we've seen so far.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="concerned">
  Wait, that's it? That makes it fair?
</s-dog>
<p>Yep! In order to be fair, every card must have an equal chance of being
selected. So for the 2nd card, we want both cards to have a <code>1/2</code> chance.  For
the 3rd card, we want all 3 cards to have a <code>1/3</code> chance. For the 4th card, we
want all 4 cards to have a <code>1/4</code> chance, and so on. So if we use <code>1/n</code> for the
new card, we can at least say that the new card has had a fair shot.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the chances as you draw more cards with this new
method.</p>

<s-dog position="right" mode="confused">
  I get how each <b>new</b> card has the right chance of being selected, but how
  does that make the <b>older</b> cards fair?
</s-dog>
<p>So far we've focused on the chance of the new card being selected, but we also
need to consider the chance of the card you're holding staying in your hand.
Let's walk through the numbers.</p>
<h3 id="card-1"><a href="#card-1">#</a>
Card 1</h3>
<p>The first card is easy: we're not holding anything, so we always choose to hold
the first card. The chance we're holding this card is <code>1/1</code>, or <code>100%</code>.</p>

<h3 id="card-2"><a href="#card-2">#</a>
Card 2</h3>
<p>This time we have a real choice. We can keep hold of the card we have, or
replace it with the new one. We've said that we're going to do this with a <code>1/n</code>
chance, where <code>n</code> is the number of cards we've seen so far. So our chance of
replacing the first card is <code>1/2</code>, or <code>50%</code>, and our chance of keeping hold of
the first card is its chance of being chosen last time multiplied by its chance
of being replaced, so <code>100% * 1/2</code>, which is again <code>50%</code>.</p>

<h3 id="card-3"><a href="#card-3">#</a>
Card 3</h3>
<p>The card we're holding has a <code>50%</code> chance of being there. This is true
regardless what happened up to this point. No matter whether we're holding card
1 or card 2, it's <code>50%</code>.</p>
<p>The new card has a <code>1/3</code> chance of being selected, so the card we're holding has
a <code>1/3</code> chance of being replaced. This means that our held card has a <code>2/3</code>
chance of remaining held. So its chances of "surviving" this round are <code>50% * 2/3</code>.</p>

<h3 id="card-n"><a href="#card-n">#</a>
Card N</h3>
<p>This pattern continues for as many cards as you want to draw. We can express
both options as formulas.  Drag the slider to substitute <code>n</code> with real numbers
and see that the two formulas are always equal.</p>
<div>
    <p>
      Hold
    </p>
    <p>
      1/(n-1) * (1-(1/n))
    </p>
    <p>
      -
    </p>
  </div>


<p>If <code>1/n</code> is the chance of choosing the new card, <code>1/(n-1)</code> is the chance of
choosing the new card from the previous draw. The chance of <em>not</em> choosing the
new card is the <em>complement</em> of <code>1/n</code>, which is <code>1-(1/n)</code>.</p>
<p>Below are the cards again except this time set up to use <code>1/n</code> instead of a
coin flip. Click to the end of the deck. Does it feel fair to you?</p>

<p>There's a good chance that through the 2nd half of the deck, you never swap
your chosen card. This <em>feels</em> wrong, at least to me, but as we saw above the
numbers say it is completely fair.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-multiple-cards"><a href="#choosing-multiple-cards">#</a>
Choosing multiple cards</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to select a single card, we can extend this to selecting
multiple cards. There are 2 changes we need to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rather than new cards having a <code>1/n</code> chance of being selected, they now have
a <code>k/n</code> chance, where <code>k</code> is the number of cards we want to choose.</li>
<li>When we decide to replace a held card, we choose one of the <code>k</code> cards we're
holding at random.</li>
</ol>
<p>So our new previous card selection formula becomes <code>k/(n-1)</code> because we're now
holding <code>k</code> cards. Then the chance that any of the cards we're holding get
replaced is <code>1-(1/n)</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see how this plays out with real numbers.</p>
<div>
    <p>
      Hold
    </p>
    <p>
      k/(n-1) * (1-(1/n))
    </p>
    <p>
      -
    </p>
  </div>


<p>The fairness still holds, and will hold for any <code>k</code> and <code>n</code> pair. This is
because all held cards have an equal chance of being replaced, which keeps them
at an equal likelihood of still being in your hand every draw.</p>
<p>A nice way to implement this is to use an array of size <code>k</code>. For each new card,
generate a random number between 0 and <code>n</code>. If the random number is less than
<code>k</code>, replace the card at that index with the new card.  Otherwise, discard the
new card.</p>

<p>And that's how reservoir sampling works!</p>
<h2 id="applying-this-to-log-collection"><a href="#applying-this-to-log-collection">#</a>
Applying this to log collection</h2>
<p>Let's take what we now know about reservoir sampling and apply it to our log
collection service. We'll set <code>k=5</code>, so we're "holding" at most 5 log messages
at a time, and every second we will send the selected logs to the log collection
service. After we've done that, we empty our array of size 5 and start again.</p>
<p>This creates a "lumpy" pattern in the graph below, and highlights a trade-off
when using reservoir sampling. It's no longer a real-time stream of logs, but
chunks of logs sent at an interval. However, <h->sent logs</h-> never exceeds
the <h->threshold</h->, and during quiet periods the two lines track each other
almost perfectly.</p>


<p>No logs lost during quiet periods, and never more than <h->threshold</h-> logs
per second sent during spikes.  The best of both worlds. It also doesn't store
more than <code>k=5</code> logs, so it will have predictable memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading">#</a>
Further reading</h2>
<p>Something you may have thought while reading this post is that some logs are
more valuable than others. You almost certainly want to keep all error logs, for
example.</p>
<p>For that use-case there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Weighted_random_sampling">weighted</a> variant of reservoir sampling. I
wasn't able to find a simpler explanation of it, so that link is to Wikipedia
which I personally find a bit hard to follow. But the key point is that it
exists and if you need it you can use it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reservoir sampling is one of my favourite algorithms, and I've been wanting to
write about it for years now. It allows you to solve a problem that at first
seems impossible, in a way that is both elegant and efficient.</p>
<p>Thank you again to <a href="https://ittybit.com/?ref=sam">ittybit</a> for sponsoring this
post.  I really couldn't have hoped for a more supportive first sponsor. Thank
you for believing in and understanding what I'm doing here.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who read this post and gave their feedback. You made this
post much better than I could have done on my own, and steered me away from
several paths that just weren't working.</p>

<p dir="auto">An eBPF agent that captures traffic flowing through the Linux kernel. By attaching to TLS/SSL functions, data is intercepted before and after encryption and then passed to flexible plugins with full visibility along with all of the available context - process/container/host/user/protocol/etc. Qtap makes it possible to understand what's happening with your egress traffic, without modifying apps, installing proxies, or managing certs.</p>

<p dir="auto">Qtap shows you exactly what data is being sent and received in its original, unencrypted form while operating out-of-band with minimal overhead, without adding latency or disrupting application performance.</p>

<p dir="auto">Qtap can augment your existing observability piplines or can be used as a foundational component for a custom solution, like <a href="https://www.qpoint.io/qtap" rel="nofollow">Qpoint</a>, in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Security auditing</strong> - Security professionals can verify sensitive data isn't being unintentionally exposed in network communications.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging network issues</strong> - When APIs return errors or connections fail, seeing the actual data being sent helps identify misconfigured parameters, malformed requests, or unexpected responses.</li>
<li><strong>API development</strong> - Developers can verify their applications are sending correctly formatted requests and properly handling responses without modifying code.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting third-party integrations</strong> - When integrating with external services, Qtap helps confirm what data is actually being exchanged versus what documentation claims.</li>
<li><strong>Learning and exploration</strong> - Understanding how protocols actually work by observing real traffic between applications and services.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy system investigation</strong> - When working with poorly documented or legacy systems, Qtap provides insights into how they communicate without requiring source code access.</li>
<li><strong>Validation testing</strong> - Confirming that application changes don't unexpectedly alter network communication patterns.</li>

            Leo is now tied for the fourth most common name chosen by popes, along with Clement. Only John, Gregory and Benedict have proven more popular.

            The last Pope Leo was Leo XIII, who was born in French-occupied Rome in 1810. He served as pope from 1878 until his death in 1903, making his 25-year papacy the fourth longest in the church’s history.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">For more than two months, the Trump administration has been subject to a federal court order stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">But new whistleblower records submitted in a lawsuit led by the Washington state attorney general appear to contradict the claim.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Nearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25928836-wa-case_memoli/">memo that details</a> how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases. In the most high-profile case so far, the administration has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5358421/supreme-court-abrego-garcia-deportation-decision">yet to comply with a federal judge’s order</a>, upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, requiring it to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The records filed in the NIH-related lawsuit last week also reveal for the first time the enormous scope of the administration’s changes to the agency, which has been subject to massive layoffs and research cuts to align it with the president’s political priorities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Other documents filed in the case raise questions concerning a key claim the administration has made about how it is restructuring federal agencies — that the Department of Government Efficiency has <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/on-doge--directives--and-doj">limited authority</a>, acting mostly as an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/">advisory body that consults</a> on what to cut. However, in depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">The lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to <a href="https://x.com/DOGE/status/1895645518912795109?lang=en">research in China</a> have also been cut, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nih-funding-climate-change-public-health">climate change</a> projects are under scrutiny.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">Andrew G. Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, the NIH’s parent agency, told ProPublica in an email that the grant terminations directly followed the president’s executive orders and that the NIH’s actions were based on policy and scientific priorities, not political interference.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">“The cuts are essential to refocus NIH on key public health priorities, like the chronic disease epidemic,” he said. Nixon also told ProPublica that its questions related to the lawsuit “solely fit a partisan narrative”; he did not respond to specific questions about the preliminary injunction, the administration’s compliance with the order or the involvement of DOGE in the grant termination process. The White House did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Mike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said. “Our office will use every tool we have to uncover the truth about why these grants were terminated.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Since Trump took office in January, the administration has provided limited insight into why it  chose to terminate scientific and medical grants. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.1">That decision-making process has been largely opaque, until now.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Washington Fights to Overturn Grant Termination</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">In February, Washington state — joined by Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado and three physicians —&nbsp;sued the administration after it threatened to enforce its executive orders by withholding federal research grants from institutions that provided gender-affirming services or promoted “gender ideology.” Within weeks, a federal judge <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.233.0_5.pdf">issued an injunction</a> limiting the administration from fully enforcing the orders in the four states that are party to the suit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">The same day as the injunction, however, the NIH terminated a research grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital to develop and study an online education tool designed to reduce the risk of violence, mental health disorders and sexually transmitted infections among transgender youth, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.0.pdf">records filed in the court case</a>. The NIH stated that it was the agency’s policy not to “prioritize” such studies on gender identity.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">“Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.1.pdf">notice stated</a>, without citing any scientific evidence for its claims. The NIH sent another notice <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.2.pdf">reiterating the termination</a> four days later.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">The Washington attorney general’s office requested the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.245.3_1.pdf">termination be withdrawn</a>, citing the injunction. But the administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.243.0.pdf">refused</a>, claiming that it was in compliance as the termination was based on NIH’s own authority and grant policy and was not enforcing any executive order.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">The Washington attorney general asked the judge to hold the administration in contempt for violating the injunction. While the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.258.0_3.pdf">request was denied</a>, the court granted an expedited discovery process to better assess whether the administration had breached the injunction. That process would have required the administration to quickly turn over internal documents relating to the termination. In response, the administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.267.0_1.pdf">reinstated the grant</a> for Seattle Children’s Hospital and declared the discovery process moot, or no longer relevant. However, U.S. District Judge Lauren J. King, who was appointed by former President Joseph Biden, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.273.0_2.pdf">permitted</a> it to continue.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Whistleblower Documents Reveal Sweeping Changes at NIH</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In recent months, whistleblowers have <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.275.0.pdf">made the plaintiffs in the lawsuit aware</a> of internal records that more closely connect the grant terminations to the administration’s executive orders.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.276.4.pdf">internal spreadsheet</a> of dozens of grants marked for cancellation at an NIH institute, the stated reason for termination for several was “gender ideology (EA 14168),” including the grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">The rationale appears to reference Executive Order 14168, which <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02090/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal">banned using federal funds</a> to “promote gender ideology,” again seeming to conflict with the administration’s stance that the termination was not based on the executive orders. The termination dates of the grants, according to the spreadsheet, were after the injunction went into effect.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Another internal document, which provides extraordinary insight into the administration’s efforts to reshape the NIH, also states the executive order was the impetus for grant terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.276.5.pdf">March 11 memo from Memoli</a>, the NIH cataloged all actions that the agency had taken thus far to align with the president’s executive orders. In a section detailing the steps taken to implement the “gender ideology” executive order, one of the 44 actions listed was the termination of active grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">“NIH is currently reviewing all active grants and supplements to determine if they promote gender ideology and will take action as appropriate,” the memo stated, noting that the process was in progress.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">While the administration has said in court filings that it is following the judge’s injunction order, the Washington state attorney general’s office told ProPublica that it disagreed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Depositions Reveal DOGE Links</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">In depositions conducted last month as part of the lawsuit, the testimony of two NIH officials also raised questions about why the research grants were terminated and how DOGE was involved.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Liza Bundesen, who was the deputy director of the agency’s extramural research office, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25919695-liza-bundesen-depo/">testified</a> that she first learned of the grant terminations on Feb. 28 from a DOGE team member, Rachel Riley. Bundesen said she was invited into a Microsoft Teams video call, where Riley introduced herself as being <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/">part of DOGE</a> and working with the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">Riley, a former consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co., joined HHS on Jan. 27, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277150/gov.uscourts.dcd.277150.80.5.pdf">court filings in a separate lawsuit</a>, and has <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/nih-faces-renewed-doge-directive-cut-staff-pre-covid-levels-putting-thousands-line-rifs/403593/">reportedly served</a> as the DOGE point person at the NIH.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/">executive order</a> detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/on-doge--directives--and-doj">authority to direct the cancellation</a> of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">“She informed me that a number of grants will need to be terminated,” Bundesen testified, adding that she was told that they needed to be terminated by the end of the day. “I did not ask what, you know, what grants because I just literally was a little bit confused and caught off guard.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">Bundesen said she then received an email from Memoli, the NIH acting director, with a spreadsheet listing the grants that needed to be canceled and a template letter for notifying researchers of the terminations.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">“The template had boilerplate language that could then be modified for the different circumstances, the different buckets of grants that were to be terminated,” she said. “The categories were DEI, research in China and transgender or gender ideology.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Bundesen forwarded the email with the spreadsheet to Michelle Bulls, who directs the agency’s Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration. Bundesen resigned from the NIH a week later, on March 7, citing “untenable” working conditions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">“I was given directives to implement with very short turnaround times, often close of business or maybe within the next hour,” she testified. “I was not offered the opportunity to provide feedback or really ask for clarification.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Bulls confirmed in her own deposition that the termination list and letter template originally came from Riley. When Bulls started receiving the lists, she said she did what she was told. “I just followed the directive,” she said. “The language in the letters were provided so I didn’t question.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Bulls said she didn’t write any of the letters herself and just signed her name to them. She also said she was not aware whether anyone had assessed the grants’ scientific merit or whether they met agency criteria. The grant terminations related to gender identity did not stem from an independent agency policy, she testified, appearing to contradict the administration’s assertion that they were based on the agency’s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.245.3_1.pdf">own authority and grant policy</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">As of April 3, Bulls said she had received more than five lists of grants that needed to be terminated, amounting to “somewhere between five hundred and a thousand” grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Most grant recipients endure a rigorous vetting process, which can <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/peer-review/simplifying-review/background">involve multiple stages of peer review</a> before approval, and before this year, Bulls testified that grant terminations at the NIH have historically been rare. There are generally two main types of terminations, she said, for noncompliance or based on mutual agreement. Bulls said that she has been “generally involved in noncompliance discussions” and since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033625/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/11/29/oer-welcomes-michelle-bulls/">she became the director</a> of the office in 2012, there had been fewer than five such terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">In addition to the termination letters, Bulls said she relied on the template language provided by Riley to draft guidance to inform the 27 centers and institutes at the NIH what the agency’s new priorities were to help them scrutinize their own research portfolios.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Following the depositions, the Washington state attorney general’s office said that the federal government has refused to respond to its discovery requests. It has filed a motion to compel the government to respond, which is pending.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Riley, Bundesen, Bulls and Memoli did not reply to ProPublica’s requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">While the administration did not answer ProPublica’s questions about DOGE and its involvement in the grant terminations, last week in its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">budget blueprint</a>, it generally justified its proposed cuts at the NIH with claims that the agency had “wasteful spending,” conducted “risky research” and promoted “dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“NIH has grown too big and unfocused,” the White House claimed in its fiscal plan, adding that the agency’s research should “align with the President’s priorities to address chronic disease and other epidemics, implementing all executive orders and eliminating research on climate change, radical gender ideology, and divisive racialism.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">Jeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">“It is profoundly distressing to see this great institution being reduced to a lawless, politicized organization without much focus on its actual mission,” he said.</p>

While Google has set 2030 goals to reach net zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions, on a 2019 basis,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-asks-large-suppliers-to-commit-to-100-renewable-energy-as-emissions-continue-to-rise/">the company recently reported</a>&nbsp;that its emissions increased by 13% in 2023, and are up by 48% since 2019, as its growing data center electricity consumption has outpaced its ability to bring carbon free energy projects online. Google has also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-achieves-zero-lifetime-net-carbon-footprint-now-aiming-for-100-carbon-free-energy/">set a goal</a>&nbsp;in 2020 to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030, matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-signs-first-nuclear-energy-deal-to-address-growing-ai-carbon-footprint/">Google signed its first advanced nuclear agreement</a> with nuclear technology company Kairos Power aimed at deploying a fleet of small advanced nuclear power projects across the U.S. to provide up to 500 MW of carbon-free energy.goals.</p> <p>As part of the new agreement with Elementl, Google will commit early-stage development capital to advance the development of three projects, each of which will be able to generate at least 600 MW of power capacity.</p> <p>Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy at Google, said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation.”</p></blockquote> <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/amazon-google-and-meta-join-pledge-to-help-triple-global-nuclear-energy-capacity/">Google and Meta</a> joined a group of major companies pledging to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The pledge notes that “energy demand in many industries is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” adding that tripling nuclear capacity will “help achieve global goals for enhanced energy resiliency and security, and continuous firm clean energy supply.”</p> <p>Established in 2023, Elementl Power develops, finances, and manages nuclear power projects, using next-generation technology that it claims is the safest form of energy generation.</p> <p>With the support of Google, Elementl said that it is advancing its goal to bring more than 10 gigawatts online in the U.S. by 2035, working collaboratively with regulated utilities, independent power producers and technology suppliers.</p> <p>Elementl Power Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Colbert said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid.”</p></blockquote> <div id="esgto-864566167"><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://www.esgtoday.com/esgtoday-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" aria-label="1280×250"><img alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" width="900" height="180" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NDkwOjk0OQ==-1" src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w"></a></p></div></div> </div>  </article>  <div> <p> <img alt="" itemprop="image" height="96" width="96" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2e27b1c085c926922a9c0c597d43a6c.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83 2x" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef5655eaf5fddd7fe4013e3e70d592ee.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83" content="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef5655eaf5fddd7fe4013e3e70d592ee.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NTAzOjM3MQ==-1" src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTAzOjM3MQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTYgOTYiIHdpZHRoPSI5NiIgaGVpZ2h0PSI5NiIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4="> </p> <p> <h4> <span> ESG Today Writing Staff </span> </h4> </p> </div>        </main>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p><em>Why splitting your codebase too early can quietly destroy your team’s velocity — and what to do instead</em>.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/frame.jpg" alt="microservice vs monolith"></p><p>In a startup, <strong>your survival depends on how quickly you can iterate, ship features, and deliver value to end-users</strong>. This is where the foundational architecture of your startup plays a big role; additionally, things like your tech stack and choice of programming language directly affect your team’s velocity. The wrong architecture, especially premature microservices, can substantially hurt productivity and contribute to missed goals in delivering software.</p><p>I’ve had this experience when working on greenfield projects for early-stage startups, where questionable decisions were made in terms of software architecture that led to half-finished services and <em>brittle, over-engineered and broken local setups</em>, and <strong>demoralized teams</strong> who struggle maintaining unnecessary complexity.</p><p>Before diving into specific pitfalls, here’s what you’re actually signing up for when introducing microservices prematurely:</p><p><strong>Microservices Early On: What You’re Paying For</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pain Point</th><th>Real-World Manifestation</th><th>Developer Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Deployment Complexity</td><td>Orchestrating 5+ services for a single feature</td><td><strong>Hours lost per release</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Local Dev Fragility</td><td>Docker sprawl, broken scripts, platform-specific hacks</td><td><strong>Slow onboarding, frequent breakage</strong></td></tr><tr><td>CI/CD Duplication</td><td>Multiple pipelines with duplicated logic</td><td><strong>Extra toil per service</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Service Coupling</td><td>“Decoupled” services tightly linked by shared state</td><td><strong>Slower changes, coordination tax</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Observability Overhead</td><td>Distributed tracing, logging, monitoring</td><td><strong>Weeks to instrument properly</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Test Suite Fragmentation</td><td>Tests scattered across services</td><td><strong>Brittle tests, low confidence</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Let’s unpack why microservices often backfire early on, where they genuinely help, and how to structure your startup’s systems for speed and survival.</p><h2 id="monoliths-are-not-the-enemy">Monoliths Are Not the Enemy</h2><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/monolith.svg" alt="Monolith architecture" width="500"></figure><p>If you’re building some SaaS product, even a simple SQL database wrapper eventually may bring a lot of internal complexity in the way your business logic works; additionally, you can get to various integrations and background tasks that let transform one set of data to another.</p><p>With time, sometimes unnecessary features, it’s inevitable that your app may grow messy. The great thing about monoliths is: they still work. <strong>Monoliths, even when messy, keep your team focused on what matters most</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Staying alive</strong></li><li><strong>Delivering customer value</strong></li></ul><p>The biggest advantage of monoliths is their simplicity in deployment. Generally, such projects are built around existing frameworks — it could be Django for Python, ASP.Net for C#, Nest.js for Node.js apps, etc. When sticking to monolithic architecture, you get the biggest advantage over fancy microservices — a wide support of the open source community and project maintainers who primarily designed those frameworks to work as a single process, monolithic app.</p><p>At one real-estate startup where I led the front-end team, and occasionally consulted the backend team on technology choices, we had an interesting evolution of a Laravel-based app. What started as a small dashboard for real-estate agents to manage deals gradually grew into a much larger system.</p><p>Over time, it evolved into a feature-rich suite that handled hundreds of gigabytes of documents and integrated with dozens of third-party services. Yet, it remained built on a fairly basic PHP stack running on Apache.</p><p>The team leaned heavily on best practices recommended by the Laravel community. That discipline paid off, we were able to scale the application’s capabilities significantly while still meeting the business’s needs and expectations.</p><p>Interestingly, we never needed to decouple the system into microservices or adopt more complex infrastructure patterns. We avoided a lot of accidental complexity that way. The simplicity of the architecture gave us leverage. This echoes what others have written — like Basecamp’s take on the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/">“Majestic Monolith”</a>, which lays out why simplicity is a superpower early on.</p><p>People often point out that it’s hard to make monoliths scalable, but it’s bad modularization <em>inside</em> the monolith that may bring such problems.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: A well-structured monolith keeps your team focused on shipping, not firefighting.</strong></p><h2 id="but-isnt-microservices-best-practice">But Isn’t Microservices “Best Practice”?</h2><p>A lot of engineers reach for microservices early, thinking they’re “the right way.” And sure — at scale, they can help. But in a startup, that same complexity turns into drag.</p><p>Microservices only pay off when you have real scaling bottlenecks, large teams, or independently evolving domains. Before that? You’re paying the price without getting the benefit: duplicated infra, fragile local setups, and slow iteration. For example, <strong>Segment</strong> eventually <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">reversed their microservice split</a> for this exact reason — too much cost, not enough value.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Microservices are a scaling tool — not a starting template.</strong></p><h2 id="where-microservices-go-wrong-especially-early-on">Where Microservices Go Wrong (Especially Early On)</h2><p>In one early-stage team I advised, the decision to split services created more PM-engineering coordination overhead than technical gain. Architecture shaped not just code, but how we planned, estimated, and shipped. That organizational tax is easy to miss — until it’s too late.</p><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/pm-coordination.svg" alt="Coordination between teams" width="600"></figure><p><em><strong>Diagram:</strong> Coordination overhead grows linearly with services — and exponentially when you add product managers, deadlines, and misaligned timelines.</em></p><p>Here are the most common anti-patterns that creep in early.</p><h3 id="1-arbitrary-service-boundaries">1. Arbitrary Service Boundaries</h3><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/premature-microservice.svg" alt="Arbitrary service boundaries in microservices" width="600"></figure><p>In theory, you often see suggestions on splitting your applications by business logic domain — users service, products service, orders service, and so on. This often borrows from Domain-Driven Design or Clean Architecture concepts — which make sense at scale, but in early-stage products, they can ossify structure prematurely, before the product itself is stable or validated. You end up with:</p><ul><li>Shared databases</li><li>Cross-service calls for simple workflows</li><li>Coupling disguised as “separation”</li></ul><p>At one project, I watched a team separating user, authentication, and authorization into separate services, which led to deployment complexity and difficulties in service coordination for any API operation they were building.</p><p>In reality, business logic doesn’t directly map to service boundaries. Premature separation can make the system more fragile and often times difficult to introduce changes quickly.</p><p>Instead, isolate bottlenecks surgically — based on real scaling pain, not theoretical elegance.</p><p>When I’ve coached early-stage teams, we’ve sometimes used internal flags or deployment toggles to simulate future service splits — without the immediate operational burden. This gave product and engineering room to explore boundaries organically, before locking in premature infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Don’t split by theory — split by actual bottlenecks.</strong></p><h3 id="2-repository-and-infrastructure-sprawl">2. Repository and Infrastructure Sprawl</h3><p>When working on the application, typically a next set of things is important:</p><ul><li>Code style consistency (linting)</li><li>Testing infrastructure, including integration testing</li><li>Local environment configuration</li><li>Documentation</li><li>CI/CD configuration</li></ul><p>When dealing with microservices, you need to multiply those requirements by the number of services. If your project is structured as a monorepo, you can simplify your life by having a central CI/CD configuration (when working with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI). Some teams separate microservices into separate repositories, which makes it way harder to maintain the code consistency and the same set of configurations without extra effort or tools.</p><p><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/tests.svg" alt="tests environments diagram"></p><p>For a three-person team, this is brutal. Context switching across repositories and tooling adds up to the development time of every feature that is shipped.</p><h4 id="mitigating-issues-by-using-monorepos-and-a-single-programming-language">Mitigating issues by using monorepos and a single programming language</h4><p>There are various ways to mitigate this problem. For early projects, the single most important thing is — keeping your code in a monorepo. This ensures that there’s a single version of code that exists on prod, and it’s much easier to coordinate code reviews and collaborate for smaller teams.</p><p>For Node.js projects, I strongly recommend using a monorepo tool like <code>nx</code> or <code>turborepo</code>. Both:</p><ul><li>Simplify CI/CD config across subprojects</li><li>Support dependency graph-based build caching</li><li>Let you treat internal services as TypeScript libraries (via ES6 imports)</li></ul><p>These tools save time otherwise spent writing glue code or reinventing orchestration. That said, they come with real tradeoffs:</p><ul><li>Complex dependency trees can grow fast</li><li>CI performance tuning is non-trivial</li><li>You may need faster tooling (like bun) to keep build times down</li></ul><p>To summarize: Tooling like <code>nx</code> or <code>turborepo</code> gives small teams monorepo velocity — if you’re willing to invest in keeping them clean.</p><p>When developing <code>go</code>-based microservices, a good idea early in the development is to use a single <code>go</code> workspace with the <code>replace</code> directive in <code>go.mod</code>. Eventually, as the software scales, it’s possible to effortlessly separate <code>go</code> modules into separate repositories.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: A monorepo with shared infra buys you time, consistency, and sanity.</strong></p><h3 id="3-broken-local-dev--broken-velocity">3. Broken Local Dev = Broken Velocity</h3><p><strong>If it takes three hours, a custom shell script, and a Docker marathon just to run your app locally, you’ve already lost velocity.</strong></p><p>Early projects often suffer from:</p><ul><li>Missing documentation</li><li>Obsolete dependencies</li><li>OS-specific hacks (hello, Linux-only setups)</li></ul><p>In my experience, when I received projects from past development teams, they were often developed for a single operating system. Some devs preferred building on macOS and never bothered supporting their shell scripts on Windows. In my past teams, I had engineers working on Windows machines, and often it required rewriting shell scripts or fully understanding and reverse engineering the process of getting the local environment running. With time, we standardized environment setup across dev OSes to reduce onboarding friction — a small investment that saved hours per new engineer. It was frustrating — but it taught a lasting lesson on how important it is to get the code running on any laptop your new developer may be using.</p><p>At another project, a solo dev had created a fragile microservice setup, that the workflow of running Docker containers mounted to a local file system. Of course, you pay a little price for running processes as containers when your computer runs Linux.</p><p>But onboarding a new front-end dev with an older Windows laptop turned into a nightmare. They had to spin up ten containers just to view the UI. Everything broke — volumes, networking, container compatibility — and the setup very poorly documented. This created a major friction point during onboarding.</p><p>We ended up hacking together a Node.js proxy that mimicked the nginx/Docker configuration without containers. It wasn’t elegant, but it let the dev get unblocked and start contributing.</p><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/dev-env.svg" alt="complex dev environment in microservices" width="600"></figure><p><strong>Takeaway: If your app only runs on one OS, your team’s productivity is one laptop away from disaster.</strong></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ideally, aim for <code>git clone &lt;repo&gt; &amp;&amp; make up</code> to have the project running locally. If it’s not possible, then maintaining an up-to-date README file with instructions for Windows/macOS/Linux is a must. Nowadays, there are some programming languages and toolchains that don’t work well on Windows (like OCaml), but the modern widely popular stack runs just fine on every widely used operating system; by limiting your local setup to a single operating system, it’s often a symptom of under-investment in DX.</p><h3 id="4-technology-mismatch">4. Technology Mismatch</h3><p>Beyond architecture, your tech stack also shapes how painful microservices become — not every language shines in a microservice architecture.</p><ul><li><strong>Node.js and Python:</strong> Great for rapid iteration, but managing build artifacts, dependency versions, and runtime consistency across services gets painful fast.</li><li><strong>Go:</strong> Compiles to static binaries, fast build times, and low operational overhead. More natural fit when splitting is truly needed.</li></ul><p>It’s very important to pick the right technical stack early on. If you look for performance, maybe look for the JVM and its ecosystem and ability to deploy artifacts at scale and run them in microservice-based architectures. If you do very fast iterations and prototype quickly without worrying about scaling your deployment infrastructure — you’re good with something like Python.</p><p>It’s quite often for teams to realise that there are big issues with their choice of technology that wasn’t apparent initially, and they had to pay the price of rebuilding the back-end in a different programming language (like <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/?utm_source=blog.quastor.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan-academy-s-migration-from-python-to-go">those guys</a> were forced to do something about legacy Python 2 codebase and migrated to Go).</p><p>But on the contrary, if you really need to, you can bridge multiple programming languages with protocols like <strong>gRPC</strong> or async message communication. And it’s often the way to go about things. When you get to the point that you want to enrich your feature set with Machine Learning functionality or ETL-based jobs, you would just separately build your ML-based infrastructure in Python, due to its rich ecosystem of domain-specific libraries, that naturally any other programming language lacks. But such decisions should be made when there’s enough head count to justify this venture; otherwise, the small team will be eternally drawn into the endless complexity of bridging multiple software stacks together.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Match the tech to your constraints, not your ambition.</strong></p><h3 id="5-hidden-complexity-communication-and-monitoring">5. Hidden Complexity: Communication and Monitoring</h3><p>Microservices introduce an invisible web of needs:</p><ul><li>Service discovery</li><li>API versioning</li><li>Retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks</li><li>Distributed tracing</li><li>Centralized logging and alerting</li></ul><p>In a monolith, a bug might be a simple stack trace. In a distributed system, it’s “why does service A fail when B’s deployment lags C by 30 seconds?”
You would have to thoroughly invest in your observability stack. To do it “properly”, it requires instrumenting your applications in specific ways, e.g. integrating OpenTelemetry to support tracing, or relying on your cloud provider’s tools like AWS XRay if you go with a complex serverless system. But at this point, you have to completely shift your focus from application code towards building complex monitoring infrastructure that to validate whether your architecture is <strong>actually</strong> functioning in production.</p><p>Of course, some of the observability instrumentation is needed to be performed on monolith apps, but it’s way simpler than doing that in terms of the number of services in a consistent way.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Understand that <strong>distributed systems <em>aren’t free.</em></strong> They’re a commitment to a whole new class of engineering challenges.</p><h2 id="when-microservices-do-make-sense">When Microservices <em>Do</em> Make Sense</h2><p>Despite the mentioned difficulties with microservices, there are times where service-level decoupling actually is very beneficial. There are cases where it definitely helps:</p><ul><li><strong>Workload Isolation</strong>: a common example for that would be in AWS best practices on using S3 event notifications — when an image gets loaded to S3, trigger an image resizing/OCR process, etc. Why it is useful: we can decouple obscure data processing libraries in a self-isolated service and make it API focused solely on image processing and generating output from the uploaded data. Your upstream clients that upload data to S3 aren’t coupled with this service, and there’s less overhead in instrumenting such a service because of its relative simplicity.</li><li><strong>Divergent Scalability Needs:</strong> — Imagine you are building an AI product. One part of the system (<strong>web API</strong>) that triggers ML workloads and shows past results isn’t resource intensive, it’s lightweight, because it interacts mostly with the database. On the contrary, ML model runs on GPUs is actually heavy to run and requires special machines with GPU support with additional configuration. By splitting these parts of the application into separate services running on different machines, you can scale them independently.</li><li><strong>Different Runtime Requirements:</strong> — Let’s say you’ve got some legacy part of code written in C++. You have 2 choices — magically convert it to your core programming language or find ways to integrate it with a codebase. Depending on the complexity of that legacy app, you would have to write glue code, implementing additional networking/protocols to establish interactions with that service, but the bottom line is — you will likely have to separate this app as a separate service due to runtime incompatibilities. I would say even more, you could write your main app in C++ as well, but because of different compiler configurations and library dependencies, you wouldn’t be able to easily compile things together as a single binary.</li></ul><p>Large-scale engineering orgs have wrestled with similar challenges. For instance, Uber’s engineering team <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-HR/blog/microservice-architecture/">documented their shift to a domain-oriented microservice architecture</a> — not out of theoretical purity, but in response to real complexity across teams and scaling boundaries. Their post is a good example of how microservices can work when you have the organizational maturity and operational overhead to support them.</p><p>At one project, that also happens to be a real-estate one, we had code from a previous team that runs Python-based analytics workloads that loads data into MS-SQL db, we found that it would be a waste to build on top of it a Django app. The code had different runtime dependencies and was pretty self-isolated, so we kept it separate and only revisited it when something wasn’t working as expected. This worked for us even for a small team, because this analytics generation service was a part that required rare changes or maintenance.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Use microservices when workloads diverge — not just because they sound clean.</strong></p><h2 id="practical-guidance-for-startups">Practical Guidance for Startups</h2><p>If you’re shipping your first product, here’s the playbook I’d recommend:</p><ul><li><strong>Start monolithic.</strong> Pick a common framework and focus on getting the features done. All known frameworks are more than good enough to build some API or website and serve the users. Don’t follow the hype, stick to the boring way of doing things; you can thank yourself later.</li><li><strong>Single repo.</strong> Don’t bother splitting your code into multiple repositories. I’ve worked with founders who wanted to separate repos to reduce the risk of contractors copying IP — a valid concern. But in practice, it added more friction than security: slower builds, fragmented CI/CD, and poor visibility across teams. The marginal IP protection wasn’t worth the operational drag, especially when proper access controls inside a monorepo were easier to manage. For early-stage teams, clarity and speed tend to matter more than theoretical security gains.</li><li><strong>Dead-simple local setup.</strong> Make <code>make up</code> work. If it takes more, be very specific on the steps, record a video/Loom, and add screenshots. If your code is going to be run by an intern or junior dev, they’ll likely hit a roadblock, and you’ll spend time explaining how to troubleshoot an issue. I found that documenting every possible issue for every operating system eliminates time spent clarifying why certain things in a local setup didn’t work.</li><li><strong>Invest early in CI/CD.</strong> Even if it’s a simple HTML that you could just <code>scp</code> to a server manually, you could automate this and rely on source control with CI/CD to do it. When the setup is properly automated, you just forget about your continuous integration infrastructure and focus on features. I’ve seen many teams and founders when working with outsourced teams often be cheap on CI/CD, and that results in the team being demoralized and annoyed by manual deployment processes.</li><li><strong>Split surgically.</strong> Only split when it clearly solves a painful bottleneck. Otherwise, invest in modularity and tests inside the monolith — it’s faster and easier to maintain.</li></ul><p>And above all: <strong>optimize for developer velocity.</strong></p><p><strong>Velocity is your startup’s oxygen.</strong> Premature microservices leak that oxygen slowly — until one day, you can’t breathe.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Start simple, stay pragmatic, and split only when you must.</strong></p><h2 id="if-you-go-with-a-microservice-based-approach">If you go with a microservice-based approach</h2><p>I had micro-service-based projects created earlier than they should have been done, and here are the next recommendations that I could give on that:</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluate your technical stack</strong> that powers your micro-service-based architecture. Invest in developer experience tooling. When you have service-based separation, you now need to think about automating your microservice stack, automating config across both local and production environments. In certain projects, I had to build a separate CLI that does administrative tasks on the monorepository. One project I had contained 15-20 microservice deployments, and for the local environment, I had to create a cli-tool for generating docker-compose.yml files dynamically to achieve seamless one-command start-up for the regular developer.</li><li><strong>Focus on reliable communication protocols</strong> around service communication. If it’s async messaging, make sure your message schemas are consistent and standardized. If it’s REST, focus on OpenAPI documentation. Inter-service communication clients must implement many things that don’t come out-of-the-box: retries with exponential backoff, timeouts. A typical bare-bones gRPC client requires you to manually factor those additional things to make sure you don’t suffer from transient errors.</li><li><strong>Ensure that your unit, integration testing, and end-to-end testing setup</strong> is stable and scales with the amount of service-level separations you introduce into your codebase.</li><li>On smaller projects that use micro-service-based workloads, you would likely default to a shared library with common helpers for instrumenting your observability, communication code in a consistent way. An important consideration here — <strong>keep your shared library as small as possible</strong>. Any major change forces a rebuild across all dependent services — even if unrelated.<figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/shared-dep.svg" alt="shared library dependency" width="600"></figure></li><li><strong>Look into observability earlier on.</strong> Add structured-JSON logs and create various correlation IDs for debugging things once your app is deployed. Even basic helpers that output rich logging information (until you instrumented your app with proper logging/tracing facilities) often save time figuring out flaky user flows.</li></ul><p>To summarize: if you’re still going for microservices, you should beforehand understand the tax you’re going to pay in terms of additional development time and maintenance to make the setup workable for every engineer in your team.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: If you embrace complexity, invest fully in making it manageable.</strong></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Premature microservices are a tax you can’t afford. Stay simple. Stay alive.</strong> Split only when the pain makes it obvious.</p><p><strong>Survive first. Scale later. Choose the simplest system that works — and earn every layer of complexity you add.</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">Monolith First</a> — Martin Fowler</li><li><a href="https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith">The Majestic Monolith</a> — DHH / Basecamp</li><li><a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices">Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar</a> — Segment Eng.</li><li><a href="https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity">Deconstructing the Monolith</a> — Shopify Eng.</li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/microservice-architecture/">Domain‑Oriented Microservice Architecture</a> — Uber Eng.</li><li><a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/">Go + Services = One Goliath Project</a> — Khan Academy</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p>My go to for UI inspiration especially packing in a lot of information in a small space are mobile apps in the audio editing/creating domain. Loopy Pro is one I always bring up, but there are a lot of audio apps that have to fit a lot of information on the screen at once while being highly intuitive because the app itself is not the primary interface, a midi controller or instrument is.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie"><em>gendarmes</em></a> have been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren't the usual financial schemes, cons, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODL!</a> shenanigans one usually reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once after being doused with gasoline.</p>
<p>This previous weekend was particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of Paris' 14th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris"><em>arrondissement</em></a> on May 1 by men in ski masks. The 14th is a pleasant place—I highly recommend a visit to the catacombs in Place Denfert-Rochereau—and not usually the site of snatch-and-grab operations. The abducted man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the man's son.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/04/abducted-dad-of-crypto-firm-boss-freed-in-french-police-raid_6740891_7.html%20">Le Monde</a>, the abducted father was taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father's fingers was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared "other mutilations" if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s. (According to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kidnapped-father-french-crypto-millionaire-150730032.html?guccounter=1">the BBC</a>, French police used "phone signals" to locate the house.)</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, but this was the second such incident this year. In January, crypto maven David Balland was also abducted along with his partner on January 21. Balland was taken to a house, where he also had a finger cut off. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/french-police-investigate-spate-of-cryptocurrency-millionaire-kidnappings">The Guardian</a><em>,</em> "Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner, who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day."</p>
<p>And a few weeks before that, attackers went to the home of someone whose son was a "crypto-influencer based in Dubai." At the father's home, the kidnappers "tied up [the father's] wife and daughter and forced him into a car. The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html">https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921624">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            

<p>Yggdrasil is an experimental compact routing scheme that is <strong>fully decentralised</strong> and only requires a small amount of state to work. It is predominanently a shortest-path scheme, whereby the network will attempt to find the most direct path to the destination.</p>

<p><img src="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/assets/images/about/first.svg"></p>

<p>Nodes are equal participants and connect to each other using <strong>peering connections</strong> which carry network traffic. Peerings can be set up over any IP network — whether that’s a direct wired or wireless link, a local area network or even the Internet. In some cases, peerings can also be set up automatically by nearby devices on the same network using multicast discovery.</p>

<p>All nodes on an Yggdrasil network are routers and will automatically pass traffic to help it get closer to its destination where possible. This means that, even in a network that is only sparsely connected, <strong>all nodes will be reachable</strong> by all other nodes on that network. It doesn’t even matter if a node is behind a NAT — once a peering is established, traffic flows in both directions over that peering.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil is also designed to tolerate changes in the network. For example, if a link fails, the network will self-heal and use other links to route traffic where available. This makes it <strong>suitable for use in mesh networks</strong>, where the network topolopy can and often will change.</p>

<p>Each node on the network has a location-independent <strong>cryptographic identity</strong> and, in our <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">current experimental implementation</a>, stable IPv6 addresses are generated from this key. This allows IPv6-supporting applications to work over Yggdrasil largely without modification. The address is fully mobile and stays with the node as it moves around the network.</p>

<h3 id="why-yggdrasil">Why Yggdrasil?</h3>

<p>Many networks that exist today are hierarchical in nature, require extensive manual configuration and often rely on a certain degree of centralisation in order to scale. This often makes it difficult or impractical to set up networks quickly on an ad-hoc basis and so most people are heavily reliant on their Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>

<p>On the other hand, Yggdrasil requires <strong>very little configuration</strong> in order to work and full multi-hop networks can be built up very quickly and easily using Yggdrasil.</p>

<p>Nodes do not need to be assigned an address from a centralised authority; they can <strong>generate their own cryptographic identity</strong> and, more importantly, they can keep this address as they roam. Once peering connections are established, routing information is propagated quickly and automatically throughout the network.</p>

<p>This ability to provide full end-to-end routability between all network nodes means that Yggdrasil is potentially an enabling technology for true edge computing scenarios, as well as real-world mesh networks, as it <strong>does not rely on the Internet</strong> to function.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-yggdrasil-compare-to-other-projects">How does Yggdrasil compare to other projects?</h3>

<p>Yggdrasil is often compared to other projects attempting to create anonymous overlays, such as Tor, I2P, Lokinet and others. These projects are very different to Yggdrasil, in part because they try to guarantee anonymity. Yggdrasil does not aim to provide and <strong>does not guarantee anonymity</strong>. These projects are also intentionally overlay-by-design rather than by convenience, whereas Yggdrasil only exists as an overlay network today because it is an easy way to test the design.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil is frequently compared with VPN projects such as Wireguard, Tailscale, Nebula and Zerotier. Although it is possible to use Yggdrasil to build up private networks and/or point-to-point VPN links, this isn’t explicitly our primary goal. It’s also important to understand that connecting any single node of a private network to another network (such as a public peer) will result in <strong>both networks being bridged together</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, Yggdrasil has <strong>no native exit nodes</strong>, nor does it have any concept of exit nodes, for providing access to the public Internet or to other networks. This can be achieved using proxies or other tunnelling solutions on top of Yggdrasil but this is not something we explicitly aim to provide.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-status-of-the-project">What is the status of the project?</h3>

<p>Yggdrasil is currently an <strong>alpha-level research project</strong>, with on-going development but actively maintained. Our expectation is that a future beta-quality release should know enough to be compatible in the face of wire format changes, and reasonably feature complete. A “stable” 1.0 release, if it ever happens, would probably be feature complete, with no expectation of future wire format changes, and free of known critical bugs.</p>

<p>The true goal of this project is to test the scalability of the Yggdrasil routing scheme and we are doing so with our <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">overlay network implementation</a>. Studying the behaviour of the network in the real world is most easily achieved with a large number of participants running the software and joining the public test network. We’ve done our best to support <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation.html">as many platforms as possible</a> and have a number of <a href="https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/public-peers">public peers</a> that you can connect to in order to join the network, so please feel free to experiment.</p>

<p>That said, we <strong>recommend against running any mission-critical workloads</strong> over Yggdrasil and it may be dangerous to rely solely on Yggdrasil for any life-or-death situation. There may be failure modes that we don’t yet know about yet!</p>

<p>The project is likely to reach a number of possible outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The project may reach a reasonably stable state but never attract a large enough number of users</li>
  <li>The project may attract a large enough number of users but reveal inherent design flaws in the process (a learning exercise for a future project or protocol version perhaps)</li>
  <li>The project may end up working perfectly even as the network grows, in which case it will become worthwhile to look at writing better-optimised implementations and/or moving the important parts into other projects</li>
</ol>

												<p>A Texas firm recently charged with conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States is at the center of a vast network of companies in the U.S. and Pakistan whose employees are accused of using online ads to scam westerners seeking help with trademarks, book writing, mobile app development and logo designs, a new investigation reveals.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/motion_to_seal_eWorldTrade_Azneem_Bilwani_Abtach_drugs_merged_usa_vs_eworldtradellc-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an indictment</a> (PDF) unsealed last month, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> said Dallas-based <strong>eWorldTrade</strong> “operated an online business-to-business marketplace that facilitated the distribution of synthetic opioids such as isotonitazene and carfentanyl, both significantly more potent than fentanyl.”</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, eWorldTrade[.]com now features <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-online-marketplace-operator-charged-trafficking-deadly-synthetic-opioids-stronger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seizure notice</a> from the DOJ. eWorldTrade operated as a wholesale seller of consumer goods, including clothes, machinery, chemicals, automobiles and appliances. The DOJ’s indictment includes no additional details about eWorldTrade’s business, origins or other activity, and at first glance the website might appear to be a legitimate e-commerce platform that also just happened to sell some restricted chemicals</p>

Image: archive.org.</p></div>
<p>However, an investigation into the company’s founders reveals they are connected to a sprawling network of websites that have a history of extortionate scams involving trademark registration, book publishing, exam preparation, and the design of logos, mobile applications and websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98283759/ELR20240903134921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Records</a> from the <strong>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office </strong>(USPTO) show the eWorldTrade mark is owned by an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azneem-bilwani-1630291a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Azneem Bilwani </b></a>in Karachi (this name also is in the registration records for the now-seized eWorldTrade domain). Mr. Bilwani is perhaps better known as the director of the Pakistan-based IT provider <strong>Abtach Ltd.</strong>, which has been <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/TM-Show-Cause-Order-Abtach-et-al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">singled out</a> by the USPTO <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/google-blocks-ads-trademark-terminal-operator-abtach-following-uspto-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Google</a> for operating trademark registration scams (the main offices for <span>eWorldtrade and Abtach share the same address in Pakistan).</span></p>
<p>In November 2021, the USPTO <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/the-dangerous-legacy-of-axact-how-diploma-mill-in-pakistan-led-trademark-scam-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Abtach</a> of perpetrating “an egregious scheme to deceive and defraud applicants for federal trademark registrations by improperly altering official USPTO correspondence, overcharging application filing fees, misappropriating the USPTO’s trademarks, and impersonating the USPTO.”</p>
<p>Abtach offered trademark registration at suspiciously low prices compared to legitimate costs of over USD $1,500, and claimed they could register a trademark in 24 hours. Abtach reportedly <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/abtach-rebrands-intersys-after-being-banned-uspto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded </a>to <strong>Intersys Limited</strong> after the USPTO banned Abtach from filing any more trademark applications.</p>

<h2>FROM AXACT TO ABTACH</h2>
<p>Many of Abtach’s employees are former associates of a similar company in Pakistan called <strong>Axact</strong> that was targeted by Pakistani authorities in a 2015 fraud investigation. Axact came under law enforcement scrutiny after <strong>The New York Times</strong> ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/world/asia/fake-diplomas-real-cash-pakistani-company-axact-reaps-millions-columbiana-barkley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a front-page story</a> about the company’s most lucrative scam business: Hundreds of sites peddling fake college degrees and diplomas.</p>
<p><span>People who purchased fake certifications were subsequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/world/asia/pakistan-axact-degree-scam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackmailed by Axact employees posing as government officials</a>, who would demand additional payments under threats of prosecution or imprisonment for having bought fraudulent “unauthorized” academic degrees. This practice created a continuous cycle of extortion, internally referred to as “upselling.” </span></p>
<p>“Axact took money from at least 215,000 people in 197 countries — one-third of them from the United States,” The Times reported. “Sales agents wielded threats and false promises and impersonated government officials, earning the company at least $89 million in its final year of operation.”</p>
<p>Dozens of top Axact employees were arrested, jailed, held for months, tried and sentenced to seven years for various fraud violations. But a 2019 research brief on Axact’s diploma mills found none of those convicted had started their prison sentence, and that several had fled Pakistan and never returned.</p>
<p>“In October 2016, a Pakistan district judge acquitted 24 Axact officials at trial due to ‘not enough evidence’ and then later admitted he had accepted a bribe (of $35,209) from Axact,” reads <a href="https://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/webinar-documents/94-4-academic-fraud-and-the-worlds-largest-diploma-mill.pdf?sfvrsn=4b276f1f_2#:~:text=Dozens%20of%20top%20Axact%20ex,was%20caught%20at%20the%20airport." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a history</a> (PDF) published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.</p>
<p>In 2021, Pakistan’s <strong>Federal Investigation Agency</strong> (FIA) charged Bilwani and nearly four dozen others — many of them Abtach employees — with running an elaborate trademark scam. The authorities <a href="https://files.lbr.cloud/public/2021-02/report.pdf?nh3DUDQa7dd3jS63lsAN2dWDbHIQjplS=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called it</a> “the biggest money laundering case in the history of Pakistan,” and named a number of businesses based in Texas that allegedly helped move the proceeds of cybercrime.</p>

<p><span>Mr. Mansoor is actively involved with and promoting a Quran study business called <strong>quranmasteronline[.]com</strong>, which was founded by Junaid’s brother <strong>Qasim Mansoor</strong> (Qasim is also named in the FIA criminal investigation).

<p>The CEO of Digitonics Labs is <strong>Muhammad Burhan Mirza</strong>, a former Axact official who was arrested by the FIA as part of its money laundering and trademark fraud investigation in 2021. In 2023, prosecutors in Pakistan charged Mirza, Mansoor and 14 other Digitonics employees with fraud, impersonating government officials, phishing, cheating and extortion. Mirza’s LinkedIn profile says he currently runs an educational technology/life coach enterprise called <strong>TheCoach360</strong>, which purports to help young kids “achieve financial independence.”</p>
<p>Reached via LinkedIn, Mr. Mirza denied having anything to do with eWorldTrade or any of its sister companies in Texas.</p>
<p>“Moreover, I have no knowledge as to the companies you have mentioned,” said Mr. Mirza, who did not respond to follow-up questions.</p>
<p>The current disposition of the FIA’s fraud case against the defendants is unclear. The investigation was marred early on by allegations of corruption and bribery. In 2021, Pakistani authorities alleged Bilwani paid a six-figure bribe to FIA investigators. Meanwhile, attorneys for Mr. Bilwani <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/194s1jG24OE2KjHtOhfGu51i6NhCFGV2X/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that although their client did pay a bribe, the payment was solicited by government officials. Mr. Bilwani did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<h2>THE TEXAS NEXUS</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has learned that the people and entities at the center of the FIA investigations have built a significant presence in the United States, with a strong concentration in Texas. The Texas businesses promote websites that sell logo and web design, ghostwriting, and academic cheating services. Many of these entities have recently been sued for fraud and breach of contract by angry former customers, who claimed the companies relentlessly upsold them while failing to produce the work as promised.</p>
<p>For example, the FIA complaints named <strong>Retrocube LLC </strong>and <strong>360 Digital Marketing LLC</strong>, two entities that share a street address with eWorldTrade: 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 8025, Dallas, Texas. Also incorporated at that Pacific Avenue address is <strong>abtach[.]ae</strong>, a web design and marketing firm based in Dubai; and <strong>intersyslimited[.]com</strong>, the new name of Abtach after they were banned by the USPTO. Other businesses registered at this address market services for logo design, mobile app development, and ghostwriting.</p>

<p>360 Digital Marketing’s website 360digimarketing[.]com is owned by an Abtach front company called <strong>Abtech LTD</strong>.

<h2>VICTIMS SPEAK OUT</h2>
<p>Ms. Will’s lawsuit is just one of more than two dozen complaints over the past four years wherein plaintiffs sued one of this group’s web design, wiki editing or ghostwriting services. In 2021, a New Jersey man <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOXxv4GP3-zz2tujPYHChmWBY6KUc70P/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued Octagroup Technologies</a>, alleging they ripped him off when he paid a total of more than $26,000 for the design and marketing of a web-based mapping service.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in that case did not respond to requests for comment, but his complaint alleges Octagroup and a myriad other companies it contracted with produced minimal work product despite subjecting him to relentless upselling. That case was decided in favor of the plaintiff because the defendants never contested the matter in court.</p>
<p>In 2023, 360 Digital Marketing LLC and Retrocube LLC were sued by a woman who said they scammed her out of $40,000 over a book she wanted help writing. That lawsuit helpfully showed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w_6-RqZl7GBea-WtdgFkv6xHRVWaG5DV/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an image of the office front door</a> at 1910 Pacific Ave Suite 8025, which featured the logos of 360 Digital Marketing, Retrocube, and eWorldTrade.</p>
<div id="attachment_71140"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71140" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/360digitalmarketingfrontdoorintexas.png" alt="" width="611" height="763"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71140">The front door at 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 8025, Dallas, Texas.</p></div>
<p>The lawsuit was filed pro se by <strong>Leigh Riley</strong>, a 64-year-old career IT professional who paid 360 Digital Marketing to have a company called <strong>Talented Ghostwriter</strong> co-author and promote a series of books she’d outlined on spirituality and healing.</p>
<p>“The main reason I hired them was because I didn’t understand what I call the formula for writing a book, and I know there’s a lot of marketing that goes into publishing,” Riley explained in an interview. “I know nothing about that stuff, and these guys were convincing that they could handle all aspects of it. Until I discovered they couldn’t write a damn sentence in English properly.”</p>
<p>Riley’s well-documented lawsuit (not linked here because it features a great deal of personal information) includes screenshots of conversations with the ghostwriting team, which was constantly assigning her to new writers and editors, and ghosting her on scheduled conference calls about progress on the project. Riley said she ended up writing most of the book herself because the work they produced was unusable.</p>
<p>“Finally after months of promising the books were printed and on their way, they show up at my doorstep with the wrong title on the book,” Riley said. When she demanded her money back, she said the people helping her with the website to promote the book locked her out of the site.</p>
<div id="attachment_71203"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71203" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rileylawsuit.png" alt="" width="754" height="686"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71203">A conversation snippet from Leigh Riley’s lawsuit against Talented Ghostwriter, aka 360 Digital Marketing LLC. “Other companies once they have you money they don’t even respond or do anything,” the ghostwriting team manager explained.</p></div>
<p>Riley decided to sue, naming 360 Digital Marketing LLC and Retrocube LLC, among others.&nbsp; The companies offered to settle the matter for $20,000, which she accepted. “I didn’t have money to hire a lawyer, and I figured it was time to cut my losses,” she said.</p>
<p>Riley said she could have saved herself a great deal of headache by doing some basic research on Talented Ghostwriter, whose website claims the company is based in Los Angeles. According to the California Secretary of State, however, there is no registered entity by that name. Rather, the address claimed by <strong>talentedghostwriter[.]com</strong> is a vacant office building with a “space available” sign in the window.</p>
<p>California resident <strong>Walter Horsting </strong>discovered something similar when he&nbsp;sued 360 Digital Marketing in small claims court last year, after hiring a company called <strong>Vox Ghostwriting</strong> to help write, edit and promote a spy novel he’d been working on. Horsting said he paid Vox $3,300 to ghostwrite a 280-page book, and was upsold an Amazon marketing and publishing package for $7,500.</p>
<p>In an interview, Horsting said the prose that Vox Ghostwriting produced was “juvenile at best,” forcing him to rewrite and edit the work himself, and to partner with a graphical artist to produce illustrations. Horsting said that when it came time to begin marketing the novel, Vox Ghostwriting tried to further upsell him on marketing packages, while dodging scheduled meetings with no follow-up.</p>
<p>“They have a money back guarantee, and when they wouldn’t refund my money I said I’m taking you to court,” Horsting recounted. “I tried to serve them in Los Angeles but found no such office exists. I talked to a salon next door and they said someone else had recently shown up desperately looking for where the ghostwriting company went, and it appears there are a trail of corpses on this. I finally tracked down where they are in Texas.”</p>
<p>It was the same office that Ms. Riley served her lawsuit against. Horsting said he has a court hearing scheduled later this month, but he’s under no illusions that winning the case means he’ll be able to collect.</p>
<p>“At this point, I’m doing it out of pride more than actually expecting anything to come to good fortune for me,” he said.</p>
<p>The following mind map was helpful in piecing together key events, individuals and connections mentioned above. It’s important to note that this graphic only scratches the surface of the operations tied to this group. For example, in Case 2 we can see mention of academic cheating services, wherein people can be hired to take online proctored exams on one’s behalf. Those who hire these services soon find themselves subject to impersonation and blackmail attempts for larger and larger sums of money, with the threat of publicly exposing their unethical academic cheating activity.</p>

<h2>GOOGLE RESPONDS</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity reviewed the Google Ad Transparency links for nearly 500 different websites tied to this network of ghostwriting, logo, app and web development businesses. Those website names were then fed into <strong>spyfu.com</strong>, a competitive intelligence company that tracks the reach and performance of advertising keywords. Spyfu estimates that between April 2023 and April 2025, those websites <em>spent more than $10 million on Google ads</em>.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Google said in a written statement that it is constantly policing its ad network for bad actors, pointing to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/ads_safety_report_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ads safety report</a> (PDF) showing Google blocked or removed 5.1 billion bad ads last year — including more than 500 million ads related to trademarks.</p>
<p>“Our policy against Enabling Dishonest Behavior prohibits products or services that help users mislead others, including ads for paper-writing or exam-taking services,” the statement reads. “When we identify ads or advertisers that violate our policies, we take action, including by suspending advertiser accounts, disapproving ads, and restricting ads to specific domains when appropriate.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement.png" alt="" width="749" height="490" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement.png 980w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement-768x502.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement-782x511.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>Google did not respond to specific questions about the advertising entities mentioned in this story, saying only that “we are actively investigating this matter and addressing any policy violations, including suspending advertiser accounts when appropriate.”</p>
<p>From reviewing the ad accounts that have been promoting these scam websites, it appears Google has very recently acted to remove a large number of the offending ads. Prior to my notifying Google about the extent of this ad network on April 28, the Google Ad Transparency network listed over 500 ads for 360 Digital Marketing; as of this publication, that number had <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR11727645009044832257?region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dwindled to 10</a>.</p>
<p>On April 30, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/16189141?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=16083443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that starting this month its ads transparency page will display the payment profile name as the payer name for verified advertisers, if that name differs from their verified advertiser name. Searchengineland.com <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-adds-to-its-transparency-rules-for-who-is-paying-for-ads-454899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> the changes are aimed at increasing accountability in digital advertising.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZ4yHTsWxnTtEVrazDbqWQY5Vju8USeBfszCGl6uxfc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This spreadsheet</a> lists the domain names, advertiser names, and Google Ad Transparency links for more than 350 entities offering ghostwriting, publishing, web design and academic cheating services.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>June Huh often finds himself lost. Every afternoon, he takes a long walk around Princeton University, where he’s a professor in the mathematics department. On this particular day in mid-May, he’s making his way through the woods around the nearby Institute for Advanced Study — “Just so you know,” he says as he considers a fork in the path ahead, “I don’t know where we are” — pausing every so often to point out the subtle movements of wildlife hiding beneath leaves or behind trees. Among the animals he spots over the next two hours of wandering are a pair of frogs, a red-crested bird, a turtle the size of a thimble, and a quick-footed fox, each given its own quiet moment of observation.</p>
<p>“I’m very good at finding stuff,” he says. “That’s one of my special abilities.”</p>
<p>Huh, 39, has now been awarded the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, for his ability to wander through mathematical landscapes and find just the right objects — objects that he then uses to get the seemingly disparate fields of geometry and combinatorics to talk to each other in new and exciting ways. Starting in graduate school, he has solved several major problems in combinatorics, forging a circuitous route by way of other branches of math to get to the heart of each proof. Every time, finding that path is akin to a “little miracle,” Huh said.</p>
<p>One might say the same of his path into mathematics itself: that it was characterized by much wandering and a series of small miracles. When he was younger, Huh had no desire to be a mathematician. He was indifferent to the subject, and he dropped out of high school to become a poet. It would take a chance encounter during his university years — and many moments of feeling lost — for him to find that mathematics held what he’d been looking for all along.</p>


    
<p>That poetic detour has since proved crucial to his mathematical breakthroughs. His artistry, according to his colleagues, is evident in the way he uncovers those just-right objects at the center of his work, and in the way he seeks a deeper significance in everything he does. “Mathematicians are a lot like artists in that really we’re looking for beauty,” said <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-federico-ardila-dances-to-the-joys-and-sorrows-of-discovery-20171120/">Federico Ardila-Mantilla</a>, a mathematician at San Francisco State University and one of Huh’s collaborators. “But I think in his case, it’s really pronounced. And I just really like his taste. He makes beautiful things.”</p>
<p>“When I found out that he came to mathematics after poetry, I’m like, OK, this makes sense to me,” Ardila added.</p>
<p>Huh himself draws parallels between the artist and the mathematician. For both, he said, “it feels like you’re grabbing something that’s already there, rather than creating something in your mind.”</p>

<p>On any given day, Huh does about three hours of focused work. He might think about a math problem, or prepare to lecture a classroom of students, or schedule doctor’s appointments for his two sons. “Then I’m exhausted,” he said. “Doing something that’s valuable, meaningful, creative” — or a task that he doesn’t particularly want to do, like scheduling those appointments — “takes away a lot of your energy.”</p>
<p>To hear him tell it, he doesn’t usually have much control over what he decides to focus on in those three hours. For a few months in the spring of 2019, all he did was read. He felt an urge to revisit books he’d first encountered when he was younger — including <em>Meditations</em> by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and several novels by the German author Hermann Hesse — so that’s what he did. “Which means I didn’t do any work,” Huh said. “So that’s kind of a problem.” (He’s since made peace with this constraint, though. “I used to try to resist … but I finally learned to give up to those temptations.” As a consequence, “I became better and better at ignoring deadlines.”)</p>

    <p>He finds that forcing himself to do something or defining a specific goal — even for something he enjoys — never works. It’s particularly difficult for him to move his attention from one thing to another. “I think intention and willpower … are highly overrated,” he said. “You rarely achieve anything with those things.”</p>
<p>This has been the case since he was young. He was born in 1983 in California, where his parents were finishing graduate school. The family then moved to Seoul, South Korea, when Huh was around 2 years old. There, his father taught statistics, his mother Russian language and literature.</p>
<p>School was excruciating for him. He loved to learn but couldn’t focus or absorb anything in a classroom setting. Instead, he preferred to read on his own — in elementary school, he devoured all 10 volumes of an encyclopedia about living things — and to explore a mountain near his family’s apartment. He quickly became familiar with every corner of it, but he still managed to get lost, one time even ending up in an area that was restricted due to the possible presence of land mines.</p>
<p>He tried his best to avoid math whenever possible. His father once tried to teach him out of a workbook, but rather than try to solve the problems, Huh would copy the solutions from the back. When his father caught on and tore those pages out, Huh went to a local bookstore and wrote down the answers there. “He gave up at that point,” Huh said.</p>
<p>When he was 16 years old and in the middle of his first year in high school (which lasts for three years in South Korea), he decided to drop out to write poetry. He was something of a romantic. “I could literally physically cry after listening to good music,” he said. He wrote about nature and about his own experiences. He planned to complete his masterpiece in the two years before he’d have to attend university. “So that didn’t happen,” he laughed.</p>
<p>He found the writing process too focused on the self — and for him, that exploration was often painful and depressing. Moreover, as he later realized, “I wanted to be someone who writes great poetry,” he said. “I didn’t want to write great poetry.” Now he sees that version of himself as almost a complete stranger.</p>
<p>When he entered Seoul National University in 2002, he felt adrift. He briefly flirted with the idea of being a science writer and decided to major in astronomy and physics. But he frequently skipped class, and he had to retake several courses. “I was just generally lost,” he said. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I didn’t know what I was good at.”</p>
<p>It turned out that he was good at math after all — something he discovered entirely by accident.</p>
<h2><strong>True Beauty</strong></h2>
<p>It took Huh six years to graduate. In that sixth year, he enrolled in a class taught by the famed Japanese mathematician Heisuke Hironaka, who <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal/fields-medals-1970">won the Fields Medal in 1970</a>. Hironaka was charismatic, and Huh quickly fell under his sway.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just his professor’s charm that attracted Huh that first day in class. It was also the math itself. Ostensibly, the course was an introduction to algebraic geometry, the study of solutions to algebraic equations and their geometric properties. Instead, Hironaka taught his own work in an area called singularity theory, which focuses on certain types of spaces. “Basically, he lectured about what he thought about yesterday,” Huh said — a very particular problem, and proofs that weren’t necessarily correct. What began as a 200-student class quickly dwindled; a few weeks later, only five students were left, Huh among them.</p>
<p>For the first time, he witnessed research mathematics unfolding in real time. Hironaka’s lectures weren’t polished as in other undergraduate courses, where everything was streamlined, the answers already worked out. Huh loved the suspense of it, the act of trying to do something no one really knew how to do — and the freedom that came with not knowing, the surprises that became possible. The typical material taught in college has been refined over the course of centuries, he said. “That’s very different from observing this raw mathematics in front of your eyes.”</p>

    <p>Huh discovered that this kind of mathematics could give him what poetry could not: the ability to search for beauty outside himself, to try to grasp something external, objective and true, in a way that opened him up more than writing ever had. “You don’t think about your small self,” he said. “There’s no place for ego.” He found that unlike when he was a poet, he was never motivated by the desire for recognition. He just wanted to do math.</p>
<p>Hironaka, perhaps recognizing this, took him under his wing. After Huh graduated and started a master’s program at Seoul National University — where he also met Nayoung Kim, now his wife — he spent a lot of time with Hironaka. During breaks, he followed the professor back to Japan, staying with him in Tokyo and Kyoto, carrying his bags, sharing meals, and of course continuing to discuss math.</p>
<h2><strong>An Unexpected Discovery</strong></h2>
<p>Huh applied to about a dozen doctoral programs in the U.S. But because of his undistinguished undergraduate experience, he was rejected by all of them save one. In 2009, he began his studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, before transferring to the University of Michigan in 2011 to complete his doctorate.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges — living in a new country, spending time apart from Kim (she stayed at Seoul National University for her doctorate in mathematics) — Huh cherished his experiences in graduate school. He was able to dedicate himself wholly to math, and he relished the freedom of exploration that had drawn him to the subject in the first place.</p>
<p>He immediately stood out. As a beginning graduate student in Illinois, he <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2012-25-03/S0894-0347-2012-00731-0/">proved a conjecture in graph theory</a> that had been open for 40 years. In its simplest form, the problem, known as Read’s conjecture, concerned polynomials — equations like <em>n</em><sup>4</sup> + 5<em>n</em><sup>3</sup> + 6<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>n</em> + 1 — attached to graphs, which are collections of vertices (points) connected by edges (lines). In particular, let’s say you want to color the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Given a certain number of colors at your disposal, there are many ways to color the graph. It turns out that the total number of possibilities can be calculated using an equation called the chromatic polynomial (which is written in terms of the number of colors being used).</p>
<p>Mathematicians observed that the coefficients of chromatic polynomials, no matter the graph, always seem to obey certain patterns. First, they are unimodal, meaning they increase and then decrease. Take the previous example of a polynomial. The absolute values of its coefficients — 1, 5, 6, 3, 1 — form a unimodal sequence. Moreover, that sequence is also “log concave.” For any three consecutive numbers in the sequence, the square of the middle number is at least as large as the product of the terms on either side of it. (In the above polynomial, for instance, 6<sup>2</sup> ≥ 5 × 3.)</p>

<p>Still, mathematicians struggled to prove these properties. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, along came Huh.</p>
<p>As a master’s student, he had studied algebraic geometry and singularity theory with Hironaka. The main objects of study in that field are called algebraic varieties, which can be thought of as shapes defined by certain equations. Intriguingly, associated to certain kinds of algebraic varieties are numbers that are known to be log concave — something Huh only knew because of the serendipitous direction his studies had taken him in. Huh’s key idea was to find a way to construct an algebraic variety such that those associated numbers were precisely the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial of the graph from the original question.</p>
<p>His solution stunned the math community. It was at that point that the University of Michigan, having rejected his initial application, recruited him to their graduate program.</p>
<p>Huh’s achievement was impressive not just because he had solved Read’s conjecture when it had seemed completely intractable for so long. He had shown that something much deeper — and geometric — was lurking beneath combinatorial properties of graphs.</p>
<p>Mathematicians were also impressed by his demeanor. His talks at conferences were always accessible and concrete; in speaking with him, it was clear that he was thinking both deeply and broadly about the concepts he was working with. “He was ridiculously mature for a graduate student,” said <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/">Matthew Baker</a>, a mathematician at the Georgia Institute of Technology. After Baker met him for the first time, “I was just like, who is this guy?”</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mmustata/">Mircea Mustaţă</a>, Huh’s adviser at the University of Michigan, he required almost no supervision or guidance. Unlike most graduate students, he already had a program in mind, and ideas about how to pursue it. “He was more like a colleague,” Mustaţă said. “He already had his own way of looking at things.”</p>
<p>Many of his collaborators note that he’s incredibly humble and down-to-earth. When he learned he’d won the Fields Medal, “it didn’t really feel that good,” Huh said. “Of course you are happy, but deep down, you’re a little bit worried that they might eventually figure out that you’re not actually that good. I am a reasonably good mathematician, but am I Fields Medal-worthy?”</p>
<h2><strong>Escape From Space</strong></h2>
<p>Graphs are actually just one type of object that can define more general structures called matroids. Consider, for example, points on a two-dimensional plane. If more than two points lie on a line in this plane, you can say that those points are “dependent.” Matroids are abstract objects that capture notions like dependence and independence in all sorts of different contexts — from graphs to vector spaces to algebraic fields.</p>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Just as graphs have chromatic polynomials associated with them, there are equations called characteristic polynomials attached to matroids. It was conjectured that the polynomials for these more general objects should also have coefficients that are log concave. But the techniques Huh used to prove Read’s conjecture only worked for showing log concavity for a very narrow class of matroids, such as the matroids that arise from graphs.</p>
<p>With the mathematician <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/katz.60/">Eric Katz</a>, Huh <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-011-0777-6">broadened the class of matroids</a> such a proof could apply to. They followed a recipe of sorts. As before, the strategy was to start with the object of interest — here, a matroid — and use it to construct an algebraic variety. From there, they could extract an object called a cohomology ring and use some of its properties to prove log concavity.</p>
<p>There was just one problem. Most matroids don’t have any sort of geometric foundation, which means there’s not actually an algebraic variety to associate to them. Instead, Huh, Katz and the mathematician <a href="http://www.math.huji.ac.il/~adiprasito/">Karim Adiprasito</a> figured out a way to write down the right cohomology ring straight from the matroid, essentially from scratch. They then showed, using a new set of techniques, that it behaved as if it had come from an actual algebraic variety, even though it hadn’t. In doing so, they proved log concavity for all matroids, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-path-less-taken-to-the-peak-of-the-math-world-20170627/">resolving the problem known as Rota’s conjecture</a> once and for all. “It’s pretty remarkable that it works,” Baker said.</p>
<p>The work showed that “you don’t need space to do geometry,” Huh said. “That made me really fundamentally rethink what geometry is.” It would also guide him toward a host of other problems, where he continued to push that idea further, allowing him to develop an even broader range of methods.</p>
<p>But for all the specificity the work requires, building the right cohomology ring requires massive amounts of guesswork and groping around in the dark. It was an aspect of the work that Huh particularly enjoyed. “There is no guiding principle … no clearly defined goal,” he said. “You just have to make a guess.”</p>

    <p>That lack of intention precisely mirrors how he functions best in his day-to-day life, too. It was as if he’d uncovered a mathematical program that perfectly fit his personality. Once again, he found that “things just happen by themselves,” Huh said.</p>
<h2><strong>The Heart of Things</strong></h2>
<p>Huh speaks slowly, pausing often and choosing his words carefully, and carries himself in a calm, peaceful manner that borders on meditative. “He doesn’t get so easily excited,” said <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~wang/">Botong Wang</a>, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who has collaborated with Huh on a number of important recent results.</p>
<p>He proceeds just as deliberately when doing mathematics. Wang was shocked when he first witnessed it. “I have this math competition experience, that as a mathematician you have to be clever, you have to be fast,” he said. “But June is the opposite. … If you talk to him for five minutes about some calculus problem, you’d think this guy wouldn’t pass a qualifying exam. He’s very slow.” So slow, in fact, that at first Wang thought they were wasting a lot of time on easy problems they already understood. But then he realized that Huh was learning even seemingly simple concepts in a much deeper way — and in precisely the way that would later prove useful.</p>
<p>“June likes to do things in the right way,” said <a href="http://gdenham.math.uwo.ca/">Graham Denham</a>, a mathematician at Western University in Ontario and one of Huh’s collaborators.</p>
<p>For instance, Denham, Ardila and Huh had just completed a 50-page proof of a problem closely related to Rota’s conjecture when Huh said they should take some more time to find a cleaner, more appealing approach. He thought there was a nicer explanation out there, and that it was best not to rush things. “Federico and I were like, oh, OK, so we’ll just chuck that, then, shall we?” Denham said.</p>
<p>It took two years to craft <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13116">the better argument</a>. “It’s good we’re all tenured,” Ardila said. Ultimately, though, Ardila and Denham agreed that the extra work was worth it. Their end result “was totally different, and deeper, and [got to] the heart of things,” Ardila said.</p>

<p>This approach doesn’t just apply to Huh’s mathematical work. In 2013, he decided he wanted to learn to cook. As a total beginner, he adopted the strategy of making the same dish — a simple pasta in oil — every day until it was perfect. For six months, that’s exactly what he did. (To date, according to Kim, that’s the only dish he knows how to cook.)</p>
<p>Huh’s entire life is built on routine. “Almost all of my days are exactly the same,” he said. “I have a very high tolerance for repetition.” He has trouble staying asleep and usually wakes up at around 3 a.m. He then goes to the gym, has breakfast with his wife and two sons (one is 8 years old, the other just turned 1), and walks his eldest to school before heading to his Princeton office.</p>
<p>The office is spare, practically empty. There’s a large desk, a couch for sleeping — Huh typically takes a nap later in the morning — and a yoga mat rolled out on the floor (just for lying down, he said; he doesn’t actually know how to do yoga). No books, just a few stacks of papers neatly arranged on a shelf against one wall. In the corner is a vacuum cleaner. Huh likes repetitive, mindless activities like cleaning, dishwashing and the physical act of transcribing what he reads into a notebook.</p>
<p>He often works in the public library, in the children’s section, where it’s pretty noisy. “I don’t like quiet places,” he said. “It makes me sleepy.” Huh says this about many things.</p>
<p>He goes for a long walk after lunch each day, then returns to his office to do some more work (unless he’s already hit his three-hour quota) before heading home. He spends the rest of the evening with his family; they all go to sleep, together in one large bed, at around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>This preference for routine — and the tendency to get exhausted by anything that strays from it — can sometimes manifest in extreme ways. When he was completing his doctorate in Michigan, for instance, “I would cut off almost everything else,” Huh said. When he first moved to Ann Arbor, he found himself unequipped for the brutal winter. He had few belongings, and he needed a blanket. But when he looked up how to get to the local mall, he found it too logistically difficult. “It was just beyond my level of tolerance,” he said. “I did not want to waste my mental energy on figuring out how to go from here to there.” Instead, he walked to a nearby CVS drugstore, bought 10 squares of fabric and a giant stapler, and stapled the squares together to make a blanket.</p>

    <p>He lived off frozen pizza for months at a time because he didn’t want to deal with getting groceries and cooking. He just wanted to do math. He describes that period of his life as “almost monastic.” In fact, at the time, he really only spoke with another person — Mustaţă, his adviser — once a week.</p>
<p>Kim recalls visiting Huh when he was still in Illinois, and “after that, I really rethought our relationship,” she said. “Should I marry him? Because he [cannot] handle real-life skills, surviving skills.”</p>
<p>Yet marry him she did, in 2014. They moved to Princeton, where they both started work at the Institute for Advanced Study. It was Kim’s first time living in the U.S., and she felt uncomfortable taking care of certain tasks in English; she had to depend on Huh to get things done. “Let’s just say, she was disappointed,” he said.</p>
<p>Later that year, Kim gave birth to their first son, Dan. While in labor, she caught Huh doing math.</p>
<p>“My wife is a much more balanced person than I am,” he said. “Life has very many facets, and math is a very, very, very tiny part of it.”</p>
<p>“I’m a real worker,” Kim said. “He is a thinker.”</p>
<p>But, she added, Huh has improved drastically since then. As the couple raised Dan, “I learned how to live a more balanced life,” Huh said. “That was a transformative period.” He spends a lot of time with Dan — drawing with him, solving problems in intricate math workbooks that Dan creates for him, and taking him to the bookstore and other local spots. He even takes care of the logistical tasks that Kim asks him to do, albeit begrudgingly. “I still don’t like it,” he said, “but I mean, we cannot just live with stapled blankets.”</p>
<p>Now he’s even able to step away from mathematics. His mind no longer returns to working on problems when he’s in an idle state, and he’s able to take a break when something else requires him to.</p>
<p>“He’s a totally different person,” Kim said.</p>
<h2><strong>Heavy on Top</strong></h2>
<p>Regardless, some things haven’t changed. Huh can still muster only enough energy to work for a few hours each day. “Other people work one hour and just take a five-minute rest,” Kim said. “He is like, one hour do something else, and just focus for five minutes, 10 minutes.”</p>
<p>His search for beauty hasn’t changed either. And often he returns to questions about log concavity or similar concepts as a way to unearth that beauty.</p>

<p>For instance, he, Wang and other collaborators recently proved a fundamental problem about configurations of points, lines and planes called the Dowling-Wilson “top-heavy” conjecture. Consider a finite collection of points in the plane, where every pair of points is connected by a line. The mathematicians Paul Erdős and Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn showed that the number of lines must always be greater than or equal to the number of points (unless all the points are located on one line). Consider, for example, four points arranged at the corners of a square. Lines trace out the square and also connect opposite corners, adding up to six lines in total.</p>
<p>The top-heavy conjecture generalizes this idea. Instead of the plane, you’re given a set of points in some high-dimensional space. Consider all the lines that connect pairs of points, the planes spanned by sets of three points, the three-dimensional subspaces constructed from four points, and so on. Now think about a sequence built from these numbers: the number of points, the number of lines, the number of planes. Compare numbers in symmetric positions in that sequence (the first and last numbers, the second and penultimate numbers, and so on). The number corresponding to the higher-dimensional space will be at least as large — that is, the sequence is top-heavy. (This sequence is also conjectured to be log concave, but that has not yet been proved; so far, Huh and Wang have shown that the first half of the sequence is unimodal.)</p>

    <p>Huh and Wang adapted ideas from Huh’s work on Rota’s conjecture, but in doing so they had to push his program further. Again, they were working with matroids, algebraic varieties and cohomology rings. But this time the algebraic varieties they had to find involved singularities, places where a space looks different when you zoom in on it than it does at other points. That made it much more complicated to <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/acta-mathematica/volume-218/issue-2/Enumeration-of-points-lines-planes-etc/10.4310/ACTA.2017.v218.n2.a2.full">build the right spaces</a> and prove certain properties about their cohomology rings — and even more difficult to solve the case where they had to construct those rings <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06088">straight from the matroids</a>, without algebraic varieties to guide them.</p>
<p>During the five years they spent solving this problem, Huh also started investigating a way to complete the break from geometry. So much of his work until then involved the arduous task of building the exact cohomology that a problem required. Moreover, once that cohomology is found, mathematicians still have to prove that it satisfies certain properties, which can also take years.</p>

    <p>The new theory that he developed (along with the mathematician <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/pbranden">Petter Brändén</a>) was able to bypass those methods entirely. It allowed them to <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2020/192-3/p04">solve a problem</a> called the strong Mason conjecture (which asks questions about the number of independent sets in matroids), and other mathematicians have already used it to re-prove Rota’s conjecture in a more straightforward way. But even more important, it opens the door to finding entirely new problems, hints at an even deeper explanation for why all these log concavity statements are true, and intersects with problems in theoretical computer science in intriguing ways that are just beginning to be explored.</p>
<h2><strong>Click of the Connection</strong></h2>
        
        
<p>For Huh, when he is working, there’s something almost subconscious going on. In fact, he usually can’t trace how or when his ideas come to him. He doesn’t have sudden flashes of insight. Instead, “at some point, you just realize, oh, I know this,” he said. Maybe last week, he didn’t understand something, but now, without any additional input, the pieces have clicked into place without his realizing it. He likens it to the way your mind can surprise you and create unexpected connections when you’re dreaming. “It’s just amazing what human minds are capable of,” he said. “And it’s nice to admit that we don’t know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Perhaps this, too, speaks to the artist in him. He hopes to continue uncovering unexpected connections between different areas of math.</p>
<p>“He just follows the vision of this original program that he had … already as a graduate student,” Baker said. “It will be very interesting to see what the limits are.”</p>
<p>So far, Huh hasn’t hit them. And mathematicians are sure he’ll continue to make beautiful things.</p>
<p>When asked if he’d ever entertain the earlier version of his artist self and try writing poetry again, he shrugged. “Maybe. But I don’t know,” he said. “I’m very much into something else.”</p>

We’ve noticed that the term “GPU utilization” gets used to mean very different things by people solving problems at different parts of the stack. So we put together this article to share our framework for thinking about GPU utilization across the stack and the tips and tricks we’ve learned along the way.</p> <p>In particular, we’ll talk about three very different things that all get called “GPU utilization”:</p> <ul><li><a href="#what-is-gpu-allocation-utilization"><!----><!---->GPU Allocation Utilization<!----></a><!---->, the fraction of your GPUs that are running application code,</li> <li><a href="#what-is-gpu-kernel-utilization"><!----><!---->GPU Kernel Utilization<!----></a><!---->, the fraction of time your application is running code on GPUs, and</li> <li><a href="#what-is-model-flops-utilization-mfu"><!----><!---->Model FLOP/s Utilization<!----></a><!---->, the fraction of the GPUs’ theoretical arithmetic bandwidth your application is using to run models.</li></ul> <p>We’ll specifically focus on neural network inference workloads — neural networks because they are workload generating the most demand right now and inference because, unlike training, inference is a revenue center not a cost center. We’re betting on the revenue center.</p> <h2 id="what-is-utilization">What is utilization?</h2> <h3 id="utilization--output-achieved--capacity-paid-for">Utilization = Output achieved ÷ Capacity paid for</h3> <p><em>Utilization</em> relates the available capacity of a system to that system’s output.</p> <p>In throughput-oriented systems like GPU applications, the capacity paid for is often a <em>bandwidth</em> (e.g. the arithmetic bandwidth) and the output achieved is then a <em>throughput</em> (e.g. floating point operations per second, FLOP/s).</p> <p>Because it is a ratio, utilization is unitless. That means <strong>there are actually many GPU-related quantities you might call “GPU utilization”</strong>, leaving off the implicit units of the capacity and output. These different quantities range across orders of magnitude of time and across different organizational capacities (e.g. procurement, DevOps, and low-level performance engineering).</p> <h2 id="what-is-gpu-allocation-utilization">What is GPU Allocation Utilization?</h2> <h3 id="gpu-allocation-utilization--gpu-seconds-running-application-code--gpu-seconds-paid-for">GPU Allocation Utilization = GPU-seconds running application code ÷ GPU-seconds paid for</h3> <p>First, consider the number of GPUs that you have allocated — whether that is fixed GPU capacity on-premise in your basement (or data center) or it is rented capacity in a cloud data center (or many people’s basements) — across a period of time.</p> <p>We use the term <em>GPU Allocation Utilization</em> for the fraction of those GPU-seconds during which you were running application code. This is the highest-level notion of “GPU utilization”.</p> <p>There are two key limits on GPU Allocation Utilization: economic and developer-operational.</p> <p>The economic limits on GPU Allocation Utilization rise from combined technical and market limitations. Purchasing, commissioning, decomissioning, and selling GPUs cannot be done as quickly as the output demanded by the application changes (on the scale of seconds or minutes).</p> <p>Of course, as for other hardware we are blessed with highly-virtualized data center platforms (“clouds”) where we can virtually allocate and de-allocate GPU capacity. Even there, however, existing pricing models and demand that exceeds supply leave providers dictating terms, like multi-month or multi-year commitments, which limit achievable utilization for a given quality-of-service.</p> <div><p><h3>With a fixed, over-provisioned GPU allocation, utilization is low</h3> <!--[!--><!--]--></p>  <!--[--><!--]--></div> <p>Modal helps organizations solve this problem. We aggregate GPU demand across consumers and GPU supply across providers to improve GPU allocation efficiency.</p> <p>But GPU Allocation Utilization isn’t just about the GPU-seconds paid for, it’s about the GPU-seconds spent running application code.</p> <p>That’s where the DevOps limits on GPU Allocation Utilization come in. Even in a fully liquid GPU market, there is latency between the time at which a GPU is purchased or rented and the time at which the GPU is running useful work — time to configure operating systems, perform health checks, copy over application code, etc. Absent the ability to precisely predict future demand at timescales greater than that latency, this leads to reduced GPU Allocation Utilization, reduced quality-of-service, or both!</p> <div><p><h3>If allocation is slow, utilization and QoS suffer</h3> <!--[!--><!--]--></p>  <!--[--><!--]--></div> <p>To achieve high GPU Allocation Utilization and meet quality-of-service goals, allocation and spin-up to application code needs to be fast enough to respond to increases in demand.</p> <div><p><h3>With fast, automatic allocation, utilization and QoS can both be high</h3> <!--[!--><!--]--></p>  <!--[--><!--]--></div> <p>This is one of the core problems solved by Modal. We manage a large multi-cloud GPU fleet, benefitting from economies of scale to unlock better engineering solutions and concentration of measure to improve predictability of demand. We <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jJ1GhGkLY0"><!----><!---->built a custom container stack (in Rust btw)<!----></a><!----> to reduce the latency from non-application code and system configuration. And users’ workloads spin up faster because the serverless runtime for that container execution system frames user workloads in terms of application code, not virtual machine maintenance. That allows us to skip the repetitive, undifferentiated work required to create virtual machines. That unlocks novel engineering optimizations for us, like <a href="https://modal.com/blog/mem-snapshots"><!----><!---->memory snapshotting and restoration<!----></a><!---->, and it just-so-happens to make application engineering easier for our users.</p> <h2 id="what-level-of-gpu-allocation-utilization-can-i-expect-to-achieve">What level of GPU Allocation Utilization can I expect to achieve?</h2> <p>The existing numbers are sobering. According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ai-infrastructure.org/the-state-of-ai-infrastructure-at-scale-2024/"><!----><!---->State of AI Infrastructure at Scale 2024 report<!----></a><!---->, the majority of organizations achieve less than 70% GPU Allocation Utilization <em>when running at peak demand</em> — to say nothing of aggregate utilization. This is true even of sophisticated players, like the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.banana.dev/blog/sunset"><!----><!---->Banana serverless GPU platform<!----></a><!---->, which operated at an aggregate utilization of around 20%.</p> <p>With Modal, users can achieve GPU Allocation Utilization in excess of 90% — in aggregate, not just at peak.</p> <p>If that interests you, check out our <a href="https://modal.com/docs"><!----><!---->docs<!----></a><!----> and our <a href="https://modal.com/pricing"><!----><!---->pricing page<!----></a><!---->.</p> <p>If it doesn’t, read on for more about the software engineering required to get the most out of your GPUs — on Modal or elsewhere.</p> <h2 id="what-is-gpu-kernel-utilization">What is GPU Kernel Utilization?</h2> <h3 id="gpu-kernel-utilization--gpu-seconds-running-kernels--gpu-seconds-paid-for">GPU Kernel Utilization = GPU-seconds running kernels ÷ GPU-seconds paid for</h3> <p>Just because an allocated GPU is running application code doesn’t mean it is running code <em>on the GPU.</em> The term of art for “code that runs on the GPU” in the popular <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/cuda-programming-model"><!----><!---->CUDA programming model<!----></a><!----> for GPUs is “kernel”, and so we call the fraction of time we spend running code on the GPU the <em>GPU Kernel Utilization</em>.</p> <p>This utilization metric is reported by, among others, the beloved <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/host-software/nvidia-smi"><!----><code>nvidia-smi</code> command line tool<!----></a><!----> wrapping <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/host-software/nvml"><!----><!---->NVIDIA’s Management Library<!----></a><!----> for their GPU hardware, and so it is commonly checked and cited. We <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu-metrics"><!----><!---->expose it to our users<!----></a><!----> under the name that library uses, “GPU utilization”. Note that this name can be slightly misleading, since this metric does not care whether the code we’re running on the GPU is exercising the hardware’s actual capacity.</p> <p>An application that is achieving low GPU Allocation Utilization is necessarily going to achieve low GPU Kernel Utilization, so long as you consider all GPU-seconds being paid for: a unit not running application code can’t run kernels.</p> <p>Why else might you achieve low GPU Kernel Utilization? In particular, what patterns will show up as low kernel utilization per GPU?</p> <p>First, there might be lots of work to do that supports your application but doesn’t use the GPU, like moving input or output data via network or disk, downloading the many gigabytes of weights of a foundation model, or writing logs.</p> <p>These tasks can be sped up by usual means — judicious application of lazy and eager loading, parallelization, increased bandwidth for non-GPU components like networks, and deleting more code <a rel="nofollow" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html"><!----><!---->YAGN<!----></a><!---->.</p> <p>Second, the CPU might not be providing work to the GPU quickly enough. A typical GPU-accelerated program is, like a high-performance network application, a dance of concurrency between the CPU executing logic about what work must be done and specialized, but dumb, hardware that can actually do the work. For example, when multiplying two matrices, the popular PyTorch library needs to determine the shapes and types of those two matrices and then lookup the appropriate kernel — somewhat akin to a JIT database query optimizer selecting a physical operator mid-execution. If you are unable to complete this work before the GPU finishes its previous task, the GPU will idle. We’ll call this class of issue “host overhead”.</p> <p>Often, resolving host overhead is a matter of re-writing the host logic — preventing slow host work (like logging in Python) from blocking the host work that drives the GPU. But at the scale of milliseconds per task step, Python starts to become incapable of keeping up, and at the scale of microseconds per task step, the latency required to schedule kernels onto the GPU via <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/host-software/cuda-runtime-api"><!----><!---->the CUDA C++ APIs and driver<!----></a><!----> begins to bottleneck.</p> <p>In both cases, there are two basic optimizations. First, multiple kernels can be launched at once <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/"><!----><!---->using CUDA Graphs<!----></a><!---->, which essentially convert a sequence of kernel launches into a DAG that only needs to be launched once. Second, the application can aggregate more work for the GPU to complete for a given unit of host work — for example by <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/dynamic-batching"><!----><!---->batching<!----></a><!----> requests together — to improve utilization with a possible penalty to latency.</p> <p>Code regions with low GPU Kernel Utilization can be identified from application traces, like those produced by the <a href="https://modal.com/docs/examples/torch_profiling"><!----><!---->PyTorch Profiler<!----></a><!---->. Specifically, any period of time where all CUDA streams are empty is a period of zero GPU Kernel Utilization, and so applications with low GPU Kernel Utilization have largely empty CUDA streams in their traces, like the one below. These periods of quiescence need to be correlated to activity on the host to determine which parts of the application code are leading to the bottleneck. GPU application profilers and trace viewers generally support this, e.g. by showing kernel launch dependencies, like the arrow in the trace below.</p> <p><img src="https://modal-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/tmpx_2c9bl5_c5aa7ab0.webp" alt="A trace of a PyTorch application with low GPU Kernel Utilization"> <!--[!--><!--]--><!----></p> <p><modal-img-caption>In traces of GPU applications, periods where no kernels are running appear as empty strips in the timelines of CUDA streams (e.g. Stream 7 7 in the trace above).

CPU utilization tracks the fraction of CPU cycles during which instructions were being executed on behalf of your program (as opposed to the CPU idling or running other programs).</p> <p>However, for CPU utilization, hitting 90%+ is often bad, even a trigger for alerts. But we want to and can achieve that level of GPU Kernel Utilization!</p> <p>Fundamentally, this is downstream of the greater predictability of many GPU applications. Running a transactional database replica at 90% CPU utilization baseline risks degraded quality-of-service if query patterns or quantity change. Typical GPU applications have much less variability — for a database analogue, imagine repeatedly running only one basic sequential scan aggregation query, but with slightly different parameters each time — and so have more controllable quality-of-service.</p> <h2 id="what-is-model-flops-utilization-mfu">What is Model FLOP/s Utilization (MFU)?</h2> <h3 id="model-flops-utilization--model-flops-throughput-achieved--flops-bandwidth-paid-for">Model FLOP/s Utilization = Model FLOP/s throughput achieved ÷ FLOP/s bandwidth paid for</h3> <p>At some galaxy-brained, CEO-math level, expenditures on GPUs are really expenditures on floating point operation bandwidth, and so the deepest and most fundamental utilization metric to measure is the ratio of that bandwidth to the throughput achieved.</p> <p>This metric is known as <em>MFU</em>, which either means “Maximum” or “Model” FLOP/s Utilization, depending on who you ask. We go with “Model”, since it’s more common.</p> <p>Instances that aren’t running application code or that aren’t running GPU kernels cannot achieve a high MFU, so low GPU Allocation Utilization or low GPU Kernel Utilization imply low Model FLOP/s Utilization.</p> <p>However, high utilization at these more abstract levels does not imply high MFU.</p> <p>First, as an implementation detail, communication between GPUs is frequently implemented via GPU kernels. This communication, like most communication in distributed systems, is subject to faults (hardware fault, programmer fault, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/08/shark-attacks-threaten-google-s-undersea-internet-cables-video.html"><!----><!---->shark attack fault<!----></a><!---->), which frequently manifest as deadlock. From the perspective of GPU Kernel Utilization, a system that is deadlocked in the middle of running a communication kernel is fully utilized (!), but it is completing no useful work. We like to catch this particular issue by monitoring <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu-metrics"><!----><!---->GPU power draw and heat<!----></a><!---->. More generally, optimizing communication is critical for achieving high MFU, especially for workloads that spread a single task across multiple nodes.</p> <p>Second, floating point computation is just one of the things a GPU must do to complete a task. The most important other task is moving data. Computation can only occur on data stored inside of the <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file"><!----><!---->register file<!----></a><!----> of the GPU’s <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor"><!----><!---->streaming multiprocessors<!----></a><!---->, which each store less than a megabyte, while foundation models are measured in gigabytes. The data to which a computation applies must generally be moved from a slower, larger area of the <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy"><!----><!---->memory hierarchy<!----></a><!---->. The <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/gpu-ram"><!----><!---->bandwidth of this memory<!----></a><!----> is generally many times lower than the device’s FLOP/s bandwidth, especially in recent generations. The ratio of an algorithm’s FLOP/s throughput to its byte/s throughput is called the arithmetic intensity.</p> <p>Bottlenecking on memory is a particular challenge in latency-sensitive foundation model inference workloads, where the arithmetic intensity is low (perhaps a few FLOPs per byte). Besides algorithmic rewrites to increase arithmetic intensity, like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135"><!----><!---->the online softmax in Flash Attention<!----></a><!---->, the primary generic strategy is <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/dynamic-batching"><!----><!---->batching<!----></a><!----> more work together, which increases FLOPs executed more than memory bytes moved for most neural network inference workloads, but generally adds per-task latency.</p> <p>Finally, GPU kernels must be carefully written to achieve high MFU. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM"><!----><!---->This public worklog by Si Boehm<!----></a><!----> gives a flavor for the effort required to reach state-of-the-art for a single kernel. Even that worklog stops short of truly maximizing MFU, since it tackles a problem that can’t make use of the fastest elements of contemporary GPUs, the <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-core"><!----><!---->Tensor Cores<!----></a><!---->, and writing kernels that can saturate Tensor Cores is even more challenging — see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cudaforfun.substack.com/p/outperforming-cublas-on-h100-a-worklog"><!----><!---->this worklog from Pranjal Shankhdhar<!----></a><!---->. For this reason, most teams use high-quality open source kernels through libraries like CuBLAS or frameworks like PyTorch and vLLM.</p> <p>The achieved FLOP/s and memory throughput of a GPU application can be monitored using the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/user-guide/feature-overview.html#profiling-metrics"><!----><!---->NVIDIA Data Center GPU Management tool<!----></a><!---->, <code>dcgm</code>. The metrics prefixed with <code>DCGM_FI_PROF</code> are generally relevant. In particular, the <code>DCGM_FI_PROF_DRAM_ACTIVE</code> metric measures the utilization of the DRAM-to-SRAM memory bandwidth. The <code>DCGM_FI_PROF_PIPE_TENSOR_ACTIVE</code> metric measures the utilization of the Tensor Cores that provide the maximum FLOP/s bandwidth. This isn’t identical to MFU for subtle reasons covered well in Stas Bekman’s guide <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering/blob/master/training/performance/README.md#mfu-vs-hfu"><!----><!---->here<!----></a><!---->.</p> <h2 id="what-level-of-model-flops-utilization-can-i-hope-to-achieve">What level of Model FLOP/s Utilization can I hope to achieve?</h2> <p>First, let’s note that measuring Model FLOP/s Utilization is tricky. The theoretical bandwidth can be read from manufacturer datasheets — but watch for asterisks like “with sparsity”. The achieved model throughput, on the other hand, can be hard to measure, in particular since some FLOPs might be spent on other computations, like activation recomputation in training. For that reason, it is often done based on pen-and-paper analysis of the algorithm and with approximate, “napkin” math.</p> <p>The state-of-the-art for MFU in training is achieved by the foundation model teams at leading organizations like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Of these, Meta is the most open and reports an MFU of 38 - 41% when training <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783"><!----><!---->the LLaMA 3 405B model<!----></a><!---->. The more recent DeepSeek-v3 training run by DeepSeek achieved around 20-30% MFU (there’s no official number) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/31/deepseek-debates/"><!----><!---->using GPUs with tighter communication bottlenecks<!----></a><!---->.</p> <p>Much of the shortfall is due to the need for inter-node communication in large training jobs, which creates bandwidth constraints that aren’t present in inference applications. For inference workloads, MFU might reach higher, closer to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering/tree/master/compute/accelerator#maximum-achievable-flops"><!----><!---->70% - 80% MFU achieved by raw matrix multiplications<!----></a><!---->, but we aren’t aware of any published results from large-scale deployments. Let us know if we missed them!</p> <p>For context, it’s also helpful to consider the equivalent of MFU for a job running on a CPU. For concreteness, consider the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc"><!----><!---->One Billion Row Challenge<!----></a><!---->, which led teams around the world to competitively optimize a large-scale aggregation problem on CPUs. This problem requires three floating point operations per row on one billion rows, and so has a total FLOP count of 3 billion. The leading results finished in about one second, and so achieved a FLOP/s throughput of about 3 billion. If we assume that the hardware used for the challenge, eight cores out of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax161"><!----><!---->32 core AMD EPYC 7502P<!----></a><!----> machine which can run at 3.35 GHz, is capable of issuing one FLOP per cycle, then the FLOP/s bandwidth is ~26 billion, for an MFU of ~10%. However, that CPU has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions"><!----><!---->AVX2 SIMD vector instructions<!----></a><!----> with a lane width of 256 and so, assuming it can issue 16 FLOPs/cycle per core, the FLOP/s bandwidth is actually ~420 billion, leading to an MFU of under 1%.</p> <h2 id="how-can-i-improve-my-gpu-utilization">How can I improve my GPU utilization?</h2> <p>If you’re not using <a href="https://modal.com/"><!----><!---->Modal<!----></a><!---->, that’s a great place to start!
