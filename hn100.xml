<p><b>Literate programming: Knuth is doing it wrong</b></p><p>
Literate programming advocates this: <em>Order your code for others to read,
not for the compiler. Beautifully typeset your code so one can curl up in bed
to read it like a novel. Keep documentation in sync with code.</em> What's not
to like about this vision? I have two beefs with it: the ends are insufficiently
ambitious by focusing on a passive representation; and the means were insufficiently
polished, by over-emphasizing typesetting at the cost of prose quality.
Elaboration, in reverse order:

<!-- more -->
<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing typesetting over organization</em></center>

<p>
When I look around at the legacy of literate programming, systems to do
so-called semi- or quasi-literate programming dominate. These are systems that
focus on generating beautifully typeset documentation without allowing the
author to arbitrarily order code. I think this is exactly backwards; codebases
are easy to read primarily due to the author's efforts to orchestrate the
presentation, and only secondarily by typesetting improvements. As a concrete
example, just about every literate program out there begins with cruft like
this:<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

</p><pre><span>// Some #includes</span>
</pre>

<p>
or:

</p><pre><span>-- Don't mind these imports.</span>
</pre>

<p>
I used to think people just didn't understand Knuth's vision. But then I went
and looked at his literate programs. Boom, #includes:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/advent.w.gz">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/adventure.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
The example Pascal program in <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Knuth's
original paper</a> didn't have any imports at all. But when it comes to
organizing larger codebases, we've been putting imports thoughtlessly at the
top. Right from day one.

</p><p>
Exhibit 2:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sat12.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sat12.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
<em>“Skip ahead if you are impatient to see the interesting stuff.”</em>
Well gee, if only we had, you know, a tool to put the interesting stuff up
front.

</p><p>
Exhibit 3:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
This is the start of the piece. There's a sentence of introduction, and then
this:

</p><div>
<p><span>“</span>We use a utility field to record
the vertex degrees.

</p><p>
#define deg u.I
</p>
</div>

<p>
That's a steep jump across several levels of abstraction. Literally the first
line of code shown is a macro to access a field for presumably a struct whose
definition — whose <em>very type name</em> — we haven't even seen
yet. (The variable name for the struct is also hard-coded in; but I'll stop
nit-picking further.)

</p><p>
Exhibit 4: Zoom out just a little bit on the previous example:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham2.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
Again, there's #includes at the top but I won't belabor that. Let's look at
what's in these #includes. "GraphBase data structures" seems kinda relevant to
the program. Surely the description should inline and describe the core data
structures the program will be using. In the immortal words of <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred
Brooks</a>:

</p><p><span>“</span>Show me your flowcharts [code]
and conceal your tables [data types], and I shall continue to be
mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts;
they’ll be obvious."
</p>

<p>
Surely a system to optimize order for exposition shouldn't be stymied by
<em>code in a different file</em>.

</p><p>
On the whole, people have failed to appreciate the promise of literate
programming because the early examples are just not that good, barring the
small program in Knuth's original paper. The programs jump across abstraction
layers. Problems are ill-motivated. There's a pervasive mindset of top-down
thinking, of starting from <span>main</span>, whether or not that's easiest to read. The
ability to change order is under-used, perhaps because early literate tools
made debugging harder, but mostly I think because of all the emphasis —
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">right from the
start</a> — on just how <em>darn cool</em> the typesetting was.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

</p><p>
All this may seem harsh on Knuth, but I figure Knuth can take it. He's, well,
Knuth, and I'm nobody. He came up with literate programming as the successor
to structured programming, meaning that he was introducing ordering considerations
at a time when most people were still using <em>gotos</em> as a matter of
course. There was no typesetting for programmers or academics, no internet, no
hyperlinking. No, these early examples are fine for what they are. They
haven't developed because <em>we programmers</em> have failed to develop them
over time. We've been too quick to treat them as sacred cows to be merely
interpreted (not noticing the violence our interpretations do to the original
idea anyway). I speculate that nobody has actually read anybody else's
literate programs in any sort of detail. And so nobody has been truly inspired
to do better. We've been using literate programming, like the vast majority of
us use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">TAOCP</a>,
as a signalling device to show that we are hip to what's cool. (If you have
spent time reading somebody else's literate programs, I want to hear about
your experiences!)

<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing passive reading over interactive feedback</em></center>

<p>
I've been indirectly maligning typesetting, but it's time to aim squarely at
it. There's a fundamental problem with generating a beautifully typeset
document for a codebase: it's dead. It can't render inside just about any
actual programming environment (editor or IDE) on this planet, and so we can't
make changes to it while we work on the codebase. Everybody reads a pdf about
a program at most once, when they first encounter it. After that, re-rendering
it is a pain, and proof-reading the rendered document, well forget about it.
That dooms generated documentation to be an after-thought, forever at risk of
falling stale, or at least rendering poorly.

</p><p>
You can't work with it, you can't try to make changes to it to see what
happens, and you certainly can't run it interactively. All you can do,
literally, is curl up with it in bed. And promptly fall asleep. I mean, who
reads code in bed without a keyboard?!

</p><p>
What's the alternative? In the spirit of presenting a target of my own for
others to attack, I'll point you at some literate code I wrote <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">last
year</a> for a simple interpreter. A sample of what it looks like:

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>// Programs are run in two stages:</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  a) _read_ the text of the program into a tree of cells</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  b) _evaluate_ the tree of cells to yield a result</span>
&nbsp;cell* run(istream&amp; in) {
&nbsp;  cell* result = nil;
&nbsp;  do {
&nbsp;      <span>// TEMP and 'update' help recycle cells after we're done with</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// them.</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// Gotta pay attention to this all the time; see the 'memory'</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// layer.</span>
&nbsp;      TEMP(form, read(in));
&nbsp;      update(result, eval(form));
&nbsp;  } while (!eof(in));
&nbsp;  return result;
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;cell* run(string s) {
&nbsp;  stringstream in(s);
&nbsp;  return run(in);
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span>:(scenarios run)</span>
&nbsp;<span>:(scenario examples)</span>
&nbsp;<span># function call; later we'll support a more natural syntax for</span>
&nbsp;<span># arithmetic</span>
&nbsp;(+ 1 1)
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 2
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># assignment</span>
&nbsp;(&lt;- x 3)
&nbsp;x
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 3
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># list; deliberately looks just like a function call</span>
&nbsp;'(1 2 3)
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> (1 2 3)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># the function (fn) doesn't have to be named</span>
&nbsp;((fn (a b)  <span># parameters (params)</span>
&nbsp;    (+ a b))  <span># body</span>
&nbsp;   3 4)  <span># arguments (args) that are bound to params inside this call</span>
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 7
</pre>

<p>
A <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">previous post</a> describes
the format, but we won't need more details for this example. Just note that it
is simple plaintext that will open up in your text editor. There is minimal
prose, because just the order of presentation does so much heavy lifting.
Comments are like code: the less you write, the less there is to go bad. I'm
paying the cost of ‘<span>//</span>’
to delineate comments because I haven't gotten around to fixing it, because
it's just not that important to clean it up. You can't see it in this sample,
but the program at large organizes features in self-contained layers, with
later features hooking into the code for earlier ones. Here's <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/test.html">a
test harness</a>. (With, I can't resist pointing out, the includes at the
bottom.) Here's a <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/memory.html">garbage
collector</a>. <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/literate/030scope">Here</a>
I replace a flat namespace of bindings with dynamic scope. In each case, code
is freely intermingled with tests to exercise it (like the <span>scenarios</span>
above), tests that can be run from the commandline.

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 029  <span># exercises the core interpreter</span>
&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 030  <span># exercises dynamic scope</span>
&nbsp;...
</pre>

<p>
Having built the program with just a subset of layers, you're free to poke at
it and run what-if experiments. <em>Why did Kartik write this line like
so?</em> Make a change, run the tests. <em>Oh, that's why.</em> You can add
logging to trace through execution, and you can use a debugger, because you're
sitting at your workstation like a reasonable programmer, not curled up in
bed.

</p><p>
Eventually I'd like to live in a world where our systems for viewing live,
modifiable, interactive code are as adept at typesetting as our publishing
systems are. But until that day, I'll choose simple markdown-like plain-text
documentation that the author labored over the structure of. Every single
time.

<br>
</p><center><em>footnotes</em></center>

<p>
<a name="f1">1.</a> Literate Haskell and CoffeeScript to a lesser extent allow
very flexible ordering in the language, which mitigates this problem. But then
we have their authors <a href="http://jashkenas.github.io/docco">telling
us</a> that their tools can be used with any language, blithely ignoring the
fact that other languages may need better tools. Everybody's selling mechanisms,
nobody's inculcating the right <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy">policies</a>.

</p><p>
<a name="f2">2.</a> We've all had the little endorphin rush of seeing our
crappy little papers or assignments magically improved by sprinkling a little
typesetting. And we tend to take well-typeset documents <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/dont_make_the_d.html">more
seriously</a>. The flip side to this phenomenon: if it looks done <a href="http://blog.42floors.com/thirty-percent-feedback">you
won't get as much feedback on it</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Broadcom has lost another large customer for its VMware platform: Austrian cloud provider Anexia has moved 12,000 VMs, some of them rented by major European businesses, to an open-source system based on the KVM hypervisor.</p>
<p>Anexia was founded in 2006, is based in Austria, and provides cloud services from over 100 locations around the world by placing equipment in third party datacenters. Clients include remote access and control vendor TeamViewer, and airline Lufthansa – plus plenty more outfits that need reliable hosting and service to match.</p>
<p>CEO Alexander Windbichler told <i>The Register</i> that after Broadcom acquired VMware, increased licensing costs, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/broadcom_ends_vmware_partner_program/">made big changes to its partner program</a>, Anexia remained eligible to operate a VMware-powered cloud.</p>

    

<p>But Windbichler felt he couldn’t afford to continue, because Broadcom offered new terms that saw the cost of VMware licenses rise sharply. The CEO preferred not to enumerate the increase precisely however <i>The Register</i> understands it exceeded 500 percent.</p>

        


        

<p>Whatever the actual figure, Windbichler said the cost increase “Would have been existential for us.”</p>
<p>“We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.” That arrangement, the CEO said, would have created extreme stress on company cashflow.</p>

        

<p>“We would not be able to compete with the market,” he said. “We had customers on contracts, and they would not pay for a price increase.”</p>
<p>Windbichler considered legal action, but felt the fight would have been slow and expensive.</p>
<p>Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform. Another factor in the company’s favour was that it disguised the fact it ran VMware with an abstraction layer it called “Anexia Engine” that meant customers never saw Virtzilla’s wares and instead worked in a different interface to manage their VM fleets. The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes. A further fortuitous circumstance was that KVM can boot virtual machines created with VMware’s VMDK format.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">Broadcom loses another big VMware customer: UK fintech cloud Beeks Group, and most of its 20,000 VMs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">Ingram Micro to 'stop doing business' with Broadcom, downgrade to 'limited engagement' on VMware</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/broadcom_q4_fy_2024_vmware/">Broadcom says VMware is a better money-making machine than it hoped</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/broadcom_vmware_vcdx_snafu/">No, Broadcom did not just end VMware's flagship VCDX certification program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Windbichler and his team felt that Netcup’s platform could be upgraded to meet the needs of Anexia’s clients, some of whom use it to host mission-critical realtime workloads that demand low latency, and that Anexia engine could be adapted to work with a KVM back end.</p>
<p>But the terms of Anexia’s licenses meant it had a handful of months to get the job done before price rises and a two-year subscription kicked in – and less time to convince customers who signed up for VMware-powered services that the new platform would do the job.</p>
<h3>‘Fighting for a cause’</h3>
<p>Windbichler felt customers would oppose the move, so created a presentation in which he pitched the move as more than a cost-saving migration.</p>
<p>“We said we are fighting for a cause,” he said. “I did not expect that customers would care about that, but they were happy to do it.”</p>

        

<p>Among the factors that he feels got customers over the line were media articles about Broadcom’s actions, including some from <i>The Register</i>.</p>
<p>Through early 2024, Anexia’s developer team worked to improve the Netcup platform and create a simple migration tool. The result was an agent that runs on a guest VM and presents info in Anexia engine that helps customers understand if a VM is ready to move from VMware to KVM.</p>
<p>If a customer agrees to migrate, it takes one click and a brief pause for a VM reboot – an act which maps a VM to storage and converted it to the appropriate virtual disk format– and workloads resume as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Windbichler said the migration tool was delivered in time for all Anexia customers, and their 12,000 VMs, to migrate by May 2024.</p>
<p>The process wasn’t easy, as the migration process meant that for a brief time two instances of a VM would exist, requiring more hardware capacity than the company might possess in some of its locations. Careful resource management planning was needed, as some customers could not easily find a change window and it was hard to ensure servers and storage would be ready for the move. Anexia pulled it off without having to alter its physical fleet, which given its widespread operations would have added enormous complexity to the project.</p>
<h3>Broadcom ‘lost all the trust’</h3>
<p>The CEO rates the project the most complex thing Anexia has done, and in conversation with <i>The Register</i> was full of praise for his team who he said did amazing work and now feel they were part of a once-in-a-lifetime effort.</p>
<p>That team is now growing, as without VMware bills – and all customers still aboard – Anexia’s balance sheet is in good shape.</p>
<p>“We have free budget to work on the open source solution and make us sovereign for us and our customers,” Windbichler said.</p>
<p>The CEO thinks more companies will move from VMware.</p>
<p>“I do not believe Broadcom will be successful,” he told <i>The Register</i>. “They lost all the trust. I have talked to so many VMware customers and they say they cannot work with a company like that.”</p>
<p>Regulators are also interested in Broadcom’s practices, he said. As Anexia tried to understand the impact of the VMware acquisition, it engaged with industry group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), which was able to arrange meetings with EU officials. Windbichler believes those engagements led to some of Broadcom’s concessions to its channel. The CEO also found Austria’s competition authorities receptive. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The 'cab' is hinged round the bottom of the box structure, probably released by Keaton at the appropriate moment, and very likely sprung to assist the demolition.</p>

<p>The rest is just balanced on top and will fall at the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>You only see it move about 6 feet, so it doesn't have to last long. As I can see no evidence of a rope to pull it [and I don't think painting techniques would be good enough to paint it out afterwards] let's assume someone pushed it from a few yards further back then ran out of frame. It has no engine, of course.</p>

<p>If you watch it frame by frame, it's easier to see...</p>

<p>In the first 2 frames, all is well so far - except the bonnet/hood isn't quite seated properly. Also note Keaton's hand on the bodywork - that may already be loose [or may be part of the release mechanism]. The wheel at camera right isn't quite straight either...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/6p3N5.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/6p3N5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>By frame 3, that wheel is already falling off, before it even hits the bump...<br>
Incidentally, the bonnet/hood has dropped back into its correct position momentarily.<br>
After further analysis, the release has been triggered by frame 3. There is a disconnect at the rear, camera left, and I'm now certain the front wheel, camera right, has a sprung steering mechanism to push it the right way.  </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/eTw65.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/eTw65.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>by frame 4, the catch has been released and the bodywork is hinging outwards...
The seat is also being hinged backwards and downwards, but we can't see that yet.
[Further evidence of the steering being sprung is that the initial impact with the dirt ridge  momentarily pushes it back straight. The rear wheel is also off by this point and the axle has dropped, assisting the slew - better detail at the end]</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/VlVI6.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/VlVI6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Keaton lifts the steering wheel away and the front panel falls forwards - assisting the demolition of the engine bay and grille. One thing to keep track of over the next few frames is that the steering column stays in position relative to the car's chassis, which could be quite a hazard.<br>
[My 'sprung steering theory' is that the spring force has now overcome the bump and is back on track. It's hard to tell from this point if it is only the steering, or if the axle itself bends forwards. [From what little I know of cars from this era, that axle ought to be a solid bar, with steering at the ends.]<br>
Further evidence now shows the entire axle turns, see detail at the end of the post.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/i27oC.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/i27oC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Now we can see the seat tilting, preventing Keaton from sliding forwards into the loose debris and containing him within the relative safety of the hinged box. Throwing his legs upwards as the seat drops is a) comedic and b) safer.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ldc2m.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ldc2m.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>  </p>

<p>Now we get to see the steering column that didn't fall away ...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/M7SbO.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/M7SbO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Note he seems well aware that the steering column didn't fall away - construction error or design, we may never know. You can see him avoid it over the next few frames, even as the car takes a final lurch.<br>
You can also see the clear benefit in these final frames of the seat falling back to 45°, preventing him from sliding forwards.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/GLdFd.jpg" width="320"> <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/tKKOo.jpg" width="320"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/YFERy.jpg" width="320"> </p>

<p>And that's it. He's already stepping out of the car by frame 11.<br>
Note his exit route is a) planned and b) padded - the original car door.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/l9Swu.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/l9Swu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>That is probably a clue as to why the camera right wheel went first, to slew the car in a specific direction.</p>

<p>Ten minutes and both he and the car could be ready for another take.</p>

<p>Re: the slewing - I've been trying to decide if this frame shows the front axle bending to ensure it goes in that direction. I can't decide.<br>
Perhaps the release mechanism also disconnected the steering on that side, or sprung it across, to push it in the correct direction.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ejcNh.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ejcNh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ebM33.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ebM33.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Last bit of evidence - from another source - the rear camera-left wheel drops first, assisting the slew, even as the front wheel is turning, before it hits the dirt at all...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/YNeql.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/YNeql.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/84Pjh.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/84Pjh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The front axle in its entirety turns too [on this better footage, there's no sign it bends, but it does turn as a whole piece.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/o66Vu.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/o66Vu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>One final note...</strong></p>

<p>The wheels never come off. They're tethered, like a modern Formula 1 car.<br>
They fall over but never fully detach from the axle ends.<br>
If they weren't, pure chance would say one of them wouldn't land right next to its own axle - especially the rear which we see come loose long before the rest.  </p>

<p>It would appear that the only totally free-to-fly items are the radiator grille and the two headlamps. Everything else, including the last-to-fall front wing/fender, is held firmly in place, at least by one end.</p>

						<p>When I was analysing the structures of CYOA works a few years back, I began to recognise some strong recurring design patterns. I came up with some home-brewed terminology, but didn’t ever lay it out in a nice clear way. This is a non-exhaustive look at some of the more common approaches, somewhat-updated (a lot has changed since then).</p>
<p>I should stress that these aren’t discrete categories: while a lot of works will fall very straightforwardly into a single pattern, many will involve elements of multiple patterns. (And yes, I’m aware that you can often simulate one using the mechanics of another. That’s mostly beside the point.) Also, the example diagrams I’m using are smaller and simpler than would be&nbsp;likely in actual works.</p>
<p><strong>Time Cave.&nbsp;</strong>A heavily-branching sequence. All choices are of roughly equal significance; there is little or no re-merging, and therefore no need for state-tracking. There are many, many endings.</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The time cave is the oldest and most obvious CYOA structure. It is often good for narratives about freedom and open possibility, adventures that could go&nbsp;<em>anywhere,</em>&nbsp;flights of fancy.&nbsp;Time caves tend to have relatively short playthroughs, but strongly&nbsp;encourage replay: they are broad rather than long. Even with multiple playthroughs, most players will probably miss a good deal of the content.</p>
<p>The time cave’s&nbsp;structure is both organised by chronological progression and detached from it.&nbsp;It’s ungrounded by regularity: possibility is&nbsp;<em>so</em> open that it often becomes fantastic or surreal, with different branches occupying wholly different realities. The player has velocity but little grasp, vast freedom but little&nbsp;ability to comprehend it.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>Edward Packard’s earlier work (<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/cyoa-structures-the-cave-of-time/">The Cave of Time</a><em>, </em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/cyoa-structures-more-packard/">Sugarcane Island</a>), Emily Short’s <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/cyoa-structure-if/">A dark and stormy entry</a>; <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/cyoa-structure-millennial-snark/">Pretty Little Mistakes</a><i>.</i></p>

<p><strong>Gauntlet.&nbsp;</strong>Long rather than broad, gauntlets have a relatively linear central thread, pruned by branches which end in death, backtracking, or quick rejoining. The Gauntlet generally tells one anointed story, which can be adorned with optional content or prematurely ended with failure; if there are multiple endings, they’re likely to derive from a Final Choice. Gauntlets rarely rely on state to any great extent (if they do, they are likely to evolve into a branch-and-bottleneck structure.)</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The player is likely to realise that they are on a constrained path, but the presentation of side-branches matters a great deal – do they mean death? incorrect answers? travel back in time? blocked paths, footnotes, &nbsp;or&nbsp;scenic details? Most often,<em>&nbsp;</em>the gauntlet creates an atmosphere of a hazardous, difficult or constrained world. Sometimes this can be punishing or depressing; sometimes it can be darkly comic; sometimes it’s a sign that you’re in a work heavily dependent on reflective or rhetorical choice. Perhaps the easiest structure to author, gauntlets can be conceived of in similar terms to&nbsp;linear stories, and ensure that most players will see most of the important content.</p>
<p>There are two major varieties of gauntlet: deadly and friendly. Deadly gauntlets mostly prune the tree with&nbsp;<em>failure</em>; friendly ones mostly do so with short-range rejoining, and look a bit more like simple <em>branch-and-bottleneck</em> structures. Friendly gauntlets have been vastly more common in recent years, making up a high&nbsp;proportion of Twine works.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/cyoa-structure-spin-offs/">Zork: The Forces of Krill</a><em>. </em><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qgyhzznz7r5p64eq">Our Boys In Uniform</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Branch and Bottleneck.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The game branches, but the branches regularly rejoin, usually around events that are common to all versions of the story. To avoid obliterating the effect of past choices, branch-and-bottleneck structures almost always rely on heavy use of state-tracking (if a game doesn’t do this, chances are you are dealing with a gauntlet).</p>
<p>Somewhat rarely, the bottlenecks may be invisible – the plot branches and never reaches an explicit rejoining node, but the choices at the end of each branch are the same or similar, creating an exquisite-corpse effect.</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>Branch-and-bottleneck games tend to be heavily&nbsp;governed by the passage of time, while still allowing the player fairly strong grasp.<em>&nbsp;</em>The branch-and-bottleneck structure is most often used to reflect the growth of the player-character: it allows the player to construct a somewhat-distinctive story and/or personality, while still allowing for a manageable plot. There’s a tendency – not a necessary one, by any means – for playthroughs to be very similar in the early game, then diverge as the effects of earlier choices accumulate. In order for the approach to work, it has to be used in a fairly large piece; you need time to accumulate change before producing results that reflect it.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>This is pretty much how&nbsp;<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/long-live-the-queen/">Long Live the Queen</a> works, and is the guiding principle of <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/choiceofgames.com">Choice of Games</a> (Dan Fabulich uses the&nbsp;term <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/2011/07/by-the-numbers-how-to-write-a-long-interactive-novel-that-doesnt-suck/"><em>delayed branching</em></a>). It’s also a common plot structure in non-IF games that allow significant plot choices.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Quest.&nbsp;</strong>The quest structure forms distinct branches, though they tend to rejoin to reach a relatively small number of winning endings (often only one). The elements of these branches have&nbsp;a modular structure: small, tightly-grouped clusters of nodes allowing&nbsp;many ways to approach a single situation, with lots of interconnection within each cluster and relatively little outside it. Re-merging is fairly common; backtracking rather less so. Quests generally involve some level of state-tracking, and do poorly when they don’t. The minimal size for a quest is relatively large, and this category includes some of the largest CYOAs.</p>

<p><span><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This mode is well-suited for journeys of exploration, focused on setting; the quest’s structure tends to be organised by geography rather than time. Indeed, most works of this kind involve a journey with a specific purpose in mind. Quests work well for grounded, consistent worlds, but within that context the player-character’s situation is constantly changing. The&nbsp;narrative&nbsp;tends to be fragmentary or episodic, like old-school D&amp;D encounters: little chunks of story which might not have any great significance for the big picture.</span></p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>The <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> books and their descendants (<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/cyoa-structures-cyo-rpg/">Lone Wolf</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/80-days-the-map-is-the-territory/">80 Days</a><em>).</em></p>
<p><span><b>Open Map.</b>&nbsp;Even though quests are structured by geography, time still plays an important part: there’s a built-in direction of travel. But take a&nbsp;CYOA structure, make travel between the major nodes reversible, and you&nbsp;have a static geography, a world in which the player can toodle about indefinitely. Often&nbsp;this is a&nbsp;<em>literal</em> geography and relies on extensive state-tracking both explicit and secret for narrative progress. But it’s not an uncommon mode for things with assumptions grounded in the hypertext-novel idiom – static but non-linear works like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.francoiscoulon.com/le_reprobateur.html">Le Reprobateur</a><em>.</em></span></p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This is often used as an imitation of the default style of parser IF, although some may be parallel derivation from the former’s D&amp;D roots. As with classic map-based parser games, the narrative tends to become slower-paced and less directed; the player has more leisure to explore and grasp the world, but spends less of their time advancing the story.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;Duelmaster</em>;&nbsp;<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qfvfc6576i90py4w">Chemistry and Physics</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sorting Hat.&nbsp;</strong>The early game branches heavily and rejoins heavily (branch-and-bottleneck is a likely model here), ultimately determining which major branch the player gets assigned to. These major branches are typically quite linear&nbsp;– sometimes they look like gauntlets, but they might be choiceless&nbsp;straight-shots.&nbsp;Sorting Hats almost always rely substantially&nbsp;on state-tracking in the early game, and often bottleneck at the decision point.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The Sorting Hat&nbsp;is a compromise between the breadth of more open formats and the depth of linear ones. Sometimes&nbsp;the nature of the various branches is signaled to the player; this is kind of important, in fact, because the player is pretty likely to notice the linearity of the second half and might assume that&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>of their choices will ultimately get funneled&nbsp;into that particular thread. The player gets a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of influence over how the story goes; however, the author may end up effectively having to write several different games.</p>
<p><em>Examples: </em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/cyoa-structure-graphic-novels/">Katawa Shoujo</a><em>; </em><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=es0sfij74uu4barv">Magical Makeover</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Floating&nbsp;Modules.</strong>&nbsp;A mode only really possible in computer-based works. There is no tree – or, while there may be scattered twigs and branches, there’s no trunk. No central plot, no through-line: modular encounters become available to the player based largely on state, or perhaps randomly.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This is a challenging&nbsp;style to write for, both because it’s difficult to intuitively grasp – writers tend to rebound quickly to a more unified structure – and because few assumptions can ever be made about prior events.&nbsp;Without a large amount of content, the method tends to collapse into a linear system. Because play mechanics are largely about altering stats in order to negotiate a world, there’s a strong incentive to expose those stats to the player; repeated events chosen only to affect a stat (grinding) may be a feature.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to&nbsp;floating-module: <a href="https://emshort.wordpress.com/2016/04/12/beyond-branching-quality-based-and-salience-based-narrative-structures/">Emily Short has a tentative categorisation here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>Pure examples of modular design are relatively rare. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040404061317/www.channelzilch.com/doug/battle.htm">King of Chicago</a>&nbsp;(hat-tip Sean Barrett)&nbsp;is an early example.&nbsp;<a href="http://storynexus.com/s">StoryNexus</a> and its conceptual relatives (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://varytale.com/books/book/short-bee/info/">Bee</a>) inhabit&nbsp;this space, though they&nbsp;generally impose some more linear-progression structure on it. (Alexis Kennedy uses the term <a href="http://www.failbettergames.com/storynexus-developer-diary-2-fewer-spreadsheets-less-swearing/">quality-based narrative</a> to describe the general approach: ‘pieces of story like mosaic tiles, not pipes or complex machinery.’)</p>

This is a very general pattern, and can co-exist with many others.&nbsp;<em>Trapped in Time</em>, for instance, is basically a cycle-and-growing Gauntlet;&nbsp;<em>Bee</em>&nbsp;tames its floating-module&nbsp;nature with a year-long loop structure.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>Loop&nbsp;and Grow emphasizes the regularity of the world while retaining narrative momentum. A justification is needed for why whole sections of narrative can repeat: the player-character is often following routine activities in a familiar space, engaged in time-travel, or performing tasks at a certain level of abstraction. This regularity often comes at the price of openness: many stories with a strong Loop&nbsp;and Grow structure involve a struggle against confinement or stagnation.</p>
<p>An important variation&nbsp;of&nbsp;loop-and-grow structures is&nbsp;<strong>spoke and hub:&nbsp;</strong>the game has several major branches, but they all originate at and return to a central node or set of nodes. The player may go out along each spoke once, or many times.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;Bee</em>, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=juj5b61griyoswn2">Trapped in Time</a>, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=b6ljg2m07tmc2ffv">Solarium</a>.</p>

There’s a lot of great detail in Humpries’s write-up, and I recommend you read it directly in addition to this post.</p>



<h2>What happened at Canva</h2>



<h3>Trigger: deploying a new version of a page</h3>



<p>The trigger for this incident was Canva deploying a new version of their editor page. It’s notable <strong><em>that there was nothing wrong with this new version.</em></strong> The incident wasn’t triggered by a bug in the code in the new version, or even by some unexpected emergent behavior in the code of this version. No, while the incident was triggered by a deploy, the changes from the previous version are immaterial to this outage. Rather, <em><strong>it was the system behavior that emerged from clients downloading the new version that led to the outage</strong></em>. Specifically, it was clients downloading the new javascript files from the CDN that set the ball in motion.</p>



<h3>A stale traffic rule</h3>



<p>Canva uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> as their CDN. Being a CDN, Cloudflare has datacenters <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/">all over the world</a>., which are interconnected by a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-backbone-internet-fast-lane">private backbone</a>. Now, I’m not a networking person, but my basic understanding of private backbones is that CDNs lease fibre-optic lines from telecom companies and use these leased lines to ensure that they have dedicated network connectivity and bandwidth between their sites.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Canva, there was a previously unknown issue on Cloudflare’s side: Cloudflare Wasn’t using their dedicated fibre-optic lines to route traffic between their Northern Virginia and Singapore datacenters. That traffic was instead, unintentionally, going over the public internet.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>[A] stale rule in Cloudflare’s traffic management system [that] was sending user IPv6 traffic over public transit between Ashburn and Singapore instead of its default route over the private backbone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The routes that this traffic took suffered from considerable packet loss. For Canva users in Asia, this meant that they experienced massive increases in latency when their web browsers attempted to fetch the javascript static assets from the CDN.</p>



<p>A stale rule like this is the kind of issue that the safety researcher James Reason calls a <em>latent pathogen</em>. It’s a problem that remains unnoticed until it emerges as a contributor to an incident.</p>



<h3>High latency synchronizes the callers</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>Normally, an increase in errors would cause our canary system to abort a deployment. However, in this case, no errors were recorded because requests didn’t complete. As a result, over 270,000+ user requests for the JavaScript file waited on the same cache stream. This created a backlog of requests from users in Southeast Asia.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first client attempts to fetch the new Javascript files from the CDN, but the files aren’t there yet, the CDN must fetch the files from the origin. Because of the added latency, this takes a long time.</p>



<p>During this time, other clients connect, and attempt to fetch the javascript from the CDN. But the CDN has not yet been populated with the files from the origin, that transfer is still in progress.</p>



<p>As Cloudflare notes in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-concurrent-streaming-acceleration/">this blog post</a>, when all subsequent clients request access to a file that is in the process of being populated in the cache, they must wait until the file has been cached before they can download the file. Except that Cloudflare has implemented functionality called <em>Concurrent Streaming Acceleration</em> which permits multiple clients to simultaneously download a file that is still in the process of being downloaded from the origin server.</p>



<p>The resulting behavior is that the CDN now behaves effectively as a <em>barrier</em>, with all of the clients slowly but simultaneously downloading the assets. With a traditional barrier, the processes who are waiting can proceed once all processes have entered in the barrier. This isn’t quite the same, as the clients who are waiting can all proceed once the CDN completes downloading the asset from the origin.</p>

<h3>The transfer completes, the herd thunders</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>At 9:07 AM UTC, the asset fetch completed, and all 270,000+ pending requests were completed simultaneously. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>20 minutes after Canva deployed the new Javascript assets to the origin server, the clients completed fetching them. The next action the clients take is to call Canva’s API service. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the JavaScript file now accessible, client devices resumed loading the editor, including the previously blocked object panel. The object panel loaded simultaneously across all waiting devices, resulting in a thundering herd of 1.5 million requests per second to the API Gateway — 3x the typical peak load.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s one more issue that made this situation even worse: a known performance issue in the API gateway that was slated to be fixed.</p>



<h3>A problematic call pattern to a library reduces service throughput</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>The API Gateways use an event loop model, where code running on event loop threads must not perform any blocking operations.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two common threading models for request-response services are <em>thread-per-request</em> and <em>async</em>. For services that are I/O-bound (i.e., most of the time servicing each request is spent waiting for I/O operations to complete, typically networking operations), the async model has the potential to achieve better throughput. That’s because the concurrency of the thread-per-request model is limited by the number of operating-system threads. The async model services multiple requests per thread, and so it doesn’t suffer from the thread bottleneck. Canva’s API gateway implements the <em>async</em> model using the popular <a href="https://netty.io/">Netty</a> library.</p>



<p>One of the drawbacks of the async model is the risk associated with the active thread getting <em>blocked</em>, because this can result in a significant performance penalty. The async model multiplexes multiple requests across an individual thread, and none of those requests can make progress when that thread is blocked. Programmers writing code in a service that uses the async model need to take care to minimize the number of blocking calls.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Prior to this incident, we’d made changes to our telemetry library code, inadvertently introducing a performance regression. The change caused certain metrics to be re-registered each time a new value was recorded. This re-registration occurred under a lock within a third-party library.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Canva’s case, the API gateway logic was making calls to a third-party telemetry library. They were calling the library in such a way that it took a lock, which is a blocking call. This reduced the effective throughput that the API gateway could handle.</p>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png"><img data-attachment-id="5672" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/telemetry-lib/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png" data-orig-size="2732,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="telemetry-lib" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="767" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=1024 1024w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=2046 2046w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=150 150w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=300 300w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/telemetry-lib.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Calls to the library led to excessive thread locking </figcaption></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>Although the issue had already been identified and a fix had entered our release process the day of the incident, we’d underestimated the impact of the bug and didn’t expedite deploying the fix. This meant it wasn’t deployed before the incident occurred.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ironically, they were aware of this problematic call pattern, and they were planning on deploying a fix the day of the incident(!).</p>



<p>As an aside, it’s worth noting the role of telemetry logic behavior in the <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/14/quick-takes-on-the-recent-openai-public-incident-write-up/">recent OpenAI incident</a>, and in the locking behavior of tracing library in a <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/08/01/reproducing-a-java-21-virtual-threads-deadlock-scenario-with-tla/">complex performance issue that Netflix experienced</a>. Observability giveth reliability, and observability taketh reliability away.</p>



<p>Canva is now in a situation where the API gateway is receiving much more traffic than it was provisioned to handle, is also suffering from a performance regression that reduces its ability to handle traffic even more. </p>



<p>Now let’s look at how the system behaved under these conditions.</p>



<h2>The load balancer turns into an overload balancer</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the API Gateway tasks were failing to handle the requests in a timely manner, the load balancers started opening new connections to the already overloaded tasks, further increasing memory pressure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A load balancer sits in front of a service and distributes the incoming requests across the units of compute. Canva runs atop <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">ECS</a>, so the individual units are called <em>tasks</em>, and the group is called a <em>cluster</em> (you can think of these as being equivalent to <em>pods</em> and <em>replicasets </em>in Kubernetes-land).</p>



<p>The load balancer will only send requests to a task that is healthy. If a task is unhealthy, then it stops being considered as a candidate target destination for the load balancer. This yields good results if the overall cluster is provisioned to handle the load: the traffic gets redirected away from the unhealthy tasks and onto the healthy ones.</p>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png"><img data-attachment-id="5681" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/lb-healthy/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png" data-orig-size="2732,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lb-healthy" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="767" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=1024 1024w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=2046 2046w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=150 150w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=300 300w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-healthy.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Load balancer only sells traffic to the healthy tasks</figcaption></figure>



<p>But now consider the scenario where all of the tasks are operating close to capacity. As tasks go unhealthy, the load balancer will redistribute the load to the remaining “healthy” tasks, which increases the likelihood those tasks gets pushed into an unhealthy state. </p>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png"><img data-attachment-id="5682" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/lb-unhealthy/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png" data-orig-size="2732,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lb-unhealthy" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="767" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=1024 1024w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=2046 2046w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=150 150w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=300 300w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lb-unhealthy.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Redirecting traffic to the almost-overloaded healthy nodes will push them over</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is a classic example of a positive feedback loop: the more tasks go unhealthy, the more traffic the healthy nodes received, the more likely those tasks will go unhealthy as well.</p>



<h3>Autoscaling can’t keep pace</h3>



<p>So, now the system is saturated, and the load balancer is effectively making things worse. Instead of shedding load, it’s concentrating load on the tasks that aren’t overloaded yet.</p>



<p>Now, this is the cloud, and the cloud is <em>elastic</em>, and we have a wonderful automation system called the <em>autoscaler</em> that can help us in situations of overload by automating provisioning new capacity.</p>



<p>Only, there’s a problem here, and that’s that the autoscaler simply can’t scale up fast enough. And the reason it can’t scale up fast enough is because of another automation system that’s intended to help in times of overload: Linux’s OOM killer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The growth of off-heap memory caused the Linux Out Of Memory Killer to terminate all of the running containers in the first 2 minutes, causing a cascading failure across all API Gateway tasks. This outpaced our autoscaling capability, ultimately leading to all requests to canva.com failing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Operating systems need access to free memory in order to function properly. When all of the memory is consumed by running processes, the operating system runs into trouble. To guard against this, Linux has a feature called the <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/oom-killer/">OOM killer</a> which will automatically terminate a process when the operating system is running too low on memory. This frees up memory, enabling the OS to keep functioning. </p>



<p>So, you have the autoscaler which is adding new tasks, and the OOM killer which is quickly destroying existing tasks that have become overloaded.</p>



<p>It’s notable that Humphries uses the term <em>outpaced</em>. This sort of scenario is a common failure mode in complex system failures, where the system gets into a state where it can’t keep up. This phenomenon is called <em>decompensation</em>. Here’s resilience engineering pioneer <a href="https://www.profound-deming.com/profound-podcast/s4-e24-dr-david-woods-resilience-and-complexity-part-one">David Woods describing decompensation on John Willis’s <em>Profound</em> Podcast</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And lag is really saturation in time. That’s what we call decompensation, right? I can’t keep pace, right? Events are moving forward faster. Trouble is building and compounding faster than I, than the team, than the response system can decide on and deploy actions to affect. So I can’t keep pace. – David Woods</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Adapting the system to bring it back up</h2>



<p>At this point, the API gateway cluster is completely overwhelmed. From the timeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>9:07 AM UTC – Network issue resolved, but the backlog of queued requests result in a spike of 1.5 million requests per second to the API gateway.</p><p>9:08 AM UTC – API Gateway tasks begin failing due to memory exhaustion, leading to a full collapse.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>When your system is suffering from overload, there are basically two strategies: </p>



<ol>
<li>increase the capacity</li>



<li>reduce the load</li>
</ol>



<p>Wisely, the Canva engineers pursued both strategies in parallel.</p>



<h3>Max capacity, but it still isn’t enough</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We attempted to work around this issue by significantly increasing the desired task count manually. Unfortunately, it didn’t mitigate the issue of tasks being quickly terminated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The engineers tried to increase capacity manually, but even with the manual scaling, the load was too much: the OOM killer was taking the tasks down too quickly for the system to get back to a healthy state.</p>



<h3>Load shedding, human operator edition</h3>



<p>The engineers had to improvise a load shedding solution in the moment. The approach they took was to block traffic the CDN layer, using Cloudflare.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;At 9:29 AM UTC, we added a temporary Cloudflare firewall rule to block all traffic at the CDN. This prevented any traffic reaching the API Gateway, allowing new tasks to start up without being overwhelmed with incoming requests. We later redirected canva.com to our status page to make it clear to users that we were experiencing an incident.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth noting here that while Cloudflare contributed to this incident with the stale rule, the fact that they could dynamically configure Cloudflare firewall rules meant that Cloudflare also contributed to the mitigation of this incident.</p>



<h3>Ramping the traffic back up</h3>



<p>Here they turned off all of their traffic to give their system a chance to go back to healthy. But a healthy system under zero load behaves differently from a healthy system under typical load. If you just go back from zero to typical, there’s a risk that you push the system back into an unhealthy state. (One common problem is that autoscaling will have scaled down multiple services due when there’s no load).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once the number of healthy API Gateway tasks stabilized to a level we were comfortable with, we incrementally restored traffic to canva.com. Starting with Australian users under strict rate limits, we gradually increased the traffic flow to ensure stability before scaling further.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Canva engineers had the good judgment to ramp up the traffic incrementally rather than turn it back on all at once. They started restoring at <em>9:45 AM UTC</em>, and were back to taking full traffic at <em>10:04 AM</em>.</p>



<h2>Some general observations</h2>



<h3>All functional requirements met</h3>



<p>I always like to call out situations where, from a <em>functional</em> point of view, everything was actually working fine. In this case, even though there was a stale rule in the Cloudflare traffic management system, and there was a performance regression in the API gateway, everything was working correctly from a functional perspective: packets were still being routed between Singapore and Northern Virginia, and the API gateway was still returning the proper responses for individual requests before it got overloaded. </p>



<p>Rather, these two issues were both <em>performance</em> problems. Performance problems are much harder to spot, and the worst are the ones that you don’t notice until you’re under heavy load. </p>



<p>The irony is that, as an organization gets better at catching functional bugs before they hit production, more and more of the production incidents they face will be related to these more difficult-to-detect-early performance issues. </p>



<h3>Automated systems made the problem worse</h3>



<p>There were a number of automated systems in play whose behavior made this incident more difficult to deal with.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-concurrent-streaming-acceleration/">Concurrent Streaming Acceleration</a> functionality synchronized the requests from the clients. The OOM killer reduced the time it took for a task to be seen as unhealthy by the load balancer, and the load balancer in turn increased the rate at which tasks went unhealthy. </p>



<p>None of these systems were designed to handle this sort of situation, so they could not automatically change their behavior.</p>



<h3>The human operators changed the way the system behaved</h3>



<p>It was up to the incident responders to adapt the behavior of the system, to change the way it functioned in order to get it back to a healthy state. They were able to leverage an existing resource, Cloudflare’s firewall functionality, to accomplish this. Based on the description of the action items, I suspect they had never used Cloudflare’s firewall to do this type of load shedding before. But it worked! They successfully adapted the system behavior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re building a detailed internal runbook to make sure we can granularly reroute, block, and then progressively scale up traffic. We’ll use this runbook to quickly mitigate any similar incidents in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a classic example of <em>resilience</em>, of acting to reconfigure the behavior of your system when it enters a state that it wasn’t originally designed to handle. </p>



<p>As I’ve <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/05/31/transgressing-the-boundaries-rasmussen-and-woods/">written about previously</a>, Woods talks about the idea of a <em>competence envelope</em>. The competence envelope is sort of a conceptual space of the types of inputs that your system can handle. Incidents occur when your system is pushed to operate outside of its competence envelope, such as when it gets more load than it is provisioned to handle:</p>



<p>The competence envelope is a good way to think about the difference between <em>robustness</em> and <em>resilience</em>. You can think of robustness as describing the competence envelope itself: a more robust system may have a larger competence envelope, it is designed to handle a broader range of problems. </p>



<p>However, every system has a finite competence envelope. The difference between a <em>resilient</em> and a <em>brittle</em> system is how that system behaves when it is pushed just outside of its competence envelope.</p>



<figure><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="5702" data-permalink="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/21/the-canva-outage-another-tale-of-saturation-and-resilience/competence-envelope-2/" data-orig-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png" data-orig-size="2220,1169" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="competence-envelope" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=2048 2048w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=150 150w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=300 300w, https://surfingcomplexity.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/competence-envelope-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Incidents happen when the system is pushed outside of its competence envelope</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <em>resilient</em> system can change the way it behaves when pushed outside of the competence envelope due to an incident in order to extend the competence envelope so that it can handle the incident. That’s why we say it has <em><strong>adaptive capacity</strong>. </em>On the other hand, a <em>brittle</em> system is one that cannot adapt effectively when it exceeds its competence envelope. A system can be very robust, but also brittle: it may be able to handle a very wide range of problems, but when it faces a scenario it wasn’t designed to handle, it can fall over hard. </p>



<p>The sort of adaptation that resilience demands requires human operators: our automation simply doesn’t have a sophisticated enough model of the world to be able to handle situations like the one that Canva found itself in. </p>



<p>In general, action items after an incident focus on expanding the competence envelope: making changes to the system to handle the scenario that just happened. <a href="https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/">Improving adaptive capacity</a> involves different kind of work than improving system robustness.</p>



<p>We need to build in the ability to reconfigure our systems in advance, without knowing exactly what sorts of changes we’ll need to make. The Canva engineers had some powerful operational knobs at their disposal through the Cloudflare firewall configuration. This allowed them to make changes. The more powerful and generic these sorts of dynamic configuration features are, the more room for maneuver we have. Of course, dynamic configuration is also dangerous, and is itself a contributor to incidents. Too often we focus solely on the dangers of such functionality in creating incidents, without seeing its ability to help us reconfigure the system to mitigate incidents.</p>



<p>Finally, these sorts of operator interfaces are of no use if the responders aren’t familiar with them. Ultimately, the more your responders know about the system, the better position they’ll be in to implement these adaptations. Changing an unhealthy system is dangerous: no matter how bad things are, you can always accidentally make things worse. The more knowledge about the system you can bring to bear during an incident, the better position you’ll be in to adaptive your system to extend that competence envelope.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354">Uni Jetstream</a> is a versatile pen that can be used in almost any situation. It proves that ballpoint pens aren’t just low-quality writing instruments “borrowed” from restaurants and hotels. The Jetstream uses a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a> that provides a smooth, vivid, and consistent writing experience. And like other ballpoint pens, the Jetstream can write on receipts and other surfaces that gel pens struggle with.
							</p><p>The Jetstream comes in several body styles, tip sizes, and ink colors. This includes the comfortable <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Alpha-Gel-Grip-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/655">Alpha Gel Grip</a>, as well as a shockingly fine <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/354?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.28 mm</a> tip size that no other ballpoint pen can match. You can even get the Jetstream in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Multi-Pens/ct/858">multi pen form</a>, which includes several ink colors. Some even have mechanical pencil components!</p>

									The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706">Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen</a> is the best beginner fountain pen, period. Its durable metal build and smooth stainless steel nib ensure that your first fountain pen is one you can be proud of. The Metropolitan comes in three nib sizes (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=4cb4dbdf7f3f31d2">fine</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=58abf2a2f635c8ec32ea692af29489e9">medium</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pens/ct/1706?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba">medium italic</a>) and several body colors. It can be filled with Pilot’s proprietary <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Namiki-Fountain-Pen-Refill-Cartridges/ct/130">cartridges</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pen-Black-Plain-Fine/pd/12075/refills?&amp;f=64f61958cc42490f31a490a25ae468364ebf64e44e23854d">converters</a>—one is included!—which allows you to use any <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Fountain-Pen-Inks/ct/3250">bottled fountain pen ink</a>.
									</p><p>For those who like how the Metropolitan writes but would prefer a different body, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Kakuno-Fountain-Pens/ct/1984">Kakuno</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Penmanship-Fountain-Pens/ct/759">Penmanship</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Prera-Fountain-Pens/ct/410">Prera</a> all use the same swappable nibs. The Kakuno is especially charming thanks to the smiley face stamped on the nib, which reminds you which side should face up.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>Most fountain pens are filled with cartridges or converters, but some have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Fountain-Pen-Filling-Systems-Explained/pt/912#Built-In%20Filling%20System">built-in mechanisms</a> that allow you to fill the pen barrel with ink. They’re not as convenient as cartridges, but they can be filled with far more ink. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-GO-Fountain-Pens/ct/5275">TWSBI GO</a> is a great place to start if you want to try out this type of filling system. Its spring-loaded piston mechanism is easy to use. Submerge the nib in ink, then press down and release the plunger to fill the pen.</p>
							
							<p>Are you still a little hesitant to try out fountain pens? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pens/ct/5111">Platinum Preppy</a> is another beginner option. It has a budget-friendly price that won’t break the bank if you decide fountain pens aren’t for you. Plus, you can repurpose the pen by swapping out the nib for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fluorescent-Highlighter-Pen-Tip-Refill-Pack-of-2/pd/2820">chisel tip</a> and the fountain pen ink cartridge for a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Highlighter-Ink-Cartridges/ct/3171">highlighter ink cartridge</a>. Now you have a refillable highlighter pen!</p>

									While most piston-filling fountain pens cost more than $100, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">TWSBI ECO</a> is the best fountain pen under $50. It offers amazing value with its high quality piston-filler, and its sleek, clear body lets you see how much ink is left inside. It’s available in four nib sizes, including a fun <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=6914ab5eaeccecd6039d36e7d078ad40b376adb49213ebba_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3">1.1 mm stub</a>.
									</p><p>You might be wondering, “Why should I pick the TWSBI ECO over the GO mentioned in the previous section?” It comes down to price, ink capacity, and style. The GO has a budget-friendly price, smaller ink capacity, and quirky design that might look a little childish to some. The ECO is a little more expensive, though its traditional piston mechanism can hold more ink. Additionally, it has a body design with more general appeal, including limited edition colors (<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pens/ct/2864?&amp;f=b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">some of which</a> are over $50).</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>If the idea of a piston-filling pen makes you a bit nervous—or if you would prefer the convenience of cartridges—we wholeheartedly recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pens/ct/1185">LAMY Safari</a>. This distinctively modern fountain pen has a triangular grip section that guides your hand into an ergonomic <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">tripod grip</a>. The Safari is made of durable ABS plastic. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-AL-Star-Fountain-Pens/ct/1184">AL-Star</a> is a little more expensive, but it’s made from lightweight aluminum.</p>

It’s a stylish option for anyone ready to venture into more interesting fountain pen styles and materials. It’s both vintage and modern thanks to an iconic octagonal body design that was first introduced in 1935. The Kaweco Sport’s slogan—”Small in the pocket, great in the hand”—describes its appeal perfectly. Although the pen is small enough to fit in a pocket for <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Everyday-Carry-Stationery-Items/pt/46">everyday carry</a>, the cap can be posted on the back of the barrel to extend it to a comfortable size.
									</p><p>The Kaweco Sport is available as an inexpensive <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/3402?&amp;f=bfc2ef6f965adaf41e7007fbf57bff50_8a33979b9cde1c4f6070d7031f9e7bf3_b266f8e094c1bb7a35d80a8f3bed5d19">plastic pen</a>, but we like the AL Sport’s premium feel. The aluminum build gives the pen a good weight and durability without adding too much weight.</p>
								</div>
							
							<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Brass-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/2462">Brass Sport</a> is a good alternative for anyone who wants a heavier pen, though we should note that its raw <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Brass-Pens/pt/337">brass</a> construction can have a noticeable scent.</p>
							
							<p>We also want to mention the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=873a409ab1e24078cf6022af66aea815">LAMY Studio</a>. It features the same steel nib found on the Safari fitted to a sturdy metal body. The Studio’s subtle, curving design gives the pen a remarkably sophisticated look. If you like the Studio and are willing to spend more than $100, you can pick up the stealthy all-black <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=f0cf9d16b892f5cd0a0d2415a7dca11f">Lx</a> with a matching steel nib or a fountain pen with a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Studio-Fountain-Pens/ct/1308?&amp;f=1914fdb7b0902f3495804bc50c319a60">14k gold nib</a>.</p>

									Although there are many sophisticated pens that any professional would be proud to carry, we have to say that the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876">Pilot Vanishing Point</a> is the best luxury fountain pen for writing. This fountain pen’s elegance speaks for itself, but its retraction mechanism takes it to another level. Just press the button on the back of the barrel to extend the nib. When the nib is retracted, a “gate” inside the grip section seals the nib and prevents it from drying out.
									
									</p><p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens-Standard/ct/1225">Standard Vanishing Point</a> is best for those with larger hands and comes in a range of finishes, from the stealthy <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pens/ct/3876?&amp;f=3e29cb29569d6320_9f666c7890582192">Black Matte</a> to the stunning <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Raden-Fountain-Pens/ct/6893">Raden</a> series inlaid with real abalone shell. The thinner and lighter <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Decimo-Fountain-Pens/ct/544">Decimo</a> is ideal for those with smaller hands, or anyone who intends to write for long periods of time.</p>
								</div>

							<p>Some writers may find that the Vanishing Point’s clip gets in the way of their fingers. For an alternative that’s no less exceptional, you can’t go wrong with the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-2000-Fountain-Pens/ct/1542">LAMY 2000</a>. This fountain pen balances a striking design with understated style. Because it’s a piston filler, it has a high ink capacity that allows you to write for pages and pages.</p>
							
							<p>Is the LAMY 2000’s design a little too modern for your taste? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-3776-Century-Fountain-Pens/ct/3830">Platinum 3776 Century</a> has a vintage appeal thanks to its classic, cigar-shaped design with rounded ends. Or are you searching for an option with plenty of colors to choose from? The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sailor-Pro-Gear-Slim-Fountain-Pens/ct/4019">Pro Gear Slim</a> would be right up your alley. Sailor regularly releases new colors based on seasonal themes, Japanese festivals, and more. </p>

							This will likely be different for everyone, but at JetPens we confidently recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Pens/ct/286">Uni-ball Signo UM-151</a> as the best gel pen. It glides across the page whether you pick the reliable <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Pens/ct/286?&amp;f=a4ac441aec235eb1cd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.5 mm</a> tip size for everyday note-taking or the ultra-fine <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Pens/ct/286?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.28 mm</a> for precise writing in tiny planner squares. Its ink is wonderfully vibrant and comes in an array of beautiful colors.
							</p><p>There’s more to the Signo’s ink than just appearances, though. Its pigment-based ink is water resistant, archival quality, and resists fading from light exposure.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211?&amp;f=4420bdc25fd1063e1f9956c298a4b4ce">Pilot Acroball</a> is an excellent ballpoint pen for writing. Like our top choice, it uses low-viscosity ink that flows smoothly. In our tests, we found that the Acroball felt a little more “textured” on paper than the Jetstream, which meant it was easier to control.
							</p><p>The Acroball’s body is made from recycled plastic, and it has a firm rubber grip that’s comfortable to hold. Other pens that use Acro ink have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211?&amp;f=24b4f2b5c0e9dfbf">metal</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211?&amp;f=6899e7f15372d0331e7007fbf57bff50">plastic</a> grips. We found them pleasant to hold, but writers with sweaty hands might notice their grasps slipping easily on the smooth surfaces.</p>
							<p>The Acroball also comes in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acroball-Multi-Pens/ct/2996">multi pen</a> form, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acroball-Multi-Pens/ct/2996?&amp;f=a19ed82aab4a28cce9773f43a7371a16">some versions</a> include mechanical pencil components.</p>

							The unique tip of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Pulaman-JM20-Pens/ct/1547">Pentel Pulaman JM20 Pen</a> makes it especially well-suited for writing. Its plastic nib is expressive and creates different line widths depending on the angle and pressure that you write with. Over time, the tip wears down according to how you use it, creating an experience that’s entirely unique to you and your writing style. Its conventional body style also makes it comfortable to hold for long writing sessions.
							</p><p>For more color options, check out the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Staedtler-Triplus-Fineliner-Pens/ct/1313">Staedtler Triplus Fineliner Pen</a>. It has as 0.3 mm felt tip that’s reinforced with a metal sleeve. Its dry-safe feature keeps the pen from drying out if you leave it uncapped for a few days (but we still recommend keeping your pen capped!).</p>

							If you want your writing instrument to have the finest tip possible, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381">Pilot Hi-Tec-C</a> is the best gel pen for you. Its <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=f1d84bb55a3b087ba04e42ce0a1eb746">0.25 mm</a> tip can write neatly in the tiniest spaces, from book margins to planner squares. The Hi-Tec-C is remarkably smooth considering the fineness of the tip, and it comes in a handful of bright colors.
							</p><p>However, we must warn that such fine tip sizes will feel more “scratchy” than those found on 0.38 mm or 0.5 mm pens. A smaller tip size has a smaller surface area that comes in contact with the paper, and it puts down less ink that would otherwise lubricate the tip. Additionally, the 0.25 mm Hi-Tec-C may need to be primed with a scribble on a piece of scratch paper to get the ink flowing.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>We find these minor flaws a reasonable exchange for such fine lines, but the slightly broader <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-G-Tec-C-Gel-Pens/ct/3381?&amp;f=df8f74e215697aa1cd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.3 mm</a> tip tends to perform more reliably.</p>
					
					<p>Those who prefer ballpoint inks should reach for the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=7c1b58e478515a91a04e42ce0a1eb746">Uni Jetstream Edge</a>. As with the Hi-Tec-C, its ultra fine tip doesn’t perform as consistently as the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/5947?&amp;f=6c955f272b074045a04e42ce0a1eb746">0.38 mm Jetstream</a>, but we’re still impressed by how well the pen writes. A 0.28 mm tip size is almost unheard of in ballpoint pens, and Uni managed to make a precise pen that still offers a smooth writing experience. You can even get it as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Edge-3-Color-Ballpoint-Multi-Pens/ct/6234">multi pen</a>!</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703">Zebra Sarasa Dry</a> is the fastest-drying gel pen. Even the largest and wettest <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Dry-Gel-Pens/ct/3703?&amp;f=98b97b6ae48ce49ecd5fbcfbc64dc408">0.7 mm</a> tip size dried in less than five seconds on Rhodia paper, a paper that inks tend to dry slowly on. The Sarasa Dry puts down a wonderfully saturated line, writes smoothly, and comes in three tip sizes. Like many other Sarasa pens, this gel pen has a hinged clip that opens wide so it slides easily over notebooks and pockets.
							</p><p>As with many water-based gel inks, the Sarasa Dry smears readily beneath highlighters. Color-coders should consider using ballpoint pens like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acro-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pens/ct/1211">Pilot Acro and Acroball</a> instead. Oil-based ballpoint inks won’t react to water-based highlighter inks, so you can go over your notes without worrying about smudges.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Additionally, Pilot’s Acro ink is a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Low-Viscosity-Ballpoint-Pens/pt/160">low-viscosity ballpoint ink</a>, so it writes smoothly without blobbing.</p>

Even so, we think the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-207-Premier-Retractable-Gel-Pen-0.7-mm-Silver-Body-Black-Ink/pd/8466">Uni-ball Signo 207 Premier</a> is the best ergonomic pen for most writers. It uses the same ink as other <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-Gel-Pens/ct/2576">Signo Gel Pens</a>, so it flows freely and glides across the page with little pressure. The pigmented ink is satisfyingly dark regardless of how lightly you write. If you <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Pen-for-Your-Hand-Grip/pt/454">hold your pens tightly</a>, its squishy grip will relieve your achy fingers. In addition, the 207 Premier has a lightweight body with a low center of gravity that won’t tire your hand as you write.
							</p><p>If you prefer ballpoint ink, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-Ballpoint-Pen-Series/ct/857">Pilot Dr. Grip</a> is another excellent ergonomic pen. It has a carefully balanced barrel, and its double layer grip design is moderately soft without being too squishy or too hard.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The Dr. Grip, which is also available as a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-4-1-Multi-Pens/ct/306">multi pen</a>, has even earned an “Ease-of-Use” Commendation from the Arthritis Foundation.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Gel-Pens/ct/2574">Pilot FriXion</a> is by far the best “erasable” pen. This remarkable pen offers the best combination of vibrancy, consistency, and “erasability.” It accomplishes this with a special thermosensitive ink that writes just like any other ink, yet disappears without a trace when rubbed with the hard “eraser” on the end of the pen. The friction generated by this rubbing action raises the temperature of the ink and turns it invisible.
							</p><p>The Pilot FriXion comes in several colors, tip sizes, and body designs so that you can find one that fits your style. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Series/ct/4201">FriXion ink technology</a> can be found in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Light-Erasable-Highlighters/ct/682">highlighters</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Colors-Erasable-Markers/ct/1123">markers</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Stamps/ct/2531">stamps</a>.</p>
							<p>FriXion inks are less saturated in color than standard gel inks. This is most noticeable with the black ink, which can appear gray.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-FriXion-Ball-Knock-Zone-Retractable-Gel-Pens/ct/6729">Ball Zone</a> improves the ink’s saturation so the black ink no longer has a green tint and the colored inks are more vibrant.</p>
					
					<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Pilot FriXion ink will “erase” with any heat, so don’t store your notebooks in hot cars or on top of radiators. Additionally, don’t use FriXion ink to take tests or write on important documents, especially those that need permanent signatures. If you accidentally make your writing disappear, you may be able to get it to reappear by placing the paper in a freezer that reaches below 14°F (-10°C).</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Writech-Swirl-Rollerball-Pens/ct/7371">Writech Swirl</a> is a fantastic rollerball pen for left-handed writers. We found that it wrote smoothly with very little feedback. Amazingly, the ink dries almost instantly on copy paper, and it dries in under five seconds on high-quality papers like Rhodia. 
							</p><p>The Swirl’s name comes from the marbled print on its barrel, which matches the color of the ink inside. Choose from eight vibrant shades.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Propus-Window-Q-Dry-Highlighters/ct/3509">Uni Propus Window Q-Dry</a> is the best highlighter for left-handed writers. Highlighters are often prone to smudging because of their wet inks, but the Q-Dry dried within a single second on Rhodia paper in our tests. Inks dry slowly on Rhodia paper, so this quick dry time is an incredible feat! Left-handed writers can highlight pages without the risk of smears. Additionally, this highlighter has a window in the chisel tip, so you can see where you’re highlighting. A fine bullet tip on the other side is great for underlining or circling key terms.

	<p>The Best Pens for Journaling and Planning</p>
		
		<div>
				
					<div><p>
							Just about any pen can work well for journaling, but the JetPens team is especially fond of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pens/ct/262">Zebra Sarasa Clip</a>. Its vibrant pigment ink is smooth to write with and both water and fade resistant, so it won’t disappear if you accidentally spill a drink on your journal. 
							</p><p>If you keep a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Journals/pt/566">journal</a> like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Leuchtturm1917-Bullet-Journals/ct/4259">Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal</a> that you update with quick notations throughout the day, the Sarasa’s fast-drying ink will help prevent smudges. What really sets the Sarasa Clip apart, though, is its namesake clip. It opens wide to let you securely fasten the pen to a notebook so you’ll always be ready to make a new entry.</p>
							<p>The Clip comes in a wide variety of hues for color-coding as well as tip-sizes from 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm to suit anyone’s preferences. </p>
						</div>
					
					<p>There’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Multi-Pens/ct/412">multi pen version</a> filled with Sarasa ink. Those who appreciate finer tip sizes should consider trying the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Nano-Gel-Pens/ct/6558">Sarasa Nano</a>. It uses an internal spring that allows the tip to retract slightly into the pen, reducing sideways force and preventing the tip from wiggling undesirably.</p>

							These <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733">Kuretake ZIG Clean Color Dot Markers</a> bring fun and versatility to journaling and planning. We’re big fans of the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kuretake-ZIG-Clean-Color-Dot-Markers/ct/5733?&amp;f=cd4aa3cda9bd1548bd4cf76df45d38a1">double-sided version</a>, which features a 0.5 mm hard plastic tip on one end and a wonderfully squishy dot tip on the other.
							</p><p>Depending on the pressure you use, the dot tip can make marks from one to five millimeters wide, though we should warn that pressing very hard can put a lot of ink on the page and cause bleedthrough. It’s easy and fun to make quick flowers and other fun doodles, or—for a slightly more practical use case—to highlight important dates in your planner or calendar. You can even make expressive brush-like strokes with the dot tip by varying the pressure as you draw!</p>

It features a colored highlighter on one end and a complementary fineliner on the other. The highlighter end has a 4.0 mm chisel tip with ink that stands out without being overwhelmingly bright. The color of the fineliner end depends on which Mark+ you pick. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Mark-2-Way-Marker-Pens-Gray-Type/ct/6136">Gray Type Marker Pen</a> has a gray hue tinted to match the chisel color, while the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Mark-2-Way-Marker-Pens-Color-Type/ct/6137">Color Type</a> has a darker version of the chisel color.

It didn’t smear the water-based or oil-based inks we <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Highlighter-Pens/pt/606#TEST%20RESULTS">tested it with</a>—and it didn’t smear inkjet-printed handouts, either. One caveat: we used specific pens and inks for our testing, so be sure to test the highlighter with your pens before you do a lot of highlighting.
							</p><p>The JustFit Mojini Line has a flexible chisel tip that follows the curves of book pages, so your highlighted lines stay neat. Choose from five vibrant colors. </p>

Its highly pigmented ink delivers intense color that’s easy to read from across the room, and its thick tip is easy to control. Its dry-erase ink wipes away cleanly without leaving behind “shadows” on the whiteboard.
							</p><p>Best of all, the Board Master has an ingenious twin pipe feeder system that equalizes the pressure inside and outside the marker. Lines remain crisp, vibrant, and consistent down to the last drop of ink. You’ll never have to struggle with faint whiteboard marker lines again!

					<div><p>
							We have to pick the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/BIGiDESIGN-Ti-Arto-EDC-Pens/ct/5253">BIGiDESIGN Ti Arto EDC</a> as the best metal pen for everyday carry due to its durability and versatility. This <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Machined-Pens-2020-Review/pt/973">machined pen</a> is made from solid <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Titanium-Pens/pt/582">titanium</a>, a phenomenally strong material that can easily withstand the hard knocks of <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Everyday-Carry-Stationery-Items/pt/46">daily carry</a>.
							</p><p>More importantly, the Ti Arto EDC can use almost any refill you want to try. An adjustable clutch mechanism in the nose cone securely holds refills in place, with no tip wiggle to district from your writing experience. The Ti Arto EDC also features a telescoping barrel that lets you adjust the length of the pen to match the refill inside.</p>
							<p>If you like the Ti Arto EDC but want different features, BIGiDESIGN makes <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/BIGiDESIGN-Pens/ct/4929">other great pens</a>. The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/BIGiDESIGN-Ti-Click-EDC-Pens/ct/5699">Ti Click EDC</a> has a similarly telescoping barrel with a handy click retraction mechanism for quick notes.</p>

	<p>The Best Pens for Hand Lettering</p>
		
		
		
		<div>
				
					<div><p>
							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910">Sakura Pigma Micron</a> is a fantastic fineliner for lettering (and art, too!). Its precise tip allows letterers to make consistent marks for drawing monoline styles and elaborate letterforms. Its rich, pigment-based ink delivers vivid color that is archival quality and waterproof, so your lettering will last for years. This iconic pen comes in several colors and fineliner tip sizes ranging from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=90a21b8d54b00f7e9554f72d2b1a94e1">003</a> (0.15 mm) for intricate embellishments to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0c76cccd3a5f8bf6a04e42ce0a1eb746">12</a> (0.7 mm) for text that stands out. Pigma Micron tips can be a little delicate, so use a light hand and don’t press too hard while lettering. Otherwise, you might bend the tips.
							</p><p>Other tip types including <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=9337a404131b90fa7df047e3c29eae93">bullet tips</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=0ddcea6bf85d451d32091cb827bdb85a">plastic nibs</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pens/ct/3910?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brushes</a> are also available.</p>

							The best dip pen for lettering is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Rohrer-Klingner-Glass-Pens/ct/6105">Rohrer &amp; Klingner Glass Pen</a>. It’s a beautiful writing tool and a unique work of art at the same time. A <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/How-to-Use-a-Glass-Dip-Pen/pt/344">glass pen</a> has a tip with spiraling grooves that act as reservoirs. Dip the tip in ink to fill the grooves. As you write, ink travels down the grooves to the tip of the pen. When the tip feels like it’s running dry, turn the pen in your hand to allow ink from another groove to flow to the tip. Glass nibs will never rust, so they can last a lifetime as long as they’re cleaned of ink residue. Be sure to store them in a stable area like a pen cup or tray, too: after all, they’re made of glass, and can break if dropped!
							</p><p>If the designs offered by Rohrer &amp; Klingner don’t strike your fancy, browse the different glass pen colors offered by <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Herbin-Glass-Dip-Pens/ct/724">Herbin</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Guridrops-Glass-Pens/ct/6952">Guridrops</a>.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>All glass pens are handmade by artisans, so no two will look exactly alike.</p>
					
					<p>Since glass dip pens are made of fragile materials, some calligraphers may feel anxious about accidentally damaging them. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Teranishi-Guitar-Aurora-Glass-Pens-with-Cap/ct/7097">Teranishi Guitar Aurora Glass Pens</a> have acrylic barrels and come with screw-on caps to protect their glass tips. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nibs/ct/7197">Kakimori Metal Dip Pen Nibs</a> are made from durable brass or stainless steel (though you’ll need to pick up a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kakimori-Dip-Pen-Nib-Metal-Nib-Brass/pd/40028/compatible#index=1">nib holder</a>, too).</p>
					
					<p>You can also try a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iro-Utsushi-Dip-Pens/ct/6648">Pilot Iro-Utsushi Dip Pen</a>, which has a barrel made of plastic or wood. The nib is made of stainless steel and has a rounded tip similar to a fountain pen nib, so they’re less “sharp” than typical dip pen nibs and feel smoother on paper. You should still be careful not to drop the pen on its nib, but you won’t have to worry about glass shards if an accident happens.</p>

Their archival-safe, pigment-based inks dry very quickly. We were able to paint over them with watercolors immediately and saw no bleeding whatsoever. And since Multiliners are made by Copic, they’re compatible with alcohol-based <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Markers/ct/3075?&amp;f=1b8763b30df3730297f215786bb046761f4737d59d8d7acd">Copic Markers</a>.

							</p><p>These fineliners have precise needlepoint-tips and come in sizes ranging from delicate <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-Pens/ct/2115?&amp;f=5cacb198d90013b59554f72d2b1a94e1">0.03 mm</a> to bold <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-Pens/ct/2115?&amp;f=b6764a24883b9a72a04e42ce0a1eb746">1.0 mm</a> for every kind of line. They’re also available in ten colors, so you can line your artwork in a different color for visual appeal.</p>

							<p>Artists who do a great deal of inking should consider the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pens/ct/686">Multiliner SP</a>. They require a higher up-front investment than their disposable siblings, but they’re <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Refills/ct/2357">refillable</a> and even have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Copic-Multiliner-SP-Pen-Replacement-Nibs-Accessories/ct/3427">replaceable tips</a>.</p>

							The best <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Technical-Drawing-Pens/pt/436">technical drawing pen</a> for art is the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/OHTO-Graphic-Liner-Needle-Point-Drawing-Pens/ct/1506">OHTO Graphic Liner</a>. Unlike traditional drawing pens with metal tips that must be held vertically, the Graphic Liner has a rollerball tip that can be used at your natural drawing angle. Since it’s made of metal rather than felt or plastic, the tip creates consistent lines without fraying or flexing. This makes it especially suitable for beginners, but even experienced artists can appreciate its natural feel and waterproof, Copic-proof, and archival pigment-based ink.

							The best <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Manga-and-Comic-Art-Supplies/pt/956"><em>manga</em> pen</a> for art combines a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs/ct/3065?&amp;f=a220e003961af2ce">Nikko G Nib</a> with a nib holder like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Tachikawa-T-40-Nib-Holder-Natural/pd/4573">Tachikawa Model 40</a>. A G Nib has a sharp tip that creates both broad and thin lines ideal for facial features, action-packed scenes, and more. We recommend that beginners start with the Nikko G because it’s relatively firm compared to other G nibs. This firmness makes it easy to control while still allowing a satisfying amount of flex.
							</p><p>For consistent lines, try Nikko’s <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Nikko-Comic-Pen-Nibs-Standard/ct/3794?&amp;f=add42f28e0d80e67dacb8f62f5adf3e49e6ad08b7a4ff724">Maru Nibs</a>. Also known as mapping nibs, these stiff nibs don’t flex at all. They work well for precise details.</p>
							<p>Comic pen nibs can’t be used on their own and must be paired with nib holders. The Tachikawa Model 40 is our favorite nib holder for <em>manga</em> artists.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>Its double rubber rings can hold a wide variety of nibs, and its rubber grip makes it comfortable to hold. It even comes with a plastic cap to protect nibs during transport.</p>

							As its name suggests, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Series/ct/4076">Faber-Castell PITT Artist Pen</a> is a great marker for art. It combines the permanence and vibrancy of India ink with the convenience of a marker. Other inks can fade when exposed to light, but the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/309">PITT Artist Pen</a> uses ink that’s lightfast so you can confidently display your art. Because some colors are more lightfast than others, Faber-Castell prints a rating on each pen’s barrel to help you choose the right hues. A one-asterisk rating means the ink is lightfast for at least five years, while a three-asterisk rating is lightfast for more than 100 years!
							
							</p><p>Faber-Castell offers PITT Pens in <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pens/ct/3076">marker</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Brush-Pens/ct/5181">brush pen</a> forms. And no matter which pen you prefer, it’s color-matched with other Faber-Castell products like <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Polychromos-Colored-Pencils/ct/4107">Polychromos Colored Pencils</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-Albrecht-Durer-Watercolor-Pencils/ct/5448">Albrecht Dürer Watercolor Pencils</a> for consistency in your multimedia projects.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Royal-Talens-Ecoline-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/ct/4166">Royal Talens Ecoline</a> is the best watercolor brush pen for art. Its soft felt tip puts down swaths of bright, juicy color with each stroke. This softness means that it takes some practice to learn how to control the Ecoline, but it makes such wonderful lines that it’s worth it for this excellent watercolor brush pen. The Ecoline contains highly <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Watercolor-Brush-Pens/pt/952">water-soluble ink</a> that blends easily and can continue to be layered and blended after it dries. We recommend pairing the Ecoline with thick <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Watercolor-Supplies/ct/2941?&amp;f=ca1f8d859dd3bdb2">watercolor paper</a> because heavy applications of ink can bleed through thinner papers.

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090">Uni Posca</a> is consistently one of the most popular <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-Paint-Pens-For-Arts-and-Crafts/pt/917">paint pens</a> at JetPens, and for good reason. Its opaque, water-based ink writes on a wide variety of porous and nonporous surfaces, including paper, plastic, wood, and metal. This marker has intense color payoff and is easy to remove from nonporous surfaces like glass, which makes it great for window signs. It comes in several different tip sizes from <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=6c3e2810f75bf0d14191bd7ebbc0e799">extra fine</a> to <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=0405f6b2421bcd951f4737d59d8d7acd">broad</a>, and there’s even a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Posca-Markers/ct/1090?&amp;f=7dd55fcb7563d511">brush version</a> for lettering and art.

							If you need a vibrant colored pen for drawing and coloring, you’ll want to check out the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Point-88-Fineliner-Pens/ct/1236">Stabilo Point 88</a>. This fineliner has a 0.4 mm tip that’s great for creating fine outlines and filling in details with bright, even color. It comes in over fifty hues and shades, and it even works well for journaling and taking color-coded notes. Its water-based ink is specially formulated to resist drying out when left uncapped, so it won’t dry out while you’re thinking about what to do next. Make sure you cap your pens for extended breaks, though—it’s the best way to make sure your writing instruments last as long as possible.
							</p><p>If you want to fill in big areas with color quickly, try the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Pen-68-Markers/ct/3600">Stabilo Pen 68</a>, which has a bold bullet tip. A <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Pen-68-Brush-Markers/ct/6125">brush pen version</a> is also available.</p>
						</div>
					
					<p>We also want to shine a spotlight on <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Clickart-Knock-Sign-Pens/ct/5823">Zebra Clickart Knock Sign Pens</a>, which have convenient retractable tips. They don’t come in as many colors as the Stabilo Point 88, but all artists and doodlers can appreciate the variety they offer.</p>

							The <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-One-Gel-Pens-Standard/ct/6100">Uni-ball One</a> might look simple, but it’s hands down the best gel pen for coloring. Its fast-drying, bleed-resistant ink is specially formulated with large pigment particles that stay on the surface of the paper instead of getting absorbed into the fibers. Dark inks look darker and bright inks look brighter, so your <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Coloring-Books/ct/3582">coloring books</a> will be packed with vibrant art. It comes in tons of different colors as well as three tip sizes, all of which are smooth to draw with. Its simple white barrel is accented by a detail near the clicker, which lets you know exactly what color is inside.
							</p><p>Fans of the Sarasa—another popular colored gel pen—can take a look at the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-R-Gel-Pens/ct/6253">Zebra Sarasa R</a>. Its ink has 27% more color density than standard Sarasa ink, so colors are more saturated.</p></div>

							If you want a simple effect that still grabs your attention, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Hybrid-Mattehop-Gel-Pens/ct/7072">Pentel Hybrid Mattehop</a> is the best matte gel pen for art. It features an opaque ink that dries to a matte, plastic-like finish. Our JetPens team members especially liked the way that the Mattehop performed on glossy papers, like those found in yearbooks. It even shows up on dark papers, so you can write over backgrounds without worry. However, we found that the gel pen does take a while to dry, so be careful not to smudge your writing.

							Just like its glittery cousin, the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Gelly-Roll-Moonlight-Gel-Pens/ct/510">Sakura Gelly Roll Moonlight</a> is packed with opaque ink that makes it the best pastel gel pen for art. It comes in three tip sizes, all of which put down smooth lines that stand out on light and dark papers. The water-based ink is archival quality, so you can rest assured that your projects won’t deteriorate over time.
							</p><p>We also want to recommend the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Souffle-Gel-Pens/ct/445">Sakura Souffle</a>, which has a unique ink with a three-dimensional effect! This finish isn’t as noticeable on porous surfaces like paper, so we recommend saving the Souffle for photos and glossy cards.</p>
							<p>For a brush pen option, try the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Milky-Brush-Pens/ct/6696">Pentel Milky</a>. You can use it to create lettering with line variation, or to quickly fill in large areas with ink. </p>

<p>From sodas to energy drinks, the consumption of sugary drinks <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been linked</a> to more than 2.2 million new cases of diabetes and 1.1 million new cases of heart disease annually, raising concerns over the health risks these drinks bring to the table.</p><p>The problem is especially severe in low- and middle-income countries, where sugar-filled drinks are aggressively marketed and often more accessible than healthier alternatives. In Latin America and the Caribbean, nearly 24% of new type 2 diabetes cases in 2020 were attributed to the consumption of sugary beverages.

</p><p>Similarly, sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing the highest percentage increase in diabetes cases over three decades, with sugary drinks contributing to 21 percent of new diabetes cases and 11 percent of heart disease cases, the study highlights. The health risks of sugary drinks stem largely from their composition.</p>
<p>Packed with sugar but devoid of nutritional value, these beverages cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Over time, this leads to weight gain, insulin resistance, and a cascade of metabolic issues that pave the way for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.</p><div>	<h4>Tech. Entertainment.

Beverage companies’ marketing strategies only exacerbate the issue. In many urban centers, social media influencers promoting sugary drinks target young people, filling an information void left by insufficient nutrition education.</p><p>As a result, consumption continues to rise, putting additional strain on healthcare systems ill-equipped to handle the long-term consequences of these preventable diseases. Solutions do exist, of course. Public health campaigns, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, and stricter advertising regulations have proven effective in some countries.</p><p>For example, Mexico introduced a sugar tax in 2014, which helped reduce consumption. However, much more needs to be done, particularly in regions like Latin America and Africa, where the health impacts are most severe. We’ve seen some <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/insulin-may-be-a-thing-of-the-past-thanks-to-this-groundbreaking-diabetes-cure/">major breakthroughs in creating diabetes cures</a>, but tackling the issue at its roots would be massive.</p>
<p>Reducing sugary drink consumption isn’t just about tackling diabetes and heart disease; it’s about creating a healthier future for communities worldwide. By tackling the health risks of sugary drinks now, we can provide a healthier future for the next generation.</p>

<p id="introduction">“How are you measuring productivity?”</p>

<p>It was September 2023 and my CEO was asking me a question.</p>

<p>“How are you measuring productivity?”</p>

<p>It was September 2023, my CEO was asking me a question, and my position as Vice President of Engineering was less than three months old.</p>

<p>“How are you measuring productivity?”</p>

<p>It was September 2023, my CEO was asking me a question, my position was less than three months old, and <em>I didn’t have an answer</em>.</p>

<p>So I told the truth.</p>

<p>“How am I measuring productivity? I’m not. Software engineering productivity can’t be measured.”</p>

<p>It’s true! The question of measuring productivity is a famous one, and the best minds in the industry have concluded it can’t be done. Martin Fowler wrote an article in 2003 titled “<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html">Cannot Measure Productivity</a>.” Kent Beck and Gergely Orosz <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity">revisited the question</a> 20 years later. <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-440">Kent Beck concluded</a>, “Measure developer productivity? Not possible.”</p>

<p>My favorite discussion of the topic is Robert Austin’s, who wrote <em>Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations</em>. He says a measurement based approach “generates relatively weak improvements“ and “significant distortion of incentives.”</p>

<p>How do I measure productivity? It can’t be done. At least, not without creating a lot of dysfunctional incentives.</p>

<p>But this isn’t a talk about measuring productivity. This is a talk about what you do, as VP of Engineering, when somebody asks for the impossible.</p>

<p>[turn right] “How are you measuring productivity?” [turn left] “I’m not. It can’t be done.” [turn right] “You’re wrong. I don’t believe you.”</p>

<p>I don’t... respond well to that sort of flat dismissal. I said some things that you’re not supposed to say to your CEO.</p>

<p>It was September 2023, my position was less than three months old, and it didn’t look like I was going to make it to the end of month four.</p>

<p>[beat]</p>

<p>Luckily, my CEO’s actually a pretty reasonable person. Our company is fully remote, so he invited me to come to his house next time I was in his city so we could discuss it face-to-face.</p>

<p>That gave me a month to cool off and think about what I wanted to say. I had an impossible—or at least, dangerous—request: measure productivity. Given that I couldn’t give my CEO what he wanted without creating dysfunction in engineering, what <em>could</em> I give him?</p>

<p>That’s what this talk is <em>really</em> about.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/003.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide with the text “The Best Product Engineering Org in the World” written in a bold white font on a black background.">
</p>

<p>The CEO, chief product officer, chief technical officer, and I met a month later. I said, “If we had the best product engineering organization in the world, what would it look like?” I walked them through an exercise right there on the CEO’s dining room table. It had a lot of index cards and sticky notes... of course!</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/004.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A picture of a dining room table covered in cards and sticky notes.">
</p>

<p>In the end, we came up with six categories. Imagine we’re the best product engineering org in the world. What does that look like?</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/005.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide with six categories written in a bold white font on a black background. The categories are: People, Internal Quality, Lovability, Visibility, Agility, and Profitability.">
</p>

<p>For us, it means these six things.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><em>People.</em> We’d have the best people in the business, and we’d be the best place for them to work. They’d beg to work for us, and people who left would try to replicate their experience everywhere they went.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>Internal Quality.</em> Our software would be easy to modify and maintain. We’d have no bugs and no downtime.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>Lovability.</em> Our customers, users, and internal consumers would love our products. We’d excel at understanding what stakeholders truly need and put our effort where it mattered the most.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>Visibility.</em> Our internal stakeholders would trust our decisions. Not because we’d be perfect, but because we’d go out of our way to keep them involved and informed.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>Agility.</em> We’d be entrepreneurial, scrappy, and hungry. We’d actively search out new opportunities and change direction to take advantage of them.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>Profitability.</em> We’d be the engine of a profitable and growing business. We’d work with our internal stakeholders to ensure our products were ready for the real world of sales, marketing, content, support, partners, accounting, and every other aspect of our business.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are we the best product engineering org in the world today? No. Will we ever be? Probably not.</p>

<p>But we don’t need to be. It’s not about <em>literally</em> being the best product engineering org in the world. It’s about constantly striving to improve. These six categories are the ways we want to improve.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you? If you did this exercise with <em>your</em> leadership team, you’d probably get different answers. I’m not saying that our categories is right for everyone.</p>

<p>But it’s still an interesting thought exercise. We’re an organization that’s steeped in Agile thinking. These six categories may not be exactly what your org would use, but these six—People. Internal Quality. Lovability. Visibility. Agility. Profitability—these are worth investing in. I’m going to talk about what we’re doing in each of these six categories. If you’re a senior manager, some of these techniques might be worth using.</p>

<p>If you’re <em>not</em> a senior manager, these are techniques you could potentially take to your managers. Agile only succeeds if the organization really gets behind it. You can share these ideas as an examples of what to do to support your Agile teams.</p>

<p>Let’s dig in.</p>


<h3 id="people">People</h3>

</p>

<p>Everybody wants the best people in the business. But our company is relatively small. We can’t compete with the likes of Google, Amazon, Apple... the FAANG companies. They’re looking for the best people, too, and they have way more money than we do.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/007.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="An image of a lone chibi programmer working in the dark.">
</p>

<p>But we can still get the best people in the business. That’s because we define “best” differently than they do. They’re looking for people who went to prestigious schools, who have worked for other FAANG companies, who can solve Leetcode problems in their sleep.</p>

<p>We don’t want those people.</p>

</p>

<p>We’re an inverted organization. That means that tactical decisions are made by the people who are doing the work, not managers. (In theory, anyway, we’re not perfect.) So we’re looking for people who have <em>peer leadership</em> skills, who are great at
	<em>teamwork</em>, who will take <em>ownership</em> and <em>make decisions</em> on their own.</p>

<p>And we’re an XP shop. We use Extreme Programming as our model of how to develop software. As it turns out, XPers love teamwork, peer leadership, and ownership. They also love test-driven development, pairing, continuous integration, and evolutionary design. They tend to be passionate, senior developers. And they’re dying to be part of an XP team again.</p>

<p>You see, Extreme Programming is too... extreme... for most companies. Just like real Agile and real Scrum is too extreme for most companies. How many times have you seen Scrum used as an excuse for micromanagement, or a senior leader tell you that you have to be Agile and give them a detailed plan for what your team is going to do over the next year?</p>

<p>In other words, there aren’t many companies using XP. There are a lot of great people who wish they could use XP. We have our pick of top-quality candidates. And, as a fully remote company, we have a lot of flexibility in where we hire.</p>

</p>

<p>I said we’re an XP shop, but that’s not exactly true. The founders were immersed in XP, and XP is where we want to return, but there was a period of time where the company grew quickly and lost that XP culture. We have a bunch of engineers who don’t have the XP mindset. We need to bring them on board, too.</p>

<p>This is a matter of changing organizational culture, and organizational culture isn’t easy to change. Our engineering managers are at the forefront of that effort.</p>

<p>To help them along, we’ve revised our career ladder. This is the document that describes what you need to do in order to be promoted. The old career ladder emphasized understanding advanced technologies and building complex systems. The new one emphasizes teamwork, peer leadership, ownership, and XP engineering skills such as test-driven development, refactoring, and simple design.</p>

</p>

<p>QR Code: <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2024/update-on-software-engineering-career-ladder">Career Ladder</a></p>

<p>This is what it looks like. It’s a big spreadsheet which describes each title in our engineering organization, along with the skills required to reach each title.</p>

<p>For example, Associate Software Engineers are hired fresh out of university. They’re only expected to have classroom engineering skills. They contribute to the team with the help of other team members.</p>

<p>Mid-level software engineers are expected to be able to contribute to the team without explicit guidance. We expect them to have basic communication, leadership, product, implementation, design, and operations skills.</p>

<p>Senior software engineers are expected to have the advanced version of those skills; technical leads are expected to mentor and exercise peer leadership; and so forth.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/013.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The spreadsheet is expanded to show individual skills in each category. The “Classroom Engineering” category shows “Object-oriented programming language,” “Pairing/teaming driver,” “Classroom-level debugging,” and “Function and variable abstraction.” The “Basic Communication” category shows “Collective ownership,” “Defend a contrary stance,” “Yes, and...,” “Try it their way,” “Technical feedback,” “Active listening,” and “As-built documentation.”">
</p>

<p>As I said, each level defines sets of skills. For example, associate software engineers are expected to be fluent at the skills in classroom engineering, which includes object-oriented programming, following direction as part of a pair, basic debugging skills, and basic function and variable abstraction.</p>

<p>Mid-level software engineers are expected to be fluent at basic communication, which includes skills such as working collaboratively with other team members, disagreeing constructively, building on other people’s ideas, and so forth.</p>

<p>There’s more details here than I can explain today, but you can use the QR code to find a detailed article, including the documentation we use for the skills.</p>

<p>Today, I’d like to highlight a few skills that I think are particularly important.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/014.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Communication &amp; Teamwork.” It shows a progression of skills. Associate Software Engineers have the skill “Active participation.” Software Engineers have “Active listening.” Senior Software Engineers have “Ensure everyone’s voice is heard.” Technical Leads have “Psychological safety.”">
</p>

<p>First: communication and teamwork. Before I joined, work was assigned to individual engineers. They would go off and work for a week or two, then come back with a finished result.</p>

<p>Now, rather than assigning work to individual engineers, we assign it to <em>teams</em>. (I’ll talk more about how teams are defined later.) We expect those teams to take a valuable increment, go off and work on it <em>together</em>, including collaborating with product management and stakeholders to understand what needs to be done, and to take responsibility for figuring out how to work together <em>as a team</em>.</p>

<p>This is a <em>big</em> cultural shift! It’s uncomfortable for some folks. To help change the engineering culture, we’ve defined a lot of skills around communication and teamwork. This is just one example.</p>

<p>A new engineer is expected to participate actively in team conversations. Then, as they grow, they’re expected not only to share their perspective, but to actively work to understand other people’s perspectives as well.</p>

<p>As engineers grow further, into a senior role on the team, they’re expected to pay attention to who is participating and who isn’t, and make sure there’s room for everybody to speak and be heard.</p>

<p>And ultimately, as the team’s most senior engineer, they’re expected to actively work with management to create an environment where people feel safe speaking their mind and expressing disagreement.</p>

<p>As a reminder, what I’m trying to do here is to change the engineering culture at my company. One of the ways I think the culture needs to change is to have more <em>team</em> work and less <em>individual</em> work. This ladder of growing expectations and responsibility is one of the ways I’m encouraging those changes.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/019.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Peer Leadership.” It shows a similar progression of skills. Associate Software Engineers have the skill “Follow the process.” Software Engineers have “Team steward.” Senior Software Engineers have “Peer leadership.” Technical Leads have “Leaderful teams.”">
</p>

<p>Let me show you another example.</p>

<p>If we want to delegate decisions to the people doing the work, and we do, then peer leadership skills are essential. Peer leadership is the ability for <em>everyone</em> on the team to take a leadership role, at appropriate times, according to their skills and the needs of the team, regardless of titles.</p>

<p>We have many leadership skills, but one path starts with our most junior engineers, with a skill called “Follow the process.” But this skill isn’t just about following our existing process; it’s also about working with the rest of the team to adjust the process, or make exceptions, when the process isn’t a good fit for the situation.</p>

<p>As engineers grow, they start to take on explicit leadership roles. One of those roles is “team steward.” Each team has a “team steward” who’s responsible for defining how the team works together and keeping everyone aligned. This is a role we expect our engineers to take on early in their careers, to start building their leadership muscles.</p>

<p>Senior engineers are expected to have a more nuanced and fluid understanding of leadership. They’re supposed to understand that leadership isn’t about who’s “in charge”—who’s been formally identified as a leader—but instead about reacting to what the situation demands and following the lead of the people who know the most about the situation. They’re expected to identify and follow the people who are best suited to lead in any given situation, and build their own ability to do so, regardless of formal leadership roles.</p>

<p>Our most senior engineers take this one step further. They work with managers to understand the leadership skills of everyone on the team, the leadership skills that are missing or that need to be developed further, and to help team members grow their peer leadership skills where they’re most needed.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/024.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="Another slide showing skill progression. This one is labelled “Ownership.” Associate Software Engineers have the skill “Intrinsic motivation.” Software Engineers have “Scut work.” Senior Software Engineers have “Critique the process.” Technical Leads have “Impediment removal.”">
</p>

<p>Similarly to leadership, if we’re going to delegate decisions to team contributors, then we need them to take ownership of creating great results.</p>

<p>One of these paths starts with intrinsic motivation: the idea that our engineers are motivated by the joy of engineering and working with a great team. We don’t want people who have to be constantly monitored by a manager, but who put in their best effort because that’s the kind of person they are.</p>

<p>Before they can advance out of a junior role, they have to have the maturity to take on the unpleasant tasks that exist on every team. In English, this is called “scut work”—the tedious, disagreeable chores that have to be done.</p>

<p>Scut work isn’t something that only juniors do. It’s something everyone has to do. What we’re looking for is the ability to take it on
	<em>without being asked</em>. We’re looking for the ability to recognize and take responsibility for things that need to be done, even if they aren’t the most fun.</p>

<p>Every engineer participates in the teams’ retrospectives, but to be a senior engineer, they have to do more than participate. They have to take ownership of making improvements. Our senior engineers are constantly identifying and proposing tweaks to improve how teams work together and how they interact with people outside the team.</p>

<p>And our most senior engineers take it one step further, identifying impediments to the team’s success that are outside of the team’s control and working with management and other leads to remove them.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/029.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A skill progression slide labelled “Design.” Associate Software Engineers have the skill “Function and variable abstraction.” Software Engineers have “Class abstraction” and “Function and variable refactoring.” Senior Software Engineers have “Simple design” and “Class refactoring.” Technical Leads have “Risk-driven architecture” and “Architectural refactoring.”">
</p>

<p>We also put a lot of emphasis on XP skills, and particularly on simplifying our design. This is one example.</p>

<p>Junior engineers are expected to know how to use functions and variables to make code more readable.</p>

<p>As they grow into mid-level engineers, they learn how to refactor those functions and variables to improve the abstractions, and they also learn how to create appropriate class abstractions.</p>

<p>Senior engineers know how to refactor those class abstractions, and they use that skill to simplify the design of the system. It’s common for an initial design to be overly-complicated, so it’s important for people to be paying attention to how to simplify it over time.</p>

<p>This emphasis on simple design is the opposite of what I’ve seen in some companies. In some companies, the more senior you are, the more complicated your designs are expected to be. But we do the opposite. We think complexity is easy, and it’s <em>simplicity</em> that’s hard, so we expect our more senior engineers to produce simpler designs.</p>

<p>And finally, our most senior engineers understand how to refactor the system as a whole, and how to prioritize those refactorings according to the risks and costs of change.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>To recap, our career ladder is a tool for cultural change. We’re using it to move from being an organization that prized individual work, advanced technologies, and complex systems, to one that focuses on teamwork, peer leadership, ownership, and simplicity.</p>

<p>We launched the new career ladder in June of last year—about six months ago. It seems to be working. My managers tell me that they’re seeing shifts in behavior, with people volunteering to lead meetings and take on work they didn’t before. We’ve also been able to use the new career ladder as a touchstone for people who are having performance problems.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/035.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A cute image of chibi programmers working in pairs in an Extreme Programming team room.">
</p>

<p>Of course, the career ladder isn’t enough on its own. It helps people know what’s expected of them, but it doesn’t do any good if people don’t know how to perform these skills.</p>

<p>To help out, we’re supporting the career ladder changes with an XP coaching team. Every open headcount I’ve gotten since I joined has gone towards hiring very senior XP coaches. These are <em>player</em> coaches who get hands on with the code and lead by example. They work alongside the rest of the engineers, demonstrating as part of the team’s normal work how XP works and why it’s such a great way to work.</p>

<p>We’re at a ratio of about one XP coach for every 11 engineers, which isn’t quite enough yet. But it’s enough that we can start developing coaches internally rather than hiring externally. And, of course, as additional positions open up, we’ll be hiring people who already have XP skills, although not necessarily at the same level of seniority.</p>

<p>When I look at how other companies approach this problem, the main thing I see is a lack of commitment. They’ll have an “Agile Center of Excellence,” but the ratio will be closer to 1 coach for every 50 or 100 engineers. Those coaches often aren’t engineers, so they can’t lead by example. And even if they could, they’re spread too thin. The best way to learn XP is to be immersed in it, day in, day out, on your real-world work. You need a coach working alongside you as you learn. With ratios of 1 to 50 or worse, there’s just no way for that to happen.</p>

<p>As I said, we have a ratio of 1 to 11 XP coaches to engineers, and I would like it to be closer to 1 to 6. Our initial coaching hires are jump-starting that path, and we’re training people internally to get the rest of the way.</p>

</p>

<p>People are the life blood of any organization, and they’re particularly important in an Agile organization, where so many decisions are made by the team contributors, not managers.</p>

<p>If we were the best product engineering org in the world, we’d have the best people in the business, and we’d be the best place for them to work. To get there, we’re defining “best” differently than other companies. We’re looking for teamwork, peer leadership, and ownership. We’re attracting people who love XP and emphasize simple, clean design rather than algorithms and complex solutions. And we’re changing our company culture with a new career ladder and player-coaches who lead by example.</p>

</p>

<p>I don’t speak Japanese, but I do have a favorite Japanese word: <em>muda</em>. I learned about muda from the Toyota Production System.</p>

<p>Muda is my biggest problem, and it’s the biggest problem at many companies I know. Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/044.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A graph showing how effort is spent over time. The details are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>This graph shows five months of engineering effort on a product. This isn’t real data, for confidentiality reasons, but it’s based on my real-world experiences.</p>

<p>On the X axis, we have months of data. On the Y axis, we have the amount of time people spent on various types of work.</p>

<p>Over these five months, the example team spent about 35% of their time on deferred maintenance. They had a key technology that they hadn’t kept up to date, and the vendor was dropping support, so they had to put everything else on hold to replace it.</p>

<p>They spent about 25% of their time on call and responding to production incidents.</p>

<p>They spent about 5% of their time on routine maintenance.</p>

<p>They spent about 20% of their time fixing bugs.</p>

<p>And only about 15% of their time on doing things that added new value to their business.</p>

<p>Let me put it another way: if this fictional organization had spent one million dollars on development during this time, only $150 thousand would have been spent on things their business partners really valued. The other $850 thousand would have been wasted. It was necessary, but not valuable. Muda.</p>

<p>And that’s why “muda” is my favorite Japanese word. It’s the thing I need us all to fix.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/045.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide with three categories written in a bold black font on a grey background: “Complexity,” “Slow Feedback Loops,” and “Deferred Maintenance.”">
</p>

<p>Why is there so much muda? I see three common problems:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Complexity</li>
	<li>Slow feedback loops</li>
	<li>Deferred maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>They’re often lumped together as “technical debt” or “legacy code,” but each is its own problem. Let’s take a closer look at each one.</p>


<h4>Complexity</h4>

<p>Complexity is the result of having lots of different systems. It’s hard for any one developer to understand how everything works, so they have to work very slowly and carefully, and even then, you still get bugs and production incidents.</p>

<p>Our systems don’t <em>have</em> to be that complicated. In the rush to deliver features, people chose complicated technologies that promised fast results. This has been repeated many times. Each technology requires a bunch of expertise, and so it’s become impossible for any one person to be an expert in all of them. It’s become difficult to make those tools do exactly what we want, too, and it’s hard to make them work well together.</p>

<p>This is a fundamental mistake I see a lot of companies making. When they’re deciding how to deliver a feature, they focus on how much it will cost to <em>build</em> a feature. They don’t think about how much it will cost to <em>maintain</em> the feature. They choose solutions that are easy to build, but hard to maintain. But the majority of software development costs are <em>maintenance</em> costs, not <em>build</em> costs. Neglecting maintenance costs puts them in a difficult position.</p>

<p>

On closer inspection, the image has a number of oddities, including a plant that’s floating in mid-air, a character with his head on backwards, and a character with a coffee cup on his head. The image credit reads, “ChatGPT/Dall-E, 2024.”">
</p>

<p>In 2025, we can’t talk about development costs without also talking about AI. Don’t get me wrong! AI is a great tool. I used it for the images in this talk, and it allowed me to add character and interest that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to add.</p>

<p>But remember this image? Take a closer look at the character in the middle.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Did you wonder why he has a coffee cup on his head?</p>

<p>That’s because...</p>

</p>

His arms are crossed and a coffee cup is resting on his elbow near his hand. The image credit reads, “ChatGPT/Dall-E, 2024.”">
</p>

<p>Or how about this character?</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/052.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same image with the coffee cup removed, revealing a third hand.">
</p>

<p>He’s hiding a third hand.</p>

<p>My point is that these tools are never going to be as good as the people selling them want you to believe. They’ll get better, but they won’t be perfect.</p>

<p>The problems with image generation are fairly obvious. The problems with AI in code are more subtle, and they come down to that tradeoff between speed of building and cost of maintenance.</p>

<p>You can build code quickly with AI, but getting it all to work together nicely is harder. If you’re using AI to write code, are you considering how you’ll maintain that code? Are you considering how you’re developing the skills of your junior engineers?</p>

<p>You can also build features that use AI, such as automatic content generators. It’s pretty easy to do, actually. But fine-tuning those prompts is tricky, and it takes a lot of manual effort to get them just right. Have you considered how you’ll keep those prompts up to date as the AI engines change out from under you? Have you thought about how you’ll find out when those fine-tuned prompts aren’t working like they’re supposed to?</p>


<h4>Slow Feedback Loops</h4>

<p>Ultimately, complexity comes from teams that prioritize building over maintaining, and the costs of doing so are devastating. Now let’s look at another source of muda: slow feedback loops.</p>

<p>Feedback loops are about how effectively developers can work. After an engineer makes a change, they have to check to see if that change did what they intended. How long does that take? That’s your feedback loop.</p>

<p>If it takes less than a second, then they can check every single change. Every line of code, even. This is what test-driven development is all about, and it’s an amazing way to work. Let me show you what it looks like.</p>



<p>QR Code: <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/s/nullables">Fast Tests</a></p>

<p>This is the full build for a real production system. The system is on the small side, but it’s over 12 years old, so it’s had the opportunity to accumulate some technical debt. Let’s see how long the build takes. Don’t look away—this won’t take long.</p>

<p>[play video]</p>

<p>That’s it! Just over eight seconds.</p>

<p>For context, most organizations I meet are happy with a build that takes eight <em>minutes</em>, not eight <em>seconds</em>, and most are much, much slower.

</p><p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/056.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A screen capture from the video, showing the “unit tests” portion of the build. The build ran 1,342 tests in 2.45 seconds, averaging 1.8ms per test.">
</p>

<p>A big part of the reason this build is so fast—or rather, why most builds are so slow—is the tests. Most teams have slow, brittle tests. This codebase has over 1300 tests, but they only take two and a half seconds.</p>

<p>Describing how to achieve these sorts of fast tests is a whole talk of its own, but I have a lot of material on this topic. You can find it at <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/s/nullables">jamesshore.com/s/nullables</a>, or just follow the QR code on the slides.</p>



<p>Eight seconds is a nice, fast build, but it’s actually still too slow for a great development experience. In a perfect world, we want engineers to be able to check their work at the speed of thought. If they can check every single line of code they write, as soon as they write it, finding bugs becomes easy: you make a change, run the build, and immediately find out if there was a mistake. There’s no need to debug because you know your mistake is in the line of code you just changed.</p>

<p>To get these kinds of results, you need your build to be less than five seconds—preferably less than one second. This isn’t a fantasy! It’s possible to do this with real production code. Let me show you:</p>

<p>[play video]</p>

<p>That’s less than half a second each time the build runs.</p>

<p>There are a few tricks here. First, the build automatically runs when the code is changed. Second, the build is written in a real programming language, and it stays in memory. It’s able to cache a bunch of information, such as the location and age of all the files, the relationships between files, and so forth. So when it detects a change, it doesn’t have to scan the file system again, and it only runs the tests on the code that’s changed.</p>

<p>[beat]</p>

<p>I have to be honest. Some of our code has these sorts of feedback loops. But for the systems with the most muda, it takes much longer than a second to get feedback. Sometimes it can take tens of minutes just to get the computer into a state where a manual test is even possible. So people don’t check every change. They batch up their work, test it all at once, and then have to go through long, tedious debugging sessions to figure out the cause of each error. Some errors aren’t caught at all. That leads to muda, and that’s why fast feedback loops are important.</p>


<h4>Deferred Maintenance</h4>

<p>A third issue that leads to muda is deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance is really a consequence of the other two problems. If the system was simple, you could upgrade critical dependencies easily. But most companies have a lot of complicated dependencies, and some of their updates require major rearchitectures.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the feedback loops were fast, you could make changes quickly and safely. But most companies’ feedback loops are slow, so making changes take a long time.</p>

<p>Major rearchitectures plus slow changes means that upgrading dependencies can take weeks or months of effort. Now you have to make tough prioritization decisions. Do we build an important new feature? Or do we upgrade a component for no visible benefit? Business partners often choose to defer the maintenance. I can’t really blame them. But that deferred maintenance compounds, things get even more expensive to upgrade...</p>

<p>What do you do about such a difficult set of problems? Complexity, slow feedback loops, deferred maintenance. These problems are common. Usually you hear people talking about “legacy systems” and “technical debt.” Whatever they call it, the underlying problem is the same: low internal quality. High muda.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>I’ve seen four approaches to fixing systems with low internal quality:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Big-bang rewrite</li>
	<li>Modular rewrite</li>
	<li>Change-driven rewrite</li>
	<li>Improve in place</li>
</ol>

<p>Be careful: The first two approaches are popular... and usually fail.</p>

</p>

<p>In the “big bang” rewrite, you start up a new team to write a new version of the software. Meanwhile, the old team keeps maintaining the old software: adding features, fixing bugs, and so forth. When the new software is done, the old software will be retired, and the new software will take its place.</p>

<p>In this slide, the old system is represented by the spaghetti in the top row, and the new system is represented by the clean, shiny dishes in the bottom row.</p>

</p>

<p>This sounds nice in theory, but what really happens is the rewrite always takes much longer than expected. Meanwhile, the original software keeps getting bigger and bigger, and the mess gets worse and worse, because people think it’s going to be thrown away.</p>

<p>The replacement keeps taking longer than expected. You’re spending twice as much money, because you’re running two teams, but not getting good results for your money. So the replacement is either cancelled or rushed out the door. Customers are unhappy because it doesn’t do everything the old system did, and your engineers are unhappy because, in the rush to get the replacement done, they made a mess. It’s better than the old system is, but not that much better. It’s going to need another rewrite soon.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>In other words, “big bang” rewrites are dangerous. They should be avoided.</p>

<p>Another option, not quite as common, is the modular rewrite.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/067.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Modular Rewrite (Dream).” It shows two teams converting a messy plate of spaghetti into a clean set of shiny dishes, one piece at a time.">
</p>

<p>A modular rewrite takes a big existing system and identifies pieces that can be split off and rewritten. Then each piece is rewritten, one at a time. This might be done by a separate team, but sometimes it’s done by the same team. Over time, the whole system is replaced, without the risk of a big-bang rewrite.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/068.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A variation of the previous slide labelled “Modular Rewrite (Reality).” Only the edges of the spaghetti have been converted into shiny dishes, and ugly connecting arrows go back and forth between the spaghetti and dishes.">
</p>

<p>But, as always, things are harder than expected. You end up chipping away at the easy edges of the system, but the big complicated core stays just as big and complicated as ever.</p>

<p>And, as always, other priorities intervene before you can finish. Now, instead of one complicated system, you have multiple complicated systems, all interfacing with each other in confusing ways. If you’re not careful, you end up with a bigger, uglier mess than you started with.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/070.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A repeat of the “Fixing Internal Quality” slide. The second bullet point, “Modular rewrite,” has also been crossed off.">
</p>

<p>Modular rewrites are safer than big-bang rewrites because they work in smaller pieces, but they suffer the same problem: everything is bigger and more complicated than expected, and if you stop part way, you’re left with a mess.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/071.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Change-Driven Rewrite.” It shows a single team converting a messy plate of spaghetti into a clean set of shiny dishes, but in very tiny steps. Only a small portion of the spaghetti has been converted. Two connecting arrows go back and forth between the spaghetti and the dishes.">
</p>

<p>The trick to a rewrite is to realize that you can never compete with features. Instead of establishing a rewrite team, continue with a single team. Instead of prioritizing rewrite work, continue to prioritize features and bug fixes.</p>

<p><em>But...</em> whenever you make a change, migrate the code you’re changing to the new system. Don’t describe it as a rewrite; it’s just part of the work to complete the new feature. This way, you don’t have to compete for budget, and you don’t have to justify the cost of the rewrite. You just do it as part of your normal work.</p>

<p>This approach is slow. It will take years to complete. But thanks to the Pareto Principle—the 80/20 rule, which says that 80% of the changes to the system will occur in 20% of the code—you don’t have to rewrite everything to see a benefit. You do need to commit to seeing it through, but it’s easier to do so when people aren’t breathing down your neck asking when the rewrite will be done.</p>

<p>In this approach, you don’t add a new team. You can still add people, if you want, but you add them to your existing team, and use them to develop new features... migrating code to the new system as you go.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/072.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Improve in Place.” It shows a single team gradually transforming a messy plate of spaghetti into a clean set of shiny dishes without creating a new system.">
</p>

<p>But even better than a rewrite is <em>not rewriting at all</em>. Instead, improve your existing system in place. As you work on features and bug fixes, add tests, clean up your automated build, and file off the rough edges. It will never be perfect, but the Pareto Principle will kick in, and the parts of the system you work with most often will be the parts you improve the most.</p>

<p>Remember that eight-second build I showed you? That’s a 12-year-old codebase, and it wasn’t always that smooth. Ten years ago, it was kind of a mess. But steady, consistent effort to improve it in place means that, today, it’s a pleasure to work in, and better than it’s ever been.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/073.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A repeat of the “Fixing Internal Quality” slide. The fourth bullet point, “Improve in place,” has been marked “BEST.”">
</p>

<p>If you have internal quality problems, improve your existing systems in place. That takes specialized skills, so you might need to hire people for those skills. Personally, I hired a bunch of Extreme Programming coaches, and we’re doing a lot of training.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can’t improve in place. If you want to change fundamental technologies, such as the programming language a system uses, or a core framework, you may not be able to improve the existing system. In that case, you can do a change-driven rewrite, and migrate code to a new system as part of your work on the old system.</p>

<p>Modular and big-bang rewrites can work, but they’re dangerous. Modular rewrites risk leaving you with a bigger, more complicated mess than before. Big bang rewrites risk leaving you with a half-baked product and angry customers. Although they can work, the risk is high, and I don’t recommend them.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/074.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide summarizing the “Internal Quality” topic. It has four major points, each with sub-bullets. The first point is, “Simplify your technology stack,” with the sub-bullet “Focus on cost of maintenance, not cost to build.” The second point is, “Improve feedback loops,” with the sub-bullets “Incremental builds,” “Fast tests,” and “Test-driven development.” The third point is, “Stop deferring maintenance,” with the sub-bullet “Don’t let it be a prioritization decision.” The final point is, “Fix existing systems,” with the sub-bullets “Improve in place where possible” and “Use change-driven rewrites where not.”">
</p>

<p>If we were the best product engineering org in the world, our software would be easy to modify and maintain, we’d have no bugs, and we’d have no downtime.</p>

<p>If only that were true. We’re looking at three things:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><em>Simplifying our technology stack.</em> We’re focusing on the cost of maintenance instead of the cost to build.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>Improving our feedback loops.</em> We’re building systems that allow developers to check their work in less than five seconds, preferably less than a second, and introducing test-driven development.</p></li>

	<li><p><em>No longer deferring maintenance.</em> When a dependency has a new version, we want to upgrade it immediately. Don’t wait. Don’t allow it to be a prioritization decision. Make it a requirement and stop the line. We’re not there yet, but as our technology stack becomes simpler and our developer experience better, those upgrades will get easier.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And for the existing systems, where it’s not as easy as we’d like, we’re avoiding big rewrites. We’re improving our systems in place, where possible, and undertaking a change-driven rewrites where not.</p>


<h3 id="lovability">Lovability</h3>

</p>

<p>Jeff Patton is here this week! He’s giving tomorrow’s keynote, and from previous experience, I can tell you that he’s not to be missed.</p>

<p>Jeff can tell you much more about making software people love than I can. So I’m going to talk about how we make time to put Jeff’s ideas into practice.</p>

<p>We just talked about internal quality and reducing muda. The better your software’s internal quality, the faster your teams will go. So investments in internal quality are easy: as much as you can afford. The main challenge is managing cash flows and balancing that investment with forward progress.</p>

<p>Lovability is <em>external</em> quality. It’s about building software that our users, buyers, and internal stakeholders love. We’re going to put all our remaining capacity towards external quality. But there are <em>always</em> more ideas than time to build them all. So lovability is <em>also</em> about understanding what stakeholders really need and putting our limited capacity toward what matters most.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>People have understood this for a long time. Back in the days before Agile, companies would put immense amounts of effort into requirements analysis in order to make sure they were building the right thing. They would analyze the market, define exactly what to build, and then build it.</p>

<p>Those of you who weren’t around in the 90’s might think this “waterfall” idea is just a fable—a straw man trotted out by Agile proponents to prove that they’re better than the old way. Surely no one <em>really</em> worked that way!</p>

<p>But they did... and a lot of companies <em>still do.</em></p>

<p>They say they’re “Agile,” but when you look at how they plan, what they actually do is... analyze the market, decide exactly what to build, and then build it. The only difference is that they don’t make requirements documents any more. Instead, they make Jiras. They chop up their requirements documents into lots of itty-bitty pieces, and then they move those pieces around a lot.</p>

Build the plan; 2. Work the plan; 3. Track progress vs. plan.” Success is defined as “On Time, On Budget, and As Specified.”">
</p>

<p>This approach is called “project-based governance.” You create a plan, then you work the plan. If you execute the plan perfectly, coming in on time, on budget, and as specified, you’re going to be successful.</p>

<p>At least, that’s the theory.</p>

<p>As Ryan Nelson wrote in CIO Magazine in 2006:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Projects that were found to meet all of the traditional criteria for success—time, budget, and specifications—may still be failures in the end because they fail to appeal to the intended users or because they ultimately fail to add much value to the business… Similarly, projects considered failures according to traditional IT metrics may wind up being successes because despite cost, time or specification problems, the system is loved by its target audience or provides unexpected value.</p>
	<p>CIO Magazine, Sep 2006</p>

It closes with “$170 million spent; $104.5 million ‘completely unrecoverable.’”">
</p>

<p>One of my favorite stories about how this approach fails is the FBI’s “Virtual Case File” system, because there was a US Senate investigation, and we have a lot of details about what happened. It’s unusual in how high-profile it was, but the story is very typical of its time.</p>

<p>In June 2001, the FBI launched the Virtual Case File project.</p>

<p>17 months later, they had established “solid requirements.” Seventeen months! They knew exactly what their users needed—or thought they knew—and had a detailed plan.</p>

<p>A year after that, the project was delivered, and it didn’t work. The FBI “immediately discovered a number of deficiencies in VCF that made it unusable.”</p>

<p>In 2005, it was officially cancelled, and the director of the FBI appeared before a Senate subcommittee to explain how the FBI had managed to waste $104.5 million of taxpayers’ money.</p>

<p>The problem wasn’t that the software didn’t function; the problem was that all that detailed planning resulted in the wrong thing. The software didn’t meet the FBI’s needs.</p>

</p>

<p>Before you say, “that was then... <em>we’re</em> Agile,” look at this list again. How does your company manage projects? Do they define success as delivering on time, on budget, and as specified? Do they ask you to prepare a plan, and then track progress against that plan?</p>

</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that we can’t predict what our customers and users really want. We can only <em>guess</em>. Some of those guesses are right; some are wrong. We have to conduct experiments to find out which ones are really worth pursuing.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/083.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A picture of Eric Evans’ “Build-Measure-Learn” loop. It shows “Ideas” proceeding to “Build” proceeding to “Code.” “Code” proceeds to “Measure” proceeds to “Data.” Finally, “Data” proceeds to “Learn” back to “Ideas.” The center of the loop is labelled “Minimize total time through the loop.”">
</p>

<p>One of my favorite expressions of this idea is Eric Evans’ “Build, Measure, Learn” loop. We have an idea about what customers might love. We build a simple experiment that lets us test that idea—the smallest, simplest experiment we can think of! It might not even be code. It might just be interviews, surveys, or Figma prototypes.</p>

<p>Then we conduct the experiment and see what data comes out of it. We learn from that data and that improves our ideas of what we should build next.</p>

<p>This loop is where the idea of “Minimum Viable Product” comes from. But it’s often misunderstood. Minimum Viable Product isn’t the smallest thing we can deliver to customers; it’s the smallest <em>test</em> we can perform to <em>learn</em> what we’re <em>going to deliver</em> to customers. Those tests can be <em>very</em> small. Because the faster we can get through this loop, the more we can learn, and the less time we waste on failed ideas.</p>

Build-Measure-Learn; 2. Iterate quickly; 3. Track return on investment.” Success is defined as “Delighted customers/partners/users” and “Business impact.”">
</p>

<p>This leads to <em>product-based governance</em>. Rather than creating a plan and working the plan, we iterate on a series of very small plans. If we learn and change our plans, we can steer our way to success.</p>

<p>Success means delighting our stakeholders, and doing so in a way that impacts the business.</p>

<p>We aren’t tracking adherence to plan, but rather, return on investment.</p>

</p>

<p>Adapting plans is one of the key ideas of Agile, of course. Martin Fowler describes the essence of Agile this way:</p>

<p>“Agile development is adaptive rather than predictive; people-oriented rather than process-oriented.”</p>

<p>So now that Agile’s taken over the world, and just about everybody’s using some flavor of Scrum, we’re all able to adapt our plans, right?</p>

<p>I’d like to say that’s true... but we know it’s not, don’t we.</p>

<p>There are a lot of companies saying they do Agile, or Scrum, and they’re not either of these things. They predict rather than adapt, and they orient around process rather than people. And if you’re not adaptive, if you’re not people-oriented... you’re not Agile, no matter how many Scrummasters, Sprints, or standups you have.</p>

</p>

<p>The build-measure-learn loop and adapting your plans is important at a tactical level. But what about big-picture strategy? At my company, strategy is decided by our Leadership team, which consists of our CEO and heads of Product, Marketing, Sales, Partners, Content, Finance, and so forth.</p>

<p>Alignment at this level is critical. Each person has their own view of their world, and their own theories about what’s needed for success. Product wants to improve usability. Marketing and Sales want splashy new features. Finance wants to reduce manual billing. Each person has their own view of the world, and their own theories about what’s needed for success. How do you balance those competing concerns? How do you allocate engineering’s limited capacity?</p>

<p>We’re trying something we call “product bets.”</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/087.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Product Bets.” It says, “Increase vampire sales with an AI-powered night salesperson.” The remaining details are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>A Product Bet is a big-picture hypothesis. For example, our head of sales might say, “A lot of our customers are vampires. We can close a lot more deals if we introduce an AI-powered salesperson that’s available at night.”</p>

<p>(I’ll tell you a secret. Our customers aren’t actually vampires. I have to keep the specifics of our situation confidential. They could be werewolves.)</p>

<p>Product bets are proposed with a short, one-page summary of the hypothesis. It has a <em>thesis statement:</em> “Increase vampire sales with an AI-powered night salesperson.”</p>

<p>A <em>sponsor:</em> the head of sales.</p>

<p>The <em>value</em> we expect to gain, which is typically linked to spreadsheet with a financial model.</p>

<p>A summary of the <em>reasoning</em> for the value: Vampires spend $80mm on services like ours. Many of them use their human servants to do their shopping, but if we sell to them directly, they’ll be more likely to buy, and we’ll increase our market share among vampires by at least one percent.</p>

<p>And finally, a <em>wager</em>, which is the maximum amount of money we’re willing to spend on this bet.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/088.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Bets Lead to Objections.” It shows several objections that are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>Other members of the leadership team have their own priorities and bets, so naturally, they’re going to come up with objections.</p>

<p>The head of Content might say, “Shopping is beneath vampires. That’s what they have human servants for.”</p>

<p>The head of Marketing might say, “AI isn’t good enough to do sales.”</p>

<p>The head of Finance might say, “That’s going to cost a lot more than $400K.”</p>

<p>We want these objections. We want an open and honest dialog between members of the Leadership team, picking holes in the bets and finding ways to make them stronger.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/089.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Objections Lead to Experiments.” It says, “Vampires have human servants to do their shopping. It’s beneath them.” The remaining details are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>Ultimately, if a bet is chosen, those objections lead to experiments. “Shopping is beneath vampires? Let’s find out!”</p>

<p>Our <em>hypothesis</em> is that vampires will actually feel appreciated by us having vampire-friendly hours.</p>

<p>We want to test hypothesis as quickly and cheaply as possible, so we don’t build software; we <em>“build”</em> by temporarily moving some salespeople to a night shift.</p>

<p>Then we <em>measure</em> the difference in vampire sales.</p>

<p>Let’s say we got five times as many sales. That’s a clear win.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/090.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="Another slide labelled “Objections Lead to Experiments.” This one says, “AI isn’t good enough to do sales.” The remaining details are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>Our next objection is that AI isn’t good enough to do sales.</p>

<p>Our <em>hypothesis</em> is that no, it’s not going to be as good, but it’s going to be good enough.</p>

<p>Again, we want to test that hypothesis with the minimum effort possible, so we still don’t build software. Instead, we <em>build</em> a custom prompt in ChatGPT for the human night shift to use. Some salespeople use ChatGPT and follow the script; others continue as they were. We <em>measure</em> the difference.

</p><p>In this case, let’s say the sales decreased from 5x as many sales to 2x as many. What did we learn? A night shift is a great idea, but AI-driven sales isn’t. We change our plans, and decide to build a permanent human night shift <em>instead</em> of using AI.</p>

<p>And now we’ve saved nearly 400 thousand dollars of investment. We spent a little bit of time and money on bonuses for the sales people who participated in the night shift, and some on the custom ChatGPT prompt, but much less than we would have spent on building the full solution.</p>

</p>

<p>Ultimately, we want our Leadership team to align around strategy. Product bets are our tool for doing so.</p>

<p>I have to be honest. Getting adoption on this idea has been very slow, and we’re still rolling it out. So, of all the things I’m presenting today, this one is the most experimental, and the one to be most careful about adopting yourselves.</p>

<p>But if it works out, it won’t just be a tool for strategic prioritization. It will also be a tool for Leadership to think critically about their ideas, and a way to generate hypotheses for us to test using the Build-Measure-Learn loop.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>If we were the best product engineering org in the world, our users, customers, and internal consumers would love our products. But even more, we would understand what our stakeholders need and put our limited capacity where it matters most.</p>

<p>First, we need to achieve strategic alignment at the leadership level. We’re starting to use product bets for that. They’re not just for prioritization, though. They’re also a way to think critically about our plans and generate hypotheses that we can test.</p>

<p>Second, we need to validate those bets and adapt our plans based on what we learn. We’re using product-based governance that focuses on impact rather than adherence to plan, and we’re using the build-measure-learn loop to test our hypotheses as quickly and cheaply as possible, preferably without building software at all.</p>

<p>Given limited capacity—and there’s <em>always</em> limited capacity—there will be winners and losers in the prioritization game. Some people will be happy about the amount of time they’ve gotten from Engineering, and some will be sad. Even angry.</p>

<p>Transparency is vital for building trust with internal stakeholders. Where are we spending our time, and why? We send out regular reports, but that isn’t enough. We also have to talk to people, understand their perspective, share what’s going on and why.</p>

<p>And even if you do all that, there will still be people who are unhappy. As we say in the US, you can’t please all the people all the time.</p>

<p>I have to admit: I don’t have a lot of good answers about how to build trust. I chose the company I’m in now because I <em>already</em> had their trust. I’d worked with the founders before, 15 years ago. They knew what they were getting, and what I bring was what they wanted.</p>

<p>Even so, the founders’ trust didn’t automatically extend to the rest of the Leadership team. A lot had changed in 15 years, and nobody else knew me.</p>

<p>In fact, what the founders and I wanted, and what the rest of Leadership wanted, weren’t in alignment. We wanted product-based governance and Build-Measure-Learn. But they wanted predictability. The way they judged trustworthiness was simple: was Engineering doing what they said they would do? In other words, did we ship on time?</p>

<p>And the answer was “no.” Engineering was <em>not</em> shipping on time.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/095.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A repeat of the “Build-Measure-Learn” slide.">
</p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons Engineering wasn’t shipping on time. We didn’t have a good approach to forecasting, to begin with. But even we did, predictability wasn’t something I was planning to bring to the organization. <em>Predictability</em> is the realm of project-based governance. I was planning to introduce
	<em>product</em>-based governance.</p>

<p>Product-based governance can be frustrating to people who want predictability. Because we don’t know what we’ll do <em>here</em> [motions to “Build” step] until we know what happened <em>here</em> [motions to “Learn” step].</p>

<p>We can predict how long it will take us to get through a single loop, but we can’t predict what the next loop will look like.</p>

<p>Well, we could, but that would mean we didn’t learn anything, and if we didn’t learn anything, we’re not producing as much value as we could.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/098.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A screen shot from the movie “War Games.” It shows a computer terminal. On the terminal is the phrase: “Hello. A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.”">
</p>

<p>So, as another classic American saying has it, “the only winning move is not to play.”</p>

<p>...How about a nice game of chess?</p>

<p>One of the first things I did after joining the company was to introduce a more rigorous approach to forecasting. This approach requires gathering a lot of data, and while that was happening, I told my teams to stop making predictions to stakeholders.</p>

<p>This wasn’t popular with my stakeholders.</p>

<p>It’s not that they needed the predictions for any purpose. Predictions were being used as a political weapon. “You <em>promised</em> this would be done!” “Well, we had to set it aside, because the Leadership team decided we should work on this other thing.” “It doesn’t matter—you <em>promised</em> it would be done, and this is more important to me than that other thing they decided on!”</p>

<p>In other words, predictions were causing more harm than good.</p>

<p>The new forecasting approach is in place now, but we’re still not providing dates. Instead, we’re providing time ranges: “Historically, a valuable increment of this size has taken between two and six weeks.”</p>

<p>But we’re not predicting dates, because we don’t know when the work will start. As an example, one of my stakeholders has a project that’s very important to him. It keeps getting delayed by other priorities, and he’s upset about that. So he asks me, “when will it be done?” And I say, “2-6 weeks after it starts.” And he says, “so when will it start?” And I say, “that’s up to the Leadership team to decide. We’re ready to start as soon as they say ‘go.’”</p>

<p>He’s still unhappy, but now he’s unhappy with the prioritization process, and putting his effort into influencing prioritization decisions, which I’m going to call a win.</p>

</p>

<p>QR Code: <a href="https://www.agilefluency.org/game.php">Agile Fluency Game</a></p>

<p>People really want date predictions. The reason I can get away with not providing them is that the CEO, CTO, and Chief Product Officer are on my side. They understand the value of adaptive planning, and they trust my leadership. It’s the reason I’m working there. I was consultant for 23 years prior to joining this company, and was looking for companies to join for <em>five years</em> prior to choosing this one. I chose them because I knew I would get this level of support.</p>

<p>One way the CEO is supporting me is that he invited me to give a presentation about Agile at one of our quarterly Leadership retreats. It’s normal for me to attend these retreats, but for this one, I was given a full <em>four hours</em> out of the schedule to use as I please.</p>

<p>I used the time to explain muda and the reasons for our capacity constraints. I talked about product-based governance and many of the things we’ve discussed today. And, most importantly, I had them sit down and play a game.</p>

<p>In that game, which is called the Agile Fluency Game, participants experience what it’s like to be part of a team that’s adopting Agile for the first time. There are a lot of different lessons in the game, but one of the biggest is the cost of maintenance. If you aren’t careful about managing your maintenance costs, you’ll go out of business. Before you do, you’ll have several uncomfortable rounds struggling to make progress while all your spare capacity is spent on muda.</p>

<p>In other words, exactly the problem we were facing.</p>

<p>That opportunity turned things around for me at the company. I wouldn’t say I have everyone’s trust yet. But I do have their respect and understanding. They understand why Engineering isn’t giving them what they want, they understand why we’re focused on adapting our plans, and they respect my ability to improve it... or at least, the founders’ trust in me.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/101.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A cute image of a chibi programmer working on a spreadsheet while a variety of people watch intently.">
</p>

<p>I still have a long way to go. In 2025, we’re putting more emphasis on product bets and strategic planning. As part of that work, I’ll be working with the leadership team to create financial models of the cost and value of each of those bets. I’ll be providing forecasts of the capacity available in each of our product collectives, and helping stakeholders understand how their prioritization decisions result in tradeoffs of engineering capacity.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that working together in this way will help us further develop the visibility and trust we need. It’s a long, slow process, but without trust, we can’t be successful.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/102.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide summarizing the “Visibility” topic. It has two major points, each with sub-bullets. The first point is, “Build trust,” with the sub-bullets “Identify your champions,” “Be transparent,” and “Educate stakeholders.” The second point is, “Stay adaptive,” with the sub-bullets “Prediction: The only winning move is not to play,” “Forecast based on actual results,” and “Don’t forecast start times.”">
</p>

<p>If we were the best product engineering organization in the world, our internal stakeholders would trust our decisions. I don’t think we’re there yet. Most of that comes down to unhappiness with our capacity, and with prioritization decisions.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m no political genius. Somebody who’s more clever than me can probably figure out a better way to build the trust we need. For me, though, it started with having champions in the organization who already trusted me; being transparent about our capacity challenges; and showing people why things were operating the way they were with a hands-on experience.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I’m staying true to our goals. People always want predictive, not adaptive approaches, and I’m holding firm on staying adaptive. I am providing forecasts, but I’m doing it by extrapolating from historical data that compares estimates to actual results. And even then, I’m only forecasting how long things will take <em>once they’ve started.</em> I’m not providing dates.</p>

<p>This is what’s working for me. Your situation is going to be very different, so I’m not suggesting that you follow this approach exactly... or even at all. For example, if your CEO doesn’t support adaptive planning the way mine does, you might need to make predictions. Please adapt <em>these</em> plans for <em>your</em> situation.</p>


<h3 id="agility">Agility</h3>

</p>

<p>If we’re going to adapt our plans and follow that build-measure-learn loop, we need the technical ability to do so. There are two aspects to this: tactical and strategic.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/105.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide comparing waterfall, Scrum, and Extreme Programming lifecycles. “Waterfall” shows the phases, “Plan, Analyze, Design, Code, Test, Deploy.” “Scrum” shows the same phases, but repeated in short cycles. “Extreme Programming” shows the same short cycles as Scrum, but the phases are performed simultaneously and continuously, not sequentially.">
</p>

<p>From a tactical perspective, most engineers don’t know how to design software incrementally. Most software development education still comes from a waterfall perspective, which assumes time spent on analysis and design before coding.</p>

<p>If you break up their work into short Sprints, they’re going to create mini waterfalls, where they do a little bit of planning, a little bit of design, a little bit of programming, and a little bit of testing. They won’t have enough time to do the design and test work that they really need to do. They’ll struggle to create a cohesive design, and they’ll struggle with bugs. If you adapt your plans frequently—as you should!—it becomes even harder. Your internal quality will suffer. Muda will rise.</p>

<p>To be successful in an adaptive environment, you need to be able to keep your design and code clean at all times. Extreme Programming practices such as evolutionary design, merciless refactoring, and test-driven development allow you to test, code, and design
<em>simultaneously,</em> so you always have enough time for design and testing, even if you’re using short Sprints.</p>

<p>In other words, before we can have <em>business</em> agility, we need to have <em>technical</em> agility. This is where Extreme Programming shines, and it’s why I’m hiring for XP skills at my company.</p>

</p>

<p>There’s also a strategic component to supporting business agility. As our business strategy changes, the amount of investment we put into this product or that product changes. Our ability to respond to those changes depends on how we organize our teams.</p>

<p>The “classic” way to organize software teams is functionally. A front-end team here, a back-end team there, a database team over there. I think we know the problems this causes by now. In order to deliver any value, we have to coordinate all four teams. It leads to delays and errors. Muda.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/107.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “BizDevSecDataKitchenSinkOps.” It shows a large number of people. In the corner, a chibi character lugs a kitchen sink on his back with tears running down his face.">
</p>

<p>Agile teams are cross-functional. We create teams that can own an entire portion of a product: product <em>and</em> the front-end <em>and</em> the back-end <em>and</em> the database <em>and</em> operations <em>and</em> security. We could call that “BizDevSecDataKitchenSinkOps.”</p>

<p>Well, in theory. In practice, it’s hard to fit that many people into a single team. So we end up having to divide people amongst teams. The most popular book on this subject is called "Team Topologies."</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/108.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide showing the cover of the book “Team Topologies.” It lists four types of teams: Stream-aligned teams, Enabling teams, Complicated-subsystem teams, and platform teams.">
</p>

<p>Team Topologies provides ways of organizing teams so you can keep them small—seven or so people in each team—while still keeping them autonomous and focused on delivering value.</p>

<p>We have stream-aligned teams, which is what we really want, and then we have enabling teams, complicated-subsystem teams, and platform teams as a way of working around the fact that we can’t really have what we want with such small teams.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/110.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide showing four teams: “Legacy Money-Maker,” “Big Future Bet,” “Market Expansion,” and “Far Future Bet.”">
</p>

<p>So if we have too many people for one team, we divide them into multiple teams.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we’re at a company with four products: the legacy money-maker, a big bet on the future, a way of expanding into new markets, and a bet on the far future. We can create a stream-aligned team for each product.</p>

<p>But now we have a problem. Some of these teams are still way too big.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/111.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same slide with the “Legacy Money-Maker” and “Big Future Bet” teams broken up into smaller teams. Red arrows show dependencies between the smaller teams.">
</p>

<p>Team Topologies says to split these teams up further. Depending how you design the teams, this can work pretty well. I’ve used this approach many times myself.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/112.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Team Topologies Issues.” The contents are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>But over time, I’ve found several problems with the Team Topologies approach.</p>

<p>First, everyone is so isolated to their teams, silos form. In my experience, people barely interact across teams, even in the same product. This makes it difficult to succeed at cross-team initiatives, and hard to move people between teams.</p>

<p>Second, teams are rigid. When business needs change, adding and removing people from teams is a problem. Because teams are limited in size, new business needs often require you to reorganize your teams, which is a huge disruption. Often, Engineering resists the reorg, leaving their business partners frustrated, because effort isn’t being directed at their highest priorities.</p>

<p>Third, specialties such as user experience, security, and operations, are spread too thin. You don’t need a full time person on every team, but having people work part time on each team doesn’t work either. It leads to constant task switching, which makes it difficult for people to focus and wastes a lot of time.</p>

<p>And fourth, the teams often aren’t <em>really</em> independent. When you have a legacy codebase, it usually has to be shared across multiple teams, and no team really wants to own it. Quality degrades further as people focus on the code they do own.</p>

<p>We need to build in another direction. We need to build up, not out.</p>

</p>

<p>When people thinking about adding a lot of people to Engineering, they usually think about adding more teams, but that’s just one way to scale: <em>horizontal scaling.</em> You can also make teams bigger. That’s <em>vertical scaling.</em></p>

<p>Vertical scaling allows you to remove the complexities of Team Topologies and...</p>

</p>

<p>...return to one value stream per product.</p>

<p>My favorite way to do this is an approach called FaST.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/116.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="An image showing a group of people on the left and several stickies in the top right. One group of four stickies is labelled “In Progress” and another group of two stickies is labelled “Up Next.”">
</p>

<p>QR Code: <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/presentations/2022/fast-an-innovative-way-to-scale">FaST</a></p>

<p>FaST was invented by Quentin Quartel. It stands for “Fluid Scaling Technology.” You can learn more at fastagile.io, and I have several in-depth presentations on my website, which you can find by following this QR code. There’s also a session on FaST at this conference later today! Yoshiki Iida and Takeo Imai will be speaking in room C at 3:15.</p>

<p>Here’s how FaST works.</p>

<p>First, everybody gathers together in a big room. All the teams I’ve used FaST with have been remote, so we use a videoconference and Miro, a collaborative whiteboarding tool.</p>

<p>The meeting starts with announcements, then team leaders from the previous cycle, called stewards, describe what their teams have worked on since the last FaST meeting, two or three days ago.</p>

<p>Next, product leaders describe their business priorities.</p>

<p>On your whiteboard, you’ll have a set of high-level priorities. My teams work in terms of valuable increments, which are things we can release that bring value to our organization. You can see that some increments are in progress, and some are waiting to be started.</p>

<p>When product leads describe their business priorities, they’re describing how these have changed. Usually it’s just a quick, "no changes." But if something has changed, a product lead will explain what has changed and why.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/119.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same image again, but now four people have volunteered to lead teams. They have stickies showing what their teams will work on: “Reticulate the splines,” “Hunt for grues,” “Reverse entropy,” and “Transect encabulator.”">
</p>

<p>Next, team members volunteer to steward a team. Anybody can steward a team, but most teams are stewarded by engineers. The maximum number of stewards is limited to ensure each team has about 3-5 people on it.</p>

<p>Each steward describes what their team is going to work on. The stewards are expected to work on something that advances the collective’s business priorities, but they use their own judgment on what that is. Most of the time, it will be feature work, but it can also be things like improving the build or cleaning up noisy logs. Usually, they’re a continuation from the previous cycle.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/120.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The next stage of the same image. Now all the people have moved to join the four teams shown in the previous image.">
</p>

<p>Finally, people self-select onto the teams, based on what they want to work on, what they want to learn, and who they want to work with. Ultimately, they’re expected to do what’s best for the organization. Most of the time, they’ll continue with the same team as the previous cycle.</p>

<p>And that’s the FaST meeting. It takes 10-20 minutes, and it’s really all there is to FaST. It’s a way of having a single large group of people work together collectively by dynamically breaking into teams every few days. It’s simple, it’s fast, and it’s effective.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/best-product-engineering-org/121.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Team Topologies Issues: Solved!” The contents are described in the following text.">
</p>

<p>FaST completely solves the issues I’ve seen with Team Topologies. I’ve stopped using Team Topologies in favor of just having large product teams.</p>

<p>First, when you have lots of small teams, it’s hard to plan work that involves multiple teams. With FaST, you have larger teams, so cross-team initiatives are much less likely. We haven’t had any at my company since we started using FaST over a year ago.</p>

<p>Second, Team Topologies has trouble with big business priority changes. That’s not a problem with FaST—the "F" stands for "Fluid," and it’s really true. People dynamically adjust to whatever we need. It’s incredibly responsive, too—if there’s an urgent need, we bring it to the next FaST meeting, which happens twice a week. People form a team around it and go! We just have to be careful to manage priorities and minimize work in progress. I’m constantly reminding the product managers that it’s better to finish work than to start it.</p>

<p>Third, when you have small teams, specialists tend to get spread across multiple teams, leading to a lot of frustration and task switching. That isn’t an issue with FaST because the collectives are large enough that each one can have a dedicated specialist. They self-select into whatever work needs to be done.</p>

<p>And finally, shared code is no longer an issue because because you can combine the teams that share code into a single collective.</p>

<p>FaST isn’t perfect, and there are some real challenges with moving to FaST. If you’re interested in trying it, come talk to me about those challenges, or watch my presentations about it. But I haven’t seen anything better for solving the team organization problems that occur at scale in engineering organizations.</p>

</p>

<p>If we were the best product engineering organization in the world, we would seek out opportunities to change our plans. We would work in small pieces and adjust our strategy based on what we learned. To do that, we not only need the business agility we’ve already discussed, we need technical agility. Specifically:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Extreme Programming practices, which allow us to change direction without creating a technical mess.</p></li>
	<li><p>FaST, which allows teams to shift fluidly in response to changing business needs.</p></li>

</p>

<p>Profitability is last on the list for reason. If we take care of our people, if we take care of our internal quality, if we take care of our customers and users, if we take care of our internal stakeholders, and if we are responsive to changes in the market... we will be profitable.</p>

<p>Almost.</p>

<p>We have to remember that the only way we can take care of our people, our customers, our users, and everyone else... is if we stay in business. It’s not enough to build great software. We also have to build it to be sold, to be cost effective, and to be put into production.</p>

<p>There’s a funny paradox about engineering. Great engineering doesn’t seem to be heavily correlated with success. In my career as a consultant, I met a lot of companies that were really struggling from an engineering perspective, but were still very successful from a business perspective. That’s because, no matter how much of a mess they were under the covers, they served the needs of the business.</p>

</p>

<p>Here are a bunch of departments you might see in a business-to-business product company. Each of them directly contribute to the company’s yearly revenue.</p>

<p><em>Marketing</em> generates leads—people who might want to buy your software—for your Sales department. They’re judged on the number of qualifying leads they create.</p>

<p><em>Partners</em> also generates leads, or even sales, from people who are using complementary software. They’re judged on the revenue partners generate.</p>

<p><em>Sales</em> converts leads into paying customers. They’re judged on the new revenue they generate.</p>

<p><em>Customer Success</em> takes care of your customers. They’re judged on customer retention and upsell rates.</p>

</p>

<p>So what does product engineering do?</p>

<p>[beat]</p>

<p><em>We create new opportunities.</em> Let’s say that the trajectory of your company is to grow its annual revenue by $10mm per year. Our job is to increase that rate of growth, to $12, $15, $20mm per year. Every time we ship a new feature, we should be increasing that rate of growth.</p>

Sentences describing how product engineering helps them grow have been added. (Those sentences are described in the following text.)">
</p>

<p>Our features should open up new markets, allowing Marketing to generate more leads.</p>

<p>We should provide useful APIs, allowing Partners to build new relationships.</p>

<p>We should respond to market trends, allowing Sales to convert more leads.</p>

<p>And we should fix the problems that get in customers’ way, reducing churn and increasing upsell.</p>

<p>Every dollar invested into engineering should be reflected in permanent improvements to the value your company creates. It may not be dollars or yen; it may be helping to cure malaria or fighting climate change. But however you define value, the purpose of product engineering is to change that trajectory for the better.</p>

</p>

<p>If we were the best product engineering organization in the world, we would build our products to be sold. We would work closely with our internal stakeholders to ensure our products were ready for the real world of sales, marketing, content, support, partners, accounting, and every other aspect of our business. We would plan for observability and operability, for outages and data security. We would build software that changes the trajectory of our business.</p>

The categories are: People, Internal Quality, Lovability, Visibility, Agility, and Profitability.">
</p>

<p>And we would do it by having the best people in the business; having such high internal quality that changes were easy and bugs were rare; focusing our efforts on the changes that would make the most difference for our users and customers; having the trust of our internal stakeholders; and seeking out new opportunities and adapting our strategy.</p>

<p>Are we the best product engineering organization in the world? No. We’re not. But we would like to be. And we’re never going to stop improving.</p>

<p>I hope these ideas will help your companies continue to improve as well. Thank you for listening.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<details>
  <summary>It was made to create the smallest "fun" game possible.</summary>
  
<p dir="auto">For the people mentioning jinX's snake64 I'd note that without disparaging the achievement made by jinX, his implementation does not obey the same restrictions mine does: In his version, the snake can go through the right side directly to the left side but not from top to bottom, food items randomly spawn so there could be 30 simultaneously, some random pixels are turning white, you need to use 4, 6, 8, 2 keys to move instead of the arrows, you must start the game with downwards movement or it crashes, you have to <code>clear</code> the screen before starting the game, you have to initialize the correct video mode ahead, when you go through the top and supposed to lose you can just go back down, and as jinX stated "It will not work if you run a game from DOSBox terminal. It requires 0 (or 50h, 80h, 0D0h...) value in port 60h on start."</p>
<p dir="auto">For the countless people saying I'm intentionally not mentioning the <em>Hugi Size Coding Competition</em> (a competition in which the competitors had to make the smallest nibbles game to win) here is my reply to one such comment (from when the game was still 133 bytes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Firstly, it seems that you didn't even read the rules of the "Nibbles" game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">in the inside of this border  a  "snake"  is  supposed  to grow,  whose size  is  one  pixel at the beginning. after starting the program, the snake's size shall grow one pixel more in each repetition  of the program's main-loop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Which is simply not the same as snake and a <strong>lot</strong> less difficult to implement.</p>
<p dir="auto">Secondly, the implementations from this competition have flaws (not that they're not good but I'm saying it doesn't make my version bad) like, for example from the comments in the winning entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">game can't handle any other keys but keypad arrow keys, you need to start it by typing pause|nibbles in DOS prompt and then hitting an arrow key</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">and</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Because top memory segment in PSP is environment dependant[sic] you need version suitable for your environment</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">and it doesn't even work on DOSBox because of some special configurations needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the second place entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When starting this program, press the 2 (DOWN) key __IMMEDIATELY__</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">And it too won't work without setting the cycle count and changing it sometimes breaks the game</p>
<p dir="auto">As for the third place</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">press  '8','4','6' but not '2' once game begins immediately</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">and the game breaks in the same way the second place does (and needs the same cycle adjusting) but the walls are also broken.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'll look at the fourth place entry and stop wasting my time doing this,</p>
<p dir="auto">Well, just looked at it and couldn't make it to boot</p>
<p dir="auto">And lastly, what place is your entry to the competition? Before you criticize other people first check your criticism is correct and try doing it yourself before you judge.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks for the feedback anyways :)</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S. I didn't even claim my version was ideal, the main point of the post was asking for help, and this comment actually made me feel better about my implementation in a way, as in an actual size optimization competition someone had a submission of 121 bytes for just a line extending over the screen and my entire snake game (which obviously contains this functionality just as a small part of the entire program) takes only 12 bytes more now, and if I can fix the PR only 7 bytes more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">AFAIK This is the smallest snake game ever made.</p>
