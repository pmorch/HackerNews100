BirdyChat is now the first chat app in Europe that can exchange messages with WhatsApp under the Digital Markets Act. This brings us closer to our mission of giving work conversations a proper home.</p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">WhatsApp is currently rolling out interoperability support across Europe. As this rollout continues, the feature will become fully available to both BirdyChat and WhatsApp users in the coming months.</p></div></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">Why this matters</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">Until now, you could only message people who already had a BirdyChat account. If someone was not on the app, they had to download it before you could talk. It slowed down adoption and made it harder to move real work conversations into BirdyChat.</p><div><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">With the new WhatsApp interface mandated by the DMA, any BirdyChat user in the EEA will be able to start a chat with any WhatsApp user in the region simply by knowing their phone number. Your contacts keep using WhatsApp. You stay on BirdyChat. Messages flow both ways.</p></div><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">This removes a big barrier to adopting BirdyChat for work. You no longer need to ask people to switch apps. You can keep work neatly organised in BirdyChat while staying connected to everyone who still relies on WhatsApp.</p></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">What interoperability lets you&nbsp;do</h2></p><div data-framer-name="Text" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">Interoperability lets you:</p><ul data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q"><li><p>Start 1:1 chats with WhatsApp users using their phone number</p></li><li><p>Send messages, photos and files</p></li><li><p>Communicate over an encrypted connection</p></li><li><p>Use your work email as your identity instead of a personal phone number</p></li></ul><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">This makes it much easier to keep work and personal life separate while staying fully reachable.</p></div></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">How the integration works</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">WhatsApp introduced Third-Party Chats in Europe earlier this year. BirdyChat connects through this official DMA interface and does not use any workarounds. All communication between BirdyChat and WhatsApp users is end-to-end encrypted.</p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">Currently, BirdyChat supports 1:1 chats, with group chat interoperability coming in a future update.</p></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">Availability</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">This feature will roll out gradually to BirdyChat users across the European Economic Area. For interoperability to work, both you and your WhatsApp contacts need to be based in the EEA. Since WhatsApp is releasing interoperability as part of a gradual rollout, availability may differ slightly from country to country.</p></div></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">Get early access</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">BirdyChat is invite-only while we scale access.

You can set the proxy URL in the <code>http_proxy</code> (<a href="https://github.com/Narfinger">@Narfinger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41209">#41209</a>) or <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> (<a href="https://github.com/treeshateorcs">@treeshateorcs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41268">#41268</a>) environment variables, or via <code>--pref network_http_proxy_uri</code>.</p>
<p>We now use the <strong>system root certificates</strong> by default (<a href="https://github.com/Narfinger">@Narfinger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40935">#40935</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41179">#41179</a>), on most platforms.
If you don’t want to trust the system root certificates, you can instead continue to use Mozilla’s root certificates with <code>--pref network_use_webpki_roots</code>.
As always, you can also add your own root certificates via <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/opts/struct.Opts.html"><code>Opts</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/opts/struct.Opts.html#structfield.certificate_path"><code>certificate_path</code></a> (<code>--certificate-path=</code>).</p>
<p>We have a new <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.SiteDataManager.html"><code>SiteDataManager</code></a> API for managing <strong>localStorage</strong>, <strong>sessionStorage</strong>, and <strong>cookies</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/janvarga">@janvarga</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41236">#41236</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41255">#41255</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41378">#41378</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41523">#41523</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41528">#41528</a>), and a new <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.NetworkManager.html"><code>NetworkManager</code></a> API for managing the <strong>cache</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/janvarga">@janvarga</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41255">#41255</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41474">#41474</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41386">#41386</a>).
To clear the cache, call <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.NetworkManager.html"><code>NetworkManager</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.NetworkManager.html#method.clear_cache"><code>clear_cache</code></a>, and to list cache entries, call <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.NetworkManager.html"><code>NetworkManager</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.NetworkManager.html#method.cache_entries"><code>cache_entries</code></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#simple-dialogs"><strong>Simple dialogs</strong></a> – that is alert(), confirm(), and prompt() – are now exposed to embedders via a new <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/enum.SimpleDialog.html"><code>SimpleDialog</code></a> type in <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/webview_delegate/enum.EmbedderControl.html"><code>EmbedderControl</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40982">#40982</a>).
This new interface is harder to misuse, and no longer requires boilerplate for embedders that wish to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#cannot-show-simple-dialogs">ignore simple dialogs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Web console messages</strong>, including messages from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console API</a>, are now accessible via <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.ServoDelegate.html"><code>ServoDelegate</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.ServoDelegate.html#method.show_console_message"><code>show_console_message</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.WebViewDelegate.html"><code>WebViewDelegate</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.WebViewDelegate.html#method.show_console_message"><code>show_console_message</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41351">#41351</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.Servo.html"><code>Servo</code></a>, the main handle for controlling Servo, is now cloneable for sharing within the same thread (<a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41010">#41010</a>).
To shut down Servo, simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.drop.html">drop</a> the last <code>Servo</code> handle or let it go out of scope.
<code>Servo</code>::<code>start_shutting_down</code> and <code>Servo</code>::<code>deinit</code> have been removed (<a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41012">#41012</a>).</p>
<p>Several interfaces have also been renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.Servo.html"><code>Servo</code></a>::<code>clear_cookies</code> is now <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.SiteDataManager.html"><code>SiteDataManager</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.SiteDataManager.html#method.clear_cookies"><code>clear_cookies</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/janvarga">@janvarga</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41236">#41236</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41255">#41255</a>)</li>
<li><code>DebugOpts</code>::<code>disable_share_style_cache</code> is now <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/prefs/struct.Preferences.html"><code>Preferences</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/prefs/struct.Preferences.html#structfield.layout_style_sharing_cache_enabled"><code>layout_style_sharing_cache_enabled</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40959">#40959</a>)</li>
<li>The rest of <code>DebugOpts</code> has been moved to <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/opts/struct.DiagnosticsLogging.html"><code>DiagnosticsLogging</code></a>, and the options have been renamed (<a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40960">#40960</a>)</li>

<p>We can now <strong>evict entries</strong> from our <strong>HTTP cache</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Narfinger">@Narfinger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gterzian">@gterzian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Taym95">@Taym95</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40613">#40613</a>), rather than having it grow forever (or get cleared by an embedder).
<strong>about:memory</strong> now tracks <strong>SVG-related memory usage</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/d-kraus">@d-kraus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41481">#41481</a>), and we’ve fixed memory leaks in &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; (<a href="https://github.com/tharkum">@tharkum</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41131">#41131</a>).</p>
<p>Servo now does less work when <strong>matching selectors</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/webbeef">@webbeef</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41368">#41368</a>), when <strong>focus changes</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40984">#40984</a>), and when <strong>reflowing boxes</strong> whose size did not change (<a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41160">#41160</a>).</p>
<p>To allow for smaller binaries, <strong>gamepad support</strong> is now <strong>optional at build time</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/WaterWhisperer">@WaterWhisperer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41451">#41451</a>).</p>
<p>We’ve fixed some <strong>undefined behaviour</strong> around garbage collection (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jdm">@jdm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmorenz">@gmorenz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41546">#41546</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/688">mozjs#688</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/689">mozjs#689</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/692">mozjs#692</a>).

<p>Thanks again for your generous support!
We are now receiving <strong>7110 USD/month</strong> (+10.5% over November) in recurring donations.
This helps us cover the cost of our <strong><a href="https://ci0.servo.org/">speedy</a> <a href="https://ci1.servo.org/">CI</a> <a href="https://ci2.servo.org/">and</a> <a href="https://ci3.servo.org/">benchmarking</a> <a href="https://ci4.servo.org/">servers</a></strong>, one of our latest <strong><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2025-06/#:~:text=Servo">Outreachy interns</a></strong>, and funding <strong><a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/09/17/your-donations-at-work-funding-jdm/">maintainer work</a></strong> that helps more people contribute to Servo.</p>
<p>Servo is also on <a href="https://thanks.dev/">thanks.dev</a>, and already <strong>30 GitHub users</strong> (+2 over November) that depend on Servo are sponsoring us there.
If you use Servo libraries like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/url/reverse_dependencies">url</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/html5ever/reverse_dependencies">html5ever</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/selectors/reverse_dependencies">selectors</a>, or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cssparser/reverse_dependencies">cssparser</a>, signing up for <a href="https://thanks.dev/">thanks.dev</a> could be a good way for you (or your employer) to give back to the community.</p>
<p>We now have <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/11/21/sponsorship-tiers/"><strong>sponsorship tiers</strong></a> that allow you or your organisation to donate to the Servo project with public acknowlegement of your support.
A big thanks from Servo to our newest Bronze Sponsors: <strong>Anthropy</strong>, <strong>Niclas Overby</strong>, and <strong>RxDB</strong>!

<p>We’ve recently published one talk and one blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1mSXdlRqA"><strong>Web engine CI on a shoestring budget</strong></a> (<a href="https://www.azabani.com/talks/2025-12-18-shoestring-web-engine-ci/">slides</a>; <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-a-new-web-engine-written-in-rust/">transcript</a>) – Delan Azabani (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>) spoke about the CI system that keeps our builds and tryjobs moving fast, running nearly two million tests in under half an hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-2025-stats/"><strong>Servo 2025 Stats</strong></a> – Manuel Rego (<a href="https://github.com/mrego">@mrego</a>) wrote about the growth of the Servo project, and how our many new contributors have enabled that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have two <strong>upcoming</strong> talks at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/"><strong>FOSDEM 2026</strong></a> in <strong>Brussels</strong> later this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/LXFKS9-servo-project-impact/"><strong>The Servo project and its impact on the web platform ecosystem</strong></a> – Manuel Rego (<a href="https://github.com/mrego">@mrego</a>) is speaking on <strong>Saturday 31 January</strong> at <a href="https://everytimezone.com/?t=697d4600,8ac"><strong>14:00 local time</strong></a> (13:00 UTC), about Servo’s impact on spec issues, interop bugs, test cases, and the broader web platform ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3J8GUD-servo-streams-reimplementation/"><strong>Implementing Streams Spec in Servo web engine</strong></a> – Taym Haddadi (<a href="https://github.com/Taym95">@Taym95</a>) is speaking on <strong>Saturday 31 January</strong> at <a href="https://everytimezone.com/?t=697d4600,98d"><strong>17:45 local time</strong></a> (16:45 UTC), about our experiences writing a new implementation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API">Streams API</a> that is independent of the one in SpiderMonkey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Servo developers Martin Robinson (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>) and Delan Azabani (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>) will also be attending FOSDEM 2026, so it would be a great time to come along and chat about Servo!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html">https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46742635">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<p>
Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite
</p>
</div>





<h2 id="executive_summary"><span>1. </span>Executive Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database
engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

</p></li><li><p>
But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.

</p></li><li><p>
SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like
client/server databases.  But SQLite can do many smaller queries
efficiently too.  Application developers can use whichever technique
works best for the task at hand.
     
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="the_perceived_problem"><span>2. </span>The Perceived Problem</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website">Appropriate Uses For SQLite</a> page says that
dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL
statements each.
This has provoked criticism from readers.  Examples:

</p><ul>
<li><p>
<i>"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"</i>
</p></li><li><p>
<i>"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."</i>
</p></li><li><p>
<i>"[This is] bad design"</i>
</p></li></ul>

<p>
Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server
database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.  In
a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message
round-trip from the application to the database server and back to
the application.  Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially,
can be a serious performance drag.  This is sometimes called the
"N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.

</p><h2 id="n_1_queries_are_not_a_problem_with_sqlite"><span>3. </span>N+1 Queries Are Not A Problem With SQLite</h2>

<p>
SQLite is <u>not</u> client/server, however.  The SQLite database runs
in the same process address space as the application.  Queries do not
involve message round-trips, only a function call.  The latency
of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite.  Hence, using a large number
of queries with SQLite is not the problem.

</p><h2 id="the_need_for_over_200_sql_statements_per_webpage"><span>4. </span>The Need For Over 200 SQL Statements Per Webpage</h2>

<p>
The dynamic webpages on the SQLite website are mostly generated by
the <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil version control system</a>.
A typical dynamic
page would be a timeline such as <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline</a>.
A log of all SQL used by the timeline is shown below.

</p><p>
The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options
from the "config" and "global_config" tables of the Fossil database.
Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements
to be displayed on the timeline.
This "timeline" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex
relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and
complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes
to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.

</p><p>
Following the single big "timeline" query, 
there are additional queries for each timeline element.
Fossil is using the "N+1 Query" pattern rather than trying
to grab all the information in as few queries as possible.
But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead.
At the bottom of
each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate
the page.  For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than
25 milliseconds.  Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds
were spent inside the database engine.

</p><p>
Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application.  
But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits.  For one, the
section of the code that creates the timeline query can be
completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline
entry for display.
This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code
simple and easy to maintain.  Secondly, the information
needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information,
vary according to what type of objects are to be shown.  Check-ins need one
set of queries.  Tickets need another set of queries.  Wiki pages need a
different query.  And so forth.  By implementing these queries on-demand
and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is
further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall 
code base.

</p><p>
So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can
do many smaller and simpler queries.  Both are efficient.  An application
can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the
situation at hand.

The following is a log of all SQL used to generate one particular

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article><div><p>I’ve been using GitLab for my private projects for years now. I just started using it at some point and never had a reason to switch.</p><h2 id="how-i-ended-up-here">How I ended up here</h2><p>Back when GitHub still charged for private repositories, GitLab offered them for free. That was the initial hook. I had a bunch of small projects and experiments that I didn’t want to publish but also didn’t want to pay for. GitLab was the obvious choice.</p><p>GitHub eventually made private repos free too, but by then my workflow was already built around GitLab. All my CI pipelines, Docker images, deployment scripts - everything pointed there.</p><h2 id="the-docker-registry-thing">The Docker registry thing</h2><p>Every GitLab project comes with a Container Registry. This is probably the feature I use most.</p><p>The workflow is simple. Build an image locally or in CI, push it to the registry, pull it wherever you need it.</p><p>No separate Docker Hub account. No thinking about pull rate limits (remember when Docker Hub introduced those and broke half the internet’s CI pipelines?). No managing access tokens for yet another service.</p><p>For my private projects this is perfect. I don’t need the discoverability of Docker Hub. I just need a place to store images that integrates with my existing authentication.</p><p>The 10GB limit per project sounds small on paper but I’ve never come close to hitting it. Old tags get cleaned up, base layers are shared, and most of my images aren’t that big anyway.</p><h2 id="cicd">CI/CD</h2><p>GitLab CI was one of the earlier “CI config as code” implementations that I used. You drop a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> in your repo and things start happening. The config is versioned with everything else, which means you can see exactly what your pipeline looked like six months ago.</p><p>Nothing fancy. Build the image, push it, optionally deploy. The manual trigger on deploy is nice - I can build automatically but still control when things go to production.</p><p>The shared runners GitLab provides handle most of my workloads. They’re not fast, but they’re free and reliable. For the times when I needed something specific - like a runner with more memory or access to my private network - setting up my own runner on a cheap VPS was straightforward. Install the runner, register it with a token, done.</p><p>The documentation for CI/CD is extensive. Almost too extensive. There are so many features and options that finding what you need can take a while. But once you figure out your patterns, you mostly copy-paste from your own previous configs.</p><h2 id="the-annoying-parts">The annoying parts</h2><p>Let’s talk about what’s not great.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> The GitLab web interface has always felt sluggish to me. Click on a merge request, wait. Switch to the pipeline view, wait. Open the job log, wait. It’s not terrible, but there’s this constant friction that adds up over a long session.</p><p>I’ve noticed improvements recently. Either they optimized things or I’ve just gotten used to it - hard to say. But it’s still not as snappy as GitHub.</p><p><strong>Feature overload.</strong> GitLab tries to be everything. Issue tracking, project management, wiki, snippets, package registry, container registry, security scanning, infrastructure management, monitoring… The sidebar menu goes on forever.</p><p>I use maybe 10% of what’s available. Repositories, merge requests, CI/CD, container registry. That’s pretty much it.</p><p>This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, feature bloat. On the other, if I ever need something like a private NPM registry or security scanning, it’s already there. I just haven’t needed it yet.</p><h2 id="the-value-proposition">The value proposition</h2><p>I run about a dozen private projects ranging from active side projects to abandoned experiments I keep around “just in case.” None of this costs me anything. It’s crazy.</p><h2 id="my-workflow">My workflow</h2><p>All my private projects live on GitLab. Prototypes, experiments, half-finished ideas, things I’m actively working on but not ready to share. It’s my digital workshop where I can make a mess without anyone watching.</p><p>GitHub is different. That’s where I put things I want people to see.</p><p>This split works well for me. I get the collaboration and visibility benefits of GitHub for public stuff while keeping my private mess organized on GitLab with proper CI/CD and container registries.</p><p>Some people do everything on GitHub. Some do everything on GitLab. Having a foot in both camps might seem redundant but honestly, they serve different purposes in my workflow.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46742389">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a kind of polite fiction at the heart of the software industry. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estimating how long software projects will take is very hard, but not impossible. A skilled engineering team can, with time and effort, learn how long it will take for them to deliver work, which will in turn allow their organization to make good business plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, false. As every experienced software engineer knows, <strong>it is not possible to accurately estimate software projects</strong>. The tension between this polite fiction and its well-understood falseness causes a lot of strange activity in tech companies.</p>
<p>For instance, many engineering teams estimate work in <a href="https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing">t-shirt sizes</a> instead of time, because it just feels too obviously silly to the engineers in question to give direct time estimates. Naturally, these t-shirt sizes are immediately translated into hours and days when the estimates make their way up the management chain.</p>
<p>Alternatively, software engineers who are genuinely trying to give good time estimates have ridiculous <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19671824">heuristics</a> like “double your initial estimate and add 20%“. This is basically the same as giving up and saying “just estimate everything at a month”.</p>
<p>Should tech companies just stop estimating? One of my guiding principles is that <strong>when a tech company is doing something silly, they’re probably doing it for a good reason</strong>. In other words, practices that appear to not make sense are often serving some more basic, <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company">illegible</a> role in the organization. So what is the actual purpose of estimation, and how can you do it well as a software engineer?</p>
<h3>Why estimation is impossible</h3>
<p>Before I get into that, I should justify my core assumption a little more. People <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71">have</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18487253">written</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@riaanfnel/the-problem-with-estimates-f3d5cddd5e62">a lot</a> about this already, so I’ll keep it brief.</p>
<p>I’m also going to concede that <strong>sometimes you can accurately estimate software work</strong>, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.</p>
<p>For most of us, the majority of software work is not like this. We work on poorly-understood systems and cannot predict exactly what must be done in advance. Most programming in large systems is <em>research</em>: identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.</p>
<p>The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect">software architecture</a>, where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).</p>
<p>In short: software engineering projects are not dominated by the known work, but by the unknown work, which always takes 90% of the time. However, only the known work can be accurately estimated. It’s therefore impossible to accurately estimate software projects in advance.</p>
<h3>Estimates do not come from engineers</h3>
<p>Estimates do not help engineering teams deliver work more efficiently. Many of the most productive years of my career were spent on teams that did no estimation at all: we were either working on projects that had to be done no matter what, and so didn’t really need an estimate, or on projects that would deliver a constant drip of value as we went, so we could just keep going indefinitely<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, <strong>estimates aren’t even made by engineers at all</strong>. If an engineering team comes up with a long estimate for a project that some VP really wants, they will be pressured into lowering it (or some other, more compliant engineering team will be handed the work). If the estimate on an undesirable project - or a project that’s intended to “hold space” for future unplanned work - is too short, the team will often be encouraged to increase it, or their manager will just add a 30% buffer.</p>
<p>One exception to this is projects that are technically impossible, or just genuinely prohibitively difficult. If a manager consistently fails to pressure their teams into giving the “right” estimates, that can send a signal up that maybe the work can’t be done after all. Smart VPs and directors will try to avoid taking on technically impossible projects.</p>
<p>Another exception to this is areas of the organization that senior leadership doesn’t really care about. In a sleepy backwater, often the formal estimation process does actually get followed to the letter, because there’s no director or VP who wants to jump in and shape the estimates to their ends. This is one way that some parts of a tech company can have drastically different engineering cultures to other parts. I’ll let you imagine the consequences when the company is re-orged and these teams are pulled into the spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>Estimates are political tools for non-engineers in the organization</strong>. They help managers, VPs, directors, and C-staff decide on which projects get funded and which projects get cancelled. </p>
<h3>Estimates define the work, not the other way around</h3>
<p>The standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. <strong>This is entirely backwards.</strong> Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re working on a LLM chatbot, and your director wants to implement “talk with a PDF”. If you have six months to do the work, you might implement a robust file upload system, some pipeline to chunk and embed the PDF content for semantic search, a way to extract PDF pages as image content to capture formatting and diagrams, and so on. If you have one day to do the work, you will naturally search for simpler approaches: for instance, converting the PDF to text client-side and sticking the entire thing in the LLM context, or offering a plain-text “grep the PDF” tool.</p>
<p>This is true at even at the level of individual lines of code. When you have weeks or months until your deadline, you might spend a lot of time thinking airily about how you could refactor the codebase to make your new feature fit in as elegantly as possible. When you have hours, you will typically be laser-focused on finding an approach that will actually work. There are always many different ways to solve software problems. Engineers thus have quite a lot of discretion about how to get it done.</p>
<h3>How I estimate work</h3>
<p>So how do I estimate, given all that?</p>
<p><strong>I gather as much political context as possible before I even look at the code</strong>. How much pressure is on this project? Is it a casual ask, or do we <em>have</em> to find a way to do this? What kind of estimate is my management chain looking for? There’s a huge difference between “the CTO <em>really</em> wants this in one week” and “we were looking for work for your team and this seemed like it could fit”.</p>
<p>Ideally, I go to the code <strong>with an estimate already in hand</strong>. Instead of asking myself “how long would it take to do this”, where “this” could be any one of a hundred different software designs, I ask myself “which approaches could be done in one week?“.</p>
<p><strong>I spend more time worrying about unknowns than knowns</strong>. As I said above, unknown work always dominates software projects. The more “dark forests” in the codebase this feature has to touch, the higher my estimate will be - or, more concretely, the tighter I need to constrain the set of approaches to the known work.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>I go back to my manager with a risk assessment, not with a concrete estimate</strong>. I don’t ever say “this is a four-week project”. I say something like “I don’t think we’ll get this done in one week, because X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect. Ideally, I go back to my manager with a <em>series</em> of plans, not just one:</p>
<ul>
<li>We tackle X Y Z directly, which <em>might</em> all go smoothly but if it blows out we’ll be here for a month</li>
<li>We bypass Y and Z entirely, which would introduce these other risks but possibly allow us to hit the deadline</li>
<li>We bring in help from another team who’s more familiar with X and Y, so we just have to focus on Z</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I don’t “break down the work to determine how long it will take”. My management chain already knows how long they want it to take. <strong>My job is to figure out the set of software approaches that match that estimate.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes that set is empty: the project is just impossible, no matter how you slice it. In that case, my management chain needs to get together and figure out some way to alter the requirements. But if I always said “this is impossible”, my managers would find someone else to do their estimates. When I do that, I’m drawing on a well of trust that I build up by making pragmatic estimates the rest of the time.</p>
<h3>Addressing some objections</h3>
<p>Many engineers find this approach distasteful. One reason is that they don’t like estimating in conditions of uncertainty, so they insist on having all the unknown questions answered in advance. I have written a lot about this in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/taking-a-position"><em>Engineers who won’t commit</em></a> and <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/clarity"><em>How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders</em></a>, but suffice to say that I think it’s cowardly. If you refuse to estimate, you’re forcing someone less technical to estimate for you.</p>
<p>Some engineers think that their job is to constantly push back against engineering management, and that helping their manager find technical compromises is betraying some kind of sacred engineering trust. I wrote about this in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical"><em>Software engineers should be a little bit cynical</em></a>. If you want to spend your career doing that, that’s fine, but I personally find it more rewarding to find ways to work with my managers (who have almost exclusively been nice people).</p>
<p>Other engineers might say that they rarely feel this kind of pressure from their directors or VPs to alter estimates, and that this is really just the sign of a dysfunctional engineering organization. Maybe! I can only speak for the engineering organizations I’ve worked in. But my suspicion is that these engineers are really just saying that they work “out of the spotlight”, where there’s not much pressure in general and teams can adopt whatever processes they want. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I don’t think it qualifies you to give helpful advice to engineers who do feel this kind of pressure.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I think software engineering estimation is generally misunderstood.</p>
<p>The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project, the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes to the team with an estimate already in hand (though they might not come out and admit it), and then the team must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible within that estimate.</p>
<p>This is because estimates are not by or for engineering teams. They are tools used for managers to negotiate with each other about planned work. Very occasionally, when a project is literally impossible, the estimate can serve as a way for the team to communicate that fact upwards. But that requires trust. A team that is always pushing back on estimates will not be believed when they do encounter a genuinely impossible proposal.</p>
<p>When I estimate, I extract the range my manager is looking for, and only then do I go through the code and figure out what can be done in that time. I never come back with a flat “two weeks” figure. Instead, I come back with a range of possibilities, each with their own risks, and let my manager make that tradeoff.</p>
<p><strong>It is not possible to accurately estimate software work.</strong> Software projects spend most of their time grappling with unknown problems, which by definition can’t be estimated in advance. To estimate well, you must therefore basically ignore all the known aspects of the work, and instead try and make educated guesses about how many unknowns there are, and how scary each unknown is.</p>
<p>edit: I should thank one of my readers, Karthik, who emailed me to ask about estimates, thus revealing to me that I had many more opinions than I thought.</p>

   <p>In 2020, Connie Sherburne's husband of 31 years, Peter, died in a crash while piloting their small plane.</p>   <p>Sherburne, a practical person, immediately focused on what needed to be done.</p>   <p>"I went home that evening, and the next morning, I got up and I thought, 'Hit the ground running. You've got all this to take care of.'"</p>   <p>She drove to their insurance company in Escondido, Calif., to transfer the insurance for Peter's truck into her name. Because of the pandemic, the office was staffed by just one person. The woman opened the door to let Sherburne inside, and they sat across from each other at a desk.</p>   
   <p>"It didn't take her but a few minutes to take care of why I was there," Sherburne recalled.</p>   <p>"When she got done, she stopped and she looked at me across her desk, and she made sure that I was looking at her — that she had my full attention."</p>   <p>"And she said, 'OK, so now that we've finished with that, people are going to stop and ask you, "How can I help?"' And then she gave this pregnant pause, and she said, 'Let them.'"</p>   <p>Sherburne took in the advice, absorbing the moment. She wasn't the kind of person to reach out to others for help.</p>

   <p>"But because she said it with such force, it really, really made sense to me," Sherburne said.</p>   <p>As soon as she got home, she realized that she did need help. The firewood she used to heat her home was running low, and winter was around the corner. Chopping wood was something Peter had always done. But this time, she asked a friend to take care of it.</p>   <p>"So many, many people did little things and big things to help me," Sherburne said. "One of the neighbors actually cooked for me for four years — dinners — and her husband delivered the dinners to me."</p>   
   <p>Sherburne says she would have never reached out for support if not for the advice of the woman at the insurance company.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5683170-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"In the back of my mind, I kept hearing her voice, you know, 'Let them.'"</p>   <p>A few years later, Sherburne went back to the insurance office to tell the woman how deeply her words had affected her. But the agent didn't work there anymore.</p>   <p>"So I just wanted to tell her how much that meant to me," Sherburne said.</p>   <p>"It was such a little thing for this woman just to say that to me. But she didn't realize what a huge thing it was going to be to help me through all this."</p>   <p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/myunsunghero/" target="_blank"><em>My Unsung Hero is also a podcast</em></a><em> — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

                                        <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota activist who was charged for her role in an anti-immigration enforcement protest at a church released her own video of her arrest Friday after the White House posted a manipulated image online.</p><p>The White House on Thursday posted a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-levy-armstrong-crying-minnesota-3de56d267fe704d16fac31d8fc3d71e9">picture</a></span> on its X page of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong crying with her hands behind her back as she was escorted by a blurred person wearing a badge. The photo was captioned in all caps: “Arrested far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.”</p><p>A photo posted by Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem’s account showed the same image with Levy Armstrong wearing a neutral expression.</p><p>Levy Armstrong, who <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-minnesota-church-disruption-bondi-ed084f5005187f58eabe0cc627d1862b">was arrested</a></span> with at least two others Thursday for an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church where an ICE official also serves as a pastor, released her own video. Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Allen, a St. Paul school board member who was also arrested in connection to the protest, were both released Friday, according to a post by Levy Armstrong’s organization, the Racial Justice Network. Their attorneys declined to comment.</p>
    
<p>The video shot by Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, shows several federal agents approaching to arrest her.</p>



<p>“I’m asking you to please treat me with dignity and respect,” she said to the agents.</p>

<p>“We have to put you in handcuffs,” one agent said, while another held up a phone and appeared to record a video.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“Why are you recording?” Levy Armstrong asked. “I would ask that you not record.”</p><p>“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” the agent filming said. “It’s not going to be on anything like that.”</p><p>“We don’t want to create a false narrative,” the agent said.</p><p>At no point in the more than seven-minute video -- which shows Levy Armstrong being handcuffed and led into a government vehicle -- did Levy Armstrong appear to cry. Instead, she talked with agents about her arrest.</p>
    
<p>“You know that this is a significant abuse of power,” she said. “Because I refuse to be silent in the face of brutality from ICE.”</p><p>“I’m not in here to get in a political debate,” the agent filming said.</p><p>In an audio message that Levy Armstrong’s spokesperson shared with The Associated Press, Levy Armstrong said the video of her arrest exposes that the Trump administration had used AI to manipulate images of her arrest.</p><p>“We are being politically persecuted for speaking out against authoritarianism, fascism and the tyranny of the Trump administration,” said Levy Armstrong, who recorded the message Friday morning during a call with her husband from jail.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporters Giovanna Dell’Orto in Minneapolis and Tiffany Stanley in Washington, D.C., contributed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>When TikTok users</span> in the US opened the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/apps/">app</a> today, they were greeted with a pop-up asking them to agree to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/social-media/">social media</a> platform’s new terms of service and privacy policy before they could resume scrolling.</p><p>These changes are part of TikTok’s transition to new ownership. In order to continue operating in the US, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> was compelled by the US government to transition from <a href="https://www.wired.com/china-issue/">Chinese control</a> to a new, American-majority corporate entity. Called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, the new entity is made up of a group of investors that includes the software company <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/oracle/">Oracle</a>.</p><p>It's easy to tap Agree and keep on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-the-freecash-app-wont-pay-you-to-scroll-tiktok/">scrolling through videos</a> on TikTok, so users might not fully understand the extent of changes they are agreeing to with this pop-up.</p><p>Now that it’s under US-based ownership, TikTok potentially collects more detailed information about its users, including precise location data. A spokesperson for TikTok USDS declined to comment.</p><p>Here are the three biggest changes to <a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en&quot;}" href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TikTok’s privacy policy</a> that users should know about.</p><h2>TikTok Adds Precise Location Tracking</h2><p>TikTok’s change in <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/location/">location tracking</a> is one of the most notable updates in this new privacy policy. Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users. Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts. Similar kinds of precise location data is also tracked by other social media apps, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> and X.</p><p><strong>Old Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>We collect information about your approximate location, including location information based on your SIM card and/or IP address. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your User Content. Current versions of the app do not collect precise or approximate GPS information from US users.</em></p><p><strong>New Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including</em> ... l<em>ocation information about your approximate location based on your device and network information, such as SIM card region, IP address, and device system settings. We also collect information, such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest, if you choose to add the location to your user content. Also, if you choose to enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate or precise location information from your device.</em></p><h2>TikTok Now Tracks AI Interactions</h2><p>Rather than an adjustment, TikTok’s policy on AI interactions adds a new topic to the privacy policy document. Now, users' interactions with any of TikTok’s AI tools explicitly fall under data that the service may collect and store. This includes any prompts as well as the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">AI-generated</a> outputs. The metadata attached to your interactions with AI tools may also be automatically logged.</p><p><strong>Old Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>(These AI interactions are not explicitly mentioned in the past policy.)</em></p><p><strong>New Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Services, you may provide some or all of the following information … AI interactions, including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.</em></p><p><em>We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including … metadata that is automatically uploaded in connection with your user content, messages, or AI interactions, such as how, when, where, and by whom the user content was created, or message or prompt was sent. Metadata may also include information, such as your username, that enables your user content to be traced back to your account by other users.</em></p><h2>TikTok Expands Its Ads Network</h2><p>This change to TikTok’s privacy policy may not be as immediately noticeable to users, but it will likely have an impact on the types of ads you see outside of TikTok. So, rather than just using your collected data to target you while using the app, TikTok may now further leverage that info to serve you more relevant ads wherever you go online. As part of this advertising change, TikTok also now explicitly mentions publishers as one kind of partner the platform works with to get new data.</p><p><strong>Old Privacy Policy:</strong></p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>Advertisers, measurement, and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Platform, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Platform with your TikTok account.</em></p><p><strong>New Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>Advertisers, publishers, and measurement and other partners provide us with information about you and the actions you have taken outside of our websites and apps, including the pages you visit, products or services you purchase, and apps you download. These partners also provide information such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help measure the effectiveness of ads we serve and to better deliver ads to you on our websites and apps, or through TikTok Ad Network elsewhere online, depending on your ads settings.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>
