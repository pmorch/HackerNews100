          <p>Early car sales data for January is starting to arrive from countries across the pond, and they paint an alarming picture for Tesla. Sales are crashing in France, Germany, and the UK—all affluent countries that are key markets for Tesla's electric vehicles. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/">Coming on the heels of a large financial miss</a>, it's just one more problem for the automaker.</p>
<p>Tesla sales dropped around 13 percent across Europe in 2024, but so far this year, the scale of the problem is far greater. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/tesla-sales-plunge-63-in-france-the-eu-s-second-biggest-ev-market">In France</a>, sales of new Teslas fell by 63 percent, while total car sales in the country fell by just 6 percent, with EV sales dropping just half a percent.</p>
<p>Germany was already looking like lost ground for Tesla—its 41 percent drop in 2024 accounted for most of Tesla's lost sales across Europe. That must make the 59 percent drop in German Tesla sales recorded during January even more painful on the profit and loss statements.</p>
<p>Across the Channel, the British auto industry <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/">just released</a> its sales data for January. Here, Tesla sales fell less precipitously—just 12 percent. However, battery EV sales were 35 percent higher in the UK in January 2025 than in January 2024. The cake is growing, but Tesla is getting to eat less and less of it.</p>

Earlier this year, we updated <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/">2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental</a> in Google AI Studio, which improved its performance by combining Flash’s speed with the ability to reason through more complex problems.</p><p data-block-key="954o0">And last week, we <a href="https://blog.google/feed/gemini-app-model-update-january-2025">made an updated 2.0 Flash available to all users of the Gemini app</a> on desktop and mobile, helping everyone discover new ways to create, interact and collaborate with Gemini.</p><p data-block-key="eantc">Today, we’re making the updated Gemini 2.0 Flash generally available via the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/vertex-ai/studio">Vertex AI</a>. Developers can now build production applications with 2.0 Flash.</p><p data-block-key="8ag25">We’re also releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, our best model yet for coding performance and complex prompts. It is available in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/vertex-ai/studio">Vertex AI</a>, and in the <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini app</a> for Gemini Advanced users.</p><p data-block-key="a1fct">We’re releasing a new model, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, our most cost-efficient model yet, in public preview in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/vertex-ai/studio">Vertex AI</a>.</p><p data-block-key="dqse3">Finally, <a href="http://blog.google/feed/gemini-app-experimental-models">2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental will be available to Gemini app</a> users in the model dropdown on desktop and mobile.</p><p data-block-key="f25rt">All of these models will feature multimodal input with text output on release, with more modalities ready for general availability in the coming months. More information, including specifics about pricing, can be found in the <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-family-expands">Google for Developers blog</a>. Looking ahead, we’re working on more updates and improved capabilities for the Gemini 2.0 family of models.</p><h2 data-block-key="8lja">2.0 Flash: a new update for general availability</h2><p data-block-key="2qiq5"><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-update-flash-ai-assistant-io-2024/">First introduced</a> at I/O 2024, the Flash series of models is popular with developers as a powerful workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale and highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information with a context window of 1 million tokens. We’ve been thrilled to see its <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-20-family-expands/">reception</a> by the developer community.</p><p data-block-key="i50">2.0 Flash is now generally available to more people across our AI products, alongside improved performance in key benchmarks, with image generation and text-to-speech coming soon.</p><p data-block-key="4992c">Try Gemini 2.0 Flash in the <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini app</a> or the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/vertex-ai/studio">Vertex AI</a>.

<p>Two years after the <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/01/16/servo-2023/">renewed activity</a> on the project we can confirm that Servo is fully back.</p>
<p>If we ignore the bots, in 2024 we’ve had <strong>129 unique contributors</strong> (+143% over 54 last year), <strong>landing 1,771 pull requests</strong> (+163% over 673), and that’s just in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">our main repo</a>!</p>
<p>Including bots, the total number of PRs merged goes up to <strong>2,674</strong> (+144% over 1094). From all this work, 26% of the PRs were made by Igalia, 40% by other contributors and the rest by the bots (34%). This shows how the Servo community has been growing and becoming more diverse with new actors participating actively in the project.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a look to the data and chart above, which show the evolution since 2018 in number of merged PRs, unique contributors per year and average contributors per month (excluding bots). We can see <strong>the project is back to numbers of 2018 and 2019 when it was been developed in full speed</strong>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Servo popularity keeps growing, with many folks realizing there has been new activity on the project last year, and we have more and more people interested in the project.</p>
<figure><a href="https://star-history.com/#servo/servo"><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/2025-01-servo-github-stars.png" alt="Servo GitHub start history chart showing Servo not stopping going up since 2013, up to more than 25,000 today"></a>
  <figcaption>Servo GitHub stars haven't stopped growing, surpassing now 25K threshold.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During 2024 Servo has been present in <strong>8 events with 9 talks</strong>: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects/">FOSDEM</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/RdtlD_7JAs8">Open Source Summit North America</a>, <a href="https://servo.org/slides/2024-04-16-seattle-rust-user-group/">Seattle Rust user meetup</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA_1jxzR85M">GOSIM Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SamA5Oz-G5w">Global Software Technology Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHa4LPpWRh8&amp;t=1351s">Linux Foundation Europe Member Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpz088cxDcI">GOSIM</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c9sHaEXQak">China</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp5n7CSvALA">Ubuntu Summit</a>.</p>
<p>If we focus on development there has been many things moving forward during the year. Servo main dependencies (SpiderMonkey, Stylo and WebRender) have been upgraded, the new layout engine has kept evolving adding support for floats, tables, flexbox, fonts, etc. By the end of 2024 <a href="https://staging.wpt.fyi/results/?sha=58c1148991&amp;label=master&amp;max-count=1&amp;product=servo"><strong>Servo passes 1,515,229 WPT subtests (79%)</strong></a>. Many other new features have been under active development: WebGPU, Shadow DOM, ReadableStream, WebXR, … Servo now supports two new platforms: Android and OpenHarmony. And we have got the first experiments of applications using Servo as a web engine (like <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2024/01/19/embedding-update/">Tauri</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz">Blitz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KDABLabs/cxx-qt-servo-webview">QtWebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mcclure/cuervo/tree/unstable_traversal_experiment">Cuervo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/versotile-org/verso/">Verso</a> and <a href="https://github.com/moto-browser/moto">Moto</a>).</p>
<p>In 2024 we have <strong>raised 33,632.64 USD</strong> with <a href="https://servo.org/sponsorship/">donations via Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors</a> from <strong>500 different people and organizations</strong>. Thank you all for supporting us!</p>
<p>With this money we have now 3 servers that provides self-hosted runners for Linux, macOS, and Windows reducing our build times <strong>from over an our to under 30 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>Talking about the future, the Servo TSC has been discussing the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap"><strong>roadmap for 2025</strong></a> which has been updated on the Servo’s wiki. We have many plans to keep Servo thriving with new features and improvements. Let’s hope for a great 2025!</p>

To me personally, it feels unavoidable: I can’t look down at my phone or glance up at a TV without seeing <i>something</i> that makes me upset. And that’s really exhausting. But when outrage is everywhere, what can we do to keep it from getting to us?</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

So what that basically means is just, you know, you see something, you’re outraged by it, and over time you just become kind of numb to it.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Sounds relevant to [laughs], to many of our lives.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Yes [laughs].</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> What do researchers know about outrage in general?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So outrage fatigue itself hasn’t been that well-studied, but outrage in general has been studied, and people have found that, actually, outrage can be useful. It actually can help you identify a problem and react to it. But it can also be harmful if you’re experiencing it all the time and become overwhelmed by it.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">There’s actually a recent study by William Brady, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He and his colleagues found that outrage actually helps misinformation spread more widely, especially online on social media. So the upshot of this is that when you have too much outrage, people can actually withdraw from public spaces or virtual places like social media.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, and what is it about outrage that helps misinformation spread?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So I think part of it is the fact that it’s more engaging. It, you know, activates your emotions, and so people are more primed to respond to that. As we all know, if you’ve ever spent time on social media and social networks, we always see the most kind of inflammatory content because that’s what gets retweets or clicks and the algorithms are amplifying that.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Right, and more broadly, you know, what is it about the times we’re living in that makes outrage so hard to avoid?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So we’re living in a particularly polarized time, which I think is not a surprise to anybody. If you have been online lately, on Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or any other social media, you’ve probably seen people yelling about something or other. And this just really has been accelerating, I guess, in the last few years because of our political polarization and other world events.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">As I was saying earlier some amount of outrage is actually normal and healthy, but studies have shown that the majority of outrage posts on social media are actually driven by a small minority of users who are very—you know, they feel very strongly about something, and that can actually turn other people off of participating in the conversation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, so social media is a big part of this, you know, both amplifying it and giving a platform for people who are feeling this outrage. Other than just making us feel bad, what does outrage fatigue do to a person?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> So the real danger is that we become apathetic, and if we’re exposed to something all the time—whether it’s through social media or even traditional news sources like cable TV—if it’s constantly telling us to be outraged, eventually we’re gonna be less responsive and we’re gonna kind of pull back. So instead of, like, channeling that outrage into something useful, many people sort of feel exhausted and burned out, and they just don’t want to take action at all.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">And this is actually a problem because politicians can take advantage of that and sort of manipulate people. As we’ve seen over the last few decades some of the big social issues like abortion, gay rights, critical race theory, these have all been used as kind of wedge issues to convince people to vote in ways that might be against their own self-interest because they’re just so outraged about this one particular issue.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, so definitely worth avoiding. What can we do to accomplish that?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Right. That was my question, too. You know, a couple of things: one is that we can just sort of limit how much media we consume. As somebody who is a member of the media, you know, this might sound strange, but I think if you’re feeling constantly overwhelmed and outraged by something, if you consume less of it, that’s probably a good thing.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But it doesn’t mean you should totally sort of ignore what’s happening. When I talked to William Brady, he said that, you know, one of the ways you can kind of have an impact without just being overwhelmed is to get involved in local politics or local issues, you know, in your community because you can actually have a much greater impact on a local level, usually, than a national level anyway. So rather than just, like, retweeting that most outrageous post that you see, you know, it’s better to get involved with real people and kind of have a dialogue with them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, find some mutual aid groups ...</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Exactly.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Find stuff you can actually do when you’re not doomscrolling and hopefully [laughs] ...</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Yes [laughs].</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Do less of the doomscrolling, too. And did he have any advice for sort of recovering from outrage burnout once it’s hit you?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Gosh, that is a good question. You know, it’s not something I specifically asked Dr. Brady about, but I think, just from my own experience, like I said, you know, pulling back a little bit from some of the media consumption and, you know, just maybe limiting yourself to checking the news a couple times a day instead of, like, every hour or, you know, getting those alerts on your phone all the time. If someone is posting stuff that makes you furious all the time, maybe don’t follow them [laughs]. And, yeah, get outside, get in nature—you know, the usual things that can kind of reset your brain and make you feel, you know, more calm.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">[CLIP: Theme music]</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Feltman:</b> Yeah, maybe easier said than done, but really good advice. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us, Tanya.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><b>Lewis:</b> Thanks so much.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2025/02/05/done-with-ubuntu/">https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2025/02/05/done-with-ubuntu/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949222">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>I liked Ubuntu. For a very long time, it was the sensible default option.
Around 2016, I used the Ubuntu GNOME flavor, and after they ditched the Unity desktop environment, GNOME became the
default
option.</p>
<p>I was really happy with it, both for work and personal computing needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.id.ee/en/article/install-id-software/">Estonian ID card software</a> was also officially supported on Ubuntu,
which made Ubuntu a good choice for family members.</p>
<p>But then something changed.</p>
<h3 id="upgrades-suck">Upgrades suck</h3>
<p>Like many Ubuntu users, I stuck to the long-term support releases and upgraded every two years to the next major
version. There was just one tiny little issue: every upgrade broke <em>something.</em></p>
<p>Usually it was a relatively minor issue, with some icons, fonts or themes being a bit funny. Sometimes things went
completely wrong.</p>
<p>The worst upgrade was the one I did on my mothers’ laptop. During the upgrade process from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04,
everything blew up spectacularly. The UI froze, the machine was completely unresponsive. After a 30-minute wait and a
forced restart later, the installation was absolutely <em><strong>fucked.</strong></em> In frustration, I ended up installing <em><strong>Windows</strong></em>
so
that I don’t have to support Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Another family member, another upgrade. This is one that they did themselves on Lubuntu 18.04, and they upgraded to the
latest version. The result: Firefox shortcuts stopped working, the status bar contained duplicate icons, and random
errors popped up after logging
in. <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/10/14/fedora-starter-pack/#-specific-to-estonia-id-card-support">After making sure that ID card software works on Fedora 40,</a>
I installed that instead. All they need is a working browser, and that’s too difficult for Ubuntu to handle.</p>
<h3 id="snaps-ruined-ubuntu">Snaps ruined Ubuntu</h3>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro">Snaps</a>. I hate them.</p>
<p>They sound great in theory, but the poor implementation and heavy-handed push by Canonical has been a mess.</p>
<p>Snaps auto-update by default. Great for security<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but horrible for users who want to control what their <em>personal</em>
computer is doing.</p>
<p>Snaps get forced upon users as more and more system components are forcibly switched from Debian-based packages to
Snaps, which breaks compatibility, functionality and introduces a lot of new issues. You can upgrade your Ubuntu
installation and then discover that your browser is now contained within a Snap, the desktop shortcut for it doesn’t
work and your government ID card does not work for logging in to your bank any longer.</p>
<p>Snaps also destroy productivity. A colleague was struggling to get any work done because the desktop environment on
their Ubuntu installation was flashing certain UI elements, being unresponsive and blocking them from doing any work.
Apparently the whole GNOME desktop environment is a Snap now, and that lead to issues.</p>
<p>The fix was <em>super easy, barely an inconvenience:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>roll back to the previous version of the GNOME snap</li>
<li>restart
<ul>
<li>still broken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>update to the latest version again</li>
<li>restart
<ul>
<li>still broken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>restart again
<ul>
<li>it is fixed now</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What was the issue?</p>
<p>Absolutely no clue, but a days’ worth of developers’ productivity was completely wasted.</p>
<p>Some of these issues have <em>probably</em> been fixed by now, but if I executed migration projects at my day job with a
similar track record, I would be fired.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="snaps-done-right-flatpak">Snaps done right: Flatpak</h3>
<p>Snaps can be implemented in a way that doesn’t suck for end users. <a href="https://flatpak.org/">It’s called a Flatpak.</a></p>
<p>They work reasonably well, you can update them whenever you want and they are <em><strong>optional</strong></em>. Your Firefox installation
won’t suddenly turn into a Flatpak overnight.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/06/02/steam-deck/">Steam Deck,</a> Flatpaks are the main distribution method for user-installed apps
and I don’t mind it at all. The
only issue is the software selection, not every app is available as a Flatpak just yet.</p>
<h3 id="consider-fedora">Consider Fedora</h3>
<p>Fedora works fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/10/14/fedora-starter-pack/">It’s not perfect,</a> but I like it.</p>
<p>At this point I’ve used it for longer than Ubuntu
and <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/message-red-hat-associates-today">unless IBM ruins it for all of us,</a> I think it
will be a perfectly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cromulent">cromulent</a> distro go get work done on.</p>
<p>Hopefully it’s not too late for Canonical to reconsider their approach to building a Linux distro.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/02/05/warner-bros-youtube-full-movie-releases/">https://tedium.co/2025/02/05/warner-bros-youtube-full-movie-releases/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42949181">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                    <div>
<p><strong>In recent years, we’ve complained a lot</strong> about Warner Bros. Discovery, in part because their decision-making has seemed <a href="https://tedium.co/2022/08/03/10-unreleased-completed-movies/">almost toxic</a> and <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/11/14/warner-bros-discovery-coyote-vs-acme-film-shelving/">damaging to the creative community</a>. A movie studio that literally makes movies and doesn’t release them? That seems like a bizarre state of affairs, and under David Zaslav, they’ve done it multiple times.</p>
<p>But the studio has recently done something that I’m really just kind of in awe about. Over the last month, across five different YouTube channels, the studio has released more than 30 full movies. On YouTube. For free. Without any sort of gating.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Eup7JXScZyvRftA2Q5hv69XiegDm6tQ">Much of the collection is here</a>, but it doesn’t appear to even be a complete accounting of what the studio has released on the service. They keep adding movies, too. In the three or four days since I first spotted it, they’ve added at least two or three additional films.</p>
<p>And to be clear, this is not the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/storefront">YouTube Movies</a> service, which is fully licensed and mainly represents a pretty good add-on perk of YouTube Premium subscriptions. Instead, WBD (without notice or promotion) is dropping full-on films that it spent millions of dollars making on its own channels, in a way that makes it feels like it’s saying that the films are commercially spent.</p>
<p>It is embracing a service where a popular type of video is basically watching someone else’s video and commenting on top of it. In some cases, it is likely that those reaction videos will get more views than these movies.</p>




<p>In terms of the quality, most of the films are kind of in the realm where nostalgia hasn’t caught up with them. Some of them are quite good—most notably <em>Waiting for Guffman</em>, <em>Michael Collins</em>, and <em>Crossing Delancey</em>. And some have sheer cult appeal—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhTS_RSQxw4">the 1986 Talking Heads film <em>True Stories</em></a> feels like a surprising choice to show up here, given that David Byrne is still firmly in the mainstream nearly 40 years after the film’s release.</p>

<p>But there are a lot of stinkers and obscurities. One such film on the list: <em>The 11th Hour</em>, an environmental documentary that was created by Leonardo DiCaprio in 2007 but was ultimately overshadowed by the similar <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, released a year prior. The 2008 film <em>Chaos Theory</em>, starring Ryan Reynolds, shows the film star at the nadir of his commercial power. And then there’s the infamous 2000 New Line Cinema release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDLIGVdJDuQ"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, which was basically forgotten by all but the die-hards before it showed up on this list.</p>
<p>(It is probably a matter of minutes until <em>Town &amp; Country</em>, another infamous flop distributed by New Line during the same period, appears in this playlist.)</p>

<p>At least one film on the list was a bonafide hit upon its initial release—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J8XaQv9A0E">1977’s George Burns comedy <em>Oh, God!</em></a>, which had a $51 million box office run, equivalent to nearly $265 million in 2024 money. But most of the films on this list are more like <em>The Adventures Of Pluto Nash</em>, an infamous 2002 Eddie Murphy dud that came during a period in which Murphy was largely working on poorly reviewed family fare. (If not for <em>Shrek</em>, that entire period would have been a critical bust for Murphy. However, only the adult-oriented <em>Pluto Nash</em> lost money.)</p></div>

<div>
<p>But what stands out more than anything else is that Warner Bros. released them this way, rather than in a format that limits access—something that Warner could easily do, thanks to the fact that it owns the streaming service Max, as well as Turner Classic Movies, a television channel that allows cable customers to stream. (The aforementioned <em>Oh, God!</em> appears on TCM’s website.)</p>

<p>So, what’s going on here? If I was going to speculate, my guess is that Warner has kind of put itself in this awkward place where it has failed to give a home to some of its less-heralded content on streaming services. And in some cases, it kind of feels like a shame. Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAyg_ENvHzc"><em>The Science of Sleep</em></a>, a 2006 Michel Gondry film that received good reviews and made a small profit at the box office, but simply didn’t reach the critical heights of Gondry’s prior release, <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>. It’s not that this is a bad film—it seems to be, more than anything else, that it is kind of a forgotten one, poorly presented by the studio that paid millions of dollars to make and distribute it.</p>
<p>And honestly, in a lot of ways, that shows why this decision seems so bewildering. By releasing a handful of hidden gems next to some of the worst films it ever released, WBD is doing a disservice to its creative teams of past and present. It is essentially telling its catalog artists that it may simply drop an old film on a service that most people don’t even think of as a streamer.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. is not lacking for proper channels to release this content in full. So why post on YouTube in an DRM-free, region-free way? (For sake of confirming the films didn’t have DRM, I opened up yt-dlp frontend <a href="https://github.com/NickvisionApps/Parabolic/tree/main">Parabolic</a> and had it download two films currently on YouTube: <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, which is on YouTube Movies, and <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, which isn’t. The former was blocked from working; the latter downloaded and played easily in VLC.) The message seems to be, “nobody wants this stuff,” which is a weird thing for an entertainment conglomerate to say about its own archives. Even if these films make money through ad revenue, it likely won’t add up to much in residuals compared to a distribution deal.</p>
<p>After all, if you can just watch these films for free here, why would you buy these from Amazon or somewhere else? Well, presumably you could get the films in better quality on Blu-ray. And they might come with commentary tracks, in case you want to hear about the decisions that led to <em>Pluto Nash</em> being made. But there likely aren’t a lot of die-hard fans of most of these movies; they probably don’t need more than the videos themselves.</p>
<p>For years, the line we heard from movie studios was that these movies needed to be protected with strict digital rights management to prevent them from appearing in the wrong hands. This works against that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it’s perhaps the way things are going. <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/01/17/ernie-kovacs-lost-episode-resurfaced/">As I noted in my recent piece on Ernie Kovacs</a>, YouTube is increasingly seen as the best option for releasing content made before the 1980s, as Netflix and other services seem to be favoring more recent works. Perhaps this signifies that it’s an issue for even the big studios.</p>
<p>All that said: I’m not exactly sure what message WBD is sending here by offloading these seemingly random movies in such a bewildering way. But maybe it’s a sign that, once the long tail starts thinning out, the streaming revolution isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE0bQ4Fjbms"><em>Waiting for Guffman</em></a> still holds up, and you can watch it on YouTube, for free.</p></div><div>

                                                                        <p><img alt="Stock Windows 10 and 11 wallpapers" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699098103_windows_10_and_windows_11_story.jpg"></p>

<p>Back in October 2021, when Microsoft made the original Windows 11, version 21H2, generally available, the company, perhaps unimaginably, had also provided a <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-makes-the-tpm-bypass-for-unsupported-pcs-official-but-with-lots-of-warning/">workaround that bypassed the system requirements</a> which would allow users on unsupported PCs to upgrade too.</p>

<p>If you remember the days, there was a widespread objection against the stringent OS hardware requirements, something that is quite prevalent even today, as Microsoft recently had to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-confirms-its-not-lowering-windows-11-system-requirements-for-unsupported-hardware/">clarify it was not relaxing</a> the Windows 11 hardware eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>The workaround that Microsoft had published involved tweaking a Registry key that would allow a Windows 11 upgrade on unsupported PCs by bypassing CPU and TPM checks:</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft recommends against installing Windows 11 on a device that does not meet the Windows 11 minimum system requirements. If you choose to install Windows 11 on a device that does not meet these requirements, and you <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-confirms-its-not-lowering-windows-11-system-requirements-for-unsupported-hardware/">acknowledge and understand the risks</a>, you can create the following registry key values and bypass the check for TPM 2.0 (at least TPM 1.2 is required) and the CPU family and model.</li>
	<li>Registry Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup</li>
	<li>Name: AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU</li>
	<li>Type: REG_DWORD</li>
	<li>Value: 1</li>
	<li>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Neowin noticed today while browsing that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240929145620/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e">support article</a> which hosted this information has been edited since and the above workaround has been deleted. The change was made sometime recently after the release of <a href="https://www.neowin.net/reviews/windows-11-24h2-vs-23h2-performance-benchmark-in-2025-clean-install-vs-in-place-upgrade/">Windows 11 24H2</a>. Thus Microsoft no longer officially endorses this bypass method even though the trick itself may work.</p>

<p>Microsoft's current <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-officially-recommends-a-new-pc-and-onedrive-to-update-to-windows-11/">official recommendation is a new PC</a> for updating to Windows 11, so clearly the company is not a fan of those updating to 11 on unsupported devices, which is likely why it no longer wants to inform users about the Registry workaround. Microsoft's partners <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/dell-amd-give-a-reason-why-microsoft-officially-recommends-a-new-pc-to-update-to-windows-11/">like Dell and AMD</a> have expressed they are likely on board with this too.</p>

<p>With Microsoft justifying how <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wants-you-to-understand-why-deprecation-of-windows-features-is-good-for-you/">deprecation is actually a good thing for users</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/is-windows-11-free-update-for-limited-time-only-microsoft-might-not-be-so-sure-now/">end of support for Windows 10</a> will certainly be interesting from the hardware standpoint.</p>
                        
                        
                                                                    </div></div>]]></description>

	<p>A new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393">released on Friday</a> is making waves in the AI community, not because of the model 
it describes, but because it shows how close we are to some very large breakthroughs in AI. The model
is just below state of the art, but it can run on my laptop. More important, it sheds light on how all
this stuff works, and it’s <strong>not complicated</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="inference-scaling-wait-for-me">Inference Scaling: “Wait” For Me!</h2>
<p>OpenAI were the first to claim the inference-time scaling laws. Basically, an LLM can get higher performance
if it can “think” longer before answering. But, like, <strong>how do you do it?</strong> How do you make it think longer?</p>

<p>OpenAI and R1 had cool graphs showing performance scaling with average thinking time (this from
the s1 paper):</p>

<p><img src="https://timkellogg.me/images/s1-inference-scaling.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But <strong>how</strong> do they control the length of an LLM response? Everyone skipped over that part, but s1
shows us details, <em>and it is fun</em>.</p>

<p><em>Context: When an LLM “thinks” at inference time, it puts it’s thoughts inside <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> and 
<code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> XML tags. Once it gets past the end tag the model is taught to change voice into a confident
and authoritative tone for the final answer.</em></p>

<p>In s1, when the LLM tries to stop thinking with <code>"&lt;/think&gt;"</code>, they force it to keep going
by replacing it with <code>"Wait"</code>. It’ll then begin to second guess and double check it’s answer. They
do this to trim or extend thinking time (trimming is just abruptly inserting <code>"&lt;/think&gt;"</code>).</p>

<p>It’s really dumb, I love it. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/r.whal.ing/post/3lheatlmonk26">It feels like the kind of hack I would try</a>.</p>

<p>So for <code>o3-mini-low</code> versus <code>o3-mini-high</code>, that’s likely how they do it. They probably trained 3
models, and with each with a different average thinking time (as measured during training). Eventually the 
training process begins to encode that behavior into the model weights.</p>

<h2 id="the-entropix-tie-in">The Entropix Tie In</h2>
<p>The trick is so dumb you can do it at inference time too. I’m kicking myself for not understanding
this earlier, because it’s what entropix is all about, and <a href="https://timkellogg.me/blog/2024/10/10/entropix">I wrote a lot about entropix</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/xjdr-alt/entropix">entropix</a>, they look at the entropy &amp; varentropy of the logits (and attention) to change how the
tokens are selected. In fact, they used tokens like “Wait” to force the LLM to second guess itself.
Although there was more to it, they also tweaked sampler setting to make
it more creative, or to go into aggressive exploration mode, all depending on the internal state
of the model.</p>

<p>My hunch is that we’ll <strong>see more</strong> of entropix, or something directly inspired from it. Although, it’s
unclear if it’ll appear predominately in training or inference time.</p>

<h2 id="extreme-data-frugality">Extreme Data Frugality</h2>
<p>Why did it cost only $6? Because they used a <strong>small model</strong> and hardly any data.</p>

<p>After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K 
is all that’s needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model. <strong>Adding data didn’t raise 
performance <em>at all</em></strong>.</p>

<p>32B is a small model, I can run that on my laptop. They used 16 NVIDIA H100s for 26 minutes per 
training run, that equates to around $6.</p>

<p>The low cost means you can do a lot of runs, and they did. As we’ll see, they heavily used a 
technique called ablation, re-running the entire training process with <strong>small variations</strong> in 
configuration to prove what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>For example, how did they figure out it should be “Wait” and not “Hmm”? <strong>They measured!</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://timkellogg.me/images/s1-ablations.png" alt=""></p>

<p>They also measured properties of the training dataset, which examples provided the most signal:</p>

<p><img src="https://timkellogg.me/images/s1-diversity.png" alt=""></p>

<p>They did a ton of these ablation experiments. This is how you <strong>make progress</strong>.</p>

<p>We like to think that
OpenAI or DeepSeek are simply packed full of brilliant people and they make a wild guess, spend
$10,000,000.00 on a training run and BAM! an innovation is created. But no, even the smartest
people make hundreds of <strong>tiny experiments</strong>.</p>

<p>Innovations like s1 that dramatically lower costs mean that researchers can learn and understand
these models faster. And that directly translates to a <strong>faster pace</strong> of AI development.</p>

<h2 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h2>
<p>Again, AI is inseparable from politics, sorry.</p>

<p>There’s debate about OpenAI &amp; Anthropic’s vast funding. It’s tempting to see cost reducing 
innovations like s1 or DeepSeek V3 and assume that OpenAI &amp; Anthropic’s vast datacenters are
a waste of money. I’d argue that no, having 10,000 H100s just means that you can do 625 times
<strong>more experiments</strong> than s1 did.</p>

<p>If you believe that AI development is a prime national security advantage, then you absolutely
should want even more money poured into AI development, to make it go <strong>even faster</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="distealing">Distealing</h2>
<p>Note that this s1 dataset is <strong>distillation</strong>. Every example is a thought trace generated by 
another model, Qwen2.5,
prompted to think before answering. OpenAI has been accusing DeepSeek of creating their
<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/tree/main">V3 model</a> by distilling from o1, which is against their terms of service. There’s still no strong public
evidence in either direction, so accusations are mostly empty, but s1 gives a lot of credence.</p>

<p>Going forward, it’ll be nearly impossible to prevent distealing (unauthorized distilling). One thousand
examples is definitely within the range of what a single person might do in normal usage, no less 
ten or a hundred people. I doubt that OpenAI has a realistic path to <strong>preventing</strong> or even <strong>detecting</strong>
distealing outside of simply not releasing models.</p>

<p>Note that OpenAI released their o3 model as
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">deep research</a>, an agent instead of direct access to the model API. This might be a trend now,
“agents” serving as a way to avoid releasing direct access to a model.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>S1 is important because it illustrates the current pace of AI development that’s happening in
the open. When you consider how much compute is available to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic,
the potential true pace of AI development is <strong>mind melting</strong>.</p>

<p>S1 isn’t a replication of R1 or o1. Those were demonstrations in pure reinforcement learning (RL).
S1 shows that supervised fine tuning (SFT) shows just as much potential. That means researchers have
multiple paths to investigate for pushing forward inference-time scaling.</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say that we’re going to see some very big things in ‘25. It’s barely February…</p>

        <h2>Go Data Structures

        <div>
        <p>

            Posted on Tuesday, November 24, 2009.


        </p>
        </div>
        </h2>
       

<p>When explaining Go to new programmers, I've found that it often helps to explain what Go values look like in memory, to build the right intuition about which operations are expensive and which are not. This post is about basic types, structs, arrays, and slices.</p>
<h2>Basic types</h2>
<p>Let's start with some simple examples:</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata1.png"></center>
<p>The variable <code>i</code> has type <code>int</code>, represented in memory as a single 32-bit word.  (All these pictures show a 32-bit memory layout; in the current implementations, only the pointer gets bigger on a 64-bit machine—<code>int</code> is still 32 bits—though an implementation could choose to use 64 bits instead.) </p>
<p>The variable <code>j</code> has type <code>int32</code>, because of the explicit conversion.  Even though <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> have the same memory layout, they have different types: the assignment <code>i = j</code> is a type error and must be written with an explicit conversion: <code>i = int(j)</code>. </p>
<p>The variable <code>f</code> has type <code>float</code>, which the current implementations represent as a 32-bit floating-point value. It has the same memory footprint as the <code>int32</code> but a different internal layout. </p>

<h2>Structs and pointers</h2>
<p>Now things start to pick up. The variable <code>bytes</code> has type <code>[5]byte</code>, an array of 5 <code>byte</code>s.  Its memory representation is just those 5 bytes, one after the other, like a C array. Similarly, <code>primes</code> is an array of 4 <code>int</code>s. </p>
<p>Go, like C but unlike Java, gives the programmer control over what is and is not a pointer.  For example, this type definition: </p>
<pre>type Point struct { X, Y int }
</pre>
<p> defines a simple struct type named <code>Point</code>, represented as two adjacent <code>int</code>s in memory.</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata1a.png"></center>
<p>The <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Composite_literals">composite literal syntax</a> <code>Point{10, 20}</code> denotes an initialized <code>Point</code>. Taking the address of a composite literal  denotes a pointer to a freshly allocated and initialized <code>Point</code>. The former is two words in memory; the latter is a pointer to two words in memory. </p>
<p>Fields in a struct are laid out side by side in memory.</p>
<pre>type Rect1 struct { Min, Max Point }
type Rect2 struct { Min, Max *Point }</pre><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata1b.png"></center>
<p><code>Rect1</code>, a struct with two <code>Point</code> fields, is represented by two <code>Point</code>s—four ints—in a row. <code>Rect2</code>, a struct with two <code>*Point</code> fields, is represented by two <code>*Point</code>s.</p>
<p>Programmers who have used C probably won't be surprised by the distinction between <code>Point</code> fields and <code>*Point</code> fields, while programmers who have only used Java or Python (or ...) may be surprised by having to make the decision. By giving the programmer control over basic memory layout, Go provides the ability to control the total size of a given collection of data structures, the number of allocations, and the memory access patterns, all of which are important for building systems that perform well. </p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>With those preliminaries, we can move on to more interesting data types.</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata2.png"></center>
<p>(The gray arrows denote pointers that are present in the implementation but not directly visible in programs.)</p>
<p>A <code>string</code> is represented in memory as a 2-word structure containing a pointer to the string data and a length. Because the <code>string</code> is immutable, it is safe for multiple strings to share the same storage, so <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=8082954141980125536&amp;postID=65253524121904390">slicing</a> <code>s</code> results in a new 2-word structure with a potentially different pointer and length that still refers to the same byte sequence.  This means that slicing can be done without allocation or copying, making string slices as efficient as passing around explicit indexes.</p>
<p>(As an aside, there is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4513622">well-known gotcha</a> in Java and other languages that when you slice a string to save a small piece, the reference to the original keeps the entire original string in memory even though only a small amount is still needed. Go has this gotcha too.  The alternative, which we tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=70fa38e5a5bb">and rejected</a>, is to make string slicing so expensive—an allocation and a copy—that most programs avoid it.)</p>
<h2>Slices</h2><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata3.png"></center>
<p>A <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices">slice</a> is a reference to a section of an array. In memory, it is a 3-word structure contaning a pointer to the first element, the length of the slice, and the capacity. The length is the upper bound for indexing operations like <code>x[i]</code> while the capacity is the upper bound for slice operations like <code>x[i:j]</code>. </p>
<p>Like slicing a string, slicing an array does not make a copy: it only creates a new structure holding a different pointer, length, and capacity. In the example, evaluating the composite literal <code>[]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}</code>  creates a new array containing the five values and then sets the fields of the slice <code>x</code> to describe that array. The slice expression <code>x[1:3]</code> does not allocate more data: it just writes the fields of a new slice structure to refer to  the same backing store. In the example, the length is 2—<code>y[0]</code> and <code>y[1]</code> are the only valid indexes—but the capacity is 4—<code>y[0:4]</code> is a valid slice expression. (See <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices">Effective Go</a> for more about length and capacity and how slices are used.) </p>
<p> Because slices are multiword structures, not pointers, the slicing operation does not need to allocate memory, not even for the slice header, which can usually be kept on the stack. This representation makes slices about as cheap to use as passing around explicit pointer and length pairs in C. Go originally represented a slice as a pointer to the structure shown above, but doing so meant that every slice operation allocated a new memory object.  Even with a fast allocator, that creates a lot of unnecessary work for the garbage collector, and we found that, as was the case with strings above, programs avoided slicing operations in favor of passing explicit indices.  Removing the indirection and the allocation made slices cheap enough to avoid passing explicit indices in most cases. </p>
<h2>New and Make</h2>
<p>Go has two data structure creation functions: <code>new</code> and <code>make</code>. The distinction is a common early point of confusion but seems to quickly become natural. The basic distinction is that <code>new(T)</code> returns a <code>*T</code>, a pointer that Go programs can dereference implicitly (the black pointers in the diagrams), while <code>make(T, </code><i>args</i><code>)</code> returns an ordinary <code>T</code>, not a pointer. Often that <code>T</code> has inside it some implicit pointers (the gray pointers in the diagrams). <code>New</code> returns a pointer to zeroed memory, while <code>make</code> returns a complex structure.</p><center><img src="http://research.swtch.com/godata4.png"></center>
<p>There is a way to unify these two, but it would be a significant break from the C and C++ tradition: define <code>make(*T)</code> to return a pointer to a newly allocated <code>T</code>, so that the current <code>new(Point)</code> would be written <code>make(*Point)</code>. We tried this for a few days but decided it was too different from what people expected of an allocation function.</p>
<h2>Coming soon...</h2>
<p>This has already gotten a bit long. Interface values, maps, and channels will have to wait for future posts.</p>

<p>There have been many the­o­ries of how human his­to­ry works. Some, like Ger­man thinker <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/01/an-introduction-to-hegels-philosophy-of-history.html">G.W.F. Hegel</a>, have thought of progress as inevitable.&nbsp;Oth­ers have embraced a more sta­t­ic view, full of “Great Men” and an immutable nat­ur­al order.&nbsp;Then we have the counter-Enlight­en­ment thinker <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/vico/">Giambat­tista Vico</a>. The 18th cen­tu­ry Neapoli­tan philoso­pher took human irra­tional­ism seri­ous­ly, and wrote about our&nbsp;ten­den­cy to rely on myth and metaphor rather than rea­son or nature. Vico’s most “rev­o­lu­tion­ary move,” wrote Isa­iah Berlin, “is to have denied the doc­trine of a time­less nat­ur­al law” that could be “known in prin­ci­ple to any man, at any time, any­where.”</p>
<p>Vico’s the­o­ry of his­to­ry includ­ed inevitable peri­ods of decline (and heav­i­ly influ­enced the&nbsp;his­tor­i­cal think­ing of James Joyce and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/">Friedrich Niet­zsche</a>). He describes his con­cept “most col­or­ful­ly,” writes Alexan­der Bert­land&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/vico/">Inter­net Ency­clo­pe­dia of Phi­los­o­phy</a>, “when he gives this axiom”:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Men first felt neces­si­ty then look for util­i­ty, next attend to com­fort, still lat­er amuse them­selves with plea­sure, thence grow dis­solute in lux­u­ry, and final­ly go mad and waste their sub­stance.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The descrip­tion may remind us of Shakespeare’s “<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/360/7/88.html">Sev­en Ages of Man</a>.”&nbsp;But for&nbsp;Vico, Bert­land&nbsp;notes, every decline her­alds a new begin­ning. His­to­ry&nbsp;is “pre­sent­ed clear­ly as a cir­cu­lar motion in which nations rise and fall… over and over again.”</p>


<p>Two-hun­dred and twen­ty&nbsp;years after Vico’s 1774 death, Carl Sagan—another thinker who took human irra­tional­ism seriously—published his book&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2js5Hrz"><em>The Demon Haunt­ed World</em></a>, show­ing&nbsp;how much our every­day think­ing derives from metaphor, mythol­o­gy, and super­sti­tion. He also fore­saw&nbsp;a future in which his nation, the U.S., would fall into a peri­od of ter­ri­ble decline:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have a fore­bod­ing of an Amer­i­ca in my chil­dren’s or grand­chil­dren’s time — when the Unit­ed States is a ser­vice and infor­ma­tion econ­o­my; when near­ly all the man­u­fac­tur­ing indus­tries have slipped away to oth­er coun­tries; when awe­some tech­no­log­i­cal pow­ers are in the hands of a very few, and no one rep­re­sent­ing the pub­lic inter­est can even grasp the issues; when the peo­ple have lost the abil­i­ty to set their own agen­das or knowl­edge­ably ques­tion those in author­i­ty; when, clutch­ing our crys­tals and ner­vous­ly con­sult­ing our horo­scopes, our crit­i­cal fac­ul­ties in decline, unable to dis­tin­guish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost with­out notic­ing, back into super­sti­tion and dark­ness…</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sagan believed in progress and, unlike Vico, thought that “time­less nat­ur­al law” is&nbsp;dis­cov­er­able with the tools of sci­ence. And yet, he feared “the can­dle in the dark” of sci­ence would be snuffed out by “the dumb­ing down of Amer­i­ca…”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>…most evi­dent in the slow decay of sub­stan­tive con­tent in the enor­mous­ly influ­en­tial media, the 30 sec­ond sound bites (now down to 10 sec­onds or less), low­est com­mon denom­i­na­tor pro­gram­ming, cred­u­lous pre­sen­ta­tions on pseu­do­science and super­sti­tion, but espe­cial­ly a kind of cel­e­bra­tion of igno­rance…</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sagan died in 1996, a year after he wrote these words. No doubt he would have seen the fine art of dis­tract­ing and mis­in­form­ing peo­ple&nbsp;through social media as a late, per­haps ter­mi­nal, sign of the demise of sci­en­tif­ic think­ing. His&nbsp;pas­sion­ate advo­ca­cy for sci­ence edu­ca­tion stemmed from his con­vic­tion that we must and can reverse the down­ward trend.</p>
<div>
<p><span><iframe title="YouTube video player" type="text/html" width="640" height="505" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ECuarAmpK00?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=dark" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></span>
	</p>
</div>

<p>As he says in the poet­ic excerpt from <em>Cos­mos</em>&nbsp;above, “I believe our future depends pow­er­ful­ly on how well we under­stand this cos­mos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morn­ing sky.”</p>
<p>When Sagan refers to “our” under­stand­ing of sci­ence, he does&nbsp;not mean, as he says above, a “very few” tech­nocrats, aca­d­e­mics, and research sci­en­tists. Sagan&nbsp;invest­ed so much effort&nbsp;in pop­u­lar books and tele­vi­sion because he believed that all of us need­ed to use the tools of sci­ence: “a way of think­ing,” not just “a body of knowl­edge.” With­out sci­en­tif­ic think­ing, we can­not grasp the most impor­tant issues we all joint­ly face.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We’ve arranged a civ­i­liza­tion in which most cru­cial ele­ments pro­found­ly depend on sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy. We have also arranged things so that almost no one under­stands sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy. This is a pre­scrip­tion for dis­as­ter. We might get away with it for a while, but soon­er or lat­er this com­bustible mix­ture of igno­rance and pow­er is going to blow up in our faces.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sagan’s 1995 pre­dic­tions are now being her­ald­ed as prophet­ic. As Direc­tor of Pub­lic Radio International’s Sci­ence Fri­day, Charles Bergquist&nbsp;tweet­ed, “Carl Sagan had either a time machine or a crys­tal ball.” Matt Novak&nbsp;cau­tions against falling back into super­sti­tious think­ing in our praise of&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2js5Hrz"><em>Demon Haunt­ed World</em></a>. After all, he says, “the ‘accu­ra­cy’ of pre­dic­tions is often a Rorschach test” and “some of Sagan’s con­cerns” in oth­er parts of the book “sound rather quaint.”</p>
<p>Of course Sagan could­n’t pre­dict the future, but he did have a very informed, rig­or­ous under­stand­ing of the issues of thir­ty years ago, and his pre­dic­tion extrap­o­lates from trends that have only con­tin­ued to deep­en. If the tools of sci­ence education—like most of the coun­try’s wealth—end up the sole prop­er­ty of an elite, the rest of us will fall back into a state of gross igno­rance, “super­sti­tion and dark­ness.” Whether we might come back around again to progress, as Giambat­tista Vico thought, is a mat­ter of sheer con­jec­ture. But per­haps there’s still time to reverse the trend before the worst arrives. As Novak writes, “here’s hop­ing Sagan, one of the smartest peo­ple of the 20th cen­tu­ry, was wrong.”</p>

We believe our children deserve better. Kagi's new parental controls help parents better manage the video content their children are exposed to, reducing the risk of exposure to inappropriate content and creating a safer online experience for them.</p><p>Help us protect more young minds - <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/" rel="ugc nofollow">share your thoughts</a> on making this protection <strong>available more broadly</strong> to all plan types. In case you wonder why we did not make this option enabled by default -  video thumbnails and titles serve as a marketing tools for content creators, and changing them unilaterally would introduce us as a biased intermediary on a matter that is still in the air. This could have a negative impact for publishers and potentially conflict with our mission to "humanize the web". It is a delicate issue, and this is why we had propagated the control over this to the user level, as with all personalization features in Kagi.</p><h3>Custom Assistant Bangs</h3><p>Launch your Custom Assistant instantly from anywhere with a Bang shortcut.

To show our appreciation, we've sent out free t-shirts and sticker packs to those first 20,000 supporters. Earlier this month, these members started receiving their packages and excitedly shared photos across various socials. Here’s a snapshot of just a few:</p><p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-10-17/1729193189-984221-kagi-collage.png" title="" alt=""></p><p>For anyone who missed out, don’t worry!

The entire company took a break from the usual routine to fly to Barcelona, Spain, for our annual retreat - a chance to reenergize and refocus for the exciting journey ahead.</p><p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-10-05/1728090499-177024-kagi-team.jpg" title="" alt=""></p><p>But don’t worry, it wasn’t all fun and no work. In fact, we’ve got a pretty exciting update for you today. The retreat gave us fresh inspiration, and we’re ready to bring some of those new ideas to life starting right now.</p><h2>Launching the official Kagi Android app</h2><p>We're delighted to announce the launch of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search&amp;hl=en_US" rel="ugc nofollow">official Kagi Android app!</a> This marks an important milestone in our mission to make Kagi Search more accessible and encourage more people to try it out.</p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search" rel="ugc nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search</a></p><p>The app allows users to begin using Kagi Search immediately right from the first launch (<strong>no account needed</strong>!). For those with existing subscriptions, signing in is seamless, enabling access to all Kagi features.</p> <p>Additionally, the app includes <strong>native homescreen widgets</strong>, providing one-click access to search directly from your homescreen.</p><p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-10-10/1728592468-556003-image.png" title="" alt=""></p><p>If you use an Android device, go check it out! We've simplified the process of sharing Kagi with your network.</p><p>Additionally, a recent <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/dma/" rel="ugc nofollow">EU ruling</a> presents a significant opportunity for Kagi. Google is now required to include any search engine that meets <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/dma/searchengine/" rel="ugc nofollow">specific criteria</a>, such as having an app with <strong>over 5,000 installs</strong>, in the default list for Android and Chrome — <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search" rel="ugc nofollow">install the app</a> today and help us meet the criteria!</p> <p>Stay tuned for more exciting updates coming soon!</p><h2>Introducing Snaps</h2><p><a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/snaps.html" rel="ugc nofollow">Snaps</a> are an innovative search operator that allows for site-specific searches directly from the search bar. By simply typing <code>@</code> followed by the designated <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html" rel="ugc nofollow">site bang</a>, you can limit your search results to a specific website. For example, to search on Reddit or HackerNews, you can enter:</p><ul><li><code>@r winter boots</code> which translates to <code>winter boots site:www.reddit.com</code></li><li>and <code>@hn vim emacs</code> to <code>vim emacs site:news.ycombinator.com</code></li></ul><p>This feature was made possible thanks to the contribution of our user <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/tuesday">@tuesday</a> ( <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/1231" data-id="1231"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/1231">#1231</a>) on <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/" rel="ugc nofollow">Kagifeedback</a>!</p><p>This will work with any bang that Kagi support, including custom bangs you define. <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/bangs" rel="ugc nofollow">Kagi Bangs</a> are open source, we welcome your contributions!</p><h2>Universal Summarizer for Chrome</h2> <p><a href="https://kagi.com/summarizer" rel="ugc nofollow">Universal Summarizer</a> is one of the most-loved Kagi treats.

Introducing Sales Taxes</span><a href="https://kagi.com/changelog#3592"> #</a></h2><div><h3>Announcements</h3><div><p>Starting from <strong>March 26th</strong>, we will <strong>begin including localized sales tax for all new customers</strong> who subscribe on or after this date.</p><p>﻿Starting from <strong>April 9th, all existing customers who qualify for sales tax/VAT will see localized sales tax/VAT added to their monthly invoice in USD</strong>, on top of their current subscription fee. This adjustment will appear on your next invoice on or after April 9th, with no immediate extra charge.</p></div> <div><p>If you are paying with an <strong>alternative method via Paypal, OpenNode, or any other non-Stripe provider</strong>: You will be prompted to pick a sales tax region the next time you go to purchase credit.</p><p>﻿If you have any questions about this change, please feel free to contact our team through <a href="https://discord.gg/5V7qcs3X88" rel="ugc nofollow">Discord</a> or at <a href="mailto:support@kagi.com">support@kagi.com</a>. We will be building an F.A.Q. page to answer any questions about the migration process.</p></div><p>To clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your country/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two years. We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.</p><h3>Improvements and bug fixes</h3><ul><li>We made some changes to Kagi-specific bangs: you can access FastGPT through <code>!fgpt</code> and Discuss doc with <code>!discussdoc</code></li><li>LaTeX is not displaying properly <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3514" data-id="3514"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3514">#3514</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/rourguic">@rourguic</a> </li><li>Claude 3 Opus injects random mathematical formulae <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3564" data-id="3564"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3564">#3564</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/tiltowait">@tiltowait</a></li><li>Expert research assistant fails to process request <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3566" data-id="3566"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3566">#3566</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/frin">@frin</a></li><li>Research assistant messes up character spacing unpredictably <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3184" data-id="3184"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3184">#3184</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/httpjames">@httpjames</a></li><li>Duplicate bang search suggestion <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3379" data-id="3379"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3379">#3379</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/Value7609">@Value7609</a></li><li>Kagi Quick Answer Mismatch Between Document Number and Source Number <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3549" data-id="3549"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3549">#3549</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/benoit">@benoit</a> </li><li>UI Bug: Chat Assistant models card has a clipboard icon <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3485" data-id="3485"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3485">#3485</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/Chris">@Chris</a></li><li>Maps keeps trying to get a location on every keystroke <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3405" data-id="3405"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3405">#3405</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/tinkling6961">@tinkling6961</a> </li><li><code>POST /login</code> returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3526" data-id="3526"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3526">#3526</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/pdm">@pdm</a> </li><li>Non-ASCII Wikipedia URL incorrectly encoded <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3459" data-id="3459"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3459">#3459</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/ThreePointsShort">@ThreePointsShort</a></li><li>Kagi Assistant - Text Parsing Issue <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3390" data-id="3390"><span></span></a><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/3390">#3390</a> <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/u/martafolf">@martafolf</a></li></ul></div></div><div id="3530"><h2><span>March 12th, 2024 - Enhanced Quick Answer, New Language, and Maps Improvements</span><a href="https://kagi.com/changelog#3530"> #</a></h2><div><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>We've upgraded the Quick Answer keyboard shortcut.

Now, in the wake of </span><a href="https://apnews.com/live/dc-plane-crash-reagan-updates" rel="">the tragic plane crash</a><span> on January 29 and a resurgence of focus on this topic, it’s more important than ever to get the story straight. I neither have nor claim to have answers about the cause of the crash, but the memorandum Trump signed in the wake of the accident referenced the hiring scandal directly. As such, it’s time to complete the story I started a year ago. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Audio version available </span><a href="https://askwhocastsai.substack.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring?triedRedirect=true" rel="">here</a><span>, courtesy of Askwho Casts AI.</span></em></p><p>On New Year’s Eve, 2013, after years of furtive work, the FAA abruptly threw a grenade into its air traffic control hiring pipeline. </p><p>Moranda Reilly always wanted to work in aviation. She read books on aviation heroes, watched air disasters, she listened to live air traffic control in her car. Around her neck, she wore an airplane necklace, a gift from a friend that she’d mended repeatedly. In her 20s, she elected to take the plunge and do whatever it took to make it happen. She quit her full-time job, took out student loans, and moved to attend a university that offered a two-year degree as part of the FAA’s collegiate training initiative (CTI) for air traffic controllers. </p><p>The FAA had established its CTI program in 1989, working together alongside a select group of universities and community colleges to build a better-prepared, college-educated workforce. By the early 2010s, when Moranda and other aspiring air traffic controllers entered the program, CTI was the primary way by which people would enter the field, with the FAA accepting virtually no off-the-street hires. On its website, the FAA instructed aspiring air traffic controllers that if they got CTI degrees, passed the profession’s aptitude test (the AT-SAT), and met other eligibility requirements, it would place them into a priority hiring queue, giving them first opportunity every time employment slots opened up. Students understood that the FAA hired virtually everyone who completed the program and passed the assessment.</p><p>As the CTI program ramped up with increasing success in the mid-2000s, Florida State College of Jacksonville applied to join, and in 2008, Sam Fischer launched their program. By 2013, he had settled into a comfortable rhythm, training wave after wave of successful students.</p><p>Andrew Brigida, a 2013 graduate from Arizona State’s CTI program, had just aced the AT-SAT, getting perfect marks while meeting all other job requirements. He was fully qualified, poised to become an air traffic controller.</p><p><span>Then, on New Year’s Eve, 2013, while students and professors alike were out for winter break, the FAA abruptly sent an announcement to the presidents of the CTI schools. The announcement came, without warning, as an email from one Mr. Joseph Teixeira, the organization’s vice president for safety and technical training. "The FAA completed a barrier analysis of the ATC occupation pursuant to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) Management Directive 715,” the email read,</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-1-156166190" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> then went on to spell out some changes: </span></p><p>First, every past aptitude test applicants had taken was voided. Andrew Brigida’s perfect score was meaningless.</p><p>Second, every applicant would be required to take and pass an unspecified “biographical questionnaire” to have a shot at entering the profession.</p><p>Third, existing CTI students were left with no advantage in the hiring process, which would be equally open to all off-the-street applicants—their degrees rendered useless for the one specialized job they had trained for.</p><p>The rules had changed, and students and program managers alike were left scrambling to figure out what was going on.</p><p>Days after the announcement, Reilly launched a Facebook group for CTI students and instructors to grapple with what was happening. “This page doesn’t support the ‘angry mob’ mentality or anything but positive ‘We believe in CTI schools’ vibes,” she wrote. “We believe that all of the simulator hours spent, materials studied, and education taught in C.T.I. schools has value and is of worth.”</p><p>More than a hundred people joined in the first day. Brigida and Fischer jumped on quickly, helping Reilly to organize the group and walking the anxious crowd through everything they were learning. Fischer provided status updates, Reilly jumped in with rallying cries and organization (“Save CTI! Save CTI! Save CTI!”), and Brigida gave the group a public face. The next hiring wave would be in February 2014, and the CTI graduates and students waited anxiously, grasping at every bit of information they could find to understand what was going on. </p><p>As the hiring wave approached, some of Reilly’s friends in the program encouraged her to join the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE), telling her it would help improve her chances of being hired. She signed up as the February wave started. Soon, though, she became uneasy with what the organization was doing, particularly after she and the rest of the group got a voice message from FAA employee Shelton Snow:</p><blockquote><p><span> “I know each of you are eager very eager to apply for this job vacancy announcement and trust after tonight you will be able to do so….there is some valuable pieces of information that I have taken a screen shot of and I am going to send that to you via email. Trust and believe it will be something you will appreciate to the utmost. Keep in mind we are trying to maximize your opportunities…I am going to send it out to each of you and as you progress through the stages refer to those images so you will know which icons you should select…I am about 99 point 99 percent sure that it is exactly how you need to answer each question in order to get through the first phase.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-2-156166190" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p></blockquote><p><span>The biographical questionnaire Snow referred to as the “first phase” was an unsupervised questionnaire candidates were expected to take at home. You can take a replica copy </span><a href="https://kaisoapbox.com/projects/faa_biographical_assessment/" rel="">here</a><span>. Questions were chosen and weighted bizarrely, with candidates able to answer “A” to all but one question to get through. Some of the most heavily weighted questions were “The high school subject in which I received my lowest grades was:” (correct answer: science, worth 15 points) and “The college subject in which I received my lowest grades was:” (correct answer: history, for another 15 points). </span></p><p>Reilly, Brigida, and thousands of others found themselves faced with the questionnaire, clicking through a bizarre sequence of questions that would determine whether they could enter the profession they’d been working towards. Faced with the opportunity to cheat, Reilly did not. It cost her a shot at becoming an air traffic controller. Like 85% of their fellow CTI students, Brigida and Reilly found themselves faced with a red exclamation point and a dismissal notice: “Based upon your responses to the Biographical Assessment, we have determined that you are NOT eligible for this position.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png" width="558" height="95" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:95,&quot;width&quot;:558,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:91977,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Failed biographical assessment screen&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Failed biographical assessment screen" title="Failed biographical assessment screen" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29476b44-66b8-4b29-baf2-5d72d72486d3_558x95.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“Based upon your responses to the Biographical Assessment, we have determined that you are NOT eligible for this position as part of the current vacancy announcement.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Their plans had been upended. No chance for appeal. No way around it short of waiting another year and trying again. Despite their qualifications and their passion, they would not be air traffic controllers.</p><p><span>It was clear something odd had happened. But what? The CTI Connection group members worked to fit the pieces of the picture together. In the meantime, a conservative lawyer and former air traffic controller, Michael Pearson, pulled together a website and began recruiting for a class action lawsuit, attracting applicants with a blunt header: </span><strong>“You Have Been Intentionally Discriminated Against.”</strong><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-3-156166190" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>So what happened? Why did the FAA upend a stable hiring process, undercut the CTI schools it had established to train its workforce, and throw the plans of thousands of eager would-be air traffic controllers into disarray? I give a bare-bones accounting of the background in another article, but there are a few more details worth adding in this one.</p><p><span>Throughout the ‘90s and ‘00s, the FAA faced pressure to diversify its field of air traffic controllers, historically a profession that has been primarily white men, notably from the NBCFAE.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-4-156166190" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> In the early 2000s, this pressure focused on the newly developed air traffic control qualification test, the AT-SAT, which the NBCFAE hired Dr. Outtz to critique from an adverse impact standpoint. As originally scored, the test was intended to pass 60% of applicants, but predictions suggested only 3% of black applicants would pass.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-5-156166190" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> In response, the FAA reweighted the scoring to make the test easier to pass, reducing its correlation with job performance as they did so.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-6-156166190" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> In its final form, some 95% of applicants passed the test.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-7-156166190" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p><span>This was a bit of a shell game. In practice, they divided it into a “well qualified” band (with scores between 85 and 100 on the test, met by around 60% of applicants) and a “qualified” band (with scores between 70 and 84), and drew some 87% of selections from that “well qualified” band.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-8-156166190" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span> Large racial disparities remained in the “well qualified” band. As a result, facing continued pressure, the FAA began to investigate ways to deprioritize the test. </span></p><p><span>Why not ditch it altogether? Simple: the test worked. It had “strong predictive validity,” outperforming “most other strategies in predicting mean performance,” and it was low cost and low time commitment. On average, people who performed better on the test actually did perform better as air traffic controllers, and this was never really in dispute.

They weighed adverse impact against predicted job performance, decided the performance hit was worthwhile, and prepared the New Year’s Eve letter as a result. </span></p><p>The CTI program was popular and successful before the barrier analysis. After 2013, though, the FAA began to treat its CTI schools as a liability. After the biographical questionnaire, per conversations with CTI administrators, the FAA simply tried to pretend the CTI schools did not exist. The FAA cut off communication, treating them tersely and with disdain. </p><p>The schools were not bastions of privilege. The programs were often at community colleges and junior colleges, with diverse student bodies and professors who worked long hours helping them. They were successful and effective at what they did, and had provided a steady stream of applicants who saw a clear path into the profession. Suddenly, though, they were left scrambling to justify their existence. Fischer talks about how he used to get lots of calls from students asking how to become an air traffic controller, but after 2013, that mostly stopped. He emphasizes that the FAA was never there to give him a job, and if they wanted to change, that was their prerogative. A lot of the problem, and a lot of the sore feelings between the FAA and the CTI schools, came because of the abruptness of the change, the lack of communication, the sudden cutting off.</p><p>Fischer, alongside other program directors like Joe Eichelberger, began to organize the CTI schools and take meticulous notes. What were success rates like before the scandal? What about after? What had happened, and why? How could they continue to justify their programs to students who could no longer trust that there would be jobs waiting at the other end? </p><p><span>The CTI Connection people working to bring the story to light wanted it to remain focused and nonpartisan. They struggled to get media coverage until Adam Shapiro of Fox Business took note of their story, releasing the investigation </span><em><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/trouble-in-the-skies-fox-business-special-investigation" rel="">Trouble in the Skies</a><span> </span></em><span>in 2015, in which he told Reilly’s story and outlined everything understood about the hiring scandal up to that point. Other than Shapiro, no media figures took particular notice of the scandal, no matter what Reilly, Fischer, and the others did. CNN considered the story, then declined to run it. </span></p><p><span>Reilly kept folders of CTI class member’s stories, rushing around DC trying to get them in the right hands. She handed one folder to New Jersey congressman and Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Frank LoBiondo before the Fox Business report hit the press. Immediately after the report, LoBiondo </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/aviation-subcommittee-chair-lobiondo-blasts-faa-hiring-practices" rel="">gave a few remarks</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>It’s an incredible safety concern… what we’re dealing with here is a shortage of air traffic controllers.

Ask Jorge Rojas. </p><p>Jorge Rojas always wanted to be an air traffic controller. He went to CTI school right after high school and saw all of the 2014 chaos from a distance. In 2015, when he became eligible to take the questionnaire, he did so. Failed. Took it again in 2016. Failed. It was only after Congress explicitly passed a law rejecting the FAA’s use of the biographical questionnaire that he had an opportunity to enter the role. He worked for the FAA for five years before returning to become a government contractor. But he was frustrated—frustrated on his behalf, frustrated on the behalf of others who had had their lives thrown into turmoil. So he began filing FOIA requests.</p><p>Rojas filed hundreds of requests over the course of multiple years. The FAA delayed some, rejected others, and per Rojas, took the stance that “he’s not going to sue us for all of them.” Sometimes, he even went back to FOIA his FOIAs, to see what was taking so long and how they were responding. Five separate times, he took the FAA to court over refusals and delays.</p><p><span>In 2021, one of Rojas’s court battles made it all the way up to a petititon for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The question: could the FAA hold that “intra-agency memorandums or letters” included documents provided by APTMetrics, a private, outside consultant? Per the 9th Circuit, it could.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-17-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-17-156166190" target="_self" rel="">17</a></span><span> </span></p><p>After long delays and repeated sanctions, the FAA finally produced some of the key documents. He got the questionnaire, the answer key. He got the investigation into Shelton Snow. As of last year when I spoke with him, the FAA was still gradually, periodically, releasing documents to him, responding to FOIAs from back in 2016. </p><p>Along the whole way, Michael Pearson, soon aided by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, worked diligently on the case. Mountain States Legal Foundation is a small non-profit firm; the case is an ambitious one. They have spent years gathering evidence, arguing in court, pushing for class certification, and preparing to bring the case to trial. The case is scheduled to go to trial next year. </p><p><span>After a tragic airplane crash last Wednesday, President Trump and Vice President Vance ensured the hiring scandal could not possibly be forgotten any longer, referencing it explicitly during their remarks on the crash before Trump signed </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/immediate-assessment-of-aviation-safety/" rel="">a memorandum</a><span> demanding immediate investigation into DEI tactics in the FAA, referencing the biographical questionnaire by name. Brigida was glad to see Trump draw attention to the scandal. Others in the class are frustrated to see the way it’s been weaponized to attack not just initiatives that lower the bar, but initiatives that give opportunities for exposure and mentorship to people who would never otherwise realize aviation is an option.</span></p><p>Caleb Benner, who graduated in 2012 from Purdue University’s Aviation Management program, one of the FAA’s designated CTI programs, spent his entire childhood dreaming of becoming an air traffic controller. When other kids responded “firefighter” or “police officer” when asked “What do you want to do when you grow up?”, he always said “air traffic controller.” He took the AT-SAT after graduation and got a score in the high 90s, only for hiring to be hit by sequestration before he could apply. When they came out of sequestration and he was preparing to apply properly, he learned about the Biographical Assessment after the New Year’s Eve announcement. He took it. He failed.</p><p>After failing the assessment, he spent multiple years working a job paying $10 an hour, one he specifically chose so it would be easy to uproot and go to the Academy to train when he got the call. The call never came. Eventually, he gave up, paid to get his aircraft dispatcher’s license, and moved on. </p><p>Benner hates that this accident brought the scandal to the forefront after a decade in the courts, and is not fond of how Trump has handled it. But, as he puts it, “That doesn’t change how blatantly wrong it was what the FAA did. And I spent what seems like every day of my career dealing with the consequences of those decisions.”</p><p>Others tell similar stories. Another CTI grad tells me he became a police dispatcher (“to sate my need to talk into a headset for 8 hours a day”) and worked on getting a private rotorcraft license afterward—explained that he didn’t feel bitter, exactly, but he felt wronged. Robbed. </p><p>Reilly has remained a passionate advocate for the issue over the years. She reached out to me almost immediately after I published my original article, providing an extensive look at the years of conversations, advocacy, and work the scandal has taken. She has moved on to work in air traffic management. She remains a passionate advocate for women in aviation and spends time volunteering on youth outreach programs. Last year, she organized an event at the Reagan airport in DC, busing in 150 girls from a Title 1 school. Many, she said, had never seen an airplane up close before. </p><p>In a moment of dark irony, the sort of diversity-focused work she’s passionate about—not lowering the bar, but inspiring more people and providing them with mentorship and opportunity to reach it—is threatened by Trump’s memorandum. </p><p>Has this had a long-term impact on aviation safety and air traffic controller shortages? Likely yes. </p><p>An active air traffic controller reached out to me at the end of January last year, talking about his frustration that so many qualified individuals were eliminated from entering training, contributing to a dire staffing shortage. His facility was operating at less than 75%, with controllers fatigued from working 6-day weeks. As he explained it, training can take 1.5 to 2.5 years at larger facilities, with washout rates from 30-60%, and when we spoke upper level facilities were only accepting transfers from lower level facilities, adding years to preparation time. Every issue compounds and adds to the problem over time, and the FAA’s 2013 changes set staffing back years. The FAA, he said, simply is not bringing in enough people to match the number leaving, with some air traffic controllers believing the agency is failing on purpose to find an excuse to privatize them. </p><p>A controller who worked for 25 years and retired in 2015 spoke with me last January as well. He had been offered a position at Oklahoma City to instruct new students. Per him, the ideal candidate can go from street to fully certified in about 4 years, while some trainees during his last few years had been training for 6-8 years. He alleged a pattern where some students were trained for years longer than others, rarely washed out, and were quietly checked out and promoted away from direct air traffic control positions into management.</p><p>Another retired controller and supervisor who formerly worked at the Chicago ARTCC echoed his story, claiming the FAA would regularly change the “best qualified list,” with those responsible for promotions changing requirements depending on who they wanted to promote. He was never told to certify an inadequate trainee, he said, but “the pressure was mounting.”</p><p>Applicant quality matters in several ways. Weaker applicants are more likely to drop out in training, to take longer going through the pipeline and in on-the-job training (where experienced controllers have to work directly with them, taking other bodies off the job), and to wind up working in less busy airfields. This matters particularly because there are fixed numbers each year and the pipeline takes several years to get through, so real problems take a few years to filter through the pipeline and be felt. </p><p>The 2014 change materially shifted applicant quality on net. While it is technically and tautologically true that everyone who makes it through training is qualified, the “qualified” bar on the AT-SAT eliminated very few candidates, with quality maintained mostly by the “well qualified” bar. Higher scores were genuinely predictive of better performance, and 2014 shifted applicant population. </p><p>Not only that, it shattered the pipeline the FAA had built with CTI schools, making the process towards becoming an air traffic controller less certain, undercutting many of the most passionate people working to train prospective controllers, and leading to a tense and unclear relationship between the FAA and feeder organizations. </p><p>Did anyone truly unqualified make it all the way through the pipeline?

In part because of that, I don’t think this story can be treated as complete without making the undercurrent of its interaction with political partisanship clear and speaking directly to those sympathetic to one side or the other.</p><p>First, to liberals:</p><p>I dislike Trump as much as anyone. Maybe I’m not supposed to play my hand like that while reporting a news article, but it’s true. I’ve wanted him out of politics since he entered the scene a decade ago, I voted against him three elections in a row, and I think he’s had a uniquely destructive effect within US politics. So I understand—please believe, I understand—just how disquieting it is to watch him stand up and blame DEI after a major tragedy. </p><p><span>But Democrats did not handle it. The scandal occurred under the Obama administration. The FAA minimized it, obscured it, fought FOIA requests through multiple lawsuits, and stonewalled the public for years as the class action lawsuit rolled forward. The Trump administration missed it, too, for a term, and it’s likely most officials simply didn’t hear about it through the first few years of the Biden administration. No outlets left of Fox Business bothered to provide more than a cursory examination of it, and it never made much of a dent on the official record. Even when the New York Times ran </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/business/air-traffic-controllers-safety.html" rel="">a thoroughly reported article on air traffic controller shortages</a><span> late last year, it never touched the scandal. It was possible to miss it.</span></p><p><span>I was optimistic, then, when the story went viral again last year. I badly wanted the Biden admin to rise to the occasion, speak plainly and frankly in response to the scandal, and defuse this time bomb. I wanted other, more mainstream outlets to cover the story, but none did so. I found that a source familiar with the department’s operations learned the story from my article for the first time, but when I reached out to the FAA and the Department of Transportation with specific questions for comment, they told me they could not comment on pending litigation and provided me only boilerplate to use.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-18-156166190" href="https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring#footnote-18-156166190" target="_self" rel="">18</a></span><span> After that? Radio silence.</span></p><p>The class members have mixed sentiments as things stand. Some are thrilled that what they see as the scourge of destructive DEI initiatives is finally being addressed. Others are liberals who are frustrated and hurt that something they worked so hard to keep nonpartisan, a real scandal that hurt them, can now be little but a partisan wedge, and they’re not happy with the way Trump is handling it.</p><p>Trump isn’t handling the scandal how I would, but when is that not true? I expect collateral damage, I expect intense partisanship and noise, I expect chaos. But at the core, fundamentally, I can’t be unhappy that after a decade, a President finally brought attention to the scandal. </p><p>I realize political expediency makes talking about the scandal a losing battle for Democrats now that the Biden admin declined to fix it, but a lot of the class members were badly hoping it could be resolved in a nuanced bipartisan way. It's a partisan cudgel right now because the FAA elected to sweep it under the rug for three administrations in a row rather than frankly and honestly cutting out the rot.</p><p>Fundamentally, people should not be forced to choose between “burn it all down” and “sweep it under the rug.” People should not be forced to choose between lowering the bar and rejecting all outreach to struggling communities. Given the recent election, Democrats have years to build a vision of diversity that involves providing more opportunities for everyone to reach a high bar, not lowering the bar—one that involves making institutions work, not obfuscating institutional failure until it can no longer be hidden. </p><p>The time is right for this, and not only can it happen, it should happen. The right way to draw a contrast with Trump is not denying that there was ever an issue, but showing that people who fundamentally believe in the value of institutions and in extending opportunity to a diverse citizenship understand the issues and are prepared to solve them better than bomb-throwers ever could. </p><p>Finally, to conservatives: </p><p><span>I know, I know. The evidence is unambiguous that the bar was lowered, deliberately, over many years and with direct knowledge. The evidence is unambiguous that a cheating scandal occurred. The whole thing is as explosive as any I’ve seen, and it touches on a lot of long-running frustrations. </span><a href="https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1884989215244460398" rel="">Drink my lib tears</a><span>, rub it in my face—this happened, the institutions covered it up and danced around it for years, conservative organizations were more-or-less the only ones who rose to the demand to help bring justice for it or cover it over the course of a decade, and administrations diligently ignored it until Trump made it impossible to ignore. The people who played roles in bringing this all to light and ensuring it couldn’t simply be forgotten all deserve credit—yes, including </span><a href="https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1750752522917027983" rel="">Steve Sailer</a><span>, whose feud with Will Stancil a year ago is what brought it to my attention. </span></p><p>All of that is true. But please, as you’re handling this—as you’re digging up the corruption, understanding the failure, rooting through the mess—remember that without principled, brave, honest people like Moranda Reilly, all of this might have stayed hidden forever. It all could have died in obscurity. Remember that at root, this really is a bipartisan issue, and many of the class members really do believe in the value of diversity programs that provide a wider range of people opportunity to meet a high bar. </p><p>I know Democrats had a chance to clean it up, and they didn’t, and now you’re going to do things your way. I get that. But please remember the people at the root, and remember that it took a whole lot more than just conservatives to fight this. </p><p>All the best.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/transputer_1.jpg" width="50%" alt="Transputer homebrew board"></p><p>
Once upon a time when I was a teen, I wrote an almost full Pascal compiler for a transputer processor (the FILE type wasn't never completed). The Pascal language was designed in 1971 by Niklaus Wirth, as an educative version of the language Algol, which dates from 1960. It reached its highest popularity with Turbo Pascal and Delphi from Borland. Borland was founded by Philippe Kahn, who studied Pascal with Wirth.
</p>
<p>
This year 1993 was the convergence of several things I had been learning: Pascal (through <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-byte-book-of-pascal/">The BYTE Book of Pascal</a>), code generation (Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools), and transputer programming.
</p>
<p>
It was a time when the INMOS transputer promised parallel computing for everyone, but it was too expensive. They did a few good things, like 32-bit processing, and a very fast T805 transputer with 64-bit floating-point before the Intel 486DX2 was a thing.
</p>
<h2>In the start there was a transputer</h2>
<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/transputer_2.jpg" width="50%" alt="Transputer homebrew board"></p><p>
My father got a pair of transputer chips and the required peripheral chips. It was 1992, and the transputer chip price was $500,000 Mexican pesos. In case you want a reference, a kilo of tortilla was available for $1,000 pesos.
</p>
<p>
He made schematics and my duty was redoing these using my schematic drawing software. He wrote also long pages of handwriting explaining how it worked, and I would type in everything and print clean documents. 
</p>
<p>
My father wrote small test programs, and he would go on a long discussion about how the fastest Fibonacci algorithm would demonstrate something, and it would form the basis for higher-level algorithms. He was delighted trying algorithms and optimizing for whole days, and he also said that this processor was the fastest in the world.
</p>
<p>
The year 1993 came fast, I was a teen (age 14), and I was bored. I thought that if the processor was so fast then there should be way to test its potential. Whenever he was testing new instructions for the processor, I would read surreptitiously the processor manual, trying to find a way in my mind to bootstrap something, and doing a mental comparison of my Z80 and 8086 knowledge against the strange stack-based transputer processor.
</p>
<p>
I also studied some FORTH (named as the herald to the fourth generation languages, but the operating system of its developer only allowed five letters for the name), but I never fully understood how the compiler built its word set.
</p>
<h2>This thing was fast!</h2>
<p>
In a complete serendipity, I was reading The BYTE Book of Pascal which talked a lot about reverse-Polish notation (another name for calculations made over a stack), and I had got recently the Spanish edition of Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools book, which I was struggling to understand.
</p>
<p>
I started my exploration in unknown lands with a loop. A barebones simple loop to see how fast was the processor. I typed the code for the loop, made it to count 1 million times (well, 1048576 times), and I was astonished to see that in fact, the processor ran faster than anything I had tested before. The Z280 processor could run a 65536 times loop in under a second, but the transputer was counting one million in under a second.
</p>
<p>
The transputer board was essentially the T805 processor surrounded by 32K of high-speed RAM memory, and only able to send and receive serial data through a transceiver. No screen, no keyboard, no sound. The Z280-based computer developed previously served as a host.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I was enticed to do something more complex, and my first project was writing an assembler for the T805. This way I could code more complex projects for testing.
</p>
<p>
The transputer has this weird thing that its basic instructions are of different length. Loading a constant from 0-15 was achieved with a single byte instruction, but each further 4 bits required another byte. Loading a full 32-bit constant would require 8 bytes. Implementing an assembler for this beast required a complete rethinking of my approach to assemblers. It took me several months of the year 1993 to get it running.
</p>
<p>
This first assembler was written in Z280 machine code. It took the source code from a file, assembled it, and expanded the transputer instructions as needed until it achieved a zero-change stability.
</p>
<p>
The Z280 processor has the ability to run as a common Z80 getting code and data from $0000-$ffff, and setting up a 64K MMU area for system and another 64K for user. I used the extended instructions to get a 64K text buffer for my text editor, and to build there the data required for the assembler.
</p>
<p>
Once I had a working assembler, I built easily a system monitor to develop programs. It was a whole new world for me, as I never had worked with a 32-bit processor.
</p>
<p>
My success with the assembler directed me to another objective, P-code portability. I already had adapted the Tiny Pascal compiler written in BASIC that appeared in The Byte Book of Pascal to run in the Z280 machine, not a great effort as the original compiler run on an 8080 machine, as it is pretty compatible with Z80. It generated P-code (a pseudo code) that was interpreted to run the compiled Pascal programs.
</p>
<p>
But what if instead of a P-code interpreter, I could write a P-code translator to transputer assembler? I went to work and I made a quick&amp;dirty converter of P-code to transputer, and I was pretty happy although the compiler running in BASIC language was incredibly slow.
</p>
<p>
Also the generated code was incredibly inefficient.
</p>
<h2>Enter the dragon</h2>
<p>
It was July when I finally understood the utility of the tree generation for expressions. The function <i>gencode</i> from the Dragon's book (section 9.10, figure 9.25) was a complete inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Up to that point in time, all my compilers suffered from an excess of unnecessary <i>push</i> and <i>pop</i> instructions along some pretty basic peephole optimization, because I didn't knew how to optimize it properly. Now, the total number of registers in the transputer was 3 (A, B, and C), and just by ordering the tree I could optimize it in an amazing way and the generated code was very compact.
</p>
<p>
Still the BASIC language was too slow for bigger programs, even more as I started to figure that the Pascal compiler could be written in Pascal. I decide to code it using Turbo Pascal in MS-DOS.
</p>
<p>
In September 27, 1993, I started porting the compiler to Pascal. It took me two days to complete the basic compiler, and I was pretty happy to see it working. To my dismay, it exceeded the 32K of memory I had available in the transputer board.
</p>
<p>
I needed 25K of RAM to execute the compiler, and if it was going to self-compile I needed another 25K for the data. I tried all the possible ways to optimize it, to no avail, until two days later, my father surprised me putting 128K of RAM in the board, and I was able to load it.
</p>
<p>
I got back to the Z280 machine where I used my text editor to keep developing the compiler. I made a "driver" program that feed all the source code to the transputer, and get back the compiled code to the disk drive. The resulting assembler code was still assembled over the Z280 machine.
</p>
<p>
I found the few errors in the compiler and the assembler, and my Pascal compiler was up and running. I was ecstatic after managing to get the Pascal compiler to compile itself in the transputer board.
</p>
<p>
I was also learning there were standards. Niklaus Wirth did an amazing job specifying the Pascal language, and I was fortunate enough to have some Pascal books around.
</p>
<p>
Soon I had my first objective: a full Pascal compiler. Wasn't more like teens should be losing time in arcades? Anyways, I worked step by step on improving the Pascal compiler, and each little achievement was pretty rewarding for me. It was an enormous success implementing the floating-point support, although made easier because the transputer had the integrated floating-point instructions. Some optimizations got almost 100% speed-up for compiled programs.
</p>
<p>
At the end, it took me a little over a month to create an almost full Pascal compiler. I never made the final milestone of doing the FILE type, mostly because I didn't understand how it worked. I also divided the compiler in several pieces (each one less than 64K) so I could edit the growing compiler with my own text editor.
</p>
<p>
I had a Ray Tracing book and I started ported the code to Pascal, and the whole November 1993 I was debugging my Pascal compiler and improving the optimization to generate ray traced images. I was incredibly happy. I'll update this if I find the source code and images.
</p>
<p>
I was pretty sure Pascal was the future, until I started to become uncomfortable with the Pascal's strong typing, as it was pretty limiting when trying to do system programming.
</p>
<p>
I built confidence with this Pascal compiler, and it served me as a good experience for my next achievement: a C compiler for transputer. But that will be another history.
</p>
<h2>32 years later</h2>
<p>
    I cannot believe now is the year 2025. My Pascal compiler today stands out as a curiosity, and a testament to my effort. An almost full Pascal compiler written by a tech-savvy teen, I never noticed I could have sold it. Every software development utility at the time had a very high price, even more for the transputer.
</p>
<p>
For this article I've extracted the last version of my Pascal compiler, and given we don't have the host Z280 computer, I had to write the support software in modern C. Namely the emulator for the transputer processor, and the assembler.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy it!

<h4>An excerpt from</h4>
<h2>They Thought They Were Free</h2>

<h3>Milton Mayer</h3>

<p><p><img src="https://press.uchicago.edu/Images/Chicago/dotclear.gif" width="420" height="2"></p></p>

<h5>But Then It Was Too Late</h5>

<p>"What no one seemed to notice," said a colleague of mine, a philologist, "was the ever widening gap, after 1933, between the government and the people. Just think how very wide this gap was to begin with, here in Germany. And it became always wider. You know, it doesn’t make people close to their government to be told that this is a people’s government, a true democracy, or to be enrolled in civilian defense, or even to vote. All this has little, really nothing, to do with <i>knowing</i> one is governing.</p>

<p>"What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little by little, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if the people could not understand it, it could not be released because of national security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.</p>

<p>"This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter.</p>

<p>"You will understand me when I say that my Middle High German was my life. It was all I cared about. I was a scholar, a specialist. Then, suddenly, I was plunged into all the new activity, as the university was drawn into the new situation; meetings, conferences, interviews, ceremonies, and, above all, papers to be filled out, reports, bibliographies, lists, questionnaires. And on top of that were the demands in the community, the things in which one had to, was ‘expected to’ participate that had not been there or had not been important before. It was all rigmarole, of course, but it consumed all one’s energies, coming on top of the work one really wanted to do. You can see how easy it was, then, not to think about fundamental things. One had no time."</p>

<p>"Those," I said, "are the words of my friend the baker. ‘One had no time to think. There was so much going on.’"</p>

<p>"Your friend the baker was right," said my colleague. "The dictatorship, and the whole process of its coming into being, was above all <i>diverting</i>. It provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway. I do not speak of your ‘little men,’ your baker and so on; I speak of my colleagues and myself, learned men, mind you. Most of us did not want to think about fundamental things and never had. There was no need to. Nazism gave us some dreadful, fundamental things to think about—we were decent people—and kept us so busy with continuous changes and ‘crises’ and so fascinated, yes, fascinated, by the machinations of the ‘national enemies,’ without and within, that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that were growing, little by little, all around us. Unconsciously, I suppose, we were grateful. Who wants to think?</p>

<p>"To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it—please try to believe me—unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, ‘regretted,’ that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these ‘little measures’ that no ‘patriotic German’ could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.</p>

<p>"How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinary men? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, <i>Principiis obsta</i> and <i>Finem respice</i>—‘Resist the beginnings’ and ‘Consider the end.’ But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things <i>might</i> have. And everyone counts on that <i>might</i>.</p>

<p>"Your ‘little men,’ your Nazi friends, were not against National Socialism in principle. Men like me, who were, are the greater offenders, not because we <i>knew</i> better (that would be too much to say) but because we <i>sensed</i> better. Pastor Niemöller spoke for the thousands and thousands of men like me when he spoke (too modestly of himself) and said that, when the Nazis attacked the Communists, he was a little uneasy, but, after all, he was not a Communist, and so he did nothing; and then they attacked the Socialists, and he was a little uneasier, but, still, he was not a Socialist, and he did nothing; and then the schools, the press, the Jews, and so on, and he was always uneasier, but still he did nothing. And then they attacked the Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something—but then it was too late."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"You see," my colleague went on, "one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’</p>

<p>"And you <i>are</i> an alarmist. You are saying that <i>this</i> must lead to <i>this</i>, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.</p>

<p>"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must <i>make</i> an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.</p>

<p>"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. <i>That’s</i> the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.</p>

<p>"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.</p>

<p>"You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.</p>

<p>"Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.</p>

<p>"What then? You must then shoot yourself. A few did. Or ‘adjust’ your principles. Many tried, and some, I suppose, succeeded; not I, however. Or learn to live the rest of your life with your shame. This last is the nearest there is, under the circumstances, to heroism: shame. Many Germans became this poor kind of hero, many more, I think, than the world knows or cares to know."</p>

<p>I said nothing. I thought of nothing to say.</p>

<p>"I can tell you," my colleague went on, "of a man in Leipzig, a judge. He was not a Nazi, except nominally, but he certainly wasn’t an anti-Nazi. He was just—a judge. In ’42 or ’43, early ’43, I think it was, a Jew was tried before him in a case involving, but only incidentally, relations with an ‘Aryan’ woman. This was ‘race injury,’ something the Party was especially anxious to punish. In the case at bar, however, the judge had the power to convict the man of a ‘nonracial’ offense and send him to an ordinary prison for a very long term, thus saving him from Party ‘processing’ which would have meant concentration camp or, more probably, deportation and death. But the man was innocent of the ‘nonracial’ charge, in the judge’s opinion, and so, as an honorable judge, he acquitted him. Of course, the Party seized the Jew as soon as he left the courtroom."</p>

<p>"And the judge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the judge. He could not get the case off his conscience—a case, mind you, in which he had acquitted an innocent man. He thought that he should have convicted him and saved him from the Party, but how could he have convicted an innocent man? The thing preyed on him more and more, and he had to talk about it, first to his family, then to his friends, and then to acquaintances. (That’s how I heard about it.) After the ’44 <i>Putsch</i> they arrested him. After that, I don’t know."</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Once the war began," my colleague continued, "resistance, protest, criticism, complaint, all carried with them a multiplied likelihood of the greatest punishment. Mere lack of enthusiasm, or failure to show it in public, was ‘defeatism.’ You assumed that there were lists of those who would be ‘dealt with’ later, after the victory. Goebbels was very clever here, too. He continually promised a ‘victory orgy’ to ‘take care of’ those who thought that their ‘treasonable attitude’ had escaped notice. And he meant it; <i>that</i> was not just propaganda. And that was enough to put an end to all uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Once the war began, the government could do anything ‘necessary’ to win it; so it was with the ‘final solution of the Jewish problem,’ which the Nazis always talked about but never dared undertake, not even the Nazis, until war and its ‘necessities’ gave them the knowledge that they could get away with it. The people abroad who thought that war against Hitler would help the Jews were wrong. And the people in Germany who, once the war had begun, still thought of complaining, protesting, resisting, were betting on Germany’s losing the war. It was a long bet. Not many made it."</p>

<div><p>Huawei's HiSilicon Ascend 910C is a version of the company's Ascend 910 processor for AI training introduced in 2019. By now, the performance of the Ascend 910 is barely sufficient for the cost-efficient training of large AI models. Still, when it comes to inference, it delivers 60% of Nvidia's H100 performance, according to researchers from DeepSeek. While the Ascend 910C is not a performance champion, it can succeed in reducing China's reliance on Nvidia GPUs.</p><p>

<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ETHwNxWl04mqQt04o0zO8g" data-url="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ETHwNxWl04mqQt04o0zO8g" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Testing by DeepSeek</a> revealed that the 910C processor exceeded expectations in inference performance. Additionally, with manual optimizations of CUNN kernels, its efficiency could be further improved. DeepSeek's native support for Ascend processors and its PyTorch repository allows for seamless CUDA-to-CUNN conversion with minimal effort, making it easier to integrate Huawei's hardware into AI workflows.</p><p>

This suggests that Huawei's AI processor's capabilities are advancing rapidly, despite sanctions by the U.S. government and the lack of access to leading-edge process technologies of TSMC.</p><p>

While Huawei and SMIC have managed to catch up with TSMC's capabilities in the 2019–2020 era and produce a chip that can be considered competitive with Nvidia's A100 and H100 processors, the Ascend 910C is not the best option for AI training. AI training remains a domain where Nvidia maintains its undisputable lead.</p><p>

DeepSeek's Yuchen Jin said that long-term training reliability is a critical weakness of Chinese processors. This challenge stems from the deep integration of Nvidia's hardware and software ecosystem, which has been developed over two decades. While inference performance can be optimized, sustained training workloads require further improvements in Huawei's hardware and software stack.</p><p>

Just like the original Ascend 910, the new Ascend 910C uses chiplet packaging, and its main compute SoC has around 53 billion transistors. While the original compute chiplet of the Ascend 910 was made by TSMC using its N7+ fabrication technology (7nm-class with EUV), the compute chiplet of the Ascend 910C is made by SMIC on its 2nd Generation 7nm-class process technology known as N+2.</p><p>

Looking ahead, some experts predict that as AI models converge to Transformer architectures, the importance of Nvidia's software ecosystem may decline. DeepSeek's expertise in the optimization of hardware and software could also significantly reduce dependency on Nvidia, offering AI companies a more cost-effective alternative, particularly for inference. However, to compete at a global scale, China must overcome the challenge of training stability and further refine its AI computing infrastructure.</p></div><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ozjb4bvTthyphnjCyjp4HF"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

<p>Ah, <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. I have a love-hate relationship with this one. A “new” (reading: <em>appeared a couple years ago</em>,
already — yes, <em>already</em>), language with high ambitions. Zig was made to run at low-level, with a simple design
to solve many problems C has (macros, allocators, error handling, more powerful types like baked-in tagged
unions and bitsets, a better build system, no hidden control flow, etc.). The language claims to be the C
successor, and today, many people claim that Zig is simpler and even safer than most languages out there —
even Rust! — allowing to focus more on the technical challenges around your problem space rather
than — quoting from the Zig mantra — <em>your language knowledge</em>. I think I need to put the full mantra
because I will reuse it through this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will come back to that.</p>
<p>I had already <a href="https://strongly-typed-thoughts.net/blog/zig-linear-pwtp">written about Zig a while ago</a> when I
initially approached it. I thought the language was really interesting and I needed to dig deeper. That blog
article was made in July, 2024. I’m writing these lines in February, 2025. Time has passed, and yet I have been
busy rewriting some Rust code of mine in Zig, and trying out new stuff <em>not really easy or doable in Rust</em>, in
Zig, just to see the kind of power I have.</p>
<p>Today, I want to provide a more matured opinion of Zig. I need to make the obvious disclaimer that because I
mainly work in Rust — both spare-time and work — I have a bias here (and I have a long past of Haskell projects
too). Also, take notice that Zig is still in its pre-1.0 era (but heck, people still mention that <em>Bun</em>,
<em>Tigerbeetle</em>, <em>Ghostty</em> are all written in Zig, even though it hasn’t reached 1.0).</p>
<p>I split this article in two simple sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>What I like about Zig.</li>
<li>What I dislike about Zig.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I like</h2>
<h3>Arbitrary sized-integers and packed structs</h3>
<p>Zig has many interesting properties. The first one that comes to mind is its <em>arbitrary-sized integers</em>. That
sounds weird at first, but yes, you can have the regular <code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code> etc., but also <code>u3</code>. At first it
might sound like dark magic, but it makes sense with a good example that is actually a defect in Rust to me.</p>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>struct Flags {
  bool clear_screen;
  bool reset_input;
  bool exit;
};

// …
if (flags.clear_screen || flags.reset_input) {
  // …
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is some very typical need: you want a set of flags (booleans) and depending on their state, you want to
perform some actions. Usually — at least in C, but really everyone should do it this way — we don’t represent
such flags as structs of booleans, because booleans are — most of the time — 8-bit integers. What it means is
that <code>sizeof(Flags)</code> here is <code>3</code> bytes (24 bits, 8 * 3). For 3 bits of information. So what we do instead is
to use a single byte and perform some bitwise operations to extract the bits:</p>
<pre><code>#define FLAGS_CLEAR_SCREEN 0b001
#define FLAGS_RESET_INPUT  0b010
#define FLAGS_EXIT         0b100

struct Flags {
  uint8_t bits;
};

bool Flags_contains(Flags const* flags, uint8_t bit) {
  return flags.bits &amp; bit != 0;
}

Flags Flags_set(Flags flags, uint8_t bit) {
  flags.bits |= bit;
  return flags;
}

Flags Flags_unset(Flags flags, uint8_t bit) {
  flags.bits &amp;= ~bit;
  return flags;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is obviously very error-prone: we use CPP macros (yikes), bits are not properly typed, etc. Zig can
use its arbitrary-sized integer types and <em>packed structs</em> to automatically implement similar code:</p>
<pre><code>const Flags = packed struct {
  clear_screen: bool,
  reset_input: bool,
  exit: bool,
};
</code></pre>
<p>This structure has two <em>sizes</em>: its bit-size, and its byte-size. The bit-size represents the minimum
number of bits it uses (3), and the byte-size represents the number of bytes required to hold the type
(1). We can then use it like so:</p>
<pre><code>if (flags.clear_screen or flags.reset_input) {
  // …
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an awesome feature, especially because lots of C libraries expect such bitfields, for instance
in the form of a <code>u32</code>. You can easily and naturally convert the <code>Flags</code> type to a <code>u32</code> with
<code>@bitCast(flags)</code> — you need to ensure the booleans are in the right order (big endianness here in Zig
if I recall correctly).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: in Rust, we don’t really have a nice way to do this without requiring a dependency on
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/bitflags">bitflags</a>, which still requires you to provide the binary value of each logical boolean in binary,
usually done with <code>const</code> expressions using <code>1 &lt;&lt; n</code>..</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Generic types are just functions at the type level</h3>
<p>As a Haskeller, this is also something that makes a lot of sense to me. A typical <code>struct Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> in
most languages is actually a function taking a <code>type</code> and returning a <code>type</code> in Zig;
<code>fn Vec(comptime T: type) type</code>.</p>
<p>Although more verbose, it allows a lot of flexbility, without introducing a new layer specific to the type
system. For instance, specialization can be written in the most natural way:</p>
<pre><code>fn Vec(comptime T: type) type {
  if (@sizeOf(T) == 0) {
    return VecAsUsize;
  } else {
    return struct {
      // …
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another use case that I think is pretty nice is when you need to implement something that depends on the actual
type structure. Zig has compile-time reflection, which means that you can analyze the fields, type information
etc. of a type to implement a specialized version of your algorithm. You can then write your JSON serializer
without depending on a middleware (e.g. in Rust, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">serde</a>).</p>
<h3>Error Union Types</h3>
<p>This one is a half love / half dislike — you will find the dislike part in the appropriate section of this article.
In Zig, the core of error handling is Error Union Types. It’s straight-forward: take an <code>enum</code> (integer tags)
and glue it with a regular <code>T</code> value in a tagged union. You either get the error discriminant, or your
<code>T</code> value. In Rust terms:</p>
<pre><code>enum ErrorUnion&lt;T&gt; {
  Err(ErrorType),
  Ok(T),
}
</code></pre>
<p>There’s a catch, though. Unlike Rust, <code>ErrorType</code> is global to your whole program, and is nominally typed. Error
types are declared with the <code>error {}</code> construct:</p>
<pre><code>const MyError = error {
  FileNotFound,
  NoPermision,
};
</code></pre>
<p>Error types can be glued together to create more complex error types:</p>
<pre><code>const OtherError = error {
  OOM,
  NotANumber,
};

const AppError = MyError || OtherError;
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, an Error Union Type is <em>either an error or a value</em>, and it’s written <code>E!T</code> (<code>E</code> the error type, <code>T</code>
the value). An interesting aspect of that is that <em>all</em> error types are flat (there is no nesting), and
because they are nominal, you can even return error values without declaring them in the first place. If
you do not care about the actual type of your error, you can use the <code>anyerror</code> special type to refer to
the global error type, or leave it empty (<code>!T</code>) to infer the type based on the body of the function.</p>
<p>All of that is interesting, but one <em>very cool</em> aspect that I think I really miss when writing Rust is
coercion. Because of coercion rules, a regular value <code>T</code> coerces to <code>E!T</code>, and an error type <code>E</code> coerces to
<code>E!T</code>. So you can completely write this:</p>
<pre><code>fn foo() !i32 {
  return 3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the same is true for <code>void</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn checkOrError(input: i32) !void {
  if (input &lt; 10) {
    return error.TooSmall;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is no need to wrap results in “success paths”, such as <code>Ok(())</code> in Rust.</p>
<h3>C interop is probably the best</h3>
<p>If you need to work with C libraries a lot, Zig has some really good features and built-ins baked-in,
especially if you combine them with <code>comptime</code> functions to perform various transformations automatically.</p>
<p><code>@cImport / @cInclude</code> allow to read a <code>.h</code>, parse it at compile-time, and expose its content as Zig
symbols (functions, constants, etc.), exposed in a big struct. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>const c = @cImport({
  @cInclude("GLFW/glfw3.h");
});

// c.glfwInit() is now available
</code></pre>
<p>This is honestly pretty nice, especially since you can iterate on the contents of <code>c</code> with an <code>inline for</code>
at <code>comptime</code> to transform functions the way you want.</p>
<h3>The build system is nice</h3>
<p>The build configuration of your project is written in Zig. Even though I don’t think I like <em>configuration as
code</em>, it’s still an interesting idea. It will probably feel like fresh air for
people having to use CMake or similar tools. Zig build module is not very complex to understand and allows a
great deal of flexibility when configuring your targets, optimizations, CPU architectures, ABI, CLI options,
steps and all.</p>
<p>At the current time of writing this, however, even <code>zig</code> does build and package, dependency handling is far
behind anything you might be used to (<code>cargo</code>, <code>pip</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>cabal</code>, etc.). I don’t think it would be fair
to judge it for now.</p>
<h2>What I like less</h2>
<p>Even tough Zig is full of nice surprises, it’s also full of what I would call <em>flaws</em> that — personal
opinion – make it a bad fit for robust and sound systems.</p>
<h3>Error handling</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, error handling in Zig is nice, but it lacks one important feature: you can’t carry
values. It’s likely due to the fact errors flow via a different path than “normal” code, and require owned
values, so in many cases it will require allocations, which is not something Zig wants on its error path.</p>
<p>It makes sense, but it’s really annoying. Something like <code>error.FileNotFound</code> will require you extra
code infrastructure to find <em>exactly which file was not found</em> — maybe you can deduce it from the caller
and match on the error via <code>catch</code> — but maybe you can’t (the path might be computed by the function
returning the error). You can’t even pass integers around in errors, since it’s already used for the
variant of the error itself.</p>
<p>Coming from Rust, obviously, that feels very weak. The <code>Result&lt;A, E&gt;</code> type — that I’ve been using in Haskell
as <code>Either e a</code> — is a godsend. Not having something like that in Zig creates frustration and will likely
generate less interesting error values, or more convoluted code infrastructure around the callers.</p>
<p>On a similar note, the <code>try</code> keyword (which takes an <code>E!A</code> expression and is equal to <code>A</code> or <code>return E;</code>,
depending on the presence of error) allows to propagate errors, but it won’t do much more than that. You can
think of <code>try foo()</code> as the same as <code>foo() catch |err| return err;</code>. That obviously works only with
error union types, so if you happen to have a function returning a <code>?A</code> (optional), you can’t shortcircuit
in a nice way with <code>try</code> and instead needs to use the more verbose <code>orelse return null;</code>. This monadic
approach is pretty powerful in Haskell and Rust, and it wouldn’t hurt much to allow it for error union
types and optionals, since both are built-ins (so you don’t get to pay for the complexity of it).</p>
<p>Another thing I dislike about <code>try</code> is that it’s a prefix keyword which chains really badly:</p>
<pre><code>try (try foo()).bar()
</code></pre>
<h3>Shadowing is forbidden</h3>
<p><em>Shadowing</em> is the act of using the same name for two different bindings available in a scope hierarchy.
Rust is an excellent example of how to do shadowing correctly. For instance, in Rust:</p>
<pre><code>fn foo(input: &amp;str) {
  // input refers to the argument and has type &amp;str

  let input = input.to_owned();
  // input refers to this function stackframe local owned string and has type String
  // we don’t have access to the argument anymore

  {
    let input = 12;
    // input is integer, and we don’t have access to the String in this block
  }

  // input is the String
}
</code></pre>
<p>This lexical scoping in Rust prevents tons of boilerplate or having to come up with useless names. Zig not
having that causes annoyances, especially with error handling:</p>
<pre><code>const foo = Foo.init();
const foo2 = try foo.addFeatureA();
const foo3 = try foo.addFeatureB();
</code></pre>
<p>This is maybe a sign of the design choice (no move semantics), but all in all, I don’t like having
to come up with either obscure names or just bad names for something that should be chained calls, or just
reusing the same name. Sometimes, naming things is something we should refrain from.</p>
<h3>Compile-time duck typing</h3>
<p>This is an important issue I have with Zig, as it’s present everywhere and implies a lot of cascaded issues.
<code>comptime</code> is not only a keyword, as you might have guessed. Take this example for instance:</p>
<pre><code>fn doMath(x: anytype) @TypeOf(x) {
  // …
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is <strong>no way</strong> to know what that function <em>requires</em> as input. The very first line of the <code>zig zen</code> states</p>
<pre><code> * Communicate intent precisely.
</code></pre>
<p>And even though I do agree with that, I think it’s poorly implemented, for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring users to read the code of a function is everything but a good and precise way to communicate intent.</li>
<li>Requiring users to read the documentation is flawed by design.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second point is even violated by the standard library itself. Consider
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.Dir.iterate">std.fs.Dir.iterate</a>, which is a function
used to iterate on a directory entries. There is no documentation at all, nor even comment, and you are left with its
implementation, which is:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn iterate(self: Dir) Iterator {
    return self.iterateImpl(true);
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can click on <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.Dir.Iterator">Iterator</a> to end up on another
documentation page with no actual documentation and a lengthy implementation. I highly suggest reading the comment
on the <code>next()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>/// Memory such as file names referenced in this returned entry becomes invalid
/// with subsequent calls to `next`, as well as when this `Dir` is deinitialized.
</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>incredibly error-prone</em>, and the mere fact that even the standard library fails to abide by the very first
rule of <code>zig zen</code> proves the point that communicating intent precisely via documentation is hard, and probably not a
good design decision for a modern language.</p>
<p>And there is worse. As your software matures and you write more and more code, you will <em>eventually</em> change some
internals. Imagine what would happen if the documentation and/or comments go out of sync with the code. In languages
with type systems, it’s a minor annoyance — you will get angry people complaining about the fact the documentation
has typos / errors, and fixing them will be a patch release. In a language such as Zig where the documentation <em>is</em>
the contract, the source of the issue is vague and harder to understand: do they misuse the function? Is the function
buggy? Both?</p>
<h3>No typeclasses / traits</h3>
<p>Another point that I want to discuss is the lack of traits. Zig is a simple language and per-se, I guess, traits
were ruled out — and don’t <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/21544#issuecomment-2382542913">even think about proposing them</a>.
However, they do solve a real-world problem: programming contract. There are two important parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Programming contracts convey useful information to the programmers. If you have a function like the <code>doMath</code>
presented above, you have no clue what you are supposed to call it with. If you have something like:</p>
<pre><code>fn do_math&lt;T&gt;(input: T) T where T: Add + Mul {
  // …
}
</code></pre>
<p>You know <em>exactly</em> what you can call it with. Additionally, you get <em>discoverability</em> — it’s super easy
to build a reverse list of implementations based off some traits — Rust does it for you in both the
docs and LSP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming contracts are part of the public-facing side of your API. They should be items that are
versioned as the rest. If you decide to change the allowed properties of an input, just updating the
documentation will make it harder to realize you have to do a minor bump and not a patch bump.</p>
<p>Moreover, typeclasses allow for more control on the code <em>you don’t run / test</em>. If someone decides to
implement your trait for their types, having a clear interface to implement is far sounder than having
to go fishing for the programming contract in the documentation, assuming it even exists in the first
place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><code>comptime</code> is probably not as interesting as it looks</h3>
<p>I’ve been wondering a lot about this one lately. Yes, compile-time reflection is nice… but is it really?
When you think about it, implementing a JSON serializer for <code>anytype</code> is probably very unlikely to be
completely <em>true</em>. There will be hidden constraints. For instance, does it make sense to serialize a
pointer? Probably not, so the implementation might check the type info and refuse to serialize a
pointer. And — c.f. the previous section — that information is missing from the interface.</p>
<p>When you think about it, this problem is everywhere, as soon as you use <code>comptime</code>, because of the lack
of traits. If you want to understand the contracts / preconditions / postconditions / invariants… just
read the documentation… and the code, because well, you can’t be sure that the doc is not out of sync.</p>
<p><code>comptime</code> is one of those features that feel like a candy, but has a bitter taste to it. It feels like
C++ templates back again, and the community will not address that.</p>
<p>I hate the idea. After decades of programming, I can say with full certainty that besides teams with
extremely talented people that have been doing that kind of things for more than I’ve lived (old C
programmers, Linux maintainers, maybe a bunch of driver maintainers), it will only end up with tears.
I can’t in good faith suggest to use Zig at work given how complex our programming contracts are. I’m
far from being a perfect programmer — I make mistakes. We do have junior developers in our teams, work
or spare-time projects, people more or less used to our code bases and guidelines, and we are not 100%
perfect while reviewing either. Sometimes some code will be reviewed by someone else that is less severe
than you are. Sometimes it’s your future-self that will actually misuse something you thought was easy to understand. Etc.</p>
<h3>No encapsulation</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of the previous section. For a reason that I don’t understand, Zig doesn’t have
encapsulation. What it means is that if you use a type such as <code>ArrayList(i32)</code>, you <em>must</em> know how it’s
implemented to be able to get useful functions and properties, such as its <code>len</code> length. Still with the
same example, the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.array_list.ArrayListAligned">documentation of <code>ArrayList</code></a>
doesn’t show anything regarding the length of the array, nor even a way to iterate on its
elements. You have to know — read the code please — that what you are looking for is <code>.items.len</code> for the
length. If you want to use the <code>for</code> loop syntax, you do it on the <code>.items</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for (array.items) |item| {
  // …
}
</code></pre>
<p>Even worse, you can actually mutate the internals. How do we ensure that we can expose types to our users
without causing them to break invariants? Well, <code>zig zen</code>: communicate intent precisely, of course! Redirect
them to the code and ensure to slap <code>// INVARIANT</code> in your comments / documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sigh…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a bit dishonest, though. Zig does have a form of access control. At the module level, you can decide
whether a symbol is private (default), or <code>pub</code>. That’s all you get.</p>
<p>In essence, this is similar to C.</p>
<h3>Memory safety is highly underestimated and fallacious</h3>
<p>I read in numerous places that Zig is safer than <code>unsafe</code> Rust, which is not true, and fallacious.
Andrew Kelley <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/unsafe-zig-safer-than-unsafe-rust.html">wrote a blog article</a>
where he built his argumentation on the fact that Rust will compile and will run into UB, while Zig won’t.
Here’s the Rust code:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    a: i32,
    b: i32,
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        let mut array: [u8; 1024] = [1; 1024];
        let foo = std::mem::transmute::&lt;&amp;mut u8, &amp;mut Foo&gt;(&amp;mut array[0]);
        foo.a += 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to say is that there is indeed a UB, and it’s not easy to spot; transmuting a <code>&amp;mut u8</code> to
<code>&amp;mut Foo</code> is the same as casting an aligned pointer to an unaligned pointer, which is indeed UB. Back when
he wrote his article, I’m not sure he knew about <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">miri</a> — which has been around since
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45002">October 2017</a> — given that his article was released in 2018,
but even then, I think it’s important to draw people’s attention to something important here. Zig does have
this unaligned pointer cast detection by default, but you’re just one <code>rustup components add miri</code> call away:</p>
<pre><code>cargo miri run
…
error: Undefined Behavior: constructing invalid value: encountered an unaligned reference (required 4 byte alignment but found 1)

</code></pre>
<p>It would have been nice to point that out. Yes, Zig has it by default, but Rust has it too by adding a tool
that is available via <code>rustup</code>. I do have to agree that <code>unsafe</code> Rust is probably harder to write than
regular Zig, because of all the rules you have to manually ensure not to violate (stacked borrows, etc.), and
for 90% of the time, what you will be doing will be to call a C function via the FFI, so you should be fine.
For more complicated <code>unsafe</code> usage, just use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">miri</a>. Actually, I think it should be a good practice to use
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">miri</a>, at least in the CI.</p>
<p>I could understand Andrew missed that when he wrote his article (hm…). But today? People still mention that
Zig is <em>sooooo</em> much safer than Rust.</p>
<p>So let’s see how Zig is safer now. Up to this day, Zig doesn’t see Use After Free (UAF). Not at compile-time. Not at
runtime. They are just plain Undefined Behavior (UB). For instance:</p>
<pre><code>const std = @import("std");

fn getPtr(value: i32) *i32 {
    var x = value;
    x += 1;
    return &amp;x;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();

    const ptr = getPtr(123);
    try stdout.print("ptr.* = {d}\n", .{ptr.*});

    ptr.* += 10;
    try stdout.print("ptr.* = {d}\n", .{ptr.*});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you compile this with the default optimization option (<code>Debug</code>), you get this:</p>
<pre><code>$ zig build run
ptr.* = 124
ptr.* = 134
</code></pre>
<p>If you compile with <code>ReleaseFast</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast run
ptr.* = 0
ptr.* = 0
</code></pre>
<p><em>Oh le malaise</em>. This, here; this exact situation is the main reason why I refrain myself from using Zig
in production. The idea that I could end up in such a situation <em>and not even knowing about it</em>. There
are discussions to track all possible UB and turn them into <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">checked illegal behavior</a>.
That issue has been opened since 2019. I’m not saying it won’t ever be a thing — I guess it’s required
to hit 1.0. <em>But still</em>. The language cannot in good faith state that it’s safer than <code>unsafe</code> Rust. Let’s
convert that code to Rust and run miri on it…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would <em>obviously</em> never suggest to use raw pointers but instead references, but references will trigger
a compilation error so it’s not really fair for this comparison, and the Zig community always compares it
to <code>unsafe</code> Rust, so let’s get unsafe!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>fn get_ptr(input: i32) -&gt; *mut i32 {
    let mut value = input;
    value += 1;
    &amp;mut value as *mut _
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        let ptr = get_ptr(123);
        println!("*ptr = {}", *ptr);

        *ptr += 10;
        println!("*ptr = {}", *ptr);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running miri:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The message has some weird mentions in (<code>alloc565</code>), but the actual useful information is there: a pointer is
dangling.</p>
<p>So no, I strongly disagree that Zig is safer than — even — <code>unsafe</code> Rust. Anyone telling you otherwise is
either purposefully lying, or ignorant. And I think I need to mention the misconception that you need to
drop to <code>unsafe</code> often in Rust. This is simply not true. Some libraries — especially interfacing with C
libraries — do use <code>unsafe</code> to make FFI calls (usually, they just do that). <code>unsafe</code> might be required for
some very specific tricks required to implement safer abstractions, but you are not supposed to write a full
library or application in <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just test your software correctly!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again that argument… UB cannot be tested and requires statical analysis — or some kind of runtime protections
that is currently not implemented in Zig — and coverage in a langage that is built off lazy compilation everywhere
is probably not something I will discuss here…</p>
<h3>Lazy compilation and compilation errors instead of warnings</h3>
<p>Heck, I thought I would dodge this one. So… yeah… this is a bit embarrassing, but Zig implements lazy compilation.
The idea is that you write code, and it doesn’t compile it. That sounds so <em>exotic</em> that the standard library
has a helper function to mitigate that weird design decision (<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.testing.refAllDecls"><code>std.testing.refAllDecls</code></a>).
You must use it in a <em>very natural way</em>:</p>
<pre><code>test {
  std.testing.refAllDecls(some_module_of_yours);
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s a common idiom I have seen in many places (Ghostty <a href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/f0d276062b78658fc1f3857e9ea104788f1f4e58/src/cli.zig#L10">1</a>

<p>So… if everyone really mitigates this <em>“feature”</em>… was it really worth it? In the end, it makes sense not to
include code that is not participating in the final binary, but… have you thought about refactoring? Have you
thought about systems that add code that will be used <em>later</em>? That happens a lot and I was bitten so many
times while writing some disjoint sections of code and having to spend much more time later when gluing
everything together — <em>because the code was actually never checked</em>!</p>
<p>And there is the opposite problem. Zig makes some assumptions on what is important, so obviously, a parameter of
a function that is not used should be a hard error. It lazy-checks functions you wrote and ignores them if you
don’t use them right away, but refuses to compile arguments you ignore?! I mean, I get <em>why</em> (not using an
argument could hide a bug), but a warning would suffice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t found a way to disable that linter and make it a warning, and I think it’s unlikely to ever happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>No destructors</h3>
<p>This one <em>I could get</em>, but not implemented the way it is. Zig doesn’t have any sound way to ensure proper
resource management — just like C. See the previous section about communicating intent properly. Zig <em>requires</em>
the call site to deallocate properly, and you have to mention the deinit logic in your documentation.</p>
<p><code>defer</code> – and <code>errdefer</code>, which is for a different usecase, but it’s not really important here — is a tool you
<em>can</em> use at call site to implement resource cleanup, whether it’s memory deallocation or file descriptors close.
The concept has been around for a long time, and as mentioned in the previous sentence, it’s not automatic. The
caller <em>must know</em> that they have to call <code>defer</code>. The documentation <em>might</em> forget to mention it and the user
<em>might</em> forget to call it. On memory cleanup, if you are lucky and your tests run that code, you will get a traced
leak. For more complex resources such as GPU queues, database handles, etc., well, it’s probably a leaked file
descriptor?</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure whether destructors are the best solution to this problem, but they allow to ensure that
the code calls the cleanup routine. There are alternatives — explored in <a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/atslangweb/">ATS</a>, probably too complex
for now, requiring linear types and/or proofs to force the caller to get rid of the resource — Rust <em>could have</em>
something along those lines, since it has move semantics and an affine type system; I don’t think people will
trade <code>Drop</code> for linear types though.</p>
<p>It’s a bit a pity, to be honest, to see such a design in Zig, because it does have the infrastructure to do
better in my humble opinion. For instance, this won’t compile:</p>
<pre><code>fn foo() i32 { return 123; }

// …
pub fn main() !void {
  foo();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the return value of <code>foo</code> is ignored. To make that compile, you need to explicitly ignore the
returned value:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn main() !void {
  _ = foo();
}
</code></pre>
<p>So it’s a bit weird to see that Zig can prevent compilation if you do not use an argument or the returned
value of a function, but doesn’t provide the proper tooling to force the user to correctly deinit
resources. If you pull the problem a bit more, it shows that the design of Zig — in its current state —
doesn’t permit that, since you would need linear types/values (i.e. a value <em>must</em> be used once and only
once). I would have loved something like a <code>#</code> linear marker that would cause a linear resource to be dangling
if it’s not eventually consumed by a function taking it with the marker as argument:</p>
<pre><code>const Resource = struct {
  …

  pub fn init() #Resource {
    …
  }

  pub fn deinit(r: #Resource) {
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, as soon as you see that, it causes issues with the Zig type system, because you can still bit-copy
values, so you duplicate a resource and might cause double-frees — but copying should be disallowed in a linear
type system. So Zig cannot have linear types/values without changing <em>all</em> the properties of such types, and
purely linear values are often not enough; we eventually want to <em>weaken</em> the restriction (relevant type system)
to be able to use the resource value in a controlled way, via, for instance, borrowing. Which leads to more
complexity in the language, so clearly not something we will ever see in Zig.</p>
<h3>No (unicode) strings</h3>
<p>The standard library doesn’t have a good support for unicode strings. There is a discussion opened by
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault</a> about <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/234">improving strings and unicode handling</a>.
I share the link so that you make your own opinion about what to think of all that, but not having a
string type and recommending users to “iterate on bytes” is a big no to me. It’s the open door to a wide variety
of issues / corrupted data. People in the thread even recommend using <code>.len</code> on <code>[]u8</code> to get length of strings
(never do that, unless you are doing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>).</p>
<p>It <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/7734#issuecomment-758167124">will never happen</a>, whatever your arguments.
You are left with user-land support, such as <a href="https://codeberg.org/atman/zg">zg</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: simplicity rhymes with unrestricted power, which rhymes with…</h2>
<p><img src="https://strongly-typed-thoughts.net/media/uploads/footguns_everywhere.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I get it. Zig has the ambition to replace C, and as such, doesn’t want to have to deal with complex abstractions.
It trades memory safety and soundness for simplicity. If I’ve been around Zig and actually writing Zig code that
much, it’s because I wanted to check whether
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/memory-safety-is-a-red-herring">memory safety is a red herring</a> myself. In the
end, maybe Zig is right. Maybe we can achieve <em>enough</em> with a simple language, and deal with the remaining issues
with other approaches. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, I think it’s too soon to make any useful conclusion. I really want to have a look at reports about
projects that are entirely written in Zig (Ghostty, TigerBeetle, etc.) after they have matured enough. It’s great
that those projects are successful with Zig; I’m honestly happy for them. But a robust and scientific approach
requires us to go further than just assumptions and feelings. I do think we have data about CVE issues (we
all know the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/">70% number</a>, right?), and it took time and lots of software history to have enough hindsight. I do
think that hindsight is required on Zig to know whether it’s actually contributing to more reliable software. Very
personal opinion: given all the points I mentioned, I really doubt it.</p>
<p>I don’t think that <em>simplicity</em> is a good vector of reliable software. At most, it’s a happy side-effect. It’s
not a requirement, and should remain a secondary mission. What the industry needs is to identify problems (we have)
and designs solutions that solve those problems. Anyone has the right to select a subset of those problems (even Rust
can’t solve everything) and solve those specifically, ignoring the others or pushing their resolution to
user-land / process etc. But here, I think there is a big misconception.</p>
<p>Zig does enhance on C, there is no doubt. I would rather write Zig than C. The design is better, more modern, and
the language is safer. But why stop half way? Why fix <em>some</em> problems and ignore the most damaging ones?</p>
<p>Remember the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you see why this is such a poignant take? Is it really better to spend time in <code>gdb</code> / whatever debugger
you are using, or having your users opening bug issues than having to spend a bit more time reading compiler
error messages? That mantra seems to make it like it’s a bad thing to have a compiler yell at you because you
are <em>very likely</em> doing something you don’t really intend to. Why? It’s a well known fact that bugs don’t
write themselves. At some point, a developer wrote some code <em>expressing</em> a solution that was, in fact,
<em>actually written</em> a different way, in dissonance with the initial intent. This is part of being a human. So
why would you complain that a compiler tells you that what you are doing is very likely wrong? Because in a
few instances, it was unable to see that what you were doing was, actually, fine? You base a full language
experience based solely on some exceptional occurrences / issues? And trust me, I also do have those moments
with Rust from time to time (especially with the lack of view types and partial mutable borrows).</p>
<p>Seeking <em>simple</em> is just not the right move to me. To me, a more robust approach is ensuring people can’t shoot
themselves, while seeking <em>simpler</em>. Simpler doesn’t mean <em>simple</em>; it means that you design a solution,
whatever the complexity, and tries to make it as simple <em>as possible</em>. Rust is honestly not that hard, but it is
definitely not a simple language. However, for all the problems it solves at compile-time, it’s definitely simpler
than all other approaches (e.g. <a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/atslangweb/">ATS</a>). And it’s not unlikely that it will get simpler and simpler as we discover
new ways of expressing language constructs.</p>
<p>I think my adventure with Zig stops here. I have had too frustration regarding correctness and reliability
concerns. Where people see simplicity as a building block for a more approachable and safe-enough language, I see
simplicity as an excuse not to tackle hard and damaging problems and causing unacceptable tradeoffs. I’m also
fed up of the <em>skill issue</em> culture. If Zig requires programmers to be flawless, well, I’m probably not a good
fit for the role.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/">https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42941143">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <h2><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/01/">01 · A spreadsheet for exploring scenarios</a></h2>
  <p>2025 Feb 4</p>
  <p>From calculating monthly budgets to planning dream vacations, spreadsheets are our trusted companions as we navigate life’s complex decisions—a playground for thinking, where possibilities come to life through numbers.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are particularly useful for thinking through financial models, budgets, or any situation that involves considering lots of possible scenarios. Instead of laboriously redoing a bunch of math, you can quickly ask “what if?” questions and see the effects.</p>
<p>But, as great as spreadsheets already are for this task, we think they could be even better. In our <em>Ambsheets</em> project, we are exploring a small extension to the spreadsheet: <strong>what if a single cell could hold multiple values at once</strong>?</p>


<figure>
  <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-1-bells-and-whistles.mp4">
</video></figure>



<h2 id="the-problem-of-comparing-scenarios"><a href="#the-problem-of-comparing-scenarios">The problem of comparing scenarios</a></h2><p>Suppose you’re moving to a new city, and you want to figure out how much you can afford to spend on your car, apartment, and other essentials each month. You start out by making a spreadsheet that sums up the various line items:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-0-spreadsheet.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, you want to consider a few scenarios for possible cars and apartments. <strong>How might you compare those scenarios in the spreadsheets of today?</strong></p>
<p>One thing you can do is <strong>toggle,</strong> by temporarily entering different values into a cell:</p>


<figure>
  <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-2-toggle.mp4">
</video></figure>


<p>Toggling is straightforward because it doesn’t require restructuring the spreadsheet at all. But it has a key drawback: there’s no way to see all the scenarios at once!</p>
<p>Another option is to <strong>restructure</strong> by adding more columns to the sheet:</p>


<figure>
  <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-3-restructure.mp4">
</video></figure>


<p>Restructuring does let you compare multiple scenarios at the same time, but it has its own drawbacks. It’s more work than toggling, because you need to pause and edit the layout. And it’s easy to run out of space—even in this small example, if you wanted to consider two possible cars and three possible apartments, your spreadsheet would grow rapidly.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-amb-values"><a href="#introducing-amb-values">Introducing amb values</a></h2><p>Neither of the options above is fully satisfying.  What if instead you could directly tell the spreadsheet that you’re considering multiple values for the price of the car? In an ambsheet, you can do just that:</p>


<figure>
  <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-4-amb-car.mp4">
</video></figure>


<p>The new value of B3, <code>{500,1200}</code>, means <em>either</em> <code>500</code> <em>or</em> <code>1200</code>. We call this an <em>amb value</em>, and it represents one dimension in our possibility space. (Amb is shorthand for “ambiguous”, and is a reference to the <a href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/4_002e3.xhtml">nondeterministic evaluator</a> from Abelson and Sussman’s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.)</p>
<p>Amb values flow through the computation just like regular values and don’t require any special treatment in formulas. Cell B7, whose formula is <code>SUM(B3:B5)</code>, now evaluates to either $3,318 or $4,018—this is what your total monthly spend will be if you decide to lease the car that costs $500/month or the car that costs $1,200/month, respectively.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to spend up to $5,000, you may also want to consider apartments that are larger and/or in nicer neighborhoods. In our ambsheet, all we have to do is change B4 to an amb value:</p>


<figure>
  <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-5-amb-apartment.mp4">
</video></figure>


<p>Now the total monthly spend (cell B7) has 6 different values, one for each possible <em>scenario:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>in the 1st one, we leased the $500/month car and rented the $2,800/month apartment,</li>
<li>in the 2nd one, we leased the $500/month car and rented the $3,700/month apartment,</li>
<li>… and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>We say this possibility space has two <em>dimensions</em> because there are two different amb values where we are making a choice. We can visualize the possible values of B7 in a 2-dimensional table:</p>


<figure>
  <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/ambsheets-1-bells-and-whistles.mp4">
</video></figure>


<p>Within each scenario, an ambsheet operates like a normal spreadsheet—the SUM formula only sees “regular” (non-amb) numbers. Behind the scenes, the ambsheet’s evaluator takes care of enumerating all possible scenarios and running the formulas for each one.</p>
<p>Ambsheets aren’t limited to 2 dimensions. For example, if you’re choosing among different Netflix plans, you could turn the last budget item into an amb value, resulting in a 3-dimensional possibility space. This is more flexible than doing restructuring in traditional spreadsheets, where you’re limited to the 2D grid.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-excels-what-if"><a href="#what-about-excels-what-if">What about Excel’s “What-if”?</a></h2><p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/notebook/static/01/what-if.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you’ve used What-If Analysis in Microsoft Excel, some of these ideas may seem familiar. That feature aims to solve the same problem as Ambsheets, but there are two key differences.</p>
<p>First, What-If Analysis has a clunky UI that’s not integrated into the spreadsheet itself. You need to open a separate mode to enter cell values or view the possible scenarios. In an ambsheet, you can start exploring scenarios right within the sheet itself.</p>
<p>We also take a different approach to enumerating scenarios. Excel requires the user to manually enter every scenario—even in the simple example above, exploring 2 cars, 3 apartments, and 2 Netflix plans would require entering 12 scenarios, with names like “Cheap Car / Medium apartment / Premium Netflix”. In contrast, an ambsheet automatically computes all combinations of the three amb values.</p>

<h2 id="going-deeper"><a href="#going-deeper">Going deeper</a></h2><p>That covers the basics of amb values, but many questions remain if we want to grow this kernel into a powerful medium for exploring scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Filtering: How can you interactively explore large possibility spaces and narrow down to the subset of scenarios that you care about?</li>
<li>Visualization: A table works fine for visualizing six values in two dimensions, but how do you show hundreds of possible values across many dimensions in a useful way?</li>
<li>Continuous distributions: What does it look like to have an amb value that represents a probability distribution rather than a list of discrete values?</li>
<li>Applications: How can ambsheets apply to specific domains of decision-making? For example, could you make an ambsheet for budgeting, or for analyzing card games?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve been exploring these questions and more, and we’ll be posting the results of our experiments in this lab notebook.</p>
<p>If you have a problem that you think might benefit from Ambsheets, we’d love to chat—please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:alexwarth@inkandswitch.com">alexwarth@inkandswitch.com</a> and <a href="mailto:geoffrey@inkandswitch.com">geoffrey@inkandswitch.com</a>.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Google removed a pledge to not build AI for weapons or surveillance from its website this week. The change was first spotted by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/google-removes-language-on-weapons-from-public-ai-principles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. The company appears to have updated its public AI principles page, erasing a section titled “applications we will not pursue,” which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250130075626/https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">still included</a> as recently as last week.</p>

<p>Asked for comment, the company pointed TechCrunch to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog post</a> on “responsible AI.” It notes, in part, “we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.”</p>







<p>Google’s <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">newly updated AI principles</a> note the company will work to “mitigate unintended or harmful outcomes and avoid unfair bias,” as well as align the company with “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”</p>

<p>In recent years, Google’s contracts to provide the U.S. and Israeli militaries with cloud services have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/google-fires-28-employees-after-sit-in-protest-over-controversial-project-nimbus-contract-with-israe/">sparked internal protests from employees</a>. The company has maintained that its AI is not used to harm humans; however, the Pentagon’s AI chief recently told TechCrunch that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/the-pentagon-says-ai-is-speeding-up-its-kill-chain/">some company’s AI models are speeding up the U.S. military’s kill chain.</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle2">https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle2</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42939940">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Oracle filed
<a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=7" rel="noopener noreferrer">a motion to dismiss</a>
in response to Deno’s petition to cancel its “JavaScript” trademark. But instead
of addressing the real issue—that JavaScript is an open standard with multiple
independent implementations—Oracle is trying to stall the process and sidestep
accountability.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>Two years ago, I published <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a>
asking Oracle to release the JavaScript trademark as a goodwill gesture. That
got no response.</p>
<p>Last September, I published <a href="https://javascript.tm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an open letter</a> co-signed
by Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript), current TC39 editors, and over 16,000
JavaScript developers. Many were shocked to learn that Oracle even claimed
ownership of JavaScript. Oracle still said nothing.</p>
<p>So last November, I filed
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle" rel="noopener noreferrer">a formal petition with the USPTO</a> through
my company, Deno, to cancel Oracle’s “JavaScript” trademark. Among other things,
we pointed out that in 2019, Oracle renewed its trademark by submitting a
screenshot of the Node.js website—a project I created—as proof of use, despite
having no affiliation with it.</p>
<p>Our petition challenges Oracle’s trademark on three grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genericness – JavaScript is a widely used programming language, not an Oracle
product.</li>
<li>Abandonment – Oracle does not control, maintain, or enforce the trademark.</li>
<li>Fraud on the USPTO – Oracle submitted misleading evidence in its renewal
filing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the full peititon for cancellation
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle/petition-for-cancellation.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="oracles-defense-that-specimen-just-ignore-it">Oracle’s defense: “That specimen? Just ignore it”</h2>
<p><a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=7" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle has finally responded</a>—but
only to the fraud claim. Their argument: <em>Yes, we used a screenshot from
Node.js, but it doesn’t matter because we also submitted another specimen.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how they frame our petition in their filing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Petition ignores completely that Oracle submitted two specimens.
Moreover, on its face, the Petition fails to allege a claim of fraud as to the
renewal in Class 42 because the specimen it touts as ‘fraudulent’ was
submitted to support only the renewal in Class 9 and not Class 42.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle’s JavaScript trademark covers both software products (Class 9) and
technology services (Class 42). Their argument is that the Node.js screenshot
was only for Class 9 and that their primary specimen—an Oracle JET page—was
sufficient for both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Petitioner has not challenged and could not plausibly challenge the
JAVASCRIPT Extension Toolkit page from Oracle’s own website that Oracle
submitted as its primary specimen in Class 9 and as its only specimen in Class
42.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This raises serious questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Oracle’s primary specimen (a screenshot of Oracle JET) was truly
sufficient, why submit a screenshot of Node.js at all?</li>
<li>Oracle JET isn’t even a standalone JavaScript runtime—it’s a UI toolkit.</li>
<li>Has anyone even used Oracle JET, or is it just there to keep the trademark
alive?</li>
<li>Oracle never explained why it used a screenshot from a project it had no
connection to.</li>
</ul>
<p>They even go as far as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oracle does not concede that submission of the Node.js Specimen was improper.
However, the Board need not address that question in connection with this
Motion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle isn’t denying that it used my project—it’s just arguing that it doesn’t
matter. If a company misrepresents something in a legal filing, you’d expect
them to acknowledge it. But Oracle hasn’t even addressed it. No apology. No
explanation. Just an attempt to move past it as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>I created Node.js and released it under the MIT license to benefit developers,
not so it could be used as a legal pawn by a Fortune 500 company. Now, instead
of correcting their misrepresentation, they’re using it to stall the case.</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle2/specimens.png" alt="Specimens used in 2019 renewal" title=""></p>
<h2 id="delaying-the-process">Delaying the process</h2>
<p>Oracle waited until the deadline to file this motion, delaying their response to
the real issue: whether “JavaScript” is a generic term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This motion tolls the deadline to otherwise answer the Petition, and Oracle
requests that the Board reset the answer deadline to at least 30 days after
the date of its decision on this motion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oracle won’t even discuss whether “JavaScript” should remain a trademark until
they’ve finished dragging out this fraud claim.</p>
<p>This legal maneuvering puts us in a difficult position:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agree to drop the fraud claim, letting them get away with misrepresenting
their trademark renewal.</li>
<li>Spend months fighting this procedural issue before even getting to the real
debate.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-real-issue">The real issue</h2>
<p>The situation is self-evident to anyone working in tech: Oracle did not create
JavaScript. Oracle does not control JavaScript. Oracle should not own the
trademark for JavaScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript is defined by an open specification (ECMA-262), maintained by TC39,
an industry group with representatives from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla,
and others. The major implementations of JavaScript are in the browsers built by
Mozilla, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Oracle has no role in JavaScript’s
governance, implementation, or evolution—yet it continues to wield this
trademark as a legal cudgel.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about JavaScript. If Oracle can hold onto this trademark, what
does that say about the trademark system as a whole? Should corporations be able
to warehouse trademarks indefinitely, even when they play no meaningful role in
the things they claim to own? Even when they commit fraud to maintain them?</p>
<p>A company with no role in JavaScript’s past or future has no right to control
its name.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Share this post and spread awareness about Oracle’s trademark claim.</li>
<li>Sign the open letter at <a href="https://javascript.tm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascript.tm</a></li>
<li>If you’re a journalist, reach out—I’m happy to talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let one thing be clear: we are not intimidated by Oracle’s legal maneuvering,
and we will continue to fight this case on it’s very strong merits. You can

Our recommendations
are all based on the same guiding principles. The logic behind them is simple – <strong>avoid tools
that collect your information, store it outside of your control, or leave it publicly exposed.</strong>
The most challenging is likely Google Maps, which we believe should be avoided while attending an
action. Google Maps always tracks its users, and Google keeps this tracking data in detail,
forever. All of this data can be <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/googles-sensorvault-can-tell-police-where-youve-been">given to law enforcement</a>.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html">Police and other agencies</a> can use Google’s high-precision data
to place a person at an action. Even more dangerous, they can then locate a person down to
specific areas within an action, or near criminal acts, within a few feet and down to the minute.
Our alternative suggestions, <a href="https://maps.apple.com/go">Apple Maps</a> and
<a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/maps/">DuckDuckGo Maps</a>, do not
track their users in this way. They also go out of their way to anonymize the data collected by the map providers.</p><p>Another popular tool <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415">we must recommend against</a> is Telegram, as it has a track record of
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-encryption-whatsapp-settings/">security issues</a>. While it
supports end-to-end encryption for messages between individuals (see <a href="#messaging-with-encryption">Messaging with Encryption</a> below), it does not apply this security to group messages. Group messages
may be reported as “spam” or “abuse”, and the full contents of messages may be subject to review
by Telegram staff and contractors. That data can then be provided to law enforcement. To make things
worse, the full encryption technique is not active for all conversations by default.</p><p>WhatsApp, while popular in some activist circles, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/06/22/battle-of-the-secure-messaging-apps-how-signal-beats-whatsapp/">has similar issues</a>,
and we recommend against that service as well. We recommend <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>,
which was built from the ground up for personal security.</p><p>Similar reasoning applies to all the recommendations we make in this document. If you use it,
we have probably researched its security features for this project. If there are tools you are not
ready to give up, we encourage you to research their privacy policies and what you can do to
protect your data.</p><h2 id="things-to-know">Things to Know

entities. Phones record and share lots of information about your whereabouts and activity with
different services. This is usually a good thing, as it helps your apps respond to your needs
and situation. But when you attend an action, those features can provide a rich digital
breadcrumb trail. We want to prevent those digital breadcrumbs from being dropped, and here is
some advice on how to do that.</p><p>Attending an action brings an additional threat to privacy. If your phone is lost or confiscated
by law enforcement, all the information on it could then be available to police. Below we will
share advice to protect your phone against intrusion should it fall into someone else’s hands.</p><p>This section uses the word “phone” to mean a smartphone running iOS or Android, such as those
manufactured by Apple, Google, Samsung, and others. If you are using a simpler phone, your risks
are likely fewer.</p><p>Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, the threats to your privacy are the same. Your phone
has a built-in <strong>GPS</strong> receiver that enables maps and other location-based apps to work.
The phone itself will keep that GPS receiver on at all times, recording where you are, and
occasionally send updates on your whereabouts to Google, Apple, or other app publishers. So we
will want to turn the GPS receiver off, which prevents from the location data from being
recorded at all.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth, WiFi, and Ultrawideband (UWB)</strong> are common technologies that use short-range radios to communicate with
other devices. Unfortunately, their operation requires your phone to broadcast information which can uniquely identify itself. This information can be observed by a “beacon” or scanning device.
Stores, government agencies, and police use these devices to identify people who are nearby.
This type of surveillance is profoundly dangerous at an action, so these radios should be disabled
whenever possible.</p><p><strong>Your mobile carrier</strong> can also track your location using your phone’s contact with its cellular towers.
Even if you are not actively in a call, texting, or browsing the internet over a celluar connection, there
is still constant activity between your device and the towers to maintain a connection. These connections
are sufficiently accurate to place an individual on the same block as an action.
This location information is typically logged by your carrier, and can be accessible to law
enforcement. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them">Some police departments</a> also have access to devices known
as cell site simulators, IMSI catchers, or a “Stingray”. These devices can mimic a mobile phone tower,
and provide the police with more accurate, real-time data.</p><p>Both iOS and Android phones have a feature named <strong>“airplane mode,”</strong> to quickly disable the cellular
radio and some, or all, of the other radios present on the device. The exact behavior is dependent on
which device you’re using. The safest option for ensuring that all of your radios have been disabled
is to both enable Airplane mode <strong>and</strong> manually ensure that the Bluetooth and WiFi radios are
turned <em>Off</em> in your devices Settings app. See the <a href="#iphone-setup">iOS</a> or <a href="#android-setup">Android</a>
section below for the specific details for your device.</p><h2 id="intrusion-protection">Intrusion Protection

They will
physically have your phone and may attempt to extract information from it. All phones have
<strong>lock screens</strong>, which is the first line of defense. In day-to-day use, we want our lock screen
to be prevent a thief or some other stranger from easily opening the
phone. With that, fingerprint readers and face scanners make for convenient unlock mechanisms.
The situation at an action is starkly different, as law enforcement may have the ability to apply your finger or face to your phone to
unlock it, even if you resist or are unconscious. For this reason,
<strong>biometric unlock mechanisms should be avoided during an action</strong>. The other unlock mechanisms
typically involve drawing a shape or entering a code. A swipe or, shape, or short code can be traced
by police (or anyone) from the thin oils your finger leaves on the screen.
<strong>Entering a code is the most secure.</strong> The code should be long enough to
prevent your fingerprints from giving it away.</p><p>Phones also let you select how long they should wait before auto-locking themselves. You should set
this time to be as short as possible, so that if you drop your phone or if is stolen, the timer will
expire and the phone will lock before anyone else can access it.
The <strong>power button should make the phone immediately lock</strong>.</p><p>There are ways to access data on a phone without unlocking it. One way to defend against these
methods is <strong>full-disk encryption</strong>, where all the information on the phone is stored in encrypted form.
This prevents law enforcement from removing the storage chips from your phone,
as all of the contents will be unreadable without being unlocked in your specific phone by your specific unlock code.</p><p>To use full-disk encryption on an iPhone, simply set a lock screen passcode. If you don’t have a
passcode, it will not activate the feature.</p><p>To see if your Android has encryption available and turned on, you can <strong>go to Settings, choose Security, and find the Encrypt Phone option.</strong>
It will say “Encrypted” or prompt you to turn on
encryption. Turning on encryption will take a few hours, and your device will need to be plugged
into its charger. This is something you only need to do once.</p><p>If your Android device was shipped with <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2995437/google-makes-full-disk-encryption-and-secure-boot-mandatory-for-some-android-60-devices.html">Android 6 or lower</a>,

One
of these involves the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144">AirDrop</a> feature. When AirDrop is
enabled, your phone could leak personally identifiable information (PII) such as your phone number
and email address to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/apples-airdrop-leaks-users-pii-and-theres-not-much-they-can-do-about-it/">nearby devices</a>.</p><p>We recommend keeping AirDrop disabled at all times when near or at an action, and in everyday life

and Android pose a problem for activists. Backups made with iCloud are encrypted in such a way that
employees at Apple can access them. This weakness is attributed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">pressure from the FBI.</a>
Anything in the backup, which may include photos, contacts, unencrypted messages, <a href="https://oleb.net/2020/icloud-end-to-end-encryption/">and more,</a>
can be handed over to law enforcement. Keys to unlock the phone’s full-disk encryption are also
stored in the iCloud backup. This arrangement allows law enforcement to request the backup data from
Apple and use the key to unlock the entire phone. It also offers a convenience, where if the user
forgets their unlock code, Apple can still recover the device. For activists, the risk posed by your
unlock keys being accessible to law enforcement is potentially greater than the benefits of that
convenience.
<strong>We do not recommend using iCloud backups.</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/6305834?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">Android leverages Google Drive</a>
for data backup, which does not generally contain unlock keys, but does automatically include app data,
call data, contacts, calendar events, videos, and photos. Starting with Android version 9 (codenamed
“Pie” and released in 2018), Google has offered end-to-end encrypted backups that <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/google-and-android-have-your-back-by.html">even they cannot
open</a> without the
user’s passcode. If your phone uses version 9 or newer, <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/10/android-cloud-backup.html">this feature is automatically active</a>
as long as you have a lock screen protected with a PIN, pattern, or passcode.

<label for="tabs-0-0">iPhone</label></p><p>### iPhone Setup
Apple has prioritized personal security in recent years and now offers features to make securing
your iPhone easier. Following these steps will make your phone reasonably secure for an action.
If your device does not support *Face ID* as a biometric login method, you will see *Touch ID* on your
device instead of *Face ID* where it is referenced below.
* Set AirDrop to [Receiving Off](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144#setoptions)
* *Settings → General → AirDrop*, tap on **Receiving Off**
* Disable your GPS receiver by turning off Location Services.
* *Settings → Privacy → Location Services*, toggle *Location Services* off.
* Even in Airplane mode, iOS will keep the GPS receiver active unless Location Services is turned off.
* Turn off WiFi, and the cellular radio by activating [Airplane Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234)
* Bluetooth **will not** be disabled the first time you use Airplace Mode. If you disable
Bluetooth *after* enabling Airplane mode, iOS will remember this, and disable
Bluetooth automatically the next time Airplane mode is used.
* Disable your Bluetooth radio
* *Settings → Bluetooth*, toggle the *Bluetooth* slider off.
* Lock screen setup
* Disable biometric login
* *Settings → Face ID &amp; Passcode*, under the section “Use Face ID For:”, toggle all
the sliders to off.
* Set your screen to auto-lock as quickly as possible, and require your passcode immediately.
* *Settings → Display &amp; Brightness → Auto-Lock*, set to 30 seconds or 1 minute at the most
* *Settings → Face ID &amp; Passcode*, set “Require Passcode” to “Immediately”
* Practice with iOS’ [Emergency SOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208076) mode, and
disable the emergency auto-call features.
* *Disable Settings → Emergency SOS → Auto-call*
* *Disable Settings → Emergency SOS → Call with Side Button*
* If you need to quickly lock down the device, press and hold the power button and either of
the volume buttons until the Emergency SOS lock screen appears. At this point, biometric
login will be disabled until the passcode is reentered.</p><p>
<label for="tabs-0-1">Android</label></p><p>### Android Setup
Android has flexible settings that can be used to make your phone secure and usable in a number of situations.
Click below to see steps to make your phone generally secure for the day of an action.
* Disable your GPS receiver by turning off Location Services.
* Pull down the notification panel from the top of the screen. There may be a toggle button
for Location Services (they often look like a satellite).
* If you don't have the button in the pulldown, go to *Settings → Location* and turn off "Use location."
* Turn off Bluetooth, WiFi, and carrier radio by activating Airplane Mode.
* Pull down the notification panel from the top of the screen. There may be a toggle button
for Airplane Mode (it often look like an airplane). Ensure Airplane Mode is ON.
* If you don't have the button in the pulldown, go to *Settings → Network &amp; internet* and turn on "Airplane mode."
* You can turn mobile data back on without leaving airplane mode if you need it. Press the
Mobile Data button in the notification panel after you activate Airplane Mode. Those two
buttons are often next to each other.
* Check that Bluetooth is really off. Android may keep it on if Bluetooth devices are
connected. The button in the notification panel should be grayed/uncolored to indicate it
is off.
* Lock screen setup
* Go to *Settings → Security → Screen Lock* and select PIN or Password.
* You will be asked if you want notifications to be shown on screen while the phone is
locked. The safest option is “Don’t show any notifications at all.” If that does not work
for you, choose “Hide sensitive notification content.”
* Click the gear to enter Screen Lock settings:
* Set "Lock after screen timeout" to Immediately.
* Turn on "Power button instantly locks".
* Disable Smart Lock if you have it. It can keep your phone unlocked when you don't expect
it, which is dangerous at an action.
* Go to *Settings → Display → Advanced → Screen timeout* and set it to the shortest possible
time, usually 15 seconds.</p></div><h2 id="security-ideas">Security Ideas

instantly, but a 10-character password would take hours. XKCD did a fun explanation of this: <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">https://xkcd.com/936/</a></p><p><strong>Your passwords should be easy for you to remember but too long for a hacker to guess.</strong> The
best technique right now is to use a passphrase of multiple words that are easy for you to
remember but so long that it would take centuries for a hacker to crack. You can use a technique
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a> to come up with a random but memorable
passphrase. Doug Muth built a nice online Diceware tool below.</p><p>Diceware Password Generator: <a href="https://diceware.dmuth.org/">https://diceware.dmuth.org/</a></p><h2 id="password-managers">Password Managers

They can save the
username, password, and other information for each app and/or site that you use. This vault is
heavily encrypted and can only be unlocked by a master password. All you need to remember is
the master password, and it will fill in everything else for you! This frees up mental space,
which is always nice, but more importantly for security, it allows you to have each site use a
completely unique and random password. Most people use variants of the same password or the
exact same password across multiple sites and services, and this is a significant security
vulnerability. If any of those services are breached (something that is completely out of your
control), then your password could be released to the hacker community, often right next to your
email. It’s shockingly easy for hackers to try using those leaked credentials with other
services, including with variations to the password. This is the most common way for people’s
accounts to be breached. This vulnerability is neutralized if the password used with the hacked
service is totally unique.</p><p>With a password manager, you can set every service to use a totally
unguessable, randomly generated, unique password, like <code>7Xg*2BMVxCo!uY</code>. Most password managers
include a random generator to make those passwords, and you never have to remember them because
they stay securely recorded inside your personal vault within the manager. Our recommendation is
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a>, an open-source and easy-to-use password manager that uses
widely-agreed-upon encryption standards for your passwords.</p><h2 id="security-questions">Security Questions

<p><span><span>In the Czech Republic, beavers built a dam in two days, which local authorities had planned for 7 years.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The rodents have saved the administration $1.2 million.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A project to restore water areas in the Brdy nature park had been under development since 2018. Over the years, the administration collected all the necessary permits and was ready to begin construction.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But it turned out to be unnecessary, as the native beavers, who have lived in the park since 2020, took matters into their own hands, building dams in the same locations planned by the government.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"The beavers saved us 30 million Czech crowns. They built the dams without any project documentation and for free," said the head of the nature reserve administration.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Beavers are known for their ability to build giant dams in streams, which function much like a modern dam. The reason they build dams is to create deep water that gives them protection from predators.</span></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Software engineers are deeply split on the subject of large language models. Many believe they’re the most transformative technology to ever hit the industry. Others believe they’re the latest in a long line of hype-only products: exciting to think about, but ultimately not useful to professionals trying to do serious work.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel like I get a lot of value from AI. I think many of the people who don’t feel this way are “holding it wrong”: i.e. they’re not using language models in the most helpful ways. In this post, I’m going to list a bunch of ways I regularly use AI in my day-to-day as a staff engineer.</p>
<h2>Writing production code</h2>
<p>I use Copilot completions every time I write code<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Almost all the completions I accept are complete boilerplate (filling out function arguments or types, for instance). It’s rare that I let Copilot produce business logic for me, but it does occasionally happen. In my areas of expertise (Ruby on Rails, for instance), I’m confident I can do better work than the LLM. It’s just a (very good) autocomplete.</p>
<p>However, I’m not always working in my areas of expertise. I frequently find myself making small tactical changes in less-familiar areas (for instance, a Golang service or a C library). I know the syntax and have written personal projects in these languages, but I’m less confident about what’s idiomatic. In these cases, I rely on Copilot more. Typically I’ll use Copilot chat with the o1 model enabled, paste in my code, and ask directly “is this idiomatic C?”</p>
<p>Relying more on the LLM like this is risky, because I don’t know what I’m missing. It basically lets me operate at a smart-intern baseline across the board. I have to also behave like a sensible intern, and make sure a subject-matter expert in the area reviews the change for me. But even with that caveat, I think it’s very high-leverage to be able to make these kinds of tactical changes quickly.</p>
<h2>Writing throwaway code</h2>
<p>I am much more liberal with my use of LLMs when I’m writing code that will never see production. For instance, I recently did a block of research which required pulling chunks of public data from an API, classifying it, and approximating that classification with a series of quick regexes. All of this code was run on my laptop only, and I used LLMs to write basically all of it: the code to pull the data, the code to run a separate LLM to classify it, the code to tokenize it and measure token frequencies and score them, and so on.</p>
<p>LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted. </p>
<h2>Learning new domains</h2>
<p>Probably the most useful thing I do with LLMs is use it as a tutor-on-demand for learning new domains. For instance, last weekend I learned the basics of Unity, relying heavily on ChatGPT-4o. The magic of learning with LLMs is that you can <em>ask questions</em>: not just “how does X work”, but follow-up questions like “how does X relate to Y”. Even more usefully, you can ask “is this right” questions. I often write up something I think I’ve learned and feed it back to the LLM, which points out where I’m right and where I’m still misunderstanding. I ask the LLM <em>a lot</em> of questions.</p>
<p>I take a lot of notes when I’m learning something new. Being able to just copy-paste all my notes in and get them reviewed by the LLM is great.</p>
<p>What about hallucinations? Honestly, since GPT-3.5, I haven’t noticed ChatGPT or Claude doing a lot of hallucinating. Most of the areas I’m trying to learn about are very well-understood (just not by me), and in my experience that means the chance of a hallucination is pretty low. I’ve never run into a case where I learned something from a LLM that turned out to be fundamentally wrong or hallucinated.</p>
<h2>Last resort bug fixes</h2>
<p>I don’t do this a lot, but sometimes when I’m really stuck on a bug, I’ll attach the entire file or files to Copilot chat, paste the error message, and just ask “can you help?”</p>
<p>The reason I don’t do this is that I think I’m currently much better at bug-hunting than current AI models. Almost all the time, Copilot (or Claude, for some personal projects) just gets confused. But it’s still worth a try if I’m genuinely stuck, just in case, because it’s so low-effort. I remember two or three cases where I’d just missed some subtle behaviour that the LLM caught, saving me a lot of time.</p>
<p>Because LLMs aren’t that good at this yet, I don’t spend a lot of time iterating or trying to un-stick the LLM. I just try once to see if it can get it.</p>
<h2>Proofreading for typos and logic mistakes</h2>
<p>I write a fair amount of English documents: ADRs, technical summaries, internal posts, and so on. I <strong>never</strong> allow the LLM to write these for me. Part of that is that I think I can write more clearly than current LLMs. Part of it is my general distaste for the ChatGPT house style.</p>
<p>What I do occasionally do is feed a draft into the LLM and ask for feedback. LLMs are great at catching typos, and will sometimes raise an interesting point that becomes an edit to my draft.</p>
<p>Like bugfixing, I don’t iterate when I’m doing this - I just ask for one round of feedback. Usually the LLM offers some stylistic feedback, which I always ignore.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I use LLMs for these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart autocomplete with Copilot</li>
<li>Short tactical changes in areas I don’t know well (always reviewed by a SME)</li>
<li>Writing lots of use-once-and-throwaway research code</li>
<li>Asking lots of questions to learn about new topics (e.g. the Unity game engine)</li>
<li>Last-resort bugfixes, just in case it can figure it out immediately</li>
<li>Big-picture proofreading for long-form English communication</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t use LLMs for these tasks (yet):</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing whole PRs for me in areas I’m familiar with</li>
<li>Writing ADRs or other technical communications</li>
<li>Research in large codebases and finding out how things are done</li>
</ul>
