<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even though the names re blacked out, you can see which organisations did presentations based on the agenda of the meetings. </p>

<p>For example there is a presentation by Timelex (a belgian law firm specialising in IT/privacy etc). There is a presentation by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator (which in 2023 was Ilkka Salmi). Various presentations by EU orgs like ENISA, the commission, europol, Eurojust </p>

<p>Then a bunch of presentations by law enforcement agencies like Europol, French Gendarmerie, Belgian &amp; Swedish justice ministries. One presentation was by 3 Italians from ministry of interior, postal police and Anti Crime Unit (DAC). One presentation was from someone from Belgian Federal police. </p>

<p>There was also someone from KU Leuven university (likely from the COSIC research group on encryption). </p>

<p>Addtionally there are some specific titles of people who gave presentations : </p>

<p>Head of the National &amp; Tactical Support Unit, Belgian Police</p>

<p>Head of Unit, Law Enforcement Cooperation and Border Management, Department for European Home Affairs Cooperation, Ministry of the Interior, Hungary</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Quarkdown is a modern Markdown-based typetting system, designed around the key concept of <strong>versatility</strong>, by seamlessly compiling a project
into a print-ready book or an interactive presentation.
All through an incredibly powerful Turing-complete extension of Markdown, ensuring your ideas flow automatically into paper.</p>

<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/paged-demo.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/paged-demo.png" alt="Paper demo"></a>
  </p><p dir="auto"><em>Original credits: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7" rel="nofollow">Attention Is All You Need</a></em></p>


<p dir="auto">Born as an extension of CommonMark and GFM, the Quarkdown Flavor brings <strong>functions</strong> to Markdown, along with many other syntax extensions.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is a function call:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".somefunction {arg1} {arg2}
    Body argument"><pre><code>.somefunction {arg1} {arg2}
    Body argument
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Possibilities are unlimited</strong> thanks to an ever-expanding <a href="https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown/blob/main/quarkdown-stdlib/src/main/kotlin/com/quarkdown/stdlib">standard library</a>,
which offers layout builders, I/O, math, conditional statements and loops.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Not enough?</strong> You can still define your own functions and variables — all within Markdown.
You can even create awesome libraries for everyone to use.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".function {greet}
    to from:
    **Hello, .to** from .from!

.greet {world} from:{iamgio}"><pre><code>.function {greet}
    to from:
    **Hello, .to** from .from!

.greet {world} from:{iamgio}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Result: <strong>Hello, world</strong> from iamgio!</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto">This out-of-the-box scripting support opens doors to complex and dynamic content that would be otherwise impossible
to achieve with vanilla Markdown.</p>
<p dir="auto">Combined with live preview and ⚡ fast compilation speed, Quarkdown simply gets the work done.</p>

<p dir="auto">What could be mistaken for a planet is actually a <strong>quark</strong> or, more specifically, a <strong>down quark</strong>,
an elementary particle that is a major constituent of matter: they give life to every complex structure we know of,
while also being one of the lightest objects in existence.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is, indeed, the concept <strong>Quarkdown</strong> is built upon.</p>

Graham Burnett described how he has been thinking about AI:</span></p><blockquote><p>In one department on campus, a recently drafted anti-A.I. policy, read literally, would actually have barred faculty from giving assignments to students that centered on A.I. (It was ultimately revised.) Last year, when some distinguished alums and other worthies conducted an external review of the history department, a top recommendation was that we urgently address the looming A.I. disruptions to our teaching and research. This suggestion got a notably cool reception. But the idea that we can just keep going about our business won’t do, either.</p><p><span>On the contrary, staggering transformations are in full swing. And yet, on campus, we’re in a bizarre interlude: everyone seems intent on pretending that the most significant revolution in the world of thought in the past century </span><em>isn’t happening</em><span>. The approach appears to be: “We’ll just tell the kids they can’t use these tools and carry on as before.” This is, simply, madness. And it won’t hold for long. It’s time to talk about what all this means for university life, and for the humanities in particular.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I suspect that a significant chunk of my historian colleagues had a negative reaction to this article. But I wholeheartedly agree with the central point Burnett makes within it —&nbsp;not that generative AI is inherently good, but simply that it is </span><em>already</em><span> transformative for the humanities, and that this fact cannot be ignored or dismissed as hype. </span></p><p>Here’s how I’m currently thinking about that transformation. </p><p>Ignoring the impact of AI on humanistic work is not just increasingly untenable. It is also foolish, because humanistic knowledge and skills are central to what it is that AI language models actually do. </p><p>The language translation, sorting, and classification abilities of AI language models —&nbsp;the LLM as a “calculator for words” — are among the most compelling uses for the current frontier models.  We’re only beginning to see these impacts in domains like paleography, data mining, and translation of archaic languages. I discussed some examples here:</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/generative-ai-for-historical-research" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d8fe561-f43e-4208-9e50-777c7accc7f1_1940x1153.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d8fe561-f43e-4208-9e50-777c7accc7f1_1940x1153.png" sizes="100vw" alt="How to use generative AI for historical research" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p>… and the state of the art has progressed quite a bit since then.

But the other factors in play (such as prioritizing user feedback via a “thumbs up” button) were similarly rooted in big-picture humanistic concerns like the impact of language on behavior, cross-cultural differences, and questions of rhetoric, genre, and tone.  </p><p>This is fascinating to me. When an IBM mainframe system broke down in the 1950s (or a steam engine exploded in the 1850s), the people who had to fix it likely did not spare a moment’s thought to consider any of these topics. </p><p>Today, engineers working on AI systems also need to think deeply and critically about the relationship between language and culture and the history and philosophy of technology. When they fail to do so, their systems literally start to break down. </p><p>Then there’s the newfound ability of non-technical people in the humanities to write their own code. This is a bigger deal than many in my field seem to recognize. I suspect this will change soon. The emerging generation of historians will simply take it for granted that they can create their own custom research and teaching tools and deploy them at will, more or less for free. </p><p>My own efforts so far have mostly been focused on two niche educational games modeled on old school text-based adventures —&nbsp;not exactly something with a huge potential audience. But that’s exactly why I choose to do it. The stakes were low; the interest level for me personally was high; and I had significant expertise in the actual material and format, if not the code. </p><p>The progression from my first attempt (last fall) to my second (earlier this spring) has been an amazing learning experience. </p><p><span>Here’s the first game (</span><a href="https://history-lens.vercel.app/" rel="">you can find a free playable version here</a><span>). It’s a 17th century apothecary simulator that requires students to read and utilize actual early modern medical recipes to heal patients based on real historical figures.

Anyone who thinks you can’t learn from interactive tutoring by an AI has not tried. You absolutely can.</p><p>On the other hand, it is just a brutal fact that AI chatbots are significantly damaging core aspects of the educational system. There’s no denying it, and it needs to be taken seriously by educators, students, politicians, and above all by the frontier AI labs themselves. </p><p><span> Educators tend to point to the ways ChatGPT and its competitors have affected </span><em>us —&nbsp;</em><span>eroding our ability to accurately assess student writing because such a large proportion of students turn in machine-generated essays, and forcing us to come up with entirely new assignments and lesson plans as a result. </span></p><p><span>But in the longer run, the damage is being done to students. By making effort an optional factor in higher education rather than the whole </span><em>point </em><span>of it, LLMs risk producing a generation of students who have simply </span><em>never experienced </em><span>the feeling of focused intellectual work. Students who have never faced writer’s block are also students who have never experienced the blissful flow state that comes when you break through writer’s block. Students who have never searched fruitlessly in a library for hours are also students who, in a fundamental and distressing way, simply don’t know what a library is even for. </span></p><p><em>New York Magazine</em><span> has a new </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" rel="">article</a><span> on student use of ChatGPT which captures the  problem well. Here’s a Columbia student who speaks for a significant chunk of the current university population:</span></p><blockquote><p>“Most assignments in college are not relevant,” he told me. “They’re hackable by AI, and I just had no interest in doing them.” While other new students fretted over the university’s rigorous core curriculum, described by the school as “intellectually expansive” and “personally transformative,” Lee used AI to breeze through with minimal effort. When I asked him why he had gone through so much trouble to get to an Ivy League university only to off-load all of the learning to a robot, he said, “It’s the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife.”</p></blockquote><p>I will speak frankly. This sucks. </p><p>It sucks the joy out of teaching, and it sucks the meaning out of the whole experience of getting an education. </p><p>When I was a postdoc at Columbia, I taught one of the core curriculum classes mentioned here, with a reading list that included over a dozen weighty tomes (one week was spent on the Bible, the next week on the Quran, another on Thomas Aquinas, and so on). There wasn’t much that was fun or easy about it. And yet —&nbsp;probably for that very reason — I learned more from teaching that class than from any other. Something fundamental about that experience feels like it’s ruined now. </p><p><span>But this is not the entire story. The middle part of D. Graham Burnett’s </span><em>New Yorker </em><span>piece strikes me as an important corrective to this sort of thing. Burnett is, I think it’s fair to say, rapturous about his students’ response to an assignment asking them to discuss the concept of attention with ChatGPT, then edit and submit the results. </span></p><p>Here’s a sample:</p><blockquote><p>Reading the results, on my living-room couch, turned out to be the most profound experience of my teaching career. I’m not sure how to describe it. In a basic way, I felt I was watching a new kind of creature being born, and also watching a generation come face to face with that birth: an encounter with something part sibling, part rival, part careless child-god, part mechanomorphic shadow—an alien familiar.</p></blockquote><p><span>I have had the same feelings, for instance when I first began tinkering with </span><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/simulating-history-with-chatgpt" rel="">history simulation assignments</a><span>. Language models are a genuinely novel teaching tool. Their impact is still uncertain. What that means is that now is </span><em>exactly </em><span>the time when people who are genuinely passionate about teaching and learning for its own sake —&nbsp;not as a scorecard to judge politicians, not as a source of corporate profit —&nbsp;need to take an active role. </span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://resobscura.substack.com/p/ai-makes-the-humanities-more-important?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/ai-makes-the-humanities-more-important?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>My greatest concern when it comes to LLMs in humanities education is that they will lead to a further polarization in educational outcomes. The Princeton students who Burnett teaches seem extraordinarily thoughtful and creative in their responses to his assignment. I suspect students in a social studies class at an underfunded public high school class would not be. </p><p><span>For this reason, it is vitally important that educators learn how to </span><em>personally </em><span>create and deploy AI-based assignments and tools that are tailored directly for the type of teaching </span><em>they </em><span>want to do. If we cede that ground, if we ignore the challenge, then we will watch helplessly as education gets taken over by cynical and stultifying “AI learning tools” which trumpet their interactivity while eroding the personalized student-teacher relationship that is at the heart of learning. </span></p><p><span>This is the basic thinking behind an </span><a href="https://apps.neh.gov/PublicQuery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=AC-303525-25" rel="">NEH grant </a><span>which I and two of my UCSC colleagues, Pranav Anand (linguistics) and Zac Zimmer (literature), were awarded in January of this year… and which got cancelled by the Trump administration/DOGE last month.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-162236863" href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/ai-makes-the-humanities-more-important#footnote-1-162236863" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> We are continuing our planned work, and I’ll keep writing about it here. </span></p><p>I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments, and please consider supporting my work via a paid subscription if this is an option for you. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png" width="1456" height="117" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:117,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97681,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff38d7e8e-658b-4957-ab40-d85eedd0fe40_3000x241.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>•&nbsp;D.

    <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>A critical </span><span>component</span><span> of healthcare, blood transfusions play a vital role in saving lives around the globe every day. Maintaining an adequate blood supply, though, is no easy task, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The demand for O</span><span>–</span><span>negative blood — the universal donor type — often exceeds supply and donations have a limited shelf life. Looking to address the issue are a group of Japanese scientists led by Hiromi Sakai at <a href="https://www.naramed-u.ac.jp/university/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nara Medical University</a>. </span><span>They’ve</span><span> developed a new type of artificial blood that can be used in patients of any blood type. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>The artificial blood is created by extracting hemoglobin — a protein </span><span>containing</span><span> iron that </span><span>facilitates</span><span> the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells — from expired donor blood. It is then encased in a protective shell to create stable, virus-free artificial red blood cells. As these artificial cells have no blood type, there is no need for compatibility testing. The synthetic blood can </span><span>reportedly be</span><span> stored for up to two years at room temperature and five years under refrigeration. That is a significant improvement over donated red blood cells, which can only be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of </span><span>42 days</span><span>. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="683d47927a6cd"><span data-contrast="auto">Artificial Blood Trials </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Small-scale studies began in 2022. Three groups of four healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 50 received a single intravenous injection of hemoglobin vesicles — artificial oxygen carriers that mimic the structure of red blood cells — in increasing amounts, up to 100 milliliters. While some participants experienced mild side effects, there were no significant changes in vital signs, including blood pressure. Building on that success, Sakai announced that his team was accelerating the process last July. In March, it started administering between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cell solution to volunteers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>If no side effects are confirmed, the trial will shift to examin</span><span>ing</span><span> the treatment’s efficacy and safety. It aims to put the artificial red blood cells into practical use by around 2030. While these studies are taking place, Professor Teruyuki Komatsu of Chuo University’s Faculty of Science and Engineering is also working on the development of artificial oxygen carriers, using albumin-encased hemoglobin to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke. So far, animal studies have shown promising results. As a result, researchers are now eager to move to human trials.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p>A heartfelt provocation about AI-assisted programming.</p>
<p>Tech execs are mandating LLM adoption. That’s bad strategy. But I get where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>Some of the smartest people I know share a bone-deep belief that AI is a fad —  the next iteration of NFT mania. I’ve been reluctant to push back on them, because, well, they’re smarter than me. But their arguments are unserious, and worth confronting. Extraordinarily talented people are doing work that LLMs already do better, out of  spite.</p>

<p>All progress on LLMs could halt today, and LLMs would remain the 2nd most important thing to happen over the course of my career.</p>
<p><strong>Important caveat</strong>: I’m discussing only the implications of LLMs for software development. For art, music, and writing? I got nothing. I’m inclined to believe the skeptics in those fields. I just don’t believe them about mine.</p>
<p>Bona fides: I’ve been shipping software since the mid-1990s. I started out in boxed, shrink-wrap C code.  Survived an ill-advised <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Design-Generic-Programming-Patterns/dp/0201704315" title="">Alexandrescu</a> C++ phase. Lots of Ruby and Python tooling.  Some kernel work. A whole lot of server-side C, Go, and Rust. However you define “serious developer”, I qualify. Even if only on one of your lower tiers.</p>
<h3 id="level-setting"><a href="#level-setting" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>level setting</span></h3><p>† (or, God forbid, 2 years ago with Copilot)</p>
<p>First, we need to get on the same page. If you were trying and failing to use an LLM for code 6 months ago †, you’re not doing what most serious LLM-assisted coders are doing.</p>

<p>People coding with LLMs today use agents. Agents get to poke around your codebase on their own. They author files directly. They run tools. They compile code, run tests, and iterate on the results. They also:</p>

<ul>
<li>pull in arbitrary code from the tree, or from other trees online, into their context windows,
</li><li>run standard Unix tools to navigate the tree and extract information,
</li><li>interact with Git,
</li><li>run existing tooling, like linters, formatters, and model checkers, and
</li><li>make essentially arbitrary tool calls (that you set up) through MCP.
</li></ul>
<p>The code in an agent that actually “does stuff” with code is not, itself, AI. This should reassure you. It’s surprisingly simple systems code, wired to ground truth about programming in the same way a Makefile is. You could write an effective coding agent in a weekend. Its strengths would have more to do with how you think about and structure builds and linting and test harnesses than with how advanced o3 or Sonnet have become.</p>
<p>If you’re making requests on a ChatGPT page and then pasting the resulting (broken) code into your editor, you’re not doing what the AI boosters are doing. No wonder you’re talking past each other.</p>
<h3 id="the-positive-case"><a href="#the-positive-case" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>the positive case</span></h3>
<p><img alt="four quadrants of tedium and importance" src="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/assets/code-quad.png?2/3&amp;center"></p>

<p>LLMs can write a large fraction of all the tedious code you’ll ever need to write. And most code on most projects is tedious. LLMs drastically reduce the number of things you’ll ever need to Google. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they don’t get tired; they’re immune to inertia.</p>

<p>Think of anything you wanted to build but didn’t. You tried to home in on some first steps. If you’d been in the limerent phase of a new programming language, you’d have started writing. But you weren’t, so you put it off, for a day, a year, or your whole career.</p>

<p>I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the bookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An LLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it will drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost works, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing things work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.</p>

<p>There’s a downside. Sometimes, gnarly stuff needs doing. But you don’t wanna do it. So you refactor unit tests, soothing yourself with the lie that you’re doing real work. But an LLM can be told to go refactor all your unit tests. An agent can occupy itself for hours putzing with your tests in a VM and come back later with a PR. If you listen to me, you’ll know that. You’ll feel worse yak-shaving. You’ll end up doing… real work.</p>
<h3 id="but-you-have-no-idea-what-the-code-is"><a href="#but-you-have-no-idea-what-the-code-is" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but you have no idea what the code is</span></h3>
<p>Are you a vibe coding Youtuber? Can you not read code? If so: astute point. Otherwise: what the fuck is wrong with you?</p>

<p>You’ve always been responsible for what you merge to <code>main</code>. You were five years go. And you are tomorrow, whether or not you use an LLM.</p>

<p>If you build something with an LLM that people will depend on, read the code. In fact, you’ll probably do more than that. You’ll spend 5-10 minutes knocking it back into your own style. LLMs are <a href="https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules" title="">showing signs of adapting</a> to local idiom, but we’re not there yet.</p>

<p>People complain about LLM-generated code being “probabilistic”. No it isn’t. It’s code. It’s not Yacc output. It’s knowable. The LLM might be stochastic. But the LLM doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you can make sense of the result, and whether your guardrails hold.</p>

<p>Reading other people’s code is part of the job. If you can’t metabolize the boring, repetitive code an LLM generates: skills issue! How are you handling the chaos human developers turn out on a deadline?</p>
<p>† (because it can hold 50-70kloc in its context window)</p>
<p>For the last month or so, Gemini 2.5 has been my go-to †. Almost nothing it spits out for me merges without edits. I’m sure there’s a skill to getting a SOTA model to one-shot a feature-plus-merge! But I don’t care. I like moving the code around and chuckling to myself while I delete all the stupid comments. I have to read the code line-by-line anyways.</p>
<h3 id="but-hallucination"><a href="#but-hallucination" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but hallucination</span></h3>
<p>If hallucination matters to you, your programming language has let you down.</p>

<p>Agents lint. They compile and run tests. If their LLM invents a new function signature, the agent sees the error. They feed it back to the LLM, which says “oh, right, I totally made that up” and then tries again.</p>

<p>You’ll only notice this happening if you watch the chain of thought log your agent generates. Don’t. This is why I like <a href="https://zed.dev/agentic" title="">Zed’s agent mode</a>: it begs you to tab away and let it work, and pings you with a desktop notification when it’s done.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are still environments where hallucination matters. But “hallucination” is the first thing developers bring up when someone suggests using LLMs, despite it being (more or less) a solved problem.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-code-is-shitty-like-that-of-a-junior-developer"><a href="#but-the-code-is-shitty-like-that-of-a-junior-developer" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the code is shitty, like that of a junior developer</span></h3>
<p>Does an intern cost $20/month? Because that’s what Cursor.ai costs.</p>

<p>Part of being a senior developer is making less-able coders productive, be they fleshly or algebraic. Using agents well is both a both a  skill and an engineering project all its own, of prompts, indices, <a href="https://fly.io/blog/semgrep-but-for-real-now/" title="">and (especially) tooling.</a> LLMs only produce shitty code if you let them.</p>
<p>† (Also: 100% of all the Bash code you should author ever again)</p>
<p>Maybe the current confusion is about who’s doing what work. Today, LLMs do a lot of typing, Googling, test cases †, and edit-compile-test-debug cycles. But even the most Claude-poisoned serious developers in the world still own curation, judgement, guidance, and direction.</p>

<p>Also: let’s stop kidding ourselves about how good our human first cuts really are.</p>
<h3 id="but-its-bad-at-rust"><a href="#but-its-bad-at-rust" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but it’s bad at rust</span></h3>
<p>It’s hard to get a good toolchain for Brainfuck, too. Life’s tough in the aluminum siding business.</p>
<p>† (and they surely will; the Rust community takes tooling seriously)</p>
<p>A lot of LLM skepticism probably isn’t really about LLMs. It’s projection. People say “LLMs can’t code” when what they really mean is “LLMs can’t write Rust”. Fair enough! But people select languages in part based on how well LLMs work with them, so Rust people should get on that †.</p>

<p>I work mostly in Go. I’m confident the designers of the Go programming language didn’t set out to produce the most LLM-legible language in the industry. They succeeded nonetheless Go has just enough type safety, an extensive standard library, and a culture that prizes (often repetitive) idiom. LLMs kick ass generating it.</p>

<p>All this is to say: I write some Rust. I like it fine. If LLMs and Rust aren’t working for you, I feel you. But if that’s your whole thing, we’re not having the same argument.</p>

<p>Do you like fine Japanese woodworking? All hand tools and sashimono joinery? Me too. Do it on your own time.</p>
<p>† (I’m a piker compared to my woodworking friends)</p>
<p>I have a basic wood shop in my basement †. I could get a lot of satisfaction from building a table. And, if that table is a workbench or a grill table, sure, I’ll build it. But if I need, like, a table? For people to sit at? In my office? I buy a fucking table.</p>

<p>Professional software developers are in the business of solving practical problems for people with code. We are not, in our day jobs, artisans. Steve Jobs was wrong: we do not need to carve the unseen feet in the sculpture. Nobody cares if the logic board traces are pleasingly routed. If anything we build endures, it won’t be because the codebase was beautiful.</p>

<p>Besides, that’s not really what happens. If you’re taking time carefully golfing functions down into graceful, fluent, minimal functional expressions, alarm bells should ring. You’re yak-shaving. The real work has depleted your focus. You’re not building: you’re self-soothing.</p>

<p>Which, wait for it, is something LLMs are good for. They devour schlep, and clear a path to the important stuff, where your judgement and values really matter.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-mediocrity"><a href="#but-the-mediocrity" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the mediocrity</span></h3>
<p>As a mid-late career coder, I’ve come to appreciate mediocrity. You should be so lucky as to  have it flowing almost effortlessly from a tap.</p>

<p>We all write mediocre code. Mediocre code: often fine. Not all code is equally important. Some code should be mediocre. Maximum effort on a random unit test? You’re doing something wrong. Your team lead should correct you.</p>

<p>Developers all love to preen about code. They worry LLMs lower the “ceiling” for quality. Maybe. But they also raise the “floor”.</p>

<p>Gemini’s floor is higher than my own.  My code looks nice. But it’s not as thorough. LLM code is repetitive. But mine includes dumb contortions where I got too clever trying to DRY things up.</p>

<p>And LLMs aren’t mediocre on every axis. They almost certainly have a bigger bag of algorithmic tricks than you do: radix tries, topological sorts, graph reductions, and LDPC codes. Humans romanticize <code>rsync</code> (<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-749/READINGS/required/cas/tridgell96.pdf" title="">Andrew Tridgell</a> wrote a paper about it!). To an LLM it might not be that much more interesting than a SQL join.</p>

<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. It doesn’t matter. If truly mediocre code is all we ever get from LLM, that’s still huge. It’s that much less mediocre code humans have to write.</p>
<h3 id="but-itll-never-be-agi"><a href="#but-itll-never-be-agi" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but it’ll never be AGI</span></h3>
<p>I don’t give a shit.</p>

<p>Smart practitioners get wound up by the AI/VC hype cycle. I can’t blame them. But it’s not an argument. Things either work or they don’t, no matter what Jensen Huang has to say about it.</p>
<h3 id="but-they-take-rr-jerbs"><a href="#but-they-take-rr-jerbs" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but they take-rr jerbs</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43776612" title="">So does open source.</a> We used to pay good money for databases.</p>

<p>We’re a field premised on automating other people’s jobs away. “Productivity gains,” say the economists. You get what that means, right? Fewer people doing the same stuff. Talked to a travel agent lately? Or a floor broker? Or a record store clerk? Or a darkroom tech?</p>

<p>When this argument comes up, libertarian-leaning VCs start the chant: lamplighters, creative destruction, new kinds of work. Maybe. But I’m not hypnotized. I have no fucking clue whether we’re going to be better off after LLMs. Things could get a lot worse for us.</p>

<p>LLMs really might displace many software developers. That’s not a high horse we get to ride. Our jobs are just as much in tech’s line of fire as everybody else’s have been for the last 3 decades. We’re not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_port_strike" title="">East Coast dockworkers</a>; we won’t stop progress on our own.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-plagiarism"><a href="#but-the-plagiarism" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the plagiarism</span></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence is profoundly — and probably unfairly — threatening to visual artists in ways that might be hard to appreciate if you don’t work in the arts.</p>

<p>We imagine artists spending their working hours pushing the limits of expression. But the median artist isn’t producing gallery pieces. They produce on brief: turning out competent illustrations and compositions for magazine covers, museum displays, motion graphics, and game assets.</p>

<p>LLMs easily — alarmingly — clear industry quality bars . Gallingly, one of the things they’re best at is churning out just-good-enough facsimiles of human creative work.  I have family in visual arts. I can’t talk to them about LLMs. I don’t blame them. They’re probably not wrong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, software developers spot code fragments <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">seemingly lifted</a> from public repositories on Github and lose their shit. What about the licensing? If you’re a lawyer, I defer. But if you’re a software developer playing this card? Cut me a little slack as I ask you to shove this concern up your ass. No profession has demonstrated more contempt for intellectual property.</p>

<p>The median dev thinks Star Wars and Daft Punk are a public commons. The great cultural project of developers has been opposing any protection that might inconvenience a monetizable media-sharing site. When they fail at policy, they route around it with coercion. They stand up global-scale piracy networks and sneer at anybody who so much as tries to preserve a new-release window for a TV show.</p>

<p>Call any of this out if you want to watch a TED talk about how hard it is to stream <em>The Expanse</em> on LibreWolf. Yeah, we get it. You don’t believe in IPR. Then shut the fuck up about IPR. Reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p>It’s all special pleading anyways. LLMs digest code further than you do. If you don’t believe a typeface designer can stake a moral claim on the terminals and counters of a letterform, you sure as hell can’t be possessive about a red-black tree.</p>
<h3 id="positive-case-redux"><a href="#positive-case-redux" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>positive case redux</span></h3>
<p>When I started writing a couple days ago, I wrote a section to “level set” to the  state of the art of LLM-assisted programming. A bluefish filet has a longer shelf life than an LLM take. In the time it took you to read this, everything changed.</p>

<p>Kids today don’t just use agents; they use asynchronous agents. They wake up, free-associate 13 different things for their LLMs to work on, make coffee, fill out a TPS report, drive to the Mars Cheese Castle, and then check their notifications. They’ve got 13 PRs to review. Three get tossed and re-prompted. Five of them get the same feedback a junior dev gets. And five get merged.</p>

<p><em>“I’m sipping rocket fuel right now,”</em> a friend tells me. <em>“The folks on my team who aren’t embracing AI? It’s like they’re standing still.”</em> He’s not bullshitting me. He doesn’t work in SFBA. He’s got no reason to lie.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of things I can’t trust an LLM with. No LLM has any of access to prod here. But I’ve been first responder on an incident and fed 4o — not o4-mini, 4o — log transcripts, and watched it in seconds spot LVM metadata corruption issues on a host we’ve been complaining about for months. Am I better than an LLM agent at interrogating OpenSearch logs and Honeycomb traces? No. No, I am not.</p>

<p>To the consternation of many of my friends, I’m not a radical or a futurist. I’m a statist. I believe in the haphazard perseverance of complex systems, of institutions, of reversions to the mean. I write Go and Python code. I’m not a Kool-aid drinker.</p>

<p>But something real is happening. My smartest friends are blowing it off. Maybe I persuade you. Probably I don’t. But we need to be done making space for bad arguments.</p>
<h3 id="but-im-tired-of-hearing-about-it"><a href="#but-im-tired-of-hearing-about-it" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but i’m tired of hearing about it</span></h3>
<p>And here I rejoin your company. I read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/" title="">Simon Willison</a>, and that’s all I really need. But all day, every day, a sizable chunk of the front page of HN is allocated to LLMs: incremental model updates, startups doing things with LLMs, LLM tutorials, screeds against LLMs. It’s annoying!</p>

<p>But AI is also incredibly — a word I use advisedly — important. It’s getting the same kind of attention that smart phones got in 2008, and not as much as the Internet got. That seems about right.</p>

<p>I think this is going to get clearer over the next year. The cool kid haughtiness about “stochastic parrots” and “vibe coding” can’t survive much more contact with reality. I’m snarking about these people, but I meant what I said: they’re smarter than me. And when they get over this affectation, they’re going to make coding agents profoundly more effective than they are today.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blog/typing-118-wpm-brain-rewiring">http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blog/typing-118-wpm-brain-rewiring</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44162327">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Typing became my therapy. Not even kidding.</p>

    <p>Started at 60 WPM, felt like dragging my feet through mud every time I had to write code comments or documentation. Now? 118 WPM. No home row bullshit. No "proper finger placement." Just pure, chaotic rhythm. <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/h2mhhp0" target="_blank">Proof here</a> because I know you don't believe me.</p>

    <h2>My Daily Brain Reset Ritual</h2>

    <p>Every morning, before I even think about opening VS Code, before Slack starts destroying my soul, before the daily standup where we pretend we know what we're doing, I just <strong>type</strong>. Five minutes. That's it.</p>

    <p>It's like meditation but actually useful. Resets my brain, calms the static from yesterday's debugging session, and gets me in the zone. Way better than staring at my ceiling wondering why I chose this career.</p>

    <h2>Speed is Useless if You're Wrong</h2>

    <p>Here's the thing that took me way too long to figure out: rushing makes everything worse. Every time I tried to go fast, I'd mess up, backspace like crazy, and end up slower than when I started. Classic developer move, honestly.</p>

    <p>So I slowed down. Focused on hitting every key right. And boom — speed just... happened. 90 WPM, 100 WPM, 118 WPM. All came when I was hitting 100% accuracy consistently.</p>

    <p><img src="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blogs/top-speed.png" alt="top-speed"></p><p>It's like debugging. You can't just randomly change stuff and hope it works. You gotta be methodical, get it right, then optimize. Same energy.</p>

    <p>Some words still absolutely wreck me though. "Obviously" keeps coming out as "obviousily" and I want to throw my keyboard every time. So now I just slow down for those demon words and blast through the rest. Strategic speed management or whatever.</p>

    <h2>Screw the Rules, Find Your Flow</h2>

    <p>Plot twist: I don't type "correctly" at all. My fingers just go wherever they want. It's like anarchist typing. My left pinky probably hasn't touched the 'A' key in months, but somehow I'm still in the 99.5 percentile.</p>

    <p>Turns out the "proper way" is just a suggestion. Like following PEP 8 or using semicolons in JavaScript. Sure, it's nice, but if your way works better, who cares?</p>

    <h2>When Your Brain is Fried</h2>

    <p>You know those days when you've been staring at the same bug for 3 hours and your brain feels like mush? Or when you've been doomscrolling Twitter instead of working and feel dead inside?</p>

    <p>That's when I open <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="_blank">Keybr</a>. It's like going to the gym but for your neurons. Good typing session = instant mood boost. Small win = dopamine hit. Better than coffee, honestly.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I use it as a break between coding sessions. Brain getting foggy? Type for 2 minutes. Stuck on a problem? Type. Deployment failed and you want to quit tech forever? You guessed it.</p>

    <h2>The Inevitable Skill Issue Moments</h2>

    <p>Not gonna lie, there were weeks where I absolutely tanked. Bad accuracy, slow speeds, feeling like I'd forgotten how to use a keyboard. Classic imposter syndrome but for typing.</p>

    <p>"Maybe I'm not actually good at this. Maybe 118 WPM was just a fluke. Maybe I should just stick to hunt-and-peck like a normal person."</p>

    <p>But then I'd bounce back. Always. Usually harder and faster than before. It's like when you're stuck on a bug for days and then suddenly the solution is obvious. The struggle makes the breakthrough better.</p>

    <p><img src="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blogs/typing-profile.png" alt="typing-profile"></p><h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>

    <p>Been doing this for over a year now. 7,000+ lessons completed on Keybr. My brain genuinely feels different. Not just the typing speed, but focus, discipline, the ability to sit down and just <em>do the thing</em>.</p>

    <p>It's one of those weird habits that seems pointless but somehow fixes everything else. Like how learning vim makes you better at thinking about text editing, or how writing tests makes you better at designing APIs.</p>

    <p><strong>Real talk:</strong> This stupid little habit has probably made me a better developer. Faster at writing code, better at documentation, less frustrated when I have to type out long variable names or commit messages.</p>

    <p>Plus, there's something deeply satisfying about watching words appear on screen at the speed of thought. It's like having a direct brain-to-computer interface, but with more finger movement.</p>

    <p>So yeah. Typing fixed my brain. And probably made me less annoying in code reviews because I can actually write coherent comments now.</p>

    <p>End of story. Now go find your own weird productivity hack that makes no sense but somehow works.</p>

                        <p><b>Analysis: The legal landscape surrounding the use of drones is currently far from clear and many practical questions remain unanswered.</b></p>
<p>Once only found in the realm of science fiction movies, drone delivery services are now an increasingly obvious part of our urban landscape. Service providers such as <a href="https://www.manna.aero/" target="_blank">Manna</a> and <a href="https://wing.com/" target="_blank">Wing</a> (the latter operated by <a href="http://google.com/">Google's</a> parent company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc." target="_blank">Alphabet</a>) are now delivering an ever growing range of items to consumers and corporate entities, particularly across the Dublin region: from <a href="https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/clips/22230075/">coffee and pastries</a> to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2024/0702/1457657-drone-delivery-hospitals/)">medical supplies and devices</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>From RTÉ Radio 1's Brendan O'Connor Show, Bobby Healy from Manna Aero drone deliveries on delivering fast food around Dublin</b></i></p>
<p>But as the phenomenon of drone deliveries increases, the concerns of home owners and residents negatively impacted by the rapid rise in the number of flyovers have attracted ever greater media attention. In recent weeks, the <a href="https://aaiu.ie/" target="_blank">Air Accident Investigation Unit</a> reported on an <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/dublin/2024/1108/1479951-drone-injury-dublin/">incident</a> in Dublin in 2022 where a man was struck by a propeller blade which had separated from a drone and had fallen on him as he mowed the lawn. Fears in relation to the potential for privacy breaches have also generated considerable attention as have complaints in relation to the noise generated by the whirring of the drones themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the legal landscape surrounding the use of drones is far from clear. While to some extent drone usage is regulated at both an Irish and European level – with the <a href="https://www.iaa.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Aviation Authority</a> playing an important role in this regard – many practical legal questions remain unanswered. Can a home owner, for instance, prevent drone delivery companies from flying over their property? Or can they sue for trespass where flyovers do occur in the airspace over their home?</p>

<p><i><b>From RTÉ Radio 1's News at One, Tom Kuhn from Wing on how drones are being used to deliver medical supplies to private hospitals</b></i></p>
<p>In the past, it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_est_solum,_eius_est_usque_ad_coelum_et_ad_inferos" target="_blank">said</a> that the owner of land owned everything reaching up to the heavens and down to hell. With the arrival of modern aviation, this understanding of the scope of property ownership shifted. Conscious of the need to balance, on one hand, the rights of landowners to enjoy the use of their land, with, on the other hand, the rights of the general public to take advantage of air travel, the courts in England <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_of_Leigh_v_Skyviews_%26_General_Ltd" target="_blank">determined</a> that the ownership of land carried with it rights in air space above the land only to such height as is 'necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment’ of it and the structures on it. This approach was reflected in Irish law via section 55 of the <a href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1936/act/40">Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936</a> which states that a landowner may not sue for trespass or<b><i> </i></b>nuisance where aircraft fly over property at a height which is ‘reasonable’ having regard to wind, weather and all the circumstances.</p>
<p>However, these statements of law provide little guidance in answering the questions now increasingly raised with the rapid growth in the use of drone technology: what is ‘reasonable’ or ‘necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment’ of the land is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>Ireland is not alone in having as yet failed to clarify the law in this area. Almost all jurisdictions are grappling with similar issues. Research from America, for example, also speaks to the confusion existing there as to the scope of landowners’ rights to prevent or exclude drones from flying over their property. Influential brands including <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://walmart.com/">Walmart</a> have met tough opposition in seeking to develop policies facilitating the use of commercial drone delivery services.</p>

<p><i><b>From RTÉ Radio 1's Morning Ireland, Jamie Cudden from Dublin City Council on the council's launch of the Drone Innovation Project</b></i></p>
<p>Yet, necessity is the mother of invention and innovative solutions are being proposed. Rather than downgrading the rights of property owners in relation to the air space over their land, the most viable solution actually appears to be the opposite. The simplest and fairest method of introducing clarity in this area for all concerned – home owners, residents and drone delivery companies alike – is arguably to develop legislation clearly defining the height to which private property ownership extends into the air space.</p>
<p>In this model, and conscious of the need to reduce the potential nuisance caused by drones, it could be stated that home owners’ rights include the air space up to 60 or 70 metres above their property (delivery drones currently operate between 50-65 metres). Some homeowners or residents will be happy to let the air space over their property be used, whether in return for payment or otherwise. Where this happens, it could allow for the emergence of digital air space sharing platforms (like <a href="https://www.airbnb.ie/" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>) to facilitate temporary flight paths for drone deliveries. Where homeowners or residents do not consent to such flyovers, an air corridor designated for drone use over the 60 or 70 metre limit would have to be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is essential that issues regarding the ownership of lower altitude airspace are addressed as a matter of priority</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By forcing drone delivery companies, in particular, to either acquire the consent of landowners if they wish to fly below this threshold, or operate in a corridor above it, some of the heat may be taken out of the debate. While this proposal appears to be the strongest solution yet developed, it is not without its flaws. At a practical level, it would, for one, be hard to prove that a drone was flying below the 60 or 70 meter limit and was trespassing. However, technology and data solutions could surely be developed or repurposed to mitigate these risks through the sharing of flight logs or other information captured in flight.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the status quo appears unsustainable and solutions, whether those set out here or otherwise, will have to be found. In the interest of all concerned, it is essential that issues regarding the ownership of lower altitude airspace are addressed as a matter of priority.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>On April 16, 2025, Apple released a patch for a bug in CoreAudio which they said was <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122282">“Actively exploited in the wild.”</a> This flew under the radar a bit. <a href="https://blog.epsilon-sec.com/cve-2025-31201-rpac.html">Epsilon’s blog</a> has a great writeup of the other bug that was presumably exploited in this chain: a bug in RPAC. The only thing out there that I am aware of about the CoreAudio side of the bug is a video by Billy Ellis (it’s great. I’m featured. You should watch…you’re probably here from that anyways). As he mentioned in the video, “Another security researcher by the name of ‘Noah’ was able to <em>tweak</em> the values such that when it was played on MacOS, it actually did lead to a crash.” I think it’s still worth it to write about that ‘tweaking’ process in more detail.</p>
<p>I had just finished another project and ended up on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit">spreadsheet</a> maintained by Project Zero which tracks zero days that have been actively exploited in the wild. It just so happened that <em>that</em> day there had been another addition: CVE-2025-31200. I couldn’t find any writeups on it, or really any information other than the fact that it was a “memory corruption in CoreAudio” so I decided to have a look myself. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>There was a bit of a rocky start. I don’t have IDA Pro so my options for binary diffing are limited. Billy mentions Diaphora in his video, and that does seem like the industry standard. Apparently it also has a Ghidra plugin, but I don’t want that Java stink on my laptop. So I had to do things the old-fashioned way. Luckily there is an awesome tool called ipsw maintained by Blacktop. One of its primary use cases is diffing between different versions of iOS. There is even a <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw-diffs">repo</a> where markdown versions of the diffs are posted, so it was trivial for me to have a look at that. There were a relatively small number of updates, and it was clear that the ones related to this bug were in AudioCodecs.</p>

<p>A 20 byte increase in the __text section is exactly the kind of change you’d expect from a memory corruption like this, so I thought I would crack open the new and the old versions in Binary Ninja and the change would be obvious. First however, I had to actually do the binary diffing. Ipsw-diff is great for basic info like this, but it’s not a disassembler, so it doesn’t show any code-level changes. In order to do the actual diffing I used radiff2 from Radare2.</p>
<p>I fully expected this binary to be a part of the Dyld shared cache. However, if you pay close attention to the path from ipsw-diff, you can see that it isn’t. It lives in <code>/System/Library/Components/AudioCodecs.component/</code>. That’s <em>Components</em> not <em>Frameworks.</em> I don’t know what the difference between them is. Regardless, AudioCodecs on macOS is not part of the shared cache. I collected both the old and the new binaries and ran them through radiff2.</p>
<h2 id="the-diff">The Diff</h2>
<p>Radiff2 spit out a few candidate functions for me to study more closely. Most of them just had compiler entropy differences (think registers shifting around) or different addresses since the text section had shifted. Luckily, one function stuck out as the obvious candidate: <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize(this, bitStreamReader)</code>, presumably a C++ (you can tell by the ‘::’) member method of the CodecConfig class. There were a number of logical changes, a new error message, and a new check all clearly visible at the bottom of the method. I thought that the bug would now be trivial to spot since the changes seemed self-contained enough, and often it’s the followup—not the actual exploit primitive itself—that takes most of the ingenuity.</p>
<p>I stared for a while at the difference between the old and new Deserialize method. I even took the time to manually copy and paste them out into VSCode and use its built-in diffing functionality. I could tell that a lot of it was the same. The method consists in a series of reads from a bitstream, each having their own failure cases and control flow. It looks like a relatively typical parsing method. The high level flow is a series of blocks that look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read some bits from the stream with the bitStreamReader</li>
<li>Check some error conditions</li>
<li>If failure then log failure and exit</li>
<li>If success then advance the pointer and continue to the next block</li>
</ol>
<p>The section that differed was the final read from the stream. In it there were repeated snippets like this meant to read in the length of some array:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, also common between them (within the differing sections) was a little floating point dance to compute the bit width of the array entries (bitWidth) that would later be read in from the stream.</p>

In both versions there is some code that computes the size of an array. It uses the number of required elements, and the current size of the array:</p>





<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span>1</span><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>elementCount</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>currentSize</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

I figured if I just traced through the rest of the code, then there would be some write into the <code>elementCount</code>-sized array with a size check based on <code>this+0x58</code>, rather than <code>elementCount</code>. That would be the primitive. Here is the chunk of the code that reads from the stream and writes in to the array:</p>

After seeing the new error message, I figured that that must be it! Whatever control flow leads to the new error message in the patched version has got to be the control flow that induces the error. The following must hold in order to reach the new check:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>desiredCount</code> ≠ 0. This takes us to the loop that tries to populate the array. The code is trying to populate an array with values read in from a stream. It is getting the <em>number</em> of those values prior (in the patched version that is <code>desiredCount</code>). If that number is zero then we’re good! We don’t need to try to populate the array and we don’t need to throw any error messages.</li>
<li>At some point while reading from the stream, <code>value</code> should be ≥ <code>elementCount</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) is trivial to induce. Consider that path in the vulnerable code. There is never a check for whether or not <code>elementCount</code> == 0. It is simply used to size the array and then the loop begins. So any audio file that reaches this code will “go down that path” in the old version. This was actually my first guess about the bug because the check whether or not <code>elementCount</code> == 0 stood out as the first big control-flow difference. In the old version, no resizing happens at all if <code>elementCount</code> == 0:</p>

</span></span><span><span>12</span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But there is no bug in that condition. If <code>elementCount</code> were zero here, then that would mean that there are no elements required to be in the array, so no resizing happens. The loop exits immediately at the check <code>(uint64_t)index &gt;= (uint64_t)elementCount</code> since <code>elementCount</code> is initialized to 0.</p>
<p>We also need (2) to be true: value &gt; <code>elementCount</code>, and that’s seemingly possible. Of course, we don’t know how exactly to trigger it yet, but we do know that <code>value</code> is read in from an attacker controlled stream, and plausibly that it can have values higher than <code>elementCount</code> given that there is a check for it. However, it is still unclear what the memory corruption actually is.  Even if we read in some value from the stream that is greater than <code>elementCount</code>, we never can actually overwrite anything in <code>outBuf</code>, since <code>outBuf</code> is sized properly based on <code>elementCount</code>. Clearly the change was related to the sizing of <code>outBuf</code> though, so how do we make sense of this? At this point I had a few hypotheses:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was simply missing how <code>outBuf</code> could be overwritten, and therefore I should spend more time staring at this patch diff until the bug revealed itself to me.</li>
<li>At some point later in the code, the values from the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> are used to size another buffer or array of some kind that is assumed to be the same size as <code>*m_TotalComponents</code>* (used as <code>elementCount</code> in the patched version)<em>.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I spent a lot of time with (a)—staring and trying to think of ways to make it so just one extra value was read into the <code>m_RemappingArray</code>. Perhaps there was some weirdness with the bit width calculation, or some kind of integer overflow that led to a smaller buffer than expected. But I couldn’t make anything work.</p>
<p>After entirely too much time spent smashing my head into this wall I proceeded to hypotheses (b). I suppose I should have done this from the start: looking at them now, laid out like this it’s so obvious to me which is correct, but it wasn’t at the time.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p>I wanted to do some dynamic analysis. In order to do that I needed to understand how to reach the vulnerable code path. So I started reverse engineering.</p>
<p>In AudioCodecs there are parallel methods to deserialize for other classes: <code>apac::spch::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code>, for example, and the name of the binary literally has the words <em>Audio</em> and <em>Codec</em> in the name. That was enough to start googling. After searching something like “APAC Audio format,” I found a lot of results for <em>ALAC</em> (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) which seemed close. I also found this reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1fncalk/what_is_the_apac_audio_format_as_listed_in_the/">post</a> in r/AudioPhile that was asking what it was, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/kaudioformatapac?language=objc">this mention</a> in Apple’s developer documentation for Core Audio Types. After following that one redditor’s guess I found this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-by/guide/immersive-video-utility/dev4579429f0/web">page</a> which confirms that APAC stands for <em>Apple Positional Audio Codec</em>.</p>
<p>With much less effort, I was able to find out that HOA plausibly stood for Higher Order Ambisonics: a method of representing sound as a spatial sound-field centered  around the listeners head. Something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Spatial Audio Example" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/ambisonics.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="https://tricktheear.eu/spatial-web-audio/">https://tricktheear.eu/spatial-web-audio/</a></p>
<p>This helped a tiny bit in understanding the logic here—enough that I went to try and make an audio file that could hit the patched function. After some playing around and downloading a lot of sketchy audio files from the internet, I was able to hit the function through <code>[audioPlayer prepareToPlay]</code>. However, it was still unclear how exactly to reach the exact snippet that had changed.
Luckily at this point I wasn’t the only person working on this, and by searching for some related keywords I stumbled on this Git repo: <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/apple-positional-audio-codec-invalid-header">https://github.com/zhuowei/apple-positional-audio-codec-invalid-header</a> from Zhouwei. He hadn’t figured it out yet as it said in the README at the time, but he had done some excellent reverse engineering. He put together an objective C++ script and lldb hook that created a .mp4 which hit the vulnerable snippet in the old version and the new check in the patched version. As you can see in his code:</p>

This is interesting then. Thinking back to the control flow that we want to force in order to test hypothesis (b), we want the parsing logic to read in a value from the stream that is <em>greater</em> than the number of total components. If we dump <code>m_TotalComponents</code> at runtime (offset 0x58 from the base of <code>CodecConfig</code>) we see that with our current encoder it is 1. Therefore, as long as a value is supplied that is greater than 1, then the loop should exit. In the unpatched version it will continue and in the patched version it will hit the new check. I guessed at this point that the values being read in from the stream here would be the 0xFF bytes we forced in the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> from earlier. Stepping through in lldb it turned out that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>We were reading in 0xffff entries, but they weren’t 0xff each time. This was curious to me. They were &gt; 1 though! So shouldn’t this cause memory cooruption? Even turning on ASan and letting the harness run I didn’t see anything. In both cases (patched and unpatched) it just exits with code 0. Though if you run them in lldb then you can see those error messages from the parser. They were definitely different.</p>

It did contain exactly 0xffff entries, but no more. This is where I got stuck for a bit. A few things were possible at this stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>This could already be an arbitrary write that ASan wasn’t picking up. There are a number of ways that ASan wouldn’t pickup a small overwrite.</li>
<li>It could be the case that this is close, but some other unknown setup is missing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I wouldn’t even be sure where to go about chasing (1), I went for (2).  I thought that a good place to start was taking a look at the error messages from above. Might it be the case that the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> just isn’t being deserialized? By looking for references to “Profile and level data could not be validated” in Binary Ninja, I found that phrase in <code>apac::hoa::GlobalConfig::Deserialize</code>. This is the dispatch site (the callee) of the virtual <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code> method. Error site here:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 6.56.03\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/finalError.png"></p>
<p>Before I reverse engineered this monster function, I thought it made sense to actually try and do a <em>little</em> bit to understand what that error could mean in more contextual, audio terms. I found <a href="https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=208361#p1081741">this answer</a> in the Blackmagic Forum website in response to a question about how to mix ambisonics audio when searching for keywords like “ambisonics profile”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems like the process uses an ambisonic microphone that you place in the center of a custom speaker space and run a test pattern sound through all of the speakers one-by-one to record a “profile” of the location of the speakers. The profile data is then fed into the decoder to let it know where the speakers are in space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this does fit in with our understanding, but it is a fairly general notion. That is, it describes the entire ambisonics <em>profile</em> rather than just one element of it. However, it doesn’t help us much in understanding why our deserialization failed.</p>
<p>After some more fruitless searching I bit the bullet and started to reverse engineer the <code>GlobalConfig</code> method. First of all, we know that we at least make it to the point where there is a call to <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code>. From the backtrace we know that that is at <code>apac::GlobalConfig::Deserialize + 1644</code>. lldb shows a <code>blraa  x8, x17</code> instruction there so we know that this is a virtual method.  If we just follow the control flow up a little bit we see:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 7.25.51\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/virtCalls.png"></p>
<p>If you’re wondering about the variable names and symbols here, this was cleaned up by me. I followed along this extremely useful <a href="https://www.seandeaton.com/gotta-re-em-all-reversing-c-virtual-function-tables-with-binary-ninja/">blog post</a> explaining how to reverse engineer complex C++ types in Binary Ninja.  I learned how to tell it about the vtable call to Deserialize at 0x57acc, for example.</p>
<p>Back to the control flow, there is some type flag read in from the stream (what I named <code>codecConfigTypeFromStream</code>) that tells <code>GlobalConfig</code> which constructor to call. Then the instantiated <code>CodecConfig</code> object calls Deserialize. This pattern continues for all the different <code>CodecConfig</code> classes. The vast majority of the code in this function lives under this <code>label_57acc</code>. The way Binary Ninja reconstructed the code here, it essentially showed that if none of these ifs are true, then control flow reaches the “profile and level data” error from above.</p>
<p>There are a number of possible errors <em>inside</em> the block after the label. If any of those error messages are hit then control flow jumps to the “profile and level data” error block only after first failing with a different more specific error.</p>
<p>Searching for the other error: “ERROR: Wrong profile index in GlobalConfig” I found this check:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 7.38.10\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/inferProfileCallSite.png"></p>
<p><code>GlobalConfig</code> grabs a reference to the supported profiles: <code>var_b0</code>, as well as some field of <code>GlobalConfig</code>at offset 0x130 and calls <code>apac::ProfileLevelConfig::InferProfileFromCodecConfigs</code>. If that crazy-looking conditional evaluates to true, then the error is logged. The conditional uses the return value of <code>apac::ProfileLevelConfig::InferProfileFromCodecConfigs</code>, <code>x0_43</code>. So I took a look at the function. Binary Ninja interpretted the signature to be:</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-error">Understanding the Error</h2>
<p>The function itself is quite short and has a lot of symbols still in it, so I took a crack at reverse engineering it. The first major clue was the outer loop structure:</p>

This suggested an array of three structures, each 40 bytes long. Combined with the function name <code>InferProfileFromCodecConfigs</code>, I guessed that this pointed to three different ‘audio profile configurations.’ The fact that this step size is used to index into multiple global arrays (<code>&amp;apac::kProfileConfigs + i</code>, <code>i + &amp;data_8ec838</code>, etc.) confirmed these are parallel arrays because they were indexed by the same offset.</p>
<p>The very first lines inside the loop revealed the <code>ConstParamArray</code> layout:</p>

<p>So the check is: “current_profile &gt; inferred_profile”. This suggests the function is trying to find a profile that’s <strong>at least as capable</strong> as what’s currently configured. If it can only find a “lower” profile, that’s an error condition.</p>
<p>With this understanding of the error conditions, I initially suspected the issue was simply an <strong>empty codec configurations vector</strong>. The logic seemed straightforward: if no codecs are configured, the function should default to the basic profile. But when I stepped through the actual execution in lldb and got to to the point where the function checks the size of the vector, I found that it actually contained one 8-byte entry:</p>

<p>Stepping through the profile matching logic, I found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile 31 <strong>does support</strong> HOA codec ID 2</li>
<li>The level validation <strong>passed</strong> (level 6 requirements met)</li>
<li>But validation <strong>failed</strong> during a later check</li>

<p>This worked!</p>

<p>When I ran the harness in lldb all I saw was: <code>Process * exited with status = 0 (0x00000000)</code>. At least according to the deserializer, we managed to create a valid APAC magic cookie. However, still no crash, nor any message from ASan. The most interesting thing to me was that this new audio file showed the exact same error message on the new version as before (it was still hitting the new check!), and showed nothing on the unpatched version.</p>
<p>When I saw this I really didn’t know where to look. I thought that the process of looking at the diff between the two versions would be enough. Here it is again as I was looking at it at this point, cleaned up:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 7.52.36\u202fPM.png" src="https://blog.noahhw.dev/posts/cve-2025-31200/images/finalDiff.png"></p>
<p>This was essentially <em>all</em> that had changed. I took a break for a while here, and worked on another project that had spawned out of this one (a way to do runtime patching which actually works for these system libraries on MacOS since I couldn’t get TinyINST or even Frida to work). Chasing down this AudioCodecs bug seemed out of reach. I mean there are so many possible places that the code could go in the enormous MacOS audio processing pipeline. Without a clear diff between two binaries with the issue, as I had had until this point, where would I even look?</p>
<p>As I worked on my other project, I kept thinking about this. Eventually I decided to take some time to try and come at it from a slightly different angle. Maybe it would help to understand a bit about what’s actually being done by the code at the level of audio processing more than just control flow/code itself.</p>
<p>I looked for references to <code>m_TotalComponents</code> in <code>apac::hoa::CodecConfig::Deserialize</code>. It is calculated in the following kind of snippet (much like everything else in this method):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong> are spatial/directional elements (salient vs. ambient/scalar)
<ul>
<li>Think the difference between highlighted important noise coming at you from some particular direction, and just embient noise in the background.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subbands</strong> are frequency divisions</li>
<li><strong>Salient Components</strong> (<code>m_maxNumSalientComponents</code>): The most important spatial features, encoded with high precision</li>
<li><strong>Scalar/Direct Components</strong> (<code>numScalarCodedComponents</code>): Less important components using simpler scalar coding</li>
<li><strong>Ambient data</strong>, which is sized per-subband as you always need background spatial info for each frequency band</li>
</ul>
<p>My understanding is that there are essentially three types of components, and two of them, <code>m_maxNumSalientComponents</code> and <code>numScalarCodedComponents</code>, add together to be <code>m_TotalComponents</code>. Thinking back to the fix being essentially:</p>

I was trying to understand what that relationship could even be. According to <a href="https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/resources/faqs/what-is-an-audio-channel?token=iHleyIFjO6AyNj0dwv2pyKSq5_BGTm76">wildlifeacoustics.com</a>, “a channel is a representation of sound coming from or going to a single point. A single microphone can produce one channel of audio, and a single speaker can accept one channel of audio, for example.” Presumably then, the <code>m_RemappingArray</code> is a way of mapping the spatial components of HOA to a given channel based layout. Therefore, there must be some later stage in the audio processing pipeline that actually “remaps” the spatial components to the channel layout. If there is some mismatch between the two, perhaps it <em>tries</em> to remap one based on the other, and ends up reaching out of bounds since they are different sizes?</p>
<p>It turns out that is precisely the exploit primitive.</p>
<h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2>
<p>I should have realized this earlier, but if we actually <em>play</em> the audio in addition to just <em>preparing to play</em> as our harness did, then that is very plausibly when the remapping occurs. I hadn’t tried this before because the vulnerable code section, as found through diffing, is perfectly reachable without ever actually playing the audio. You can just call <code>[AVAudioPlayer prepareToPlay]</code>. However, if we add in that single line of code to our harness, then with the exact audio file we have at this stage then we segfault inside a call to <code>memmove</code>!</p>

<p>Just to be clear, here is how I was setting up the audio file at this point:</p>

There are only certain profiles that are supported, as discussed above, so the number of channels in the channel layout tag has to be one of the supported profiles.</p>
<p>The crash occured most often as a null pointer dereference in <code>apac::HOADecoder::DecodeAPACFrame</code>. <code>x26</code> here hasn’t yet been initialized:</p>





<p>so we crash with EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x19). If we enable Guard Malloc in Xcode then we can see the first invalid read occurs in <code>APAC::ChannelRemapper::Process</code>.</p>

<p>If we look at the assembly where the invalid read occurs its clear that it is trying to read some value from an array, and x8 + x11«3 points out of bounds. This of course, all makes perfect sense. The method is called <code>APACChannelRemapper::Process</code>. This must be where the channel remapping actually occurs. The instruction directly above the one that Guard Malloc catches, also tells us a lot about what is going on:</p>

<p>Essentially, if you have a vector, say [A,B,C] that you actually want to be [B,A,C], then you might do that with a ‘permutation map’: another vector that says where each element should go. In this case that would be [1,0,2], which means that the element at index 1 should go to index 0, and the element at index 0 should go to index 1 and the element at index 2 should stay where it is.  The simplest working way to do this is to just allocate another vector, and essentially use the permutation map as a kind of dictionary (index→element) for populating that third vector. However, if you would rather be clever and don’t feel like allocating a whole other vector, then you can use the algorithm above.</p>
<p>For us this means that the input remapping is a map that we can use to read and write out of bounds. Notice that both <code>remapVec</code> and the input <code>floatVec</code> are assumed to be ‘well-behaved’ in their own way? If, for example, the <code>remapVec</code> looked like this [1,2,3], then the inner while loop would happily read in memory from out of bounds. Given that this function is executed under the condition that we created earlier where the <code>remapVec</code> is larger than the actual <code>floatVec</code>, then there can be elements in <code>remapVec</code> that are larger than the size of <code>floatVec</code>, each of which will cause a ‘swap’ with some memory from out bounds. This is the illegal read we saw earlier under Guard Malloc. Similarly though, for every read that gets written into the remapping array during this function, there is an equivalent write. This is the primitive.</p>
<p>As it stands though, the float pointers being swapped from out of bounds are being swapped almost always with zeros (though it depends on the specific heap layout), and then quickly dereferenced, hence the segfault. If we want it not to segfault then we need to understand a few things in more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>m_RemappingArray</code> and how to control it</li>
<li>The heap layout around the float vector</li>
<li>The control flow following the <code>APACChannelRemapper::Process</code> method</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to turn this into a real arbitrary write, we would, I think, need to understand much more deeply where in the actual audio processing pipeline this method happens. <em>This would be a great investigation if somebody wants to look into it</em>. I have found that the float vectors are clearly related to the audio data per frame. It seems that the heap layout is affected by the number of channels we pick (since of course this changes the size of the remapping array), and I have found that if I pick a number for the number of channels that is only slightly smaller than the number given in the layout tag:</p>

In this case, it only crashes much later (if at all) due to actual heap corruption.</p>
<p>If we fill the frame buffers with different data, then the address reported in the segfault changes in proportion to the values we pick, so there is some control over the write doing this. It’s still unclear to me at this point what exact stage of the processing pipeline the frame data is in. If we knew, then perhaps we could write an arbitrary value into a (seemingly) arbitary location in memory.</p>
<p>Although, it is possible that the primitive here is fundamentally tied to how these floats are being manipulated at this point. For example, this code might be applying some series of audio processing related functions to our input values that make it so they are always basically always going to be unwieldy to work with. Imagine if the primitive is that you can write n 8 byte sequences out of bounds, but they must be valid 32 bit floats in the range x-y, that had to return valid sequences when passed through however many audio processing functions. That would really constrain the space of what could be written out of bounds.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that this was actively exploited in the wild, and there have been exploits that did a lot more with a lot less. Still, I am curious to see how this is pushed to full code execution. At this point though, I have done what I set out to do: understand CVE-2025-31200, and I want to get this out so that other people can take a look as well.</p>
<p>Some folks have already reached out to me saying that they think they may have found how to push it further, so look out for anything from them. I may put out a part two to this with more details on how the exploit actually would have worked (for example the chain from this to the RPAC bug). Normally, it isn’t necessarily the actual exploit primitive that is the center of the story, but I think in this case it was a really interesting example of how tricky some of these bugs can be. Hopefully this investigation will be useful to others who want to do a similar kind of thing. I’m sure if you had a deep understand of Apples audio-processing pipeline (or probably computational audio in general) then it wouldn’t be too too difficult to find something like this, but the venn diagram of such people and people with enough knowledge to know how to look for these bugs is not particularly huge. That makes this attack surface quite a rich one!</p>

Daily active use remains comparatively low. You could read that as limited utility or slow dispersion, but we think a major contributor is unreliability. When a system can’t be trusted to work consistently, its real-world utility collapses. It’s no coincidence that the clearest value from LLMs so far has come from code generation, where outputs are not only useful, but highly verifiable. You can run the code, test it, compile it. It either works or it doesn’t. And the product it supports—software—is deterministic by design. </span></p><p>This piece explores:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The core challenge:</strong><span> LLMs are fundamentally unreliable, a characteristic we believe is unlikely to change soon.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Implications for builders:</strong><span> Success in building AI-powered products doesn’t come from waiting for perfect models, but rather from from building around their inherent variance.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Framework:</strong><span> We outline four distinct approaches builders can take to manage variance.

We won’t dive into the full complexity of the alignment discussion here—it’s a deep and important topic—but the basic idea is this: alignment is the discipline concerned with making sure that models behave, at a high level, the way we intend them to. It’s what tries to prevent scenarios where an LLM blackmails its developer to avoid being shut off, or gives users instructions on how to build bioweapons. It’s a critical area of research, and very much </span><a href="https://x.com/aengus_lynch1/status/1925746802147426450" rel="">not</a><span> a </span><a href="https://x.com/ARGleave/status/1926138376509440433" rel="">solved</a><span> one. Beyond just illustrating how fundamentally opaque these systems still are, unsolved alignment directly impacts the viability of agentic LLM use cases. But as noted, this is a topic worthy of its own deep dive, so we’ll leave it at that for now. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>Forecasting AI progress is notoriously difficult</strong><span>, especially in a domain evolving this quickly. That said, we have reason to believe that the core reliability dynamics of LLMs aren’t likely to change meaningfully in the short to medium term.</span></p><p>Here’s why:</p><ol><li><p><span>A key reason we believe these reliability issues will persist is the way LLM errors interact with task complexity. Our own observations (and interpretations of much of the available research and empirical findings), suggest that LLM failure modes compound with task length in ways that </span><a href="https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life#:~:text=increasing%20time%20periods%3A-,Intriguingly,-%2C%20this%20human%20survival" rel="">exceed</a><span> typical human error patterns. This tendency for AI errors to multiply and cascade will, we suspect, remain a fundamental barrier for truly reliable agentic systems for the foreseeable future. </span></p></li><li><p><span>The fact that no LLM use case has demonstrated true determinism in real-world applications is significant. It strongly supports the theoretical arguments discussed earlier, which posit that </span><strong>hallucinations are an unavoidable, and likely unsolvable</strong><span>, aspect of current LLM architectures. </span></p></li><li><p><span>A striking example of LLMs' operational opacity comes from Anthropic's research, illustrated by how a model might calculate 36+59=95. Internally, it uses a sophisticated, multi-path strategy, approximating the sum with one heuristic while precisely determining the final digit with another. Yet, if asked to explain its calculation, the LLM describes the standard 'carry the one' algorithm taught to humans. This suggests the model lacks the mechanism to introspect and articulate the actual computational path it took. This inability to reflect post hoc—even to itself—underscores the black-box nature of LLMs. While speculative, we suspect </span><strong>this missing self-awareness contributes to their unreliability</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png" width="1456" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>“Claude </span><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model" rel="">seems </a><span>to be unaware of the sophisticated "mental math" strategies that it learned during training.

The key concept here is allowing the system to 'run without babysitting', requiring additional capacity for when the system flags </span><strong>exceptions </strong><span>(usually means you need manpower) doesn't change this underlying dynamic. </span></p><p>This is the only category that enables fully autonomous usage, systems that can operate without human intervention. That makes it arguably the highest-margin path, with the clearest ROI story: either an existing process becomes faster, cheaper, and more scalable, or a new one becomes viable, and in both cases, the value is easy to measure. You can point to what the system does, what it improves, and what it costs.</p><h5>This can be pursued in several ways: </h5><p><span>The aim here is to engineer an LLM-based system that, for all practical purposes, achieves complete determinism, mirroring the reliability of traditional software. Realizing this requires a system capable of exhaustively testing its outputs against rigorous criteria and, critically, remediating nearly all conceivable LLM-generated issues. Companies like </span><a href="https://www.skyramp.dev/" rel="">Skyramp</a><span>, focusing on deterministic AI for test generation, are exploring aspects of this space.</span></p><p>In practice, attaining this level of comprehensive determinism is extraordinarily challenging. It necessitates absolute confidence in having identified and addressed all potential edge cases and failure modes, a feat few if any have achieved in practice. </p><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ul><li><p>This approach demands deep AI technical expertise. Getting an LLM-based system to behave deterministically is extremely hard, and being confident that it actually does requires a sophisticated understanding of how and where LLMs can fail. Unless the problem is already widely solved, teams must be able to both achieve high accuracy and rigorously validate it across edge cases. </p></li><li><p>Such a system likely requires a very sophisticated engineering layer, IP-worthy at that, this dynamic serves as a moat from both “models getting better" and competitors.</p><ul><li><p><span>This does mean that there are likely serious demands for quality engineering talent as well, and depending on specifics, specialized talent (who </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare" rel="">else</a><span> has experience in thinking about a system’s weak points?).</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your customer needs to trust you, really trust you that your tech does what it says it does, earning their trust may not be easy, but if you do, that is another source of competitive advantage.</p></li></ul><p>This path focuses on achieving a level of accuracy that is 'good enough' for a particular application where direct, instance-by-instance user verification is not part of the primary workflow, and occasional errors are within acceptable tolerance. </p><p>A critical requirement is achieving and validating a high degree of confidence that you have thoroughly accounted for all significant edge cases and the varied ways your LLM product can fail within the specific operational context.</p><h5>Examples: </h5><ul><li><p><span>An </span><strong>AI classifier</strong><span> designed for very large, unstructured datasets, used for broad-based trend analysis. Here, occasional misclassifications can be tolerated as they are unlikely to skew the overall insights significantly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Automated </span><strong>structured data extraction</strong><span> from documents (like invoices or forms), where the system achieves a </span><a href="https://rossum.ai/customer-stories/adyen/" rel="">high enough accuracy for</a><span> direct use in downstream processes, with the understanding that a very small residual error rate is acceptable.</span></p></li><li><p><span>AI-powered </span><strong>note-takers</strong><span> for meetings. In many common usage patterns, there's no explicit human check on the generated notes. The underlying logic is often that notes with minor errors or omissions still offer greater utility than the alternatives of laborious manual note-taking or having no record at all.</span></p></li></ul><h5>What defines this approach: </h5><ol><li><p><span>For this strategy, it's critical to </span><strong>deeply analyze the user's workflow</strong><span> and the actual consequences of different AI failure modes (e.g., overgeneralization vs. complete fabrication, missed information vs. incorrect information). This involves an in-depth mapping of how various errors will impact the user's objectives and risk exposure. </span><strong>Crucially, developers must recognize that users themselves can be poor judges of these risks or may be overly trusting</strong><span>, as evidenced by ongoing issues like professionals misusing LLMs in critical fields despite widely known failure patterns (e.g., </span><a href="https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/" rel="">at least 20 cases</a><span> of legal decisions where AI produced hallucinations just this month, despite hallucinations in law being a high-profile failure mode for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-ai-fake-cases.html" rel="">years</a><span>). The onus is on the product team to anticipate these issues, understand the true (not just stated) risk tolerance, and design accordingly, rather than solely relying on users to self-regulate their trust.</span></p></li><li><p><span>While perhaps less demanding than striving for proper determinism, it still requires </span><strong>strong enough AI skills to know what accuracy actually means in context</strong><span>, how to measure it, interpret it, and design around it. </span></p></li><li><p><span>For this strategy, the central aspect of product design is ensuring the product's </span><strong>core AI performance</strong><span> (its accuracy and reliability) is properly calibrated. While usability is always a factor, it's secondary here to achieving the target performance level. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Customers must </span><strong>trust the product's defined level of accuracy</strong><span>. This requires demonstrating consistent performance within those bounds, which can then become a key differentiator and competitive moat. </span></p></li></ol><p>Unlike approaches that strive to engineer out all AI variance, the second broad strategy for LLM product development accepts a degree of inherent model variability and focuses on managing its impact by integrating human verification into the process. </p><p><span>This common approach involves creating products where the </span><strong>end-user directly reviews, validates, and potentially corrects the AI's output as part of their workflow</strong><span>. To succeed, the value proposition must clearly justify the user's verification effort; the AI's assistance, even if imperfect, must be preferable to alternatives. </span></p><ul><li><p>Examples</p><ul><li><p><strong>Search &amp; discovery tools</strong><span> (e.g., web search, shopping search): Users often don't need every possible correct answer and can tolerate some irrelevant results if the tool quickly surfaces useful or intriguing information.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Information triage</strong><span> (e.g., "important document" finders in email): An AI might flag potentially missed invoices or critical communications. The user quickly verifies if the flagged items are indeed relevant, a task easier than manually sifting through everything.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful general-purpose chatbots</strong><span>: LLMs via the chat interface are so broadly capable that users find ways to derive utility despite needing to critically evaluate responses and manage occasional errors.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>"Copilot" paradigms</strong><span> (e.g., coding assistants like Cursor, legal tools like Harvey, etc.): The AI generates drafts or suggestions (code, legal clauses, analyses), and the expert user, who is "in the loop" at the right time, can quickly identify and correct issues.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Creative “content generation”</strong><span>: These are the canonical examples. Users can easily assess if the output’s style and basic coherence are suitable.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Workflow augmentation:</strong><span> These products almost always enhance a specific user persona’s workflow rather than fully automating a standalone function (there’s also a small class of “alerting” use cases, but we assess that category to be relatively limited). This stems directly from the need for human verification: when humans are in the loop, they’re usually using the AI to do their job better, not babysitting it. In other words, the AI augments the human, not the other way around. While you can design a system where a human simply verifies AI outputs, that pattern rarely proves compelling in practice. The output has to be so valuable that it justifies paying someone to check it, and most applications don’t clear that bar. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Ceiling more than floor</strong><span>: Since this approach often involves users adopting new ways of working, the "ceiling" of value, the significant benefit derived from the AI's best or most insightful contributions, must be exceptionally high. This potential for substantial gains (e.g., speed, unique insights, quality improvements) is instrumental in justifying a change in work pattern and earn the user's verification effort. The focus is less on average AI accuracy ("floor") and more on the transformative potential of the AI's peak contributions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Usability is central</strong><span>: Since user interaction and verification are integral, nailing the UI/UX for verification, correction, and seamless integration into the user's existing or new workflow is vital. Quality of user experience is then the primary differentiator and source of competitive advantage.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Designed for verifiability</strong><span>: A central characteristic is the design of AI outputs that are easily and reliably verifiable by the intended skilled end-user. This involves careful consideration of information presentation, the nature of the AI’s output, and ensuring the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.08063v1#:~:text=3.1.,Task%20Performance" rel="">right </a><span>user is targeted (e.g., AI accounting tools for accountants who can vet the suggestions).</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This distinct model places the responsibility for </span><strong>verification and</strong><span> </span><strong>ensuring the quality of the final output squarely on the product or service provider</strong><span>. This involves the provider's own internal human review processes, often working in concert with AI and specialized software to deliver a "done-for-you," result. From the customer's perspective, the AI's imperfections are handled "behind the curtain."</span></p><p>The end-user perceives this as an "AI-powered service". Usually, this involves the provider taking over a specific, often narrow, function previously handled by the client, fulfilling it in a third-party services style. The client receives a completed task or a digestible deliverable, effectively outsourcing the complexity of managing the AI and its potential variance.</p><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ol><li><p><strong>Specialized, narrow-scope offerings with optimized playbooks</strong><span>: Real value and defensibility are typically unlocked when a provider identifies a narrow scope—a specific, well-defined problem or function that can be demonstrably and massively improved with AI. This focus is critical because:</span></p><ol><li><p>Identifying such improvable functions and developing effective playbooks is a key capability in itself; achieving this across broader, more general functions is significantly more challenging.</p></li><li><p><span>As empirical findings to date </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/making-ai-work-leadership-lab-and" rel="">suggest,</a><span> simply layering AI onto existing broad processes (as some "</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/khosla-ventures-among-vcs-experimenting-with-ai-infused-roll-ups-of-mature-companies/" rel="">rollup</a><span>" strategies might attempt) often falls short of delivering significant productivity gains. True transformation typically requires a fundamental redesign of how work is done, which is most feasible within a narrow, provider-controlled scope.</span></p></li><li><p>Investing in a dedicated software layer around the LLM for a provider-managed workflow (e.g., specialized internal UIs, tailored integrations, automation scripts) typically yields a high return on investment. However, this level of impactful, specialized engineering is generally only feasible when the operational scope is narrowly defined; it becomes impractical or offers diminishing returns for overly broad, general-purpose applications.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>AI integration &amp; workforce management</strong><span>: The provider's operational ability to effectively integrate AI tools with their skilled human workforce to genuinely maximize productivity and quality is essential.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The pivotal role of domain expertise</strong><span>: This expertise is necessary for designing effective AI-augmented workflows, facilitating effective quality control, and ensuring the final output meets exacting client standards.

		📰 Penny‑1.7B · Irish Penny Journal Style (GRPO)
	</span>
</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>style transfer</strong> from the Irish Penny Journal (1840) to Smollm2 using GRPO. For example, this response to "What is the capital of France"</p>
<pre><code>Verily, in the grand tapestry of European monarchies, the city of Paris, the seat of the mighty Emperor Napoleon, holds a place of singular distinction. This city, which hath borne the name of 'La Ville Lumière' for nigh on two centuries, doth shine forth as a beacon of art, culture, and intellect, its very existence a testament to the ingenuity and brilliance of its people. And so, it is with great honour and reverence that we declare Paris, the majestic capital of the French realm, to be our noble question's answer.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Penny‑1.7B</strong> is a 1.7 billion‑parameter causal language model fine‑tuned with <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong> to emulate the 19ᵗʰ‑century prose of the <em>Irish Penny Journal</em> (1840). The RL stage ran for <strong>6,800 policy steps</strong>, using a reward model trained to classify sentences as <em>original IPJ</em> vs <em>modern translation</em>. Maximizing this score nudges generations toward authentic Victorian‑era diction while retaining the general reasoning ability of the base SmolLM2 model.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>People born more recently are less likely to have dementia at any given age than earlier generations, research suggests, with the trend more pronounced in women.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, in 2021 there were 57 million people worldwide living with dementia, with women disproportionately affected. However, while the risk of dementia increases with age, experts have long stressed it is not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link">not an inevitability of getting older</a>.</p><p>“Younger generations are less likely to develop dementia at the same age as their parents or grandparents, and that’s a hopeful sign,” said Dr Sabrina Lenzen, a co-author of the study from the University of Queensland’s Centre for the Business and Economics of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Health</a>.</p><p>But she added: “The overall burden of dementia will still grow as populations age, and significant inequalities remain – especially by gender, education and geography.”</p><p>Writing in the journal <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.13384?guestAccessKey=bacb167c-2948-4d8a-a4b4-4f6200aa35d6&amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=060225" data-link-name="in body link">Jama Network Open</a>, researchers in Australia report how they analysed data from 62,437 people aged 70 and over, collected from three long-running surveys covering the US, England and parts of Europe.</p><p>The team used an algorithm that took into account participants’ responses to a host of different metrics, from the difficulties they had with everyday activities to their scores on cognitive tests, to determine whether they were likely to have dementia.</p><p>They then split the participants into eight different cohorts, representing different generations. Participants were also split into six age groups.</p><p>As expected, the researchers found the prevalence of dementia increased by age among all birth cohorts, and in each of the three regions: UK, US and Europe. However, at a given age, people in more recent generations were less likely to have dementia compared with those in earlier generations.</p><p>“For example, in the US, among people aged 81 to 85, 25.1% of those born between 1890–1913 had dementia, compared to 15.5% of those born between 1939–1943,” said Lenzen, adding similar trends were seen in Europe and England, although less pronounced in the latter.</p><p>The team said the trend was more pronounced in women, especially in Europe and England, noting that one reason may be increased access to education for women in the mid-20th century.</p><p>However, taking into account changes in GDP, a metric that reflects broader economic shifts, did not substantially alter the findings.</p><p>Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, described the study as well-conducted. “The number of people living with dementia is still increasing due to our ageing population, but this study adds to the good news that more recent generations have a decreased risk compared to past generations,” she said.</p><p>While the study did not investigate the reasons for the decline, Spires-Jones noted a number of factors could be at play. “This is likely due to interventions such as compulsory education, smoking bans, and improvements in medical treatments for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hearing loss, which are associated with dementia risk,” she said.</p><p>Spires-Jones added the study had limitations, including that it did not rely on official diagnoses of dementia based on clinical testing.</p><p>Prof Tom Dening, of the University of Nottingham, said the study contained good news but it should not be assumed that the trend would continue, given some of the biggest health changes to reduce dementia risk may already have been made.</p><p>Prof Eric Brunner, of University College London, said it was important to look closely at recent trends and the impact of policies such as austerity, given other studies – <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00214-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link">including his own work</a> relating to England and Wales – have suggested dementia incidence, in other words the rate of new cases, may no longer be declining.</p><p>David Thomas, the head of policy and public affairs at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said evidence suggested nearly half of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 key risk factors – from smoking to air quality – although he noted not all were within individuals’ control.</p><p>“That’s why Alzheimer’s Research UK is calling on the government to put in place a strategy for preventing ill-health, including addressing dementia risk,” he said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Why I Built This</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is not just code — it's a response. Amid political pressure, some universities like Harvard, MIT, and CMU stood up for international students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’m just an ordinary undergraduate with no resources or background. This is my way of responding — not by petition, but through code. Vanta may be small, but it’s real, and it’s mine.</p>

<p dir="auto">Thanks to Professors and Schools</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you for standing up for students.</p>

We're hiring for multiple roles and are primarily interested in people with early-stage company experience, who are comfortable in high-agency, fast-paced teams.</p><p>Reasons you might want to join Elicit:</p><p>1.

We've found a level of product market fit (as evidenced by metrics) but we've not proven everything out yet. If you want predictability, Elicit is not for you.</p><p>2. We aim to hire people who thrive in low-bureaucracy environments, and let them loose.

We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

Hi, I'm Harry Altman! I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger (<a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/debugger">https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package...</a>), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things.</p><p>I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.)</p><p>I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys).</p><p>I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire!</p></div></td></tr>

  One-Liner: Automation Expert &amp; Can Ship Fast

</code></pre><p>
I've built applications in just about every language you can think of. In 2021 I built an algorithmic market making company in the NFT space. I scaled that to &gt; $50M GMV in the first year. We traded tens of thousands of NFT's using the algorithms and systems I built.  During that time I hosted services on just about every cloud provider, used a network of residential proxies, was constantly fighting evolving anti-scraping/botting tech, and built front end browser automations to place bids/buys on NFT marketplaces. Most recently I built a series of automations for a company that imports gourmet food from Europe into the US. This involved OCR of documents, using AI to automate various manual stages, and creating visibility dashboards for goods across the entire pipeline. Previously built 70+ mobile apps as well as worked with startups and larger orgs on frontier tech products.</p></div></td></tr>

hi! I'm David, a software/devops engineer with a passion for grit and going from 0 to 1. I've been building software and infrastructure for over 10 years, and most recently have built enterprise B2B SaaS products for organizations in the cybersecurity space.</p><p>I run a consulting company (atomweight.io), and have provided infosec, devops, and software engineering services to a variety of clients. I am open to both full-time and contract engagements.</p><p>I don't particularly enjoy coasting or clocking out at 5pm (mostly since I'm a night owl), so I'm looking for opportunities where I can move fast, build, ship fast, contribute the most value, and grow. If my skills and experience seem like a good fit for your needs, please reach out!</p></div></td></tr>

Hi HN! I'm Eric, a senior software engineer who has worked in the intersection of the databases and compilers spaces.
I have nearly 10 years experience at Microsoft as a developer on a partially-lazy functional query language.
Before that, I concentrated heavily on compilers, programming language theory, and formal logic in college
(with some OS kernel and computer algebra stuff on top), and I remain passionate about them. In the years since I've gained knowledge of modern OLAP database internals.
Recently I've worked on Parquet integration and optimization in this query language and Microsoft more broadly.</p><p>On the side I experiment with programming language design, especially with applying math-inspired ideas to low-level programming.
I'm looking for a fully-remote position. If any of this sounds interesting, please reach out.</p></div></td></tr>

I'm a DevOps/Platform/Infra/Backend generalist with ~13.5 years of experience and a bachelor's in CS and about a decade of farting around prior to that. I'm finishing up migrating and modernizing a major product for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I'm looking to exit the civic tech space.</p><p>I'm interested in machine learning and AI, ideally HPC and/or scientific/research computing. My idea has been to move into MLOps, then move from there into HPC, and my longterm goal (5-10 years) is to move into deep tech research (possibly get my PhD).</p><p>But I have broad interests and my feelings about AI are complicated. I don't think I'm searching for a destination, but searching for a journey and companions. I don't know much more than that, except that it probably doesn't involve me doing frontend.</p><p>My current fun-time project is writing an LLM agent to personify my Raspberry Pi research cluster, and write tools, MCP plugins, etc to embody that simulated consciousness within the infrastructure. It feels weirdly like stapling a ghost to a circuit board.</p><pre><code>    Q. Where do you see yourself in five years?

In a way, I am a "full stack" developer, but my stack may involve a front end to a piece of hardware rather than the cloud. I first got into programming via ham radio, so RF hardware remains an interest.</p><p>• Designing and building APIs. Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build.</p><p>• Talk with users! I don't like to sit in a back room cranking out code.

Customer-Facing Engineer / DevRel / Support Leader — Built multiple 0→1 functions at early YC startups.</p><p>I'm a customer-facing technical leader with 10+ years in tech and a track record of building customer experience functions from scratch. Most recently, I was the first customer-facing hire at Pythagora (YC W24), a startup building an AI software engineer. I owned everything outside of engineering: support, developer relations / developer advocate, docs, YouTube demos, influencer outreach, blog posts, and building + open-sourcing demo apps.</p><p>Before that, I was the first remote hire at Streak (YC S11) and spent several years owning customer onboarding, support, and automation. I also learned to code on the side, eventually completing the Capstone program at Launch School.</p><p>I’m especially strong in early-stage chaos, where startups need someone who can do a bit of everything, talk to users, squash bugs, clean up docs, spin up demo apps, handle a support queue, write content, and generally make the founders’ lives easier.</p><p>I’m looking for a startup where I can either be the first customer engineer or support leader, or join a small team as a DevRel/Community Engineer and help ship content + build trust with technical users.</p><p>What I’m best at:</p><p>* Translating user feedback into roadmap clarity</p><p>* Turning vague “customer needs” into structured, scalable systems</p><p>* Writing fast, clear docs + building content users actually read</p><p>* Jumping into startup Discords and building real community</p><p>* Owning support and success systems without needing hand-holding</p></div></td></tr>

(This is my first time posting in one of these threads. I precommit to posting in more of them.)</p><p>Hey, I'm Andrew! It's nice to meet you. You might already know me through</p><p>* my various software projects to help people learn Finnish @ <a href="https://finbug.xyz/" rel="nofollow">https://finbug.xyz/</a> ,</p><p>* my somewhat popular Ubuntu dev machine bootstrapping scripts @ <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/shell-bling-ubuntu">https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/shell-bling-ubuntu</a> , or</p><p>* my old, tiny SSG tutorial, "Minimum Viable Hugo" @ <a href="https://github.com/Siilikuin/minimum-viable-hugo">https://github.com/Siilikuin/minimum-viable-hugo</a> .</p><p>I also wrote <a href="https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf" rel="nofollow">https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf</a> which got over 1000 points here on Hacker News, and which many people use as their first tutorial to `fzf` to this day. My posts occasionally do quite well here.</p><p>I am seeking part time IC roles in software engineering, stuff I can do on the weekends with a 5- to 15-hour weekly commitment. Traditional compensation is of less interest to me than gaining experience and working on interesting stuff with interesting people.</p><p>I have been programming since 2009, starting with Python. The first non-trivial program I ever wrote with it was a polynomial division calculator to check my math homework, if you want an idea of the kind of person I am.Recently I've taken a liking to Go, Perl, PHP, Tiny Core Linux and other fully RAM-based solutions, good old POSIX shell, and SQLite.</p><p>If you think you have something that might interest me, send me an email! I always love hearing new ideas.</p></div></td></tr>

I’ve built entire systems from the ground up, delivered physical products in a matter of weeks, and kept Oil Rigs working offshore, built departments filled with the best people to produce top results and make the wonderful dreams reality.</p><p>With a background in Electro Mechanical Engineering, I’ve designed products for the consumer, offshore, military markets, so I know what good hardware looks like. I’ve built prototypes for many markets, and architected complex systems from concept to retirement, in a complete cradle to grave manner. I’ve worked closely with software teams to guide development of new features to protect marine vessels from GPS jamming, developed APIs for integration and dug through code by hand to reverse engineer old products that haven’t been touched in decades to determine their operation and how they will be supported and upgraded to turn them into the feature they should be.</p><p>As an Engineering Manager, I’ve been the driving force behind teams. I build teams based on two key ideas - is the team one full of individuals that are valued for their expertise, and is the culture one that I would like to be a part of? I make it a matter of pride that everyone should feel like an integral part of the team, and that mentality comes from the top down. I’ve worked with remotely distributed teams across many different disciplines, all working towards the end goal without ego getting in the way. My job has always been simple as the EM, give the team the tools and trust they need to do their absolute best.</p><p>Your idea is your baby, it’s precious to you. I’ve worked at startups, small companies and mega corporations and I’ve always maintained a very simple philosophy when it comes to work - “are we doing what the customer needs with the best people we can get?”</p><p>I’m your mechanical engineer, engineering manager, product manager, systems engineer, R&amp;D specialist, market analyst and head of technology in one, and I’m ready to make your dream the product it needs to be, hardware or software.</p></div></td></tr>

Maybe something like zephyr project.</p><p>If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper.</p><p>As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank.</p><p>Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are.</p><p>And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Microcontrollers and PLC are historically different fields that have some overlap as the fields converge somewhat. PLC come from relay logic and so learning Ladder Logic and playing with a cheaper Automation Direct PLC might be good if you're looking to do control systems like industrial machines and those robotics. RPi series micros are good to learn embedded electronics, servo controls and Realtime OS. Computer Engineering and Control System Engineering are treated differently even in the California State Engineering License Exams, so they tend to be different paths but the skills have some overlap. My degree was in computer engineering and didn't cover any PLC, but I contract and PLC comes up a lot in one-off things that need to be reliable.</p>

So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours.</p><p>I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons.</p></div></td></tr>

I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch.</p><p>This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot.

You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more "formal" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist.</p><p>My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT!</p><p>For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for &lt;$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive.</p><p>For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all.</p><p>For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running.</p><p>As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach.</p></div></td></tr>

 - Robotic hardware (motors, sensors, microcontrollers, etc)
 - Software</p><p>The electronics learning is always going to apply to start there if you need to, then depending on your goals the hardware and software will vary.</p><p>For simple DIY projects I'd start with getting an Arduino or Arduino compatible board and just play around with building things with sensors, LEDs, motors, etc. You'll find lots of kits and resources online for simple Arduino projects.</p><p>More complex projects are probably going to need to be Linux-based (AI, machine vision, etc). In which case you might want to look at building something with a mini PC, Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson.</p><p>These days robotics is super accessible, but can cost a bit depending on what you want to do... That said, most of the time you'll find there are cheap ways to build POCs to validate your ideas first.</p></div></td></tr>
