Had somebody successfully introduced a widely deployed backdoor, it would have been bad later.</p><p id="f2d8">The backdoor uses a five stage loader to try to hide and includes a function where future updates can be placed in extra files without modifying the original XZ code changes.</p><p id="16d1">These changes were committed to Github back in February, and made their way into test releases of Debian, Fedora and Kali Linux. Nobody noticed the problem. Additionally, a request was opened to make the threat actor a Linux kernel module maintainer for XZ Embedded.</p></div><div><h2 id="6991">Q&amp;A</h2><p id="06e7"><strong>Do I need to panic? </strong>No. As an assurance piece, orgs can check they aren’t using the latest unstable releases of Debian and Fedora — but they very likely aren’t.</p><p id="0020">Andres caught the problem — which has allowed it to be evicted from the Linux distribution ecosystem before any stable releases.. released.</p><p id="dc2b">How did Andres find the problem? Well, let us go to Andres:</p><blockquote><p id="118f">“I was doing some micro-benchmarking at the time, needed to quiesce the system to reduce noise. Saw sshd processes were using a surprising amount of CPU, despite immediately failing because of wrong usernames etc. Profiled sshd, showing lots of cpu time in liblzma, with perf unable to attribute it to a symbol. Got suspicious. Recalled that I had seen an odd valgrind complaint in automated testing of postgres, a few weeks earlier, after package updates.</p><p id="3d72">Really required a lot of coincidences.</p><p id="70c0">One more aspect that I think emphasizes the number of coincidences that had to come together to find this:</p><p id="61a5">I run a number “buildfarm” instances for automatic testing of postgres. Among them with valgrind. For some other test instance I had used -fno-omit-frame-pointer for some reason I do not remember. A year or so ago I moved all the test instances to a common base configuration, instead of duplicate configurations. I chose to make all of them use -fno-omit-frame-pointer.</p><p id="edd9">Afaict valgrind would not have complained about the payload without -fno-omit-frame-pointer. It was because _get_cpuid() expected the stack frame to look a certain way.</p><p id="5750">Additionally, I chose to use debian unstable to find possible portability problems earlier. Without that valgrind would have had nothing to complain.</p><p id="7ad7">Without having seen the odd complaints in valgrind, I don’t think I would have looked deeply enough when seeing the high cpu in sshd below _get_cpuid().”</p></blockquote><p id="858a">A couple of points here. First of all, the world owes Andres unlimited free beer. He just saved everybody’s arse in his spare time. I am not joking.</p><p id="5599">Nobody else had raised concerns, and I don’t believe any existing security tooling or processes would have caught this (I realise there will be a torrent of vendors claiming they detect this… but they will detect this <em>now that somebody told them</em>).</p><p id="4a8e">Because Andres privately researched the issue and got the Linux distributions to take it seriously, he averted this reaching any kind of wide (or even small) deployment in the real world.</p><p id="aaa1">Also, Andres had a unique testing environment and a set of coincidental setup issues which allowed him to discover the issue. I don’t know of anybody else has this setup.</p><p id="a458">When I installed a vulnerable Linux box, I had to double check it was actually vulnerable as I wouldn’t even see a speed issue. For me, it was a completely transparent backdoor — where sshd was running from disk as usual, with the usual file hash and no extra network activity.</p><p id="c395"><strong>How advanced was the threat actor? </strong>The backdoor attempt was a very serious one, with a very high bar of knowledge, research, development and tradecraft to reach this far into the Linux ecosystem. Additionally, changes made by the threat actor on Github span multiple years, and include things like introducing functions incompatible with OSS Fuzzer due to outstanding small issues since 2015, then getting OSS Fuzzer to exclude XZ Utils from scanning last year. The backdoor itself is super well put together, and even includes the ability to remotely deactivate and remove the backdoor via a kill command. Several days in, despite global focus, I haven’t seen anybody who has finished reverse engineering it.</p><p id="22fd"><strong>Who did it?</strong> Your mum. Just kidding, it was GCHQ in Cheltnam. Just kidding, it was Russia. Just kidding, it was China. Just kidding, it was America. Just kidding, it was definitely your mum.</p><p id="f5c3"><strong>We should stop using open source and only buy American vendor products! </strong>Yeah, good luck with that.</p><figure></figure><p id="3aea"><strong>We should start funding every open source project! </strong>Yeah, good luck with that.. I’ll start saving for my trip to Mars.</p><p id="a175"><strong>This is a wake up call around cybersecurity! </strong>People will have forgotten about it in a week. Except for LinkedIn, who will still be talking in an echo chamber about supply chain in four decades.</p><p id="2e14"><strong>So what can we do? </strong>First of all, if you rely on <em>any </em>software, you have a risk of insider threat. Be it open source, closed source, or your own in house developers — if people add backdoors and nobody notices, that’s a problem.</p><p id="6d06">Secondly, <strong><em>a core issue here is systemd in Linux</em></strong>. libsystemd is linked to all systemd servies, which opens a rich attack surface of third party services to backdoor. That is what the threat actor abused here. It mean they didn’t need to backdoor systemd, which has a rich development community paying attention — instead they relied on liblzma loading XZ, which is much further down the chain, where nobody was paying attention.</p><p id="71dd">There’s a plot twist. This issue request in systemd was opened today:</p><p id="1efe">But the fix for this was <em>already in train before the XZ issue was highlighted</em>, and long before the Github issue. The fix stopped the XZ backdoor into SSH, but hadn’t yet rolled out into a release of systemd.</p><p id="2482">I believe there’s a good chance the threat actor realised this, and began rapidly accelerated development and deployment, hence publicly filing bug reports to try to get Ubuntu and such to upgrade XZ, as it was about to spoil several years of work. It also appears this is when they started making mistakes.</p><p id="e9ae"><strong>We’re all doomed!!!1! The supply chain will end the world!11! I really want to panic!!! </strong>No. Panic helps nobody. It’s also important we keep things in perspective, e.g. this one was spotted and averted.</p><p id="b2b5">Let’s just keep doing the good SBOM work at CISA, and stop doing stunts around Huawei and such — Huawei is a speck of dust compared to the issues around tens of thousands of unpaid developers writing the core of the world’s most critical infrastructure nowadays.</p><p id="9ee5">Work around tightening systemd and other core Linux dependencies needs to continue. There’s probably more that needs to be done around EDR detection on Linux, e.g. injection into ssh that nobody detected? Detect it. In truth, Linux EDR products are significantly less robust than Windows EDR products. Ask me how I know.</p><p id="1afa">The reality is that all development has a risk of insider account abuse, and that includes open source.</p><figure></figure><p id="50eb">We should also acknowledge that open source developers are largely unpaid, and face significant amounts of online abuse from users of the software. This is not the first time an open source package has been hijacked after a maintainer was added – it actually happens all the time in Python repositories and such, and has been one of the leading causes of infostealers and coin miners in development pipelines. It is absolutely not a surprise that somebody is targeting open source compression libraries that systemd loads.. and it is also sadly not a surprise that people online bully the creators of these libraries, either.</p><p id="f608">There are no easy fixes.. we should just try to reduce the risk and calmly work some solutions.</p><p id="2267">Other reading:</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
I just wrote 84 new matrix multiplication kernels for
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a> which
enable it to read prompts / images faster. Compared to llama.cpp, prompt
eval time with llamafile should go anywhere between 30% and 500% faster
when using F16 and Q8_0 weights on CPU. The improvements are most
dramatic for ARMv8.2+ (e.g. RPI 5), Intel (e.g. Alderlake), and AVX512
(e.g. Zen 4) computers. My kernels go 2x faster than MKL for matrices
that fit in L2 cache, which makes them a work in progress, since the
speedup works best for prompts having fewer than 1,000 tokens.

</p><h3>Background</h3>

<p>
llamafile is a local LLM project I started with Mozilla back in Nov
2023. We're using
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> to package
<a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/">llama.cpp</a> as a
single-file cross-platform binary that runs on six OSes for AMD64 and
ARM64, while making gentle modifications. I believe that by improving
the core technology, we can give our users the best possible llama.cpp
experience, while helping both projects reach a broader audience.
Mozilla has been giving me the resources to do this.

When I first got into LLMs, my workstation was an austere Hewlett
Packard running Alpine with a spinning disk, slow RAM, an AVX2
processor, and no GPU. What I liked about llama.cpp is they were the
first LLM project that cared about people like me. So I started
volunteering full time and collaborated with guys like Slaren to
<a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/613">introduce
mmap()</a> support, which made weights load instantly using half as much
RAM. It was a leap forward for local LLMs at the time, but did little to
improve evaluation speed. Most of the inference code was written by
Georgi Gerganov himself, and it's so good that it'd take me another year
to finally improve upon. Now that I have, let's see how much faster
things go on my old Hewlett Packard.

<p>
Here we see that, on Skylake, llamafile users can expect to see a 2x
speedup and llama.cpp users can expect 50% better performance. Please
note this only applies to certain weights. So far, I've only written
optimized kernels for the q8_0, f16, q4_1, q4_0, and f32 data types. I
think both q8_0 and f16 are really solid choices. Possibly even f32 if
you've got plenty of RAM. That's because my new kernels change the
rules. They're doing such a good job fixing the memory bandwidth quants
always solved, that quantization could become the bigger bottleck. That
would be great news for the future of local language models, since it
means less need to trade away knowledge for speed.

You don't need a large computer to run a large language model. One of
the best personal computers available in stores today is the Raspberry Pi. They
deliver good performance at a great price and consume very little power.

Raspberry Pi released their fifth edition a few months ago and it's
outrageously fast compared to their previous model. They also introduced
support for the ARMv8.2 dotprod and fp16 arithmetic ISAs, which are very
useful for LLMs. Those two features alone enabled llama.cpp to achieve a
10x performance boost for f16 weights last year. This week I teased out
another 2x performance boost on top of that, by using a kernel that I
originally intended for AVX512. You wouldn't think a kernel designed for
beefy data center equipment would work out for a teensy tiny little
Raspberry Pi, but it actually fit hand in glove since both CPUs have 32
vector registers.

</p><p>
It's worthwhile to note that the new ARMv8.2 fp16 ISA may introduce more
errors than usual, since it causes llamafile to use fp16 words and we
aren't using techniques like <a href="https://justine.lol/matmul/kahan.gif">Kahan summation</a> for
computing dot products. So Q8_0 weights actually end up having slightly
better perplexity, because it uses the dotprod ISA which lets us updot
signed 8-bit integers into a 32-bit compute type which absorbs errors.
However this doesn't mean the faster fp16 weights can't be useful. Many
developers in this field view the differences as negligible.

</p><p>
For example, let's say you want to setup an email server on your pihole
and have TinyLLaMA filter spam. It's possible to
<a href="https://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html">configure Postfix
to filter content using a shell script</a> which lets you run the
llamafile command.

</p><pre>llamafile -m TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.f16.gguf \
          --grammar <span>'root ::= "yes" | "no"'</span> --temp 0 -c 0 \
          --no-display-prompt --log-disable -p <span>"&lt;|user|&gt;
Can you say for certain that the following email is spam?

To: jtunney@gmail.com
From: Federal-Tax-DebtHelp &lt;ConfirmationEmail.inzk@janents.com&gt;
Subject: Reduce your payments to what you can afford

Reduce your payments to what you can afford

&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;|assistant|&gt;"</span>
</pre>

<p>
When I run the shell script above on my RPI5, it takes 3 seconds.

</p><pre>jart@pi5:~/scratch$ time ./spam.sh
yes

real    0m3.168s
user    0m10.851s
sys     0m0.541s
</pre>

<p>
There are several important things happening here:

</p><ul>

  <li>
    <code>--temp 0</code> turns off the random number generator (we
    don't want improvisation for a spam filter)

  </li><li>
    Here we see why prompt eval time is king. Token generation speed
    (eval time) doesn't matter for this use case, since we're using
    the <code>--grammar</code> flag to force the LLM to only print a
    single "yes\n" or "no\n" token.

  </li><li>
    I piped the original email through <code>links -codepage utf-8
    -force-html -width 400 -dump /dev/stdin</code> which reduced the
    number of tokens and removed hidden HTML content that was put there
    by the spammer to make the email look like ham to naive Bayesian
    filters.

  </li><li>
    The <code>-c 0</code> flag configures TinyLLaMA to use the maximum
    context size, which is 2048 tokens. That's the largest prompt we can
    give it. To help avoid feeding in too much text, you can pipe the
    email through <code>sed 's/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*/ /g' | dd bs=1
    count=7000</code> to remove superfluous spaces and place an upper
    limit on its size.

</li></ul>

<p>
Please note that spam filtering is just the tip of the iceberg. I've
always thought that "generative ai" is a misnomer, because language
models (more commonly known as "The Algorithm") have always been used by
tech companies in the past to extract knowledge, curate information, and
rank content. That requires reading rather than writing. AI has never
traditionally needed to talk that much, because the English language
just isn't that useful at the scale tech companies operate. Even if you
could generate English summaries for exabytes of text a millionth its
size, that would still be more words than any team could hope to read in
a lifetime.

Gamers have the highest quality expectations of any value consumer, so
any hardware built for them is usually pretty good. In the machine
learning industry, we have thrived for years repurposing hardware that
was intended for gamers. If it weren't for their important contribution,
the AI Winter may have needed to last another ten years. So a few months
ago, I asked a gamer to build me a computer that can replace my old
Hewlett Packard.

<p>
I think Alderlake is a great CPU but it's popularly misunderstood, as
evidenced by how easily I quintupled its float16 performance. Unlike
ARMv8.2, I was able to do that without introducing rounding errors,
since my x86 kernels use a float32 compute type internally. This means I
can have an even smarter spam filter. For example, when I run
my <code>spam.sh</code> shell script, it only takes 420 milliseconds,
which is 7x faster than my Raspberry Pi 5. That's right, when it comes
to small workloads, this chip is able to finish before CUDA even gets
started.

</p><p>
Alderlake owners can also look forward to the fact that llamafile takes
special care to not run on your efficiency cores. This is one of the
things that helps llamafile to go faster than llama.cpp. It also means
you can run LLMs around the clock and there's still plenty of resources
leftover for the other programs on your computer. The reason why that's
important is because llama.cpp dispatches threads in lockstep, which
would have meant that if any <code>1</code> core takes longer than the
others to do its job, then all other <code>n</code> cores would need to
busy loop until it completed.

</p><p>
However the greatest feature of this microprocessor is how quickly it
can build all 2.6 million lines of code in the Cosmopolitan monorepo. My
Hewlett Packard always took 64 seconds, but this gaming computer does it
in 20. It actually took 35 seconds originally; what made it faster is was applying
<a href="https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/conductonaut/s-tg-c-001-r">liquid
metal</a> and AI overclocking. Another reason systems code is so fast on
the Alderlake is there was a fire fight between the hackers and
scientists in the creation of this CPU, and the hackers won. I hope
they'll strike out a better compromise on AVX512 in the future, but
overall I'm very happy with this chip, since I believe it represents
significant progress over previous models.

If there's a personal computer with the most class, it would definitely
be the Mac Studio. Gaining the performance advantage here was harder for
me, because it's the hardware platform the llama.cpp developers care
about most, plus I'm working with a handicap due to my choice to use
Stallman's compiler instead of Apple's proprietary tools.

<p>
I wouldn't want to pick a fight with an Apple user, because their M2
microprocessor turns llamafile into a firehose of synthetic content. The
trick Apple used to do it is leveraging their vertical integration. If
you buy a Mac Studio and look inside, you'll discover that they put the
RAM DIMMs <em>inside</em> the CPU. It makes latency-bound operations
like token generation go much faster, because the CPU no longer needs to
make all these long distance phone calls. However, in terms of sheer
flops (as measured by prompt tok/sec), we can see that compared to my
much cheaper Intel computer, the M2 Ultra only exposes 30% more compute
via the ARM ISA. You need to go through their proprietary frameworks
like Metal and Accelerate if you want to access anything more. If you
have xcode installed, then llamafile by default will compile a small
stub module which does just that, since despite my values I'm happy to
help you get in front of any closed source library standing between you
and your silicon.

</p><p>
One important thing to know if you're considering buying a Mac Studio is
that, like the Windows Executive, XNU does a really good job keeping
your desktop stable, and that means protecting your system from you. It
takes me 45 seconds on Mac Studio to compile the Cosmo monorepo, due to
all these safety features; but if I fork bombed it, I'd be surprised if
Netflix skipped a single frame. My <code>spam.sh</code> script also goes
430ms, which is slower than Intel. However none of this concerns me,
since I've seen the way Asahi Linux is able to unleash the M2's full
potential.

While llamafile cares deeply about helping the GPU poor, it offers a
first-class experience to the 1% too. The AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO
7995WX was just launched several months ago and it's the most expensive
CPU money can buy right now. It'll set you back $10,000 but you get 96
cores of AVX512, based on the Zen4 architecture.

<p>
Here we see that, despite only being twice the price, the 7995WX x86 ISA
offers 7x more raw compute power than the M2 Ultra ARM ISA, and nearly
the same token generation speed, which is likely thanks to its 384mb L3
cache. When I bought this chip, I had to expand support in llama.cpp for
bfloat16 and AVX512 before I could fully test its capabilities. My work
means you can now run LLaMA 2.8x faster on Zen4 than you could before.

</p><p>
One thing I like about AVX512 is that Google's Gemma model can
<a href="https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp/issues/23">solve math
riddles on AVX512 but not on AVX2</a> because the bigger vectors usually
make it easier to reduce rounding errors. Its <code>VDPBF16PS</code>
instruction helps us updot bf16 similar to VNNI and ARM dotprod. Having
native support for bf16 is nice, since models like Mistral and TinyLLaMA
distribute weights using bfloat16 as their canonical format. If we were
to convert bf16 to fp16, then only 13% of the numbers that are possible
can be accurately represented. In practice, it matters little, since
99.71% of the numbers Mistral 7b uses are among that 13%. However I
believe that llamafile should deliver, to the best of its ability,
whatever number of bits are being claimed. Especially when doing so also
enables us to better exploit the capabilities of our hardware. Adding
bf16 support is my first big step towards improving that.

</p><p>
Please be warned that a lot of people who bought this Threadripper ran
into issues with sketchy RAM. I had to RMA the first DIMMs I bought for
this computer, because most of them died and I was getting 5 eval tokens
per second with Mistral. I've been having better luck with a new full
kit of eight sticks that just arrived today. When I run <code>sysbench
memory run</code> it reports 10,033,424 mops, which is oddly faster than
my Mac Studio where 9,892,584 mops is reported, however my Intel
computer does 14,490,952. I expected my Threadripper's RAM to have that
speed since both set of components advertised 6400 MT/s with the same
timings, but I'm told that I traded this away to have 256GB of ECC. As
for disk speed, <code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=128k count=50k;
rm -f /tmp/output</code> reports 1.6 GB/s which is 3.6x slower than my
Mac Studio, and 3x slower than my Intel (which has the same M.2 stick).
I'm told that Intel and Apple are just better at this, but I wish I
understood why.

</p><p>
Last but not least, it runs my <code>spam.sh</code> script in 323ms and
builds the whole Cosmo monorepo in 13 seconds. It's actually capable of
building it faster, since this is the first time I've ever seen my build
config being constrained by an individual artifact blocking the critical
path. I never thought I'd live to see the day. I'm also puzzled that
llamafile v0.6.2 is somehow managing to do 93 tokens per second; that's
40% faster than my M2. It's exciting news, since after reviewing the
breadth of this blog post, I would have wept if there were no more
optimizations possible.

There are dozens of mathematical operations a transformer model needs to
perform in order to generate text, e.g. rope, transpose, reshape,
softmax, rms_norm, etc. All of the performance improvements I described
above, were achieved by focusing exclusively on a single one, which
is <code>GGML_OP_MUL_MAT</code>, because that's what my Linux Perf
profiler told me llamafile spends 95% of its time doing.

</p><p>
So what is this matrix multiplication thing? We shall start by defining
the most important algorithm in the world using the pythonic dialect of
Python that is most popular with developers today:

</p><pre><span>def</span> <span>matmul</span>(A, B):
  <span>assert</span> <span>len</span>(B) == <span>len</span>(A[0])
  <span>return</span> [[<span>sum</span>(A[i][l] * B[l][j]
               <span>for</span> l <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>len</span>(B)))
           <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>len</span>(B[0]))]
          <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>len</span>(A))]
</pre>

<p>
As we can see, it's just three for loops and a multiply-add. How hard
could it be?

</p><p>
On my workstation (which I call meatball), the code above goes a
screeching 0.042 gigaflops. Most Python programmers are smart enough to
know that they should delegate tasks like these to a library
like <code>np.matmul</code>, which goes 29 gigaflops. NumPy achieves its
speed using FORTRAN which for generations has been favored
by <a href="https://justine.lol/dox/pascal.txt">real programmers</a>
who've led us to believe these libraries are something mysterious
chiseled in stone by the hand of Moses himself; but if we look at the
FORTRAN code NumPy actually uses, then it really isn't all that
complicated and could clearly benefit from some revision.

In order to do better than 47 gigaflops on CPU, most C++ developers are
smart enough to know they should use a BLAS library. Mightiest of the
open source BLAS is <a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/">BLIS</a>
which is funded by Microsoft, Intel, Texas Instruments, AMD, HPE,
Oracle, Huawei, Facebook, ARM, and the National Science Foundation.

</p><blockquote>
"Any time somebody outside Intel beats MKL by a nontrivial amount, I
report it to the MKL team. It is fantastic for any open-source project
to get within 10% of MKL... [T]his is why Intel funds BLIS development."
(@jeffhammond) <a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/issues/264#issuecomment-428673275">blis/issues/264</a>

<p>
That's very impressive. Matrix multiplication is the practical
application of hardware that hardware makers care about optimizing most.
Since nobody knows more about Intel hardware than Intel, I imagine it's
not everday that somebody manages to challenge Intel for supremacy on
their own platform. Based on my own evaluation, what BLIS says is true.
However that is only true for single-threaded performance. Their
multithreading mode is still experimental, but if I use
a <code>./configure</code> flag to turn it on, then I'm able to boost
performance to 85 gigaflops.

</p><p>
llama.cpp had the important insight that less is more when it comes to
linear algebra. The alpha and beta parameters are never used, so they're
always set to to 1 and 0. The op graph for LLMs are designed in such a
way that the A matrix is almost always transposed and B is almost never
transposed, which means inner dimension dot product can vectorize over
contiguous memory. The m/k dimensions are usually evenly divisible by
64. While generating tokens, n=1 is usually the case, which makes matmul
a de facto matvec for the performance most people care about. BLAS
libraries usually hurt more than they help for matrix-vector
multiplication, because it's so computationally simple by comparison.
Sort of like the difference between downloading a movie and pinging a
server. Matrix vector multiplication is an operation where latency (not
throughput) is the bottleneck, and the bloat of fancy libraries has a
measurable impact. So llama.cpp does something like this, which goes 233
gigaflops.

<p>
This gives us the best possible token generation speeds. However
llama.cpp's Achilles heel on CPU has always been prompt processing
speed, which goes much slower. That's because chewing through prompts
requires bona fide matrix-matrix multiplication. Being able to do this
fast is important if you care about text summarization and LLaVA image
processing. That's the reason why support for countless BLAS libraries
has been added to llama.cpp over the past year. The most formidable of
them is Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) which goes 384 gigaflops.

</p><p>
The difference between 233 versus 384 gigaflops may not seem like much,
at least not compared to Python, but it's a tremendous gulf. MKL is also
closed source and proprietary. We aren't even allowed to disassemble it
and try to reverse engineer how it works. Intel has been developing math
kernels for fifty years and they hold the secrets they've acquired very
close to their chest. But even if our desire for performance was so
great that we were willing to overlook the ethics of an open source
project spending the majority of its time inside a proprietary blob, the
simple fact of the matter is that integrating foreign BLAS libraries
into llama.cpp isn't that practical, due to the way its threading model
works. In order to improve prompt processing speed, we must figure out
the trick BLAS libraries use, and implement it in a scrappy
dependency-free way that stays true to llama.cpp's roots.

</p><p>
I believe the trick with CPU math kernels is exploiting instruction
level parallelism with fewer memory references. If you compile the
example above with <code>-O3 -ffast-math -march=native</code> then the
code your compiler generates should look like this:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>SLLMM</span>(<span>int</span> m, <span>int</span> n, <span>int</span> k,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *A, <span>int</span> lda,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *B, <span>int</span> ldb,
           <span>float</span> *C, <span>int</span> ldc) {
<span>#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) if (m * n * k &gt; 300000)</span>
    <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; m; ++i)
        <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j) {
            <span>__m256</span> c = _mm256_setzero_ps();
            <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> l = 0; l &lt; k; l += 8)
                c = _mm256_fmadd_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(A + lda * i + l),
                                    _mm256_loadu_ps(B + ldb * j + l), c);
            C[ldc * j + i] = hsum(c);
        }
}

So what llama.cpp usually does when it wants to improve things, is it'll
unroll the innermost loop like this:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>SLLMM2</span>(<span>int</span> m, <span>int</span> n, <span>int</span> k,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *A, <span>int</span> lda,
           <span>const</span> <span>float</span> *B, <span>int</span> ldb,
           <span>float</span> *C, <span>int</span> ldc) {
<span>#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) if (m * n * k &gt; 300000)</span>
    <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; m; ++i)
        <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j) {
            <span>__m256</span> c0 = _mm256_setzero_ps();
            <span>__m256</span> c1 = _mm256_setzero_ps();
            <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> l = 0; l &lt; k; l += 16) {
                c0 = _mm256_fmadd_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(A + lda * i + l + 0),
                                     _mm256_loadu_ps(B + ldb * j + l + 0), c0);
                c1 = _mm256_fmadd_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(A + lda * i + l + 8),
                                     _mm256_loadu_ps(B + ldb * j + l + 8), c1);
            }
            C[ldc * j + i] = hsum(c0) + hsum(c1);
        }
}
</pre>

<p>
That may slightly improve numerical stability, but it does very little
to enhance performance, since modern CPUs are perfectly capable of
speculatively executing future loop iterations on their own. What we
want to do instead is unroll the <em>outer</em> loop. The advantage of
doing this becomes clear if we consider how it enables us to share
the <code>a0</code> register load across multiple floating point
operations.

Vectorized outer product with OpenMP goes 810 gigaflops on my Alderlake
i9-14900K with 6400 MT/s RAM when multiplying a 513×512 with a 512×512
matrix. That is twenty eight years of progress per Moore's law compared
to Python. It's clearly optimal since my CPU is listed as only being
capable of going
<a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu/intel-core-i9-14900k">780
gigaflops</a>. Yes, I overclocked it with liquid metal. On the other
hand, MKL processes this matrix size at 295 gigaflops on my machine.

But does the C function above generalize to all matrix sizes? Nope. If I
bump the complexity up from 512 to 1024, then I'm pretty much back at
square one, not doing much better than a naive kernel, and MKL wins once
more. I personally don't view this as too problematic, since llama.cpp
by default processes prompts in modestly sized batches, and a kernel
should only need to be good for its intended size. It's also only a
matter of time until I unriddle the tricks needed for optimal tiling and
cache locality that can make my kernels scale.

</p><h3 id="threads">
  <a href="#threads">How I Got Multiple Threads to Work</a>
</h3>

<p>
Now to incorporate this into llamafile, we can't use OpenMP for the same
reason we can't use BLAS libraries. The kernel must be harmonized with
the way llama.cpp works. Its threading model is very similar to GPUs.
Ops in the model graph are processed one by one. A thread is spawned for
each core. Threads are restrained by a spinlock barrier and then set
loose to compute different parts of an output matrix in parallel as soon
as the next op is ready for execution. The id of each thread is
called <code>ith</code> and the number of threads is
called <code>nth</code>. There are no futexes or semaphores, because
kernel scheduling would greatly reduce tokens/sec. If we were to have
the <code>ith=0</code> thread call a BLAS API that spawned threads of
its own, then they'd be immediately starved of resources by all
the <code>ith&gt;0</code> threads returning to the spinlock barrier. We
can work within this model by defining a new kernel framework.

You need to run the following command on Linux in order to benchmark
llamafile reliably. It also helps a little bit with timings to run as
root, but that shouldn't be necessary.

</p><pre><span>echo</span> performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
</pre>

<p>
On Apple Silicon, I needed to build llama.cpp using the following
command in order to get it to run in CPU mode.

</p><pre>make -j32 LLAMA_NO_ACCELERATE=1 LLAMA_NO_METAL=1
</pre>

<p>
Some of you might be surprised that I didn't write my kernels in
assembly like BLIS does, especially given my history of projects
like <a href="https://justine.lol/matmul/github.com/jart/blink">blink</a>, <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/">SectorLISP</a>
and <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlambda2/">SectorLAMBDA</a>. The truth is I've been
coding in assembly this whole time. I configured Emacs so I can push a
button, and the disassembly for the C++ code I'm working on will pop up
on the screen in a few milliseconds. I know anyone whose codebase has
slow build times doesn't possess this advantage, which has made me
famous. Once I figure out how to do that for .cu files, I'll be
unstoppable.

I learned how to write math kernels by renting
<a href="https://vast.ai/">Vast</a> VMs and watching
<a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/">Gautham Venkatasubramanian</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/mrdomino">mrdomino</a> develop CUDA kernels
in a tmux session. They've been focusing on solving a much more
important challenge for llamafile, which is helping it not have a
mandatory dependency on the cuBLAS: the reigning supreme linear algebra
library of such speed, accuracy, and ferocity that it could only have
been written by the prince of darkness himself. You're encouraged to
follow our ongoing progress on GitHub.

In what is likely one of the largest breaches of trust in the free software ecosystem, this backdoor is likely to have been put in by Jia Tan, a long-time maintainer of xz. Throughout his tenure as a maintainer, Jia remained relatively mysterious — as is not uncommon in the community, little beyond his name (which is likely a lie) is known about him. Generally, anonymity in the free software sphere is a good thing: software is inherently based on accomplishment and merit, and there is no reason to know anything about a person’s identity. However, in this case, where someone built up the trust of a community for years and then abused it, it is interesting to see who they are. Luckily for us, Jia’s activity does provide some metadata which we can potentially use to learn more about him. So here’s an analysis on what we can learn from his work patterns and time zone.</p><p><span>What is to be learned from times? The conditions under which software is created! Think about the wide range of things that time patterns tell us about — there are people who are paid to do code and those who work on it as a hobby. Those in some areas code during different times as others. There are holidays, sleep schedules, and work-life balance— code is not exempt from these. Understanding when someone codes helps us understand </span><em>why</em><span> and </span><em>where</em><span> they are coding for. Figuring these out can give us a much better idea about why and who did this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The following analysis was conducted on JiaT75’s (</span><a href="https://github.com/JiaT75?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-12-01&amp;to=2021-12-31" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://github.com/JiaT75?tab=overview&amp;from=2021-12-01&amp;to=2021-12-31</a><span>) commits to the XZ repository and their time stamps.</span></p><p>Let’s first address the elephant in the room: Yes, you can change Git timestamps to whatever you want. It doesn’t even take a degree in cybersec to do — setting the environment variables GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE as you commit is enough. If you forget and haven’t pushed yet, you can even change the date later as you amend the commit.</p><p>However, plausibly forging time data is actually hard: You shouldn’t push a commit that you made to look as though it was made in the future, and you also shouldn’t set a date that is so far in the past that the commit looks older than online discussions that it references. This means you will often not be able to change the time without adding latency, i.e., withholding commits and thus delaying project development -- and even then, getting it right every time is hard. After all, everyone who develops software knows how tempting it is to type the magic words “git commit” without having properly checked everything.</p><p>An easier way than actually changing the time would be to change only the time zone! Ideally, you would change it to something that still leads to somewhat plausible hours. For example, someone who works during regular European office hours but claims to be on the East Coast would likely raise some suspicion, as 11 am Central European Time is 5 AM Eastern, and who regularly works in the early morning? For a hacker, it is much more plausible to work in the afternoon and late at night, so someone who keeps regular office hours would want to change into a time zone about five hours ahead or so (so they start working at 2 pm (9 am real-time) and end at 10 pm (5 pm real time)).</p><p>I think that is what Jia Tan did. Based on his name, he wanted people to believe he is Asian — specifically Chinese— and the vast majority of his commits (440) appear to have a UTC+08 time stamp. The +0800 is likely CST, the time zone of China (or Indonesia or Philippines or Western Australia), given almost no one lives in Siberia and the Gobi desert.</p><p>However, I believe that he is actually from somewhere in the UTC+02 (winter)/UTC+03 (DST) timezone, which includes Eastern Europe (EET), but also Israel (IST), and some others. Forging time zones would be easy — no need to do any math or delay any commits. He likely just changed his system time to Chinese time every time he committed.</p><p>We see him usually working 9 am to 6 pm (adjusted to EET). This makes much more sense than someone working at midnight and 1 am on a Tuesday night (non-adjusted, using UTC+08).</p><p>Except sometimes, he forgot to change his time zone. There are 3 commits and 6 commits, respectively, with UTC+02 and UTC+03. The UTC+02 time zones match perfectly with the winter time (February and November), while the UTC+03 matches with summer (Jun, Jul, and early October). This matches perfectly with the daylight savings time switchover that happens in Eastern Europe; we see a switch to +0200 in the winter (past the last weekend of October) and +0300 in the summer (past the last Sunday in March). Incidentally, this seems to be the same time zone as Lasse Collin and Hans Jansen.</p><p>OK, you say. That is one theory, but maybe not a plausible one at this point. What if he just flew from wherever he lived in UTC+08 to EET sometimes? Well, it turns out that when we take a closer look, we see that this is not plausible. Let’s analyze the few times when Jia was recorded in a non-+0800 time zone. Here, we notice that there are some situations where Jia switches between +0800 and +0300/+0200 in a seemingly implausible time. Indicating that perhaps he is not actually in +0800 CST time, as his profile would like us to believe.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, on 6 Oct 2022, we see two commits, one at 21:53:09 +0300 followed by another at 17:00:38 +0800. If we do the math, there is about an 11-hour difference between the two commits. However, a flight from China to anywhere in Eastern Europe or the Middle East takes at least 10-12 hours raw flight time, and likely much longer, considering non-stop flights between these locations are rare.</p><p>Even more damning, on Jun 27, 2023, we see the following: one commit at  23:38:32 +0800, another at 17:27:09 +0300. This is only a difference in a matter of minutes!</p><p><span>There is also one more vital clue to which country he worked in: Holidays. We notice that Jia’s work schedule and holidays seem to align much better with an Eastern European than a Chinese person. Disclaimer: I am not an expert in Chinese holidays, so this very well could be inaccurate. I am referencing this list of bank holidays: </span><a href="https://www.bankofchina.co.id/en-id/service/information/latest-news/2022/public-holidays-in-china-hk-and-the-us-in-2023.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://www.bankofchina.co.id/en-id/service/information/latest-news/2022/public-holidays-in-china-hk-and-the-us-in-2023.html</a></p><p>Chinese bank holidays (just looking at 2023):</p><p>- Working on 2023, 29 September: Mid Autumn Festival</p><p>- Working on 2023, 05 April: Tomb Sweeping Day</p><p>- Working on 2023, 26, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27 Jan: Lunar New Year</p><p>Eastern European holidays:</p><p>- Never working on Dec 25: Christmas (for many EET countries)</p><p>- Never working Dec 31 or Jan 1: New Years&nbsp;</p><p>To further investigate, we can try to see if he worked on weekends or weekdays: was this a hobbyist or was he paid to do this? The most common working days for Jia were Tue (86), Wed (85), Thu (89), and Fri (79).</p><p>Again, none of this is rock-solid evidence for anything — but we thought this was an interesting enough observation to post. Based on this, “Jia” most likely worked regular office hours and was based somewhere in UTC+02/03 (e.g. EET).</p><p>Update (Mar 31): Thank you all for your great feedback! We slightly updated the post: We switched around the times from the two commits where time zones change too quickly (our point stands; we just reversed the examples). We also clarified that UTC +02/03 includes a wider geographical range than just Eastern Europe.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Around 50 years ago, in October 1971, Ray Tomlinson, a graduate of MIT, sent the first email email over a network.. Last year, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ~121 trillion emails were sent</a> between <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ~4.3 billion people</a>. Email is the the most important written form of communication on this planet and will remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On October 3, 2023, <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/730172167494483968/more-secure-less-spam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo</a> announced upcoming email security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dmarc-configure?view=o365-worldwide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Outlook.com</a> (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies.</p>

<p>With the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs will begin tightening the reigns. <b><mark>Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024</mark></b>.</p>



<p>In this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance.</p>

<p>The biggest change involves implementing email authentication standards like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These standards have been around for a while, but are only now being strictly enforced by major email service providers. Like SSL (HTTPS) for the web and MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) to protect your online accounts, organizations will be expected to conform to these guidelines.</p>

<p>This is what non-compliance (for Gmail) looks like in an email server log:</p>

<pre><code>host gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com [108.177.15.26]
SMTP error from remote mail server after pipelined end of data:
550-5.7.26 This mail is unauthenticated, which poses a security risk to the
550-5.7.26 sender and Gmail users, and has been blocked. The sender must
550-5.7.26 authenticate with at least one of SPF or DKIM. For this message,
550-5.7.26 DKIM checks did not pass and SPF check for [MYDOMAIJN.com] did not
550-5.7.26 pass with ip: [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]. The sender should visit
550-5.7.26  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126#authentication for
550 5.7.26 instructions on setting up authentication
</code></pre>

<p><code>
<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/3726730#5726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550, "5.7.26"</a><a>, "This message does not have authentication information or fails to pass authentication checks (SPF or DKIM). To best protect our users from spam, the message has been blocked. Please visit Prevent mail to Gmail users from being blocked or sent to spam for more information."
</a></code></p><p><a>Here’s the complete listing of </a><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/3726730" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gmail SMTP errors codes</a>.</p>

<p>This is quickly becoming a mandatory standard for senders, so every business will need to become familiar with them – or risk email deliverability to customers.</p>

<h2>Who’s Affected?</h2>

<p>Enforcement primarily pertains to <b>Bulk Senders</b>:</p>

<div><blockquote><p>“A <b>bulk sender</b> is any email sender that sends close to 5,000 messages or more to personal Gmail accounts within a 24-hour period. Messages sent from the same primary domain count toward the 5,000 limit.”</p></blockquote></div>





<p>These guidelines require bulk senders to enable SPF, DMARC and DKIM for their domains.</p>

<p>While these guidelines primarily affect bulk senders, senders with less volume per day can also be affected if they are not adhering to these guidelines. We recommend that all organizations, regardless of daily volume – implement these standards and adhere to guidelines.

</p><p>It’s also very important that both senders and recipients understand these requirements. Implementing them protects partners, customers and anyone receiving email. Improving email security and user experience can indirectly influence how your emails reach user inboxes</p>

<p>Here’s a quick summary of the guidelines:</p>

<p><span>Sender Authentication:</span> Senders should implement email authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent email spoofing and phishing attempts. We’ll cover this in more detail later in this article.</p>

<p><span>Bulk Senders Requirements:</span> Sending unsolicited bulk emails can lead to deliverability  issues (spam filtering) and reputation damage. Email providers have various algorithms and user reports to identify and filter spam. Google will require bulk senders (those sending 5,000+ emails per day to Gmail) to meet stricter requirements for compliance with spam thresholds.</p>

<p><span>Easy Unsubscribe: </span>Implement easy unsubscribe options (One-click Unsubscribe). Gmail users have tools to report spam, unsubscribe from unwanted emails and control their inbox experience. If it is too difficult to unsubscribe from your emails, customers will be more likely to flag your email as spam. Additional links provided in the ‘References’ section at the end of this article.</p>

<p><span>Engagement:</span> Avoid misleading subject lines, excessive personalization, or promotional content that triggers spam filters. Focus on providing relevant and valuable information when considering email content.</p>

<p>Special  Considerations:</p><ul>
<li>Keep your email spam rate is less than 0.3%.</li>
<li>Don’t impersonate email ‘From:’ headers.</li>
<li>Ensure that sending domains or IPs have valid forward and reverse DNS records, also referred to as PTR records.</li>
<li>Use a TLS connection for transmitting email.</li>
<li>Make sure your forward and reverse DNS records are valid.</li>
<li>Ensure receivers can easily unsubscribe from your marketing messages.</li>
<li>Format messages according to the ‘Internet Message Format standard’ <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RFC3322</a></li>
<li>If you regularly forward email, including using mailing lists or inbound gateways – add <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/81126#arc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ARC</a><a> headers to outgoing messages.</a></li><a>
<li>For direct mail, the domain in the sender’s From: header must be aligned with either the SPF domain or the DKIM domain. This is required to pass DMARC alignment.</li>
<li>Marketing messages and subscribed messages must support one-click unsubscribe, include a clearly visible unsubscribe link in the message body and process recipient unsubscribe requests within 2 days.</li>

<h2>Sender Authentication</h2>

<p>In this section e discuss Email Authentication and how to avoid the spam folder.</p>

<p>There are 3 authentication standards to help protect an organization’s email:</p>

<p><b>SPF</b> (Sender Policy Framework) specifies the servers and domains allowed to send email for your business. This protects against spoofing and helps prevent your emails from being flagged as spam. This is added as a record on  public DNS server that is used to check the source IP of the email and compares it with a DNS TXT record.</p>

<p><code>v=spf1 ip4:173.236.251.117 include:netblocks.dreamhost.com include:relay.mailchannels.net mx ~all</code></p>

<p><b>DKIM</b> (DomainKeys Identified Mail), used to digitally sign every outgoing message sent from your organization. The receiving server uses this to verify that it came from your business. It is a unique key for domain that allows mail servers to verify email authenticity and resist tampering. It is a generated key that is configured on a public DNS server.</p>

<p><code>
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; h=sha256; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAmY24P6ntSL6CbVrv++vyTdgVJP4jxAEDoYbpo2vMEpOb2SDnUsiiBnd8rINyMh9BMA5whxKC/w7oqYD9dr5mvfPtkVPBSz9PqFHE2s/QsFnJlBsUJJrLFBlSXw+F95TTZyqNboANJuGCGpbg207KloAd0PZxaHjyBqj9fTfFLUCp/TrEmaMZ1E3LwqXd2jqC2mUCBcIMzIOcT68eU0b5LTlRMPL7k07BOlMGSx8Ez2wYltyDXPQc9IM8rOlMmtO92O/PkyqhyqJF+QxMSAgV6CLhtghmwbRFjvKUbkAtdCYmfRqDiPrrTCZhV7RX6+3gg7F6MPstL+KefKKToFunFQIDAQAB
</code></p>

<p><b>DMARC</b> (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol designed to give domain owners the ability to protect against  spoofing, phishing, email scams and other cyber threats. It instructs receiving servers on how to handle outgoing messages from your organization that don’t pass SPF or DKIM.</p>

<p>More specifically, DMARC standardizes how email receivers perform email authentication using the SPF and DKIM authentication mechanisms. The policy is is published in the public Domain Name System (DNS) as text TXT records and used  by the receiving email server to authenticate incoming emails based on the name / value tags that are defined:</p>

<p><code>"v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=none; fo=1; rua=mailto:<span data-cfemail="fa9e979b8899a5888f9bba9f979b93969e9f9c9f94899fd48a8895959c8a9593948ed4999597">[email&nbsp;protected]</span>; ruf=mailto:<span data-cfemail="7d19101c0f1e220f081b3d18101c141119181b18130e18530d0f12121b0d12141309531e1210">[email&nbsp;protected]</span>"</code></p>



<p>DMARC:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Reduces email Spoofing &amp; Phishing</b>: Prevents bad actors from impersonating an organization’s domain by verifying which domain the email originated from.</p>
<p>The domain name in the <code>From:</code> field in the email envelop header is inspected and aligned with other domains authenticated by either SPF or DKIM:</p>
<code>From:	John Doe &lt;<span data-cfemail="442e202b2104213c25293428216a272b29">[email&nbsp;protected]</span>&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improves Email Deliverability</b>: Sets policies for how the receiving email server should deal with failures.</p>
<p>When emails fail DMARC authentication, the DMARC policy instructs how the receiving email server should handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks. The options are: Accept, Reject or Quarantine the email – ensuring senders that their legitimate emails are reaching recipients inboxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Provides Reporting &amp; Feedback</b>: DMARC provides a reporting mechanism for policy actions performed by the above policy.</p>
<p>These reports provide insights to domain owners about emails sent from their organization (even if they were sent by unauthorized parties). They can be helpful in identifying and addressing email spoofing attempts.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s a simple diagram to help explain the entire email journey:</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.xomedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/diag1-8544.png" alt="Email diagram"></p>

<ul>
<li>Sender composes and sends an email.</li>
<li>Sender’s MTA (Mail Transfer Agent on mail server) adds a DKIM signature to the email header as a special field..</li>
<li>Recipient’s MTA checks SPF and DKIM records.</li>
<li><p>DMARC alignment is verified, and the policy is applied:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>If a message passes authentication by the receiving server – <b>Deliver</b> to user's inbox.</li>
      <li><p>If a message fails authentication by the receiving server:</p>
         <p><b>Quarantine</b> (send them to recipients’ spam folder).</p>
         <p>NOTE: If the receiving mail server has a quarantine configured, messages might be sent to quarantine, rather than directly to the recipient's spam folder.</p>
         <p><b>Reject</b> messages are never deliver to the recipient. The receiving server usually sends a bounce message to the sender</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example email envelop from an organization that passes all of the email security guidelines:</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.xomedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/diag2-8544.png" alt="Email Headers"></p>

<p>Proper configuration of these standards shields against attacks and increases deliverability so that messages land in inboxes, not spam folders.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>Google continuously updates its algorithms and user-reported data to improve email filtering and user experience. Google’s <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/ridding-gmail-of-100-million-more-spam-messages-with-tensorflow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI</a> <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/an-overview-of-gmails-spam-filters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spam filtering</a> algorithms block 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware attempts from landing in your inbox. For 1.8 billion accounts, 15 billion unwanted emails are being blocked daily.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Implementing these guidelines will no doubt pose challenges for smaller organizations with limited resources. As mentioned earlier, many companies faced similar challenges transitioning to HTTPS for the Web, and MFA for online accounts. Email compliance is now rapidly becoming a mandatory standard that every business must become familiar with.</p>

<p>While these efforts may seem daunting, it’s important to understand that adapting to stricter security guidelines brings significant benefits such as stronger email security, customer trust and ensures that your emails are reaching their inboxes. Prioritizing these measures will elevate your brand and pave the way for business success.</p>

<p>To implement email authentication, consult with your service provider’s resources or support. For example, here’s collection of resource links for some well-known service providers:</p>

<div id="accordionExample" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
            <p>NOTE: Cloudflare provides a nice tool in their dashboard to help you generate and implement these records.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SPF</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DKIM</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DMARC</a><br>
         </p></div>



<p>Adoption is an important first step, being vigilant in the face of evolving security threats is equally important. Businesses will also need to be diligent about keeping up with changing standards.</p>

<p>By leveraging automation, organizations can effortlessly keep pace with shifting standards – ensuring continuous compliance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Continuously monitor email provider documentation for policy updates.</li>
<li>Query and perform DNS record verification and validation.</li>
<li>Analyze DMARC reports (both aggregate and forensic) for anomalies based on defined keywords.</li>
<li>Configure an email alert to notify you of any events triggered from the above steps.</li>
</ol>





<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>In this section we’re going to show you a couple of methods hackers employ to exploit email security loopholes. Failing to secure email systems properly exposes your customers to malicious actors who can hijack email domains for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>Email Spoofing and Phishing are two tactics commonly used to trick recipients:</p>

<p><b>Spoofing (impersonating)</b>: Involves sending emails that appear to be from a legitimate sender, like a bank, a company or even a friend. The goal is to trick the recipient into clicking on a malicious link, opening an infected attachment or revealing personal information. Spoofing is often used in phishing emails that aim to extract personal data from recipients.

</p><p><b>Phishing (action)</b>: Is a type of cyberattack that uses deceptive emails to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, clicking on malicious links or downloading infected attachments. The attackers typically impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to gain the recipient’s trust and make the email appear believable.

</p><p>The following command line mail utilities are commonly used in scripts to change email envelop header information such as “From:”, “To:” and “Subject:”.</p>

<p>A hacker will also go to great lengths setting up a remote web server with a login page that looks like the login page of a banking institution or social media platform.</p>

<p>These commands are automated using scripts (small programs) that are easily adaptable to impersonate an email from your bank with a  link to a fake login page to fool you into entering login credentials. These attacks can be very persistent, crafty and intelligently designed to evade both human and spam detection measures.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this article we covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>The new mandatory guidelines and best practices that email providers are enforcing in 2024 and the impact it will have on businesses.</li>
<li>We explained how to implement these guidelines and how to remain compliant.</li>
<li>We also provided some free online tools to help with implementation and compliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bulk senders are required to authenticate emails, be careful not exceed spam rate thresholds and implement one-click unsubscribes for email marketing campaigns and newsletters.</p>

<p>As email service providers enforce stricter guidelines, organizations need to be proactive with compliance. While implementing these guidelines can be complex, the benefits will be well worth it. Not only will it enhance security, it will boost email deliverability and engagement rates. Ultimately this will drive more sales and revenue, helping you stand out in a crowded digital marketplace.</p>

<p>Just as many companies faced similar challenges transitioning to HTTPS and MFA, email compliance is rapidly becoming a standard that every business must become familiar with. These security benefits will elevate your brand and pave the way for business success by building customer trust and ensuring emails reach their inboxes.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cpp2"><a id="what-is-cpp2"></a> What is Cpp2?</h2>
<p>"Cpp2," short for "C++ syntax 2," is my (<a href="https://github.com/hsutter">Herb Sutter's</a>) personal project to try to make writing ordinary C++ types/functions/objects be much <strong>simpler and safer</strong>, without breaking backward compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>What it isn't.</strong> Cpp2 is not a successor or alternate language with its own divergent or incompatible ecosystem. For example, it does not have its own nonstandard incompatible modules/concepts/etc. that compete with the Standard C++ features; it does not replace your Standard C++ compiler or other tools; and it does not require any changes to your Standard C++ compiler or standard library or other libraries or tools to keep fully using all of them.</p>
<p><strong>What it is.</strong> Cpp2 aims to be another "skin" for C++ itself, just a simpler and safer way to write ordinary C++ types/functions/objects, and a faster way to experiment with proposals for future new Standard C++ features in a simpler compiler and syntax flavor. It seamlessly uses Standard C++ modules and concepts requirements and other features, and it works with all existing C++20 or higher compilers and libraries and tools right out of the box with no changes required to use them all seamlessly and directly with zero overhead.</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup said it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inside C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out." <br>  — Bjarne Stroustrup, <em>The Design and Evolution of C++</em> (D&amp;E), 1994</p>
<p>"Say 10% of the size of C++ in definition and similar in front-end compiler size. ... most of the simplification would come from generalization." <br>  — Bjarne Stroustrup, <em>ACM History of Programming Languages III</em>, 2007</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My goal is to try to prove that Stroustrup is right:</strong> that it's possible and desirable to have true C++ with all its expressive power and control and with full backward compatibility, but in a flavor that's 10x simpler with fewer quirks and special cases to remember, <sup id="fnref:simpler"><a href="#fn:simpler">1</a></sup> and 50x safer where it's far easier to not write security bugs by accident.</p>
<p>We can't make an improvement that large to C++ via gradual evolution to today's syntax, because some important changes would require changing the meaning of code written in today's syntax. For example, we can never change a language feature default in today's syntax, not even if the default creates a security vulnerability pitfall, because changing a default would break vast swathes of existing code. Having a distinct alternative syntax gives us a "bubble of new code" that doesn't exist today, and have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Freedom to make any desired improvement, without breaking any of today's code.</strong> Cpp2 is designed to take all the consensus C++ best-practices guidance we already teach, and make them the default when using "syntax 2." Examples: Writing unsafe type casts is just not possible in Cpp2 syntax; and Cpp2 can change language defaults to make them simpler and safer. You can always "break the glass" when needed to violate the guidance, but you have to opt out explicitly to write unsafe code, so if the program has a bug you can grep for those places to look at first. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/wiki/Design-note%3A-Unsafe-code">Design note: unsafe code</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perfect link compatibility always on, perfect source compatibility always available (but you pay for it only if you use it).</strong> Any type/function/object/namespace written in either syntax is always still just a normal C++ type/function/object/namespace, so any code or library written in either Cpp2 or today's C++ syntax ("Cpp1" for short) can seamlessly call each other, with no wrapping/marshaling/thunking. You can write a "mixed" source file that has both Cpp2 and Cpp1 code and get perfect backward C++ source compatibility (even SFINAE and macros), or you can write a "pure" all-Cpp2 source file and write code in a 10x simpler syntax.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-cppfront"><a id="what-is-cppfront"></a> What is cppfront?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront"><strong>Cppfront</strong></a> is a compiler that compiles Cpp2 syntax to today's Cpp1 syntax. This lets you start trying out Cpp2 syntax in any existing C++ project and build system just by renaming a source file from <code>.cpp</code> to <code>.cpp2</code> and <a href="#adding-cppfront-in-your-ide-build-system">adding a build step</a>, and the result Just Works with every C++20 or higher compiler and all existing C++ tools (debuggers, build systems, sanitizers, etc.).</p>
<p>This deliberately follows Bjarne Stroustrup's wise approach with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront"><strong>cfront</strong></a>, the original C++ compiler: In the 1980s and 1990s, Stroustrup created cfront to translate C++ to pure C, and similarly ensured that C++ could be interleaved with C in the same source file, and that C++ could always call any C code with no wrapping/marshaling/thunking. By providing a C++ compiler that emitted pure C, Stroustrup ensured full compatibility with the C ecosystems that already existed, and made it easy for people to start trying out C++ code in any existing C project by adding just another build step to translate the C++ to C first, and the result Just Worked with existing C tools.</p>

Keewatin Dewdney">		
						<p> After a brief illness Alexander Keewatin "Kee" Dewdney paased away surrounded by family at Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario. He was predeceased by his first wife, Patricia Dewdney in 2020, and by his son, Jonathan, in 2022. <br>
Kee was born in London to author Selwyn Dewdney and art therapist Irene Dewdney. Early in life he developed a passionate interest in biology, but it was his fascination with higher mathematics that led to a joint doctorate in mathematics from Michigan and Waterloo Universities. From 1969 until his retirement in 1995 Kee went on to teach in the computer science department at The University of Western Ontario, after which he became Full Professor of Computer Science at The University of Waterloo. His mathematical focus was complexity theory and theory of computation. During these years he also wrote a monthly column for Scientific American. <br>
His lifelong passion for biology eventually led to his becoming steward of the Newport Forest tract on the Thame River, where he compiled an extensive list of species while also researching the mathematics of species abundance. In recognition of this work he was appointed Adjunct Professor of Biology at The University of Western Ontario. <br>
He is the author of more than a dozen nonfiction books, including a speculative bestseller called The Planiverse. Briefly, in the 1960s, he made experimental films, most notably The Malatese Cross Movement. <br>
All who knew Kee were touched by his charisma, his wonderful sense of humour and his steadfast generosity. He will be greatly missed by his wife, Elaine Dewdney, his brothers, Donner, Peter and Christopher, his nieces and nephews and many friends, and by members of London's Muslim community, where he was known as Khalil.</p></span></p>

There’s a lot of overhyped rhetoric at the moment around this tech, and looks like we’re heading into another period of post-hype disillusionment.<p>Legal angles here also also super interesting. There’s a growing body of scenarios where companies are held accountable for the goofs of their AI “assistants.” Thus we’re likely heading for some comical train wrecks as companies that don’t properly vet this stuff set themselves up for some expensive disasters (eg think the AI assistant doing things that will get the company into trouble).</p><p>I’m bullish on the tech, but bearish on the ability of folks to deploy it at scale without making a big expensive mess.

It's capital intensive, logistics intensive, and requires too many people in low-autonomy roles.</p><p>It really sucks the fun out of storytelling when you're chasing down location rights, showing up at the prop house at 7 AM, arranging for catering, etc.</p><p>&gt; We don’t know that we even have a future without vision.</p><p>As a creator, I've dreamed about a better way before GenAI was even on the radar. I'm not the only one. Existing processes suck and too much of the work isn't creative at all.</p><p>As a consumer, my needs are barely being met at all. I want a show about steampunk vampires in space. I want a biopic film exploring Reimann, but told as a musical. I have creative notes for Benioff and Weiss, and I'd rather put those together for myself and my friends than echo words into the void.</p><p>I want so much more than the canned limited selection I have available on Netflix and Criterion. It barely whets the palate, and my appetite is completely unsated. The closest I've ever gotten is performing in improv theater and exploring the worlds I want with the people I feel comfortable creating around. But that's only part of the experience I want. I want so much more. The art we have today is a pale shadow of the mind's unlimited canvas. A projection onto a caveman's wall.</p><p>You can protect a vision of a priestly class of artists from the printing press all you want. I'm tired of living in the dark ages when we're sitting at the precipice of so much more. Their jobs won't go away any more than wedding and event photographers suffer in the advent of digital film.</p><p>If anything, the artists will be the best primed to take advantage of the new alpha. Free of studio meddling, they can build their own audiences that they own without the chains of brand guidelines. Vivziepop, but a million fold.</p><p>I saw a figure recently that said 80% of consumer film, games, and media originates in the US. Think about the rest of the world. So much culture and perspective that we should all share in remains unseen, and we're left with the lens of US media giants.</p><p>Think, too, of all the dreamers lost in opportunity cost. There are a billion stories that die silently in the minds of dreamers because we couldn't help them. And the world is all the worse for it.

In addition to individualist fulfillment I crave collectivist fulfillment and for that to happen we have to assign duties to art.<p>If a collective shoulders that duty then we do get a printing press priesthood. If individualists shoulder the duty to the collective then we should get something different. Perhaps productions like Helluva Boss do have some kind of post-deconstructionist duty of their own design. If that is the case then society should reciprocate with granting rights different from what the priesthood would accrue.

A few thoughts:<p>* I was able to make a simple AI agent that could control my Spotify account, and make playlists based on its world knowledge (rather than Spotify recommendation algos), which was really cool. I used it pretty frequently to guide Spotify into my music tastes, and would say I got value out of it.</p><p>* GPT-4 worked quite well actually, GPT-3.5 worked maybe 80% of the time. Mixtral did not work at all, aside from needing hacks/workarounds to get function-calling working in the first place.</p><p>* It was very slow and VERY expensive. Needing CoT was a limitation. Could easily rack up $30/day just testing it.</p><p>My overall takeaway: it's too early: too expensive, too slow, too unreliable. Unless you somehow have a breakthrough with a custom model.</p><p>From the marketing side, people just don't "get it." I've since niched down, and it's very, very promising from a business perspective.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://konos.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://konos.ai</a>

                  <p><span>I think it's destined to fail because it basically moved AI back into the "rules based" realm. Deep learning is a decent cognitive interface - like making a guess at some structure out of non-structure. That's where the magic happens. But when you take that and start using rules to chain it together, you're basically back to the same idea as parsing semi-structured data with regex and/or if statements. You can get it to work a bit but edge cases keep coming along that kill you, and your rules will never keep up. For simple cognitive tasks, deep learning figures out enough of the edge cases to work pretty well, but that's gone once you start making rules for how to combine predictions.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I have been arguing with folks that current Reactflow based agent workflow tools are destined to fail, and more importantly, missing the point. Stop forcing AI into structured work.<p>I do think AI "agents" (or blocks as I like to think of them) unlock the potential for solving unstructured but well-scoped tasks. But it is a block of unstructured work that is very unique to a problem, and you are very likely to not find another problem where that block fits. So, trying to productize these AI blocks as re-usable agents is not that great of a value prop. And building a node based workflow tool is even less of a value prop.</p><p>However, if you can flip it inside out and build an AI agent that takes a question and outputs a node based workflow. But the blocks in the workflow are structured pre-defined blocks with deterministic inputs and outputs, or a custom AI block that you yourself built, then that is something I can find value in. This is almost like the function calling capabilities of GPT.</p><p>Building these block reminds me of the early days of cloud computing. Back then the patterns for high availability were not well-established and people that were sold on the scalability aspects of cloud computing and got onboard without accounting for service failure/availability scenarios and the ephemeral nature of EC2 instances were left burned, complaining about the unfeasibility of cloud computing.

Furthermore, even with caching LLM inference can take anywhere from 1-15s using GPT4-Turbo via the API. As was mentioned, the more characters you prefix in the context - the longer this takes. Similarly you have a variable length output from model (up to a fixed context length) and so the time it takes to calculate the “answer” can also take awhile. In particular with CoT you are basically forcing the model to use more characters than it otherwise would (in its answer) by asking it to explain itself in a verbose step by step manner.</span></p></div></td></tr>

It doesn't get stuck in loops, and it keeps trying new things until it succeeds. Devin feels like a fairly competent high school intern.</p><p>Interestingly, Devin seems better suited as an entry-level analyst than a software engineer. We've been using it internally to scrape and structure real estate listings. Their stack for web RPA and browser automation works _really_ well. And it makes sense why this is important: if you want to have a successful agent, you need to provide it with good tools. Again, it's not flawless, but it gives me hope for the future of AI agents.

We aren't yet at the stage where it makes sense to try to get an agent to code and debug complex tasks end-to-end. Trying to do this is a recipe for burning lots of tokens and spending more time and than it would take to build the thing yourself. But if you follow the 80/20 rule and get the AI to do the bulk of the work, intervening frequently to keep it on track and then polishing up the final product manually at the end, huge productivity gains are definitely in reach.

We're using AI agents for the orchestration of our fully automated web scrapers. But instead of trying to have one large general purpose agent that is hard to control and test, we use many smaller agents that basically just pick the right strategy for a specific sub-task in our workflows. In our case, an agent is a medium-sized LLM prompt that has a) context and b) a set of functions available to call.
For example we use it for:<p>- Navigation: Detect navigation elements and handle actions like pagination or infinite scroll automatically.</p><p>- Network Analysis: Identify desired data within network calls.</p><p>- Data transformation: Clean and map the data into the desired format. Finetuned small and performant LLMs are great at this task with a high reliability.</p><p>The main challenge:</p><p>We quickly realized that doing this for a few data sources with low complexity is one thing, doing it for thousands of websites in a reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient way is a whole different beast.</p><p>The integration of tightly constrained agents with traditional engineering methods effectively solved this issue for us.

The trick is figure out your long prompts ahead of time, and hardcode each one into a HTTP Request in something else (Tasker, BetterTouchTools, Alfred, Apple Shortcuts, etc). For me, I have dozens of long prompts to do exactly what I want, assigned to wakewords, hotkeys, and trigger words on my mac/watch/phone. Another key thing is I use FAST models, i.e. Groq not GPT-4. Latency makes AI too much hassle. i.e. 1. Instant (&lt;1 second end-to-end) answers in just a few words, to voice questions spoken into my watch any time I hold the side button 2. Summarize long articles and youtube videos before I decide to spend time on them 3. Add quick code snippets in plain english with hotkeys or voice 4. Get the main arguments for and against something just to frame it … stuff like that. If it would make your life easier for an AI to save you 1 second per task, why not.

I was just listening to a podcast about using an RL algorithm to enhance the plasma containment system in a fusion reactor, and the results were incredible.  It quickly learned a policy that was competitive with the existing system that had been hand built over many years at a cost of millions.  It even provided some new insights and surprises.  RL is SOTA in robotics control, and some new algorithms like Dreamer V3 can generalize in realtime without millions of samples.  It's has already grown way beyond solving ATARI games and is in many cases being used to train LLMs and other generative AI.<p>There is a good amount of research going into combining LLMs with RL for decision making, it is a powerful combination.  LLMs help with high level reasoning and goal setting, and of course provide a smooth interface for interacting with humans and with other agents.  LLMs also contain much of the collective knowledge of humanity, which is very useful for training agents to do things.  If you want to train a robot to make a sandwich it's helpful to know things, like what is a sandwich, and that it is necessary to move, get bread, etc.</p><p>These feedback loop LLM agent projects are kind of misguided IMO.  AI agents are real and useful and progressing fast, but we need to combine more tools than just LLM to build effective systems.</p><p>Personally, I am using LLMs quite effectively for ecommerce: classifying messages, drafting responses, handling simple requests like order cancellation.  All kinds of glue stuff that used to be painful is now automated and easy.  I could go on.

With aider, you collaborate with the AI on coding, asking for a sequence of bite sized changes to your code base. At each step, you can offer direction or corrections if you're unhappy with how the AI interpreted your request. If you need to, you can also just jump in and make certain code changes yourself within your normal IDE/editor.

I'll admit going in with low expectations (I know about the whole AI summer/winter cycle) and I was blown away that ChatGPT could play Jeopardy! with just a prompt since I remember being blown away by Watson and AlphaGo. But then I had it help me write a letter, and by the time I got it to do anything useful, I basically had to write an outline for it, and then I realized I had already done the hard part. I asked it to write some boilerplate code for an interface to the Slack API in Python, but it used a deprecated API, and it assumed I had a valid token. Turns out Slack has lots of different kinds of tokens and I was using the wrong one, and the AI couldn't help me figure that out. After that, I remembered the story about pain point for radiologists. They don't need help diagnosing cancer, they need help with their internet connectivity.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I then Googled the different parts to confirm that ChatGPT wasn't leading me astray.<p>If I had asked StackOverflow the same question, it would have been quickly closed as being not broadly applicable enough (since this `sed` command is quite specific to its use case).

Agents really don't have the capacity to learn from either success or failure since their internal state is fixed after training. If you ask an agent to repeatedly do some task it has a chance of failing every single time. We have been able to largely mitigate this by modeling agentic software as a state machine. At every step we have the model choose the inputs to the state machine and then we record them. We then 'compile' the resulting state-transition table down into a program that we can executed deterministically. This isn't totally fool proof since the world state can change between program runs, so we have methods that allow the LLM to make slight modifications to the program as needed. The idea here is that agents should never have to solve the same problem twice. The cool thing about this approach is that smarter models make the entire system work better. If you have a particularly complex task, you can call out to gp4-turbo or claude3-opus to map out the correct action sequence and then fall back to less complex models like mistral 7b.</p><p>The second issue is that almost all software is designed for people, not LLMs. What is intuitive for human users may not be intuitive for non-human users. We're focused on making agents reliably interact with the internet so I'll use web pages as an example. Web pages contain tons of visually encoded information in things like the layout hierarchy, images, etc. But most LLMs rely on purely text inputs. You can try exposing the underling HTML or the DOM to the model, but this doesn't work so well in practice. We get around this by treating LLMs as if they were visually impaired users. We give them a purely text interface by using ARIA trees. This interface is much more compact than either the DOM or HTML so responses come back faster and cost way less.</p><p>The third issue I see with people building agents is they go after the wrong class of problem. I meet a lot of people who want to use agents for big ticket items such as planning an entire trip + doing all the booking. The cost of a trip can run into the thousands of dollars and be a nightmare to undo if something goes wrong. You really don't want to throw agents at this kind of problem, at least not yet, because the downside to failure is so high. Users generally want expensive things to be done well and agents can't do that yet.</p><p>However there are a ton of things I would like someone to do for me that would cost less than five dollars of someones time and the stakes for things going wrong are low. My go to example is making reservations. I really don't want to spend the time sorting through the hundreds of nearby restaurants. I just want to give something the general parameters of what I'm looking for and have reservations show up in my inbox. These are the kinds of tasks that agents are going to accelerate.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/hdresearch/hdr-browser">https://github.com/hdresearch/hdr-browser</a>

These are every possible product too: physical products, virtual products like software or music, and experience products like travel or education. Between the owner’s manuals and the support forums for these products there is extremely deep knowledge about the purpose, use and troubleshooting of these products.</p><p>Third, one cannot just ask an LLM direct deep questions about some random product and expect a deep knowledge answer. One has to first create the context within the LLM that activates the area(s) of deep knowledge you want your answers to arise. This requires the use of long form prompts that create the expert you want, and once that expert is active in the LLM’s context, then you ask it questions and receive the deep knowledge answers desired.</p><p>Fourth, one can create an LLM agent that helps a person create the LLM agent they want, the LLM agent can help generate new agents, and dependency chains between different agents are not difficult at all, including information exchange between groups of agents collaborating on shared replies to requests.</p><p>And last, all that deep information about using pretty much every software there is can be tapped with careful prompting to create the context of an expert user of that software, and experts such as these can become plugins and drivers for that software.

I think there's promise to build a competent agent for this kind of use case.

Where do these papers diverge in their conclusions? 
Please translate this passage into plain English.</p><p>I haven't done this myself, but I have a hard time imagining such an agent being useless. Perhaps this is a failure of imagination on my part.</p><p>The brightest spot in my experimentation is [Cursor](<a href="https://cursor.sh/" rel="nofollow">https://cursor.sh</a>). It's good for little dev tasks like refactoring a small block of code and chatting about how to use vim.

They magnify the power of somebody that's already curious and driven. They still empower lazy, disengaged users, but with goals like doing the bare minimum, and avoiding work altogether, these tools cannot help one accomplish much of use.

<p><strong><code>TL;DR</code></strong> We made a GPT interface to an open-source US tax scenarios library,
and it is at times pretty good, but asks a lot of the user.</p>
<hr>
<p>Apparently this blog will be about working out implications of observations by
Andrej Karpathy. This time we’re thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g&amp;t=2552s">his
comment</a> that LLMs may come
to be thought of as a kind of higher-order operating system: not omnicapable
themselves, but rather the glue that links together other components, such as
data stores, domain-specific libraries and user interfaces. Cam Pedersen wrote a
nice <a href="https://campedersen.com/llm-os/">post</a> spelling out the ideas more fully.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to build some concrete data product to explore this
LLM-as-OS idea, and contrast it with the existing state of the art. The idea: a
ways back I’d written a python library called
<a href="https://github.com/mmacpherson/tenforty"><code>tenforty</code></a>, that in turn uses a
wonderful open source package called <a href="https://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/">Open Tax
Solver</a>, to explore some tax scenarios
we were dealing with. I’d never written it up, and thought someday I’d make a
webapp from it to share. This seemed like a nice opportunity to try building
something as a newfangled LLM-OS app: an AI tax advisor.</p>
<p><code>tenforty</code> turns tax form calculations into python function calls, which makes
it easy to evaluate one return, or many hypothetical returns. This latter
<em>what-if</em> aspect was the main itch I was aiming to scratch with the library:
What if we sold this stock over two years rather than one? What would happen to
our tax bracket if we maxed out our 401Ks? To answer questions like this in
TurboTax felt Sisyphean; write down tax amount, back-back-back, tweak input,
forward-forward-forward, write down tax amount…<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (There’s more about
<code>tenforty</code> <em>per se</em> in an <a href="#appendix-about-tenforty">appendix</a>.)</p>
<p>Before LLMs appeared, to build a webapp for these what-ifs, I might have
researched common tax scenarios beyond our own that <code>tenforty</code> could help with,
and built a kind of calculator app to anticipate those cases, perhaps like

<p>In 2024, if we let the LLM be the UX, then building the app becomes less, and
different, work. In some sense the user will just bring their own scenario, and
the app doesn’t need to anticipate it. These were the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a tiny web service that exposes the main functions from <code>tenforty</code> as
endpoints. We used <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>.</li>
<li>Configure the custom GPT on OpenAI:
<ul>
<li>Come up with a name: <em>Tax Driver</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Write the GPT’s prompt. We link a copy of it <a href="https://finedataproducts.com/posts/2024-03-10-tax-scenarios-with-ai/tax-driver-gpt-prompt.txt">here</a>.</li>
<li>Configure a GPT “Action” that provides the details of the endpoints. Since
FastAPI autogenerates OpenAPI specifications
(<a href="https://tax-server.finedataproducts.com/openapi.json">ref</a>), this was
mainly pasting in that spec.</li>
<li>Write a few example prompts to illustrate the kinds of things it can do.</li>
<li>(Revise the GPT prompt to address unexpected behavior… 🤦🏼‍♂️)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a paid ChatGPT+ account you can try out Tax Driver <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-jkF9Et8tT-tax-driver">right
here</a>.  The privacy policy is
linked from the GPT, and also
<a href="https://tax-server.finedataproducts.com/privacy">here</a>; the upshot is that the
backing web service is set up as a pure calculator, and logs only which endpoint
was called, and when it was called by OpenAI’s servers. Note that independently
of ChatGPT+, you can also play with <code>tenforty</code> directly using the included

notebook</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-we-learn">What Did We Learn?</h2>
<p>Tax Driver does a bunch of things well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From minimal input, as in the example screenshot here, it reliably defers to
the Action to evaluate the scenario. We’ve gotten used to GPT-4’s
natural-language abilities over the past year or so, but they really are
stunning. (<em>Note: images enlarge if clicked/tapped.</em>)</p>

  </a>
  

</li>
<li>
<p>It is game to at least try to evaluate essentially any tax scenario you might
find yourself faced with, combining its knowledge base with the specific
calculations enabled by <code>tenforty</code>. I would never have been able to match that
breadth with a set of canned scenario calculators. Here’s another example
that’s gone reasonably well, if one thinks of AMT as “the excess tax over the
regular tax due to the AMT calculation” as it’s sometimes <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp">discussed
informally</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>It can produce tables/graphics that summarize the results well:</li>

 </a>
 

<ul>
<li>
<p>If asked, it will reliably produce apt python code using <code>tenforty</code> that you
can drop into a notebook and take from there.</p>

  </a>
  

</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those capabilities are simply from the future, and some might have been
achievable by me or a team, only with much more work. And building this “app”
took a tiny fraction of the time it would have taken me to build its pre-LLM
analog.</p>
<p>But it can also be frustrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can just miss the point of a given scenario request, in that cheerfully
confident way GPT-4 has, like a politician not-answering a question at a town
hall. In this example, we’ve asked for it to look at the tax burden if
everything was exercised in one year vs spread out over two or three years,
and Tax Driver misses the mark widely:</p>

  </a>
  

</li>
<li>
<p>It has a set of specific instructions to follow from its prompt, and it often
follows them, but also sometimes defies them, especially those having to do
with figure generation. For example, here’s a case in which we’ve explicitly
asked for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_chart">shaded area chart</a>, in
addition to the instruction to prefer shaded area charts for plots like this
in its <a href="https://finedataproducts.com/posts/2024-03-10-tax-scenarios-with-ai/tax-driver-gpt-prompt.txt">prompt</a>, and it claims
that it’s drawn one, but hasn’t:</p>

  </a>
  

</li>
<li>
<p>It can be erratic. Run the same prompt twice, and once you will get reasonable
output, and the second time it will fail to successfully run an Action or
process the Action’s results. <em>No example shown.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It occasionally mixes up the Action calls, i.e. web requests, with python
calls to <code>tenforty</code>. <em>No example shown–the output is generated python code,
when it “should” have called out to the Action and done something with the
response.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are familiar to us by now. This lack of meta-cognition is a
big reason why this first generation of LLM-based products – ChatGPT, Stable
Diffusion, GitHub Copilot – are expressed as copilots, as opposed to say
autonomous assistants that can be relied upon to perform a task correctly. We
encountered the same issue in our <a href="https://finedataproducts.com/posts/2023-12-31-llm-based-metaanalysis/">previous
post</a>
about doing scientific literature meta-analysis with LLMs.</p>
<p>More broadly, as easy as it is to create this app, the universal chat interface
is the proverbial jack of all trades, master of none. It places a lot of the
burden on the user to know what they want, write out their requests carefully,
and exercise care in interpreting the results and iterating upon them. Simon
Willison made a connected point in a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/mOzxhcc1I8A?t=1108">podcast with
Outerbounds</a>: the generic chat interface
leaves much to be desired in terms of discoverability, and runs a high risk of
scaring off non-enthusiast prospective users.</p>
<p>The upshot: Tax Driver is a capable if mercurial assistant. At least playing
with our own actual tax scenarios, with a little patience and some coaching, it
produced solid analyses. I found it particularly helpful to ask it to generate
<code>tenforty</code> code that I could play with myself at the end of one of these chats.
That seems useful, compared to having to do that all oneself, but it requires a
fairly tolerant user, and is less surefooted that one ideally would hope for
from a tax advisor.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-about-tenforty">Appendix: About <code>tenforty</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/">Open Tax Solver</a> (OTS), the package
that <code>tenforty</code> relies on, is one of these gems of the internet. The OTS team
has published their software for more than twenty consecutive years now. It
provides implementations of the US 1040 form calculations, and the forms for
many states, including California and New York.</p>
<p>You can prepare your tax return either using OTS’ provided GUI, or via a simple
text file format. In either case, OTS outputs the resulting return to another
text file, and can insert the output into the official tax form PDFs. It’s thus
a DIY, open source TurboTax that improves upon doing the calculations by hand.
Very cool.</p>
<p><code>tenforty</code> works by amalgamating the C language source code from OTS releases
into a single big source file, and then wrapping that source file as a cython
extension. Because OTS is fundamentally designed around reading and writing text
files (that contain tax return information), <code>tenforty</code> actually writes and
reads back text files in temporary directories behind the scenes, although only
python dicts and pandas dataframes are presented to the library user.</p>
<p>OTS’s text-file interface works in terms of tax line numbers, e.g. W-2 income
gets reported on Line 1 of the US 1040. Since only accountants and the very
determined will know the line numbers, OTS annotates them with their natural
names like “W-2 Income” in their GUI. To solve the same problem, I added a
higher-level interface to <code>tenforty</code>, that offers natural names for the familiar
tax-form quantities, e.g. <code>w2_income</code>. All available options are listed out in
the repo’s
<a href="https://github.com/mmacpherson/tenforty/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.</p>
<p>This higher-level interface will be limiting for some, because I only did the
fairly common quantities. For example, if you’ve got a small business, there
will be some missing inputs. There are two ways around this:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s a lower-level interface in <code>tenforty</code> as it stands, where you can
provide any of the line-level inputs as a python dictionary, the return will
be evaluated, and you’ll get back a dictionary with all the line-level
outputs.</li>
<li><code>tenforty</code> is open-source, and people are encouraged to contribute PRs with
their improvements.</li>
</ol>
<p>The document
<a href="https://github.com/mmacpherson/tenforty/blob/main/DEVELOP.md"><code>DEVELOP.md</code></a>
goes into more detail about how the package works.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Even though OTS goes back to the Bush II administration, I have only included
from 2017 through 2023 tax years into <code>tenforty</code>, and I’ve only wrapped up
California (where we live), Massachusetts, and New York, although OTS supports
more states. More years/states/etc. can be added by PR.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>There are some basic unit tests in place, and then some property-based tests
using the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a> library, that exercise
<code>tenforty</code>/OTS by generating a wide variety of inputs and checking that certain
properties hold, e.g. “If your W-2 income goes up, and nothing else changes,
your total tax must always be the same or higher.”</p>
<p>I further verified that our own externally-prepared returns from the past few
years give the same answers through <code>tenforty</code>. Not a big $n$, but in principle
a larger test set of reference return calculations might be built up.</p>
<p>This is to say, there’s a good-faith effort to test the package, but the testing
game could certainly be improved. PRs welcome. :)</p>

                        <h2>No newsletter next week</h2>
<p>Running the TLA+ workshop. No way I'm gonna have any brainpower after that.</p>
<h2>Syntax highlighting is a waste of an information channel</h2>
<p>No, not a waste <em>in general</em>. Syntax highlighting is quite useful. I'm saying it's a waste <em>of an information channel</em>. Here's a quick demonstration of what I mean. Here's 399 squares and one circle. Where's the circle?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/7757f208-c0e1-491e-98b5-38a45622b114.png"></p>
<p>Round two. Where's the circle?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/c8939cab-166a-45db-90e8-19f32ae0f917.png"> </p>
<p>Color carries a <em>huge</em> amount of information. Color draws our attention. Color distinguishes things. And we just use it to distinguish syntax.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with distinguishing syntax. It's the "just" that bothers me. Highlighting syntax is not always the most important thing to us. The information we want from code depends on what we're trying to do. I'm interesting in different things if I'm writing greenfield code vs optimizing code vs debugging code vs doing a code review. I should be able to swap different highlighting rules in and out depending on what I need. I should be able to combine different rules into task-level overlays that I can toggle on and off.</p>
<p>I've listed some examples of what we could do with this. If this is something that already exists I included a link. Otherwise I included a mockup. Some of the examples have implementation issues beyond what I discussed; they're just demonstrations of what highlighting <em>could</em> be. All examples are Pythonish unless otherwise noted.</p>
<h3>Some Use Cases</h3>
<h4>Rainbow parenthesis</h4>
<p>This is a pretty common one. We can use different colors to mark how nested a set of parenthesis are. From <a href="https://github.com/luochen1990/rainbow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/67904707-1815-468b-9814-ffaf2ae87b16.png"> </p>
<h4>Context Highlighting</h4>
<p>Highlight different levels of nesting. From <a href="https://www.crockford.com/contextcoloring.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/0a9964b7-caba-4e0d-a91c-ef0859d93081.png"> </p>
<h4>Import highlighting</h4>
<p>Highlight identifiers imported from a different file.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/33640b17-f69d-4b29-8682-e52ca4a8e673.png"> 
Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight imported functions and classes differently</li>
<li>Highlight qualified imports</li>
<li>Highlight imports from particular trees</li>
</ul>
<h4>Argument Highlighting</h4>
<p>Arguments passed into the function are highlighted differently from local variables or global identifiers.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/beaac37c-6898-455e-a38d-bcb9cfc57703.png"><br>
Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carry it through to aliases (if we assign the argument to another value, highlight that too)</li>
<li>Highlight local variables only</li>
<li>Highlight values that <em>will</em> be assigned to something</li>
<li>Highlight variables used in loops</li>
</ul>
<h4>Type Highlighting</h4>
<p>Highlight all list variables and integer variables with different colors.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/b32bc94c-f95b-4daa-8d93-e662ecb10564.png"> </p>
<p>Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight all iterables</li>
<li>Highlight all functions returning option types</li>
<li>Highlight all variables that could be one of two types</li>
<li>Highlight all polymorphic types parameterized to integers</li>
</ul>
<h4>Exception Highlighting</h4>
<p>Highlight functions that raise errors not caught in their body. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/fc07fd5e-48d3-4fbe-8d3a-9e0b20fb8f3d.png"> </p>
<p>Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight all functions with try blocks</li>
<li>Highlight functions that raise user-defined exceptions</li>
<li>Highlight functions that raise a specific exception</li>
<li>Highlight functions that <em>catch</em> a specific exception</li>
</ul>
<h4>Metadata Highlighting</h4>
<p>Highlight functions that were directly called in the bodies of tests that failed in the last test run.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/f428e128-7cb2-44d0-8dc0-90f2bb33eee9.png"> </p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight functions without precondition decorators</li>
<li>Highlight functions that are part of a certain stacktrace</li>
<li>Highlight functions which are defined in our branch but not the master branch</li>
</ul>
<h4>Random other ideas I didn't mock up</h4>
<ul>
<li>All functions that transitively call functions that make an http call</li>
<li>All variable identifiers we assign to twice</li>
<li>All classes with more than 10 user-defined methods</li>
<li>All functions more than 100 lines long</li>
<li>All functions without docstrings</li>
<li>All lines last edited by a particular member of the team</li>
<li>All identifiers marked "deprecated" in a certain design document</li>
<li>All functions with a <code># TODO</code> comment inside them</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>Why aren't things this way? There's both essential and coincidental challenges that make fully leveraging color a lot harder than just having syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>First is actually implementing rules. Some of these require access to the code's AST, some require broader knowledge of the project, some require runtime information. Some of the ideas are even infeasible; accurately tracking aliasing is an open problem for most languages. Syntax highlighting, by contrast, is usually a matter of regexes and hierarchical state machines. That's how <a href="https://pygments.org/" target="_blank">pygments</a> does it. Semantic highlighting would have to be made from scratch for each language.</p>
<p>Second is highlighting conflicts. What if something needs to be colored two things for two different reasons? In syntax highlighting this is less of a problem because you have an ordered list of matchers. But with semantic highlighting we might have dynamic priorities, where rule A is more important to us now while rule B is more important to us later. Things get even more complicated if we have multiple distinct overlays, which themselves can have priority conflicts. Semantic highlighting would need a much more complex design and implementation than simple syntax highlighting does, and adding overlays makes it even more complicated.</p>
<p>Finally, existing editors just aren't well set up to handle this. Vim's syntax highlighting is a mess of regular expressions and special cases. VSCode and (I believe) Atom use <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars" target="_blank">TextMate grammars</a>, which assume a single canonical tokenization per file. VSCode recently added <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide" target="_blank">semantic highlighting</a> but it seems more oriented to augment the existing syntax highlighting, not radically rethink it. I have no idea what Emacs does.</p>
<p>So I think this is something we'll <em>eventually</em> have, because the potential advantages are too great to ignore forever. But it will take us a long time to get there. Maybe we'll see it first with toy languages where the AST is simple enough and the expressiveness is low enough to make semantic highlighting easy.</p>

<p>Hey, I feel like I'm at a big crossroads and this is an important blog post, but you probably already guessed that from the title.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to think about it. It still takes up all my brain bandwidth at the moment. But now that I have a clearer picture, I think it's time to share it with you.</p>
<h2>The end of Pepper&amp;Carrot</h2>
<p>I am planning to finish the Pepper &amp; Carrot series relatively soon. But this change will <strong>not happen tomorrow or next month</strong>, I still have four more episodes to release before I get to my planned "~The End~". And as you know, it may take a while, especially since the episodes will be difficult to write and draw. </p>
<p>So why tell you about it now? Because it may affect many of my decisions about the project, and I wanted every contributor, supporter, and reader to be informed about this new goal. It might give a more understandable perspective to actions I'll take and things I'll write. Also, I can't keep this project to myself forever.  :-)</p>
<p>I never liked it when a series 'goes on forever' and Pepper&amp;Carrot will be 10 years old in May. It made me think a lot. I also always had a special admiration for authors who <em>knew</em> when to end their series.</p>
<p>I also want to write an ending while the project is still alive. I don't want to end this project when it starts to decline or is on the verge of being forgotten. The numbers are still good: more and more readers, supporters and all metrics are still progressing on all channels. <strong>Thank you for that</strong>. I can't tell you how grateful I am for the success you've made out of Pepper&amp;Carrot, with all its spin-offs, the community, the contributors and everything else.</p>
<p>I'm counting on you to stick around until I finish the series, because I want to finish it well, and I'm already putting a lot of energy into writing an ending that I hope you'll like.</p>
<p>For this massive new quest, <strong>I am asking for your support</strong>. Most of my donation platforms (especially Patreon, Tippee) are set to trigger a payment "when the episode is released" and not "monthly". An extra budget to help me release the next four episodes will be welcome (I plan to end with episode 42 and finish with an ultimate 'book 5'). You can find the multiple ways to <a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com/static3/become-my-patron">patron me on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks if you can take part in this ending, and of course thanks if you took part in the previous episodes! </p>
<p>Also, I wanted to tell you that I'm going to keep drawing Pepper and Carrot in a way, because... </p>
<p>🥁 <em>(... drum roll)</em></p>
<h2>Introducing: Mini Fantasy Theater</h2>
<p>I couldn't talk about the end of Pepper&amp;Carrot without telling you what comes next. And that's been the <strong>hardest part</strong> of the last month for me: re-evaluating everything I've done over the last 10 years, learning about it, and <strong>building a confident vision</strong> of where I'm going next.</p>
<p>I'm planning a webcomic project called "Mini Fantasy Theater" (MFT for short).</p>
<p>This project will have a lot in common with Pepper&amp;Carrot and will be built on the same basic core values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made only with Free Libre and Open Source Software</li>
<li>Released under a Libre Culture license</li>
<li>Open Source: layered source files available</li>
<li>No paywalls, no advertising</li>
<li>Made for the web first</li>
<li>Supported by the community.</li>
<li>Share knowledge and tools: Making of, tutorials, scripts and brushes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You already know two characters from the MFT lore: a young witch and her cat. Because the MFT project was simply the project at the root of Pepper&amp;Carrot. But by the time I drew the first pilot, the first two characters of my first strip had become a success, and I just decided to carry on with them. I wrote a few lines about it in the first pages of the Pepper&amp;Carrot artbook.</p>
<p>The format for the MFT project: short comic strips, humorous, fantasy, following a small (possibly recurring) cast of characters in the world of Hereva (the same world as Pepper&amp;Carrot). It will evolve depending on how the strip works, with your feedback. Of course, Pepper the young witch and her cat Carrot will be part of the characters.</p>
<p>So don't be surprised if you see more experiments, worldbuilding, character designs and tests coming as I write the end of Pepper&amp;Carrot. I already reserved the domain <a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com/minifantasytheater/">https://www.minifantasytheater.com</a> .</p>
<p>It's also a challenge to start a new art project in this era of unethical AI art, pay to win social media, algorithms with cryptic rules that serve the interests of their platforms, search engines that only return commercial partnerships and AI pollution. But now I'm confident that I will find a way and bring interesting answers to the table.</p>
<p>That's it, and I'm very curious to see how you react to this. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments!</p>              </div>

Here’s a breakdown for you:</span></p><p><span>Central to this process are the cortical columns, functional units within the cerebral cortex that orchestrate your perception of the world. </span></p><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/eea80b9e-89e2-4bfe-9eed-089167675879/8134d6d4-d4f8-44e8-bc9c-e66eb18f8cb3_3924x4007.png?t=1707856021"></p></div><p><span>These columns evaluate sensory information against your brain's existing models, determining "True" or "False" signals to guide your reactions and beliefs. </span></p><p><span>To put this even simpler, They work like little decision-makers in the outer layer of the brain, sorting through what we see and feel. </span></p><p><span>They check this information against what the brain already knows, deciding if it matches ("True") or doesn't match ("False").

Because processing familiar information requires less energy than assimilating new data. </p><p> This is precisely why staying in your comfort zones feels so... comfortable. </p><p> It's not just inertia; it's a battle against a highly efficient computer in your head, always seeking stability over the chaos of change. </p><p> Your gut might scream for a shift, but you’re up against your brain's design, which chooses energy conservation over everything else. </p><p id="2-the-mannequin-misidentification-a"><h3><span><b>2.

Let’s just get through it with as many distractions as possible.”</i></p><p> Nothing seems to make you feel alive. You are just in automation mode. </p><p> Activities that used to hold your attention don’t mean anything anymore. </p><p id="5-breaking-through-with-challenging"><h3><b>5. Breaking Through with Challenging Thoughts</b></h3></p><p><span>Now that you recognize the signs of "brain automation," the next step isn't just about what you do; it's about how you think.</span></p><p><span>Changing your actions without changing your thoughts is like repainting your car when it needs a new engine. Sure, it will look good on the outside, it still won’t run though.</span></p><p><span>So do this: </span><span><b>Ask why, and don’t judge</b></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>“Why” is such a short but powerful question that can almost always be used successively until the truth is met:</span></p><p><span>“</span><span><i>I feel stuck in my career? Why?</i></span></p><p><span>…</span><span><i>Because I don’t like what I do. Why?</i></span></p><p><span><i>...Because it doesn't challenge me or align with my values. Why?</i></span></p><p><span><i>…Because I settled into a role that was available rather than pursuing what genuinely interests me. Why?</i></span></p><p><span><i>…Because I fear the uncertainty of change and the possibility of failure. Why?</i></span></p><p><span><i>…Because past experiences have conditioned me to prioritize security over fulfillment. Why?</i></span></p><p><span><i>…Because I internalized the belief that success is defined by stability rather than personal satisfaction and growth.”</i></span></p><p><span>Take this and keep asking the same question. You’ll get to the root of it soon enough. </span></p><p><span>In this instance, your feeling of being stuck is less about the external circumstances and more about internal barriers—fears, beliefs, and assumptions that keep you tethered to the familiar, however unsatisfying it may be.</span></p><p id="6-no-but-really-how-do-i-get-unstuc"><h3><span><b>6.

    <blockquote>
  <p>a.k.a. Richard Hamming vs. Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<p>–</p>

<p>I am going to graduate my phd soon. I’ve been talking to some prospective students recently, and a common question that comes up is: what makes a good phd student? how to be a good researcher?</p>

<p>I’d point them to some <a href="https://huiwenn.github.io/readings">articles</a>, but to be honest I have no idea. What I did spend a lot of time thinking about, and have arrived at a somewhat self-convincing answer, is to a slightly different question - what makes a happy phd student?</p>

<p>The answer is that they are married.</p>

<p>(Obviously this is a joke. We did once survey a 10-phd bbq party, and marriage was the most statistically significant positive correlator. But that’s a story for another time.)</p>

<p>Richard Hamming’s inspiring and influential talk <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">You and Your Research</a> is what convinced me to do a phd. I wanted to work on important problems and aspired to contribute to the advancement of human knowledge. Oh, to be a scientist! 3 years in I felt like there was no hope; I’ve toiled away all my time and the only way out is to quit.</p>

<p>So I sought advice from my parents. They asked me to think about the least accomplished PhD graduate I know - Can I do as much as they did? What would a minimum effort phd look like? I answered that would result in a pretty bad thesis. And they said, that’s fine, bad is ok, go do what you can. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48132/failing-and-flying">Anything worth doing is worth doing badly.</a></p>

<p>And here we are.</p>

<p>This line of reason was put into words a lot more elegantly by Richard Feynman. Allow me to quote his letter in its entirety here - I thought it was the perfect antidote to Hamming-esque anxieties, the Dionysus to our Apollo. Enjoy, and hope you will finish your phd with peacefulness in your heart as well.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Dear Koichi,</p>

<p>I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. <strong>The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some way for us to make some headway into it.</strong> I would advise you to take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.</p>

<p>You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be concerned with problems close to the gods. But at the same time I had another Ph.D. Student (Albert Hibbs) was on how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own; and left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this letter to correct it a little.</p>

<p>I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed. For example, experiments on the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces, to try to learn something about how friction worked (failure). Or, how elastic properties of crystals depends on the forces between the atoms in them, or how to make electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the reflection of electromagnetic waves from films coating glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of child’s toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several years on it without success). Plus all the “grander” problems of quantum theory.</p>

<p>No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.</p>

<p>You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. now your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.</p>

<p>Best of luck and happiness.</p>

<p>Sincerely, Richard P. Feynman.</p>

Well, there was none and there is none - let's face it. However some stayed on Lemmys of the world and many (No, I don't have empirical statistics on these) returned but yet didn't really return. Many returnees have a quasi-zombie-like presence on reddit now (I am one example). I barely participate and if I do it's a quip or two couple of times a month. Basically, for some reason, I just don't give two shits about the "community" aspect of Reddit anymore. No, it's not anger. Something just went missing.</p><p>I was regular at and still visit two largest of the country and city subreddits (and few more) and the decrease of quality and engagement is palpable there. If nothing - the lull and uncertainty decreased the engagement and greatly degraded the experience of being there.</p><p>Many smaller and mid sized niche subs are just gone. Either made private permanently or are left abandoned with rules in place that makes engagement impossible. Reddit can take over and force the mods out but the engagement is not coming back. Remember these places were built from before Instagram and apparently mainstream Twitter generation. I doubt that is going to happen again. It was from another time and populated by a generation that didn't mind writing long texts and finding great content and sharing without an expectation of "influencer" status and income, among other things.</p><p>Having said that, I was shocked to see some of the Lemmy instances to be really active like small flourishing islands. Check some book/book review related for example if you are interested. A friend had sent me the link once - it was some "cafe", I can't recall; there might be more. I have no interest in those instances so I never joined.</p><p>tl;dr: people who cared - a lot of them - left. I think that matters.

Also, it's become so obvious that submissions and comments are being manipulated and pushed by tons of bots and industry interests, it's just a bad joke at this point.<p>Very true. Over the last few months as more bots and reposters come online you have seen the subreddits bleed back into related subreddits. Most of the posts on /r/popular (landing point for navigating to old.reddit.com when not logged in) come from subs that never appeared before last summer's mod rebellion about 3rd party apps. Subs like /r/AITAH, /r/SipsTea, /r/TikTokCringe, and several others hit /r/popular regularly.</p><p>/r/news will see stories that are functionally dead with no comment activity hang around for multiple days. The sad fact that the mods for the sub require you to have an email associated with your account keeps me from adding any content there since I don't give that out.</p><p>A lot of content that rightfully belongs in one sub is cross-posted to related subs for additional karma. /r/pics is one targeted sub that catches a lot of content that normally one would only find on /r/oldschoolcool.</p><p>It's almost like reddit is returning to the pre-subreddit days where there were no boundaries on the content that one would see on the main, and only, page as it updated. Memes, rick-rolls, news, questions, etc all just fell into line and as the site grew, faded quickly into the mist.</p><p>With all this in mind I have been cutting way back on my engagement. I have walked back through my post history and edited a bunch of them, using Yossarian's censoring rules - death to all adverbs, nouns, verbs, adjectives - or just replacing the posts with meme text or song lyrics to stupid songs.</p><p>If the post involved answering a question commonly encountered on the sub, one that would be easily discovered if reddit had a high-functioning search functionality, then for the most part, I leave it in place. Most subs I interact with are DIY type subs for automobiles, home projects, etc. and there are problems common to some models of car, truck, etc that people always ask about so removing that content seems wrong.</p><p>It is sad to see a tool like reddit become such an enormous pile of suck but I think it was inevitable.

How is this vandalization? This is user control, the same level of control granted on a site that was built for users to post on and discuss any subject - free speech was a keystone principle until some bad actors couldn't stop posting trash and ended up rightly banned.<p>Millions, maybe billions of comments are digital dust at this point. Like thoughts lost just before they made it past the tip of your tongue. This is normal and expected behavior. Conversations get lost in the fog.</p><p>Reddit isn't a Banksy. Today, it's more like the monkey area of the zoo in spots with each monkey's hand ready to sling the shit. When you consider the huge number of bots on the site it is likely worse than that.</p><p>Originally /u/spez and /u/n0thing set a standard where a poster who dropped a reply containing information that didn't fit the established narrative and tried framing it as an accurate answer was asked to post the references that supported their conclusion. It was "tits or get the fuck out" days. That by itself promoted healthy discussions and worked to disseminate accurate information on important topics. It helped establish a cadre of users who are outstanding in their fields and who enjoy sharing their expertise with others.</p><p>In time, especially after Digg imploded themselves, the expansion of subreddits made it untenable for proper moderation so a lot of boogers were allowed out of the nostrils and while the quality of discussions in general on the site was still good, many subreddits were established where people could say anything with no one calling them out. It sideloaded all the horseshit that used to hit the front (and only) page of reddit to the subs - stuff like goatse, nsfw content, etc. In the earliest incarnation reddit's front page was a minefield of stuff you really needed to avoid if you wanted to surf online and still keep your job. Early users learned fast to read the comments before opening the post.</p><p>I'm having a hard time understanding how a feature - user control of content they post - is mislabeled in your reply as vandalism when the user elects to employ that feature in managing their content.

Like I mentioned, all the content that I have ever posted is likely to be indexed in someone's archive somewhere whether reddit controls that archive or not. There are too many players in that space and they have been active for years with publicly available tools to manage all the grunt work for anyone who wanted to download it all and slog through it looking for gems.</p><p>If they find one of my edited posts that has a suspicious amount of worthless updoot karma and that post is totally out of context then I am sure they are bright enough to figure out that they will need to get that content somewhere else.</p><p>I left untouched all of my old "Best of Reddit" and the gilded posts since those had above average value to the readers who chose to engage and updoot.</p><p>At the end of the day, the content has always been mine to edit or delete. That is the way that the site was designed to function so labeling anything I do as vandalism, trolling, or juvenile behavior only works to make you look like someone trying hard to understand how to value your investment in reddit in the event that others choose to act similarly.</p><p>As I mentioned somewhere else, reddit could change all of this if they instituted controls that would allow live users to instantly recognize bots and adverts so that users can instantly choose to read a post or comment or to ignore it. The fact that they embraced and actively ignore the bot armies, the shills for various products or philosophies, the blatant adverts, etc tells me and others that they have lost touch with their users.</p><p>As it is, forcing me to check karma levels and username age to hope to recognize reposters and bots is just wrong. Clear and ban the bots, ID the adverts, add a shill warning to those who evangelize or push agendas or misinformation, and the traffic finds a floor.</p><p>On that floor reddit will find those loyal, long-term users like myself a lot more likely to engage. Clean the house and make it more livable and others will move in to see what's up. Sunshine is the best disinfectant here. Otherwise people like myself will choose whether to continue to engage with reddit and set their own terms of engagement.

A lot of that content required significant time for me to locate links, photos, etc to be able to provide accurate answers to a question or, as many of my posts attempt, to correct an inaccurate answer that seems to be getting a lot of traction in the post.</p><p>The content that I post is mine, the aggregation platform is theirs. I post with the understanding that it becomes as public as the sub allows and that I have the ability to edit as I feel appropriate.</p><p>Reddit is a platform for aggregating news and information on a huge variety of subjects but the content belongs to the users. Reddit felt like they needed to monetize things and the only thing they have that has any value is the user content and user ID info. I have never provided any ID info so they are stuck with an IP address for me. I'm okay with that.</p><p>They have had ample opportunity to crawl all of my posts over the years, archive them as they see fit, and repost them later as long as I get acknowledged as the OP. They have backups. Many others have used publicly available tools to crawl the site and index user content. It is safe to say that nothing that I have ever posted has disappeared. It is available in someone's archive somewhere. I'm okay with that because I can't change that now.</p><p>When I post today, I monitor the thread activity and when it dies I edit my post unless it fits the criteria that I honor - the post references a situation where someone needed information about a common issue with a vehicle or other product that I have a lot of experience with. For example if someone just bought a 15 year old vehicle and suddenly they encounter an issue that is well-known to everyone else who has ever owned that model then I post a clear answer with photos if needed to help them solve the problem. People like this tend to be unable to afford newer vehicles and problems like this can be expensive to fix if they go to a shop when they are really simple to fix with ordinary tools. I give a description of the process to repair it so they can get on their way and not have their "new-to-me" car break down and cost them a job. Most of my posts are reposts of content posted several times over the years such that I just grab the text from my local folder and the associated photos and let if fly again.</p><p>This is necessary on reddit because their search function is intentionally broken so that old useful posts can be hard to find. This encourages people to make new posts solving old problems and drives traffic to reddit. It's a dick move on reddit's part but I accepted that years ago.</p><p>The absence of permalinks on many subs also fuels this repost bullshit. Few subs have permalinks to popular questions or FAQs on the sub, therefore you see a lot of repetition in subject matter of the posts. Reddit subs are less of an information site than they are an activity site. Reddit needs a certain amount of traffic on a sub for it to be a useful place to post so search is crippled, permalinks are largely absent, etc.</p><p>The content I post on reddit is mine. I will do with it as I please. If you wanna see everything I have ever posted in its original form you need to use one  of those crawler tools before I edit.

It's really not my problem to solve. I add content. Some of that content has value.</p><p>They have lots of gifted supporters in the Y-Combinator family who could think of lots of ways to monetize things and I don't worry about how they end up doing it until it reaches the point where it is not possible to trust that you are interacting with a thread posted by a live person or one that is a repost from a bot farm.</p><p>Reddit is over-run with bots now and the average user has no way to know which users are live humans versus bots used to drive traffic. I've always been a "don't piss down my neck and tell me it's raining" type of person. Credibility is key. Reddit needs a way for ordinary users who would like to contribute content - free or paid, I don't care - to recognize bots and other artificial traffic like paid adverts or sponsored posts. Camouflaging users wastes my time when I need to look at post history to decide whether they are real or just karma farming.</p><p>In the end I agree with the part about dying if this is the only path for reddit. All good things come to an end. That's why corporations can live forever.

Also, while the old place might have a greater variety of people (good and bad), the new place is often filled with many people who were angry about the old place (maybe mostly "good", but makes a lot of angry posts).<p>So now, people who are at this newer, possibly better, but quieter and angrier place, they have to wonder if they made a good move.  Sometimes, with enough patience, the new place do eventually turned out to be just as great.  But usually my observation is that people just give up and leave, possibly returning to the old (still popular) place.

So far it hasn’t really been a community I want to get invested in. Not to mention the comments on posts are littered with completely unrelated posts.

My account started getting restricted when I stated the idea that Tor and similar software being used to undermine foreign governments and the works of many tech companies in this area is wrong, that democracy works for us but the "manifest destiny" approach of forcing democracy on others amounted to neo-colonialism.</p><p>If my views are wrong and unpopular, the downvote/karma system takes care of that. What's wrong today is, moderators and algorithms are herding us into tribal camps. People have forgotten how to passionately disagree with others without hating them or excommunicating them. We are being excommunicated from each other for the crime of thinking for ourselves.

common sense and etiquette rules in social atmospheres.</p><p>you mention “how can we talk to and convince people on controversial topics?” (again, i want to stress that i hope i don't come across as dismissive of your concerns, but…) you don’t need to convince random strangers to believe controversial topics. you don’t need to. and we need to understand, when people do this, they come across as zealots.  take the real world again as an example: if random strangers approach you and start chirping controversial x, y, or z subjects,  thats weird...  people will treat that as weird. they will cross the street to get away from zealots who do this.  if you’re on a site and it seems like people are metaphorically crossing the street to get away from you, ask yourself how you might appear if you approach a random stranger in the real world and strongly start talking about weird controversial shit? would they look at you sideways and slowly back away? would they maybe come up with excuses to leave the conversation? common sense and etiquette rules. be normal. you don’t need to “convince” random strangers to save democracy.  most people find randoms bringing up controversial topics to be creepy and weird.</p><p>we’re people, we’re not random usernames you need to “save” or “convince” of anything. especially controversial shit.  just like in the real world, remember, sometimes people are open to a <i>conversation</i>--i want to stress <i>a conversation</i>, not a debate--sometimes they're open to one, but more often people just aren't interested. there are so many <i>very good</i> reasons people may not want to have conversations at any given time.  and beyond that, it’s even more rare for people to want random strangers who are trying to save or "convince" them through some weird internetDebate. that’s not normal. rarely does anyone want to be preached to (<i>and yes, im fully aware that i am saying this as i’m preaching to you lol, sorry</i>) if someone isn’t specifically looking for a debate, it’s absolutely offputting and creepy when people do this. sure, there are tiny little niche communities where people enjoy what these communities call "debates", but those are a tiny fraction of people compared to the massive world of normal people who find that weird.</p><p>im sure we’ve all had the “have ya heard the good news about jesus” people knock on your door?  a lot of times that’s pretty annoying. imagine how much more obnoxious it is if a random were to approach you and your friends on the street: “did you know jews and gays are ruining the world?” when this happens in the real world we’re like, 'get away from me dude, wtf…' the creepy weirdo factor doesn't change just because it’s online.  and it doesn't have to be that controversial... its just odd when people try to jam controversial shit onto random strangers. its just creepy.</p><p>as for algorithms, i totally agree with you, they’ve done far more to destroy social than anything. in the big picture i dont think we need to be stressed about it though.  im confident we’re gonna ultimately see a rejection of algorithmic curation. i mean, algorithms are just so bad. everything from shopping algorithms to music recommendations to the conversations the algorithms choose to show us. its just bad. a fail all around.</p><p>i suspect online will go back to something closer to offline reality. in reality we are never all jammed into the same room with an algorithm strongly implying "now scream at him! now tell her shes fat! now tell him why his doctor is wrong! now yell at that group!"  in the real world we have never in the past (and still don’t) <i>need</i> or even want to talk to random strangers in the real world. we don't scream our ideas at each other.  we don't think we need to interject our personal ideas into other peoples conversations.</p><p>frankly it’s bizarre that the same group of investors keep trying to convince us to do this. trying to convince all of us to simultaneously go to the same place and listen to their curated algorithms. its super odd.  the same group of investors are repeatedly trying, over and over again they've been doing this on multiple different failed social sites.  "everyone listen to our algorithm! it failed on that other site we own. but you *all* need to listen to this one! no, dont go elsewhere, listen to ours, all of you! you'll hate this one idea from him, yell at him!"  its super creepy.</p><p>also, this thing where a few people keep loudly trying to jam and force everyone around them into a “debate” is another piece of this thing thats got to go. more of us need to read the room. sometimes people will be interested in an actual conversation but they're rarely interested in what these guys laughable call a “debate”.  we need to be normal. if a person indicates they want to have a conversation with a random strange, sure, jump on in, have that <i>conversation</i>. however, if they’re already in a conversation with their friends, are they open to a random chirping in? if they’re not interested, yet someone forces their way in, its not at all surprising when that group of friends metaphorically crosses the street.</p><p>anyway, go easier on yourself. you don’t need to save democracy.  don’t imagine you're “making democracy work” by forcing controversial opinions on normal everyday people. especially those who aren’t interested in your controversial opinions. we’re just randoms on the internet. none of us are saving anything with our internet posts on random social sites.  there are much bigger things pulling those levers. pursue interests. have fun. be normal.
