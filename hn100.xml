Lynch moved to Los Angeles in 1971 and studied film-making at the AFI Conservatory, where he began filming his first feature Eraserhead. Finally finishing it in 1976, the surreal black-and-white fable was received largely with bafflement, and rejected from most film festivals, but in the late 70s became something of a success on the late-night “midnight movie” circuit.</p><p>Eraserhead’s impact led to an offer from Mel Brooks’ production company to direct The Elephant Man; starring John Hurt in a biopic of Joseph Merrick, the film about the disfigured 19th-century man was nominated for eight Oscars and secured Lynch’s Hollywood status. After turning down an offer to direct Return of the Jedi, Lynch agreed to make an adaptation of Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi novel Dune, but the film was substantially recut in postproduction and proved a commercial and critical disaster. Instead of a planned Dune sequel, Lynch decided to make a more personal film: his dark noir thriller Blue Velvet was a cult hit and a hugely influential critical success on its release in 1986, and it resulted in Lynch’s second best director Oscar nomination.</p><figure id="b50137f3-9b52-4019-804e-656b5f5888a3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="David Lynch at Cannes film festival, 2002." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="293.9719240297275" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>David Lynch at Cannes film festival, 2002.</span> Photograph: Pool BENAINOUS/DUCLOS/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Lynch then embarked on another noirish project, the opaque and surreal murder-mystery Twin Peaks that – unusually for notable film directors of the period – was envisioned as a TV series; Lynch developed it with former Hill Street Blues writer Mark Frost. A mix of small town comedy, police procedural and surreal dreamworld, and described as “the most hauntingly original work ever done for American TV”, Twin Peaks defied early predictions of failure on its broadcast in 1990; as a pioneer of “high-end TV” it is arguably Lynch’s most influential work.

A noir-style mystery drama, it was another big critical success, secured Lynch a third best director Oscar nomination and in 2016 was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/23/mulholland-drive-david-lynch-21st-century-top-films-bbc-poll" data-link-name="in body link">voted the best film of the 21st century</a>.

	Director-writer <a href="https://variety.com/t/david-lynch/" id="auto-tag_david-lynch" data-tag="david-lynch">David Lynch</a>, who radicalized American film with with a dark, surrealistic artistic vision in films like “<a href="https://variety.com/t/blue-velvet/" id="auto-tag_blue-velvet" data-tag="blue-velvet">Blue Velvet</a>” and “Mulholland Drive” and network television with “<a href="https://variety.com/t/twin-peaks/" id="auto-tag_twin-peaks" data-tag="twin-peaks">Twin Peaks</a>,” has died. He was 78.</p>



<p>
	Lynch revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with emphysema after a lifetime of smoking, and would likely not be able to leave his house to direct any longer. His family announced his death in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>, writing, “There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.'”</p>



<p>
	The “Twin Peaks” TV show and films such as “Blue Velvet,” “Lost Highway” and “Mulholland Drive” melded elements of horror, film noir, the whodunit and classical European surrealism. Lynch wove tales, not unlike those of his Spanish predecessor Luis Bunuel, which proceeded with their own impenetrable logic.

<p>
	A four-time Oscar nominee, Lynch received an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2020.</p>



<p>
	After years spent as a painter and a maker of short animated and live action films, Lynch burst onto the scene with his 1977 feature debut “Eraserhead,” a horrific, black-humored work that became a disturbing fixture on the midnight movie circuit. His outré and uncompromising style quickly won the attention of the Hollywood and international movie-making establishment.</p>



<p>
	He was hired by Mel Brooks’ production company to write and direct “The Elephant Man,” a deeply affecting drama about a horrifically deformed sideshow freak in Victorian England who became a national celebrity. The feature captured eight Academy Award nominations, including Lynch’s first for best director.</p>



<p>
	He found less success with his 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling science fiction novel “Dune.” The production, made on a budget of $40 million during an arduous three-year shoot, was a colossal box office flop.</p>



<p>
	However, Lynch rebounded from the disaster with two films that defined his mature style: “Blue Velvet” (1986), a frightening hellride through the psychosexual underbelly of a small American town, and the sexed-up, violent road movie “Wild at Heart” (1990), which was honored with the Cannes Film Festival’s Palme d’Or.</p>



<p>
	In 1990, he revolutionized American episodic TV with “Twin Peaks,” a series he created with writer Mark Frost. With action springing from the investigation of a high school girl’s mysterious murder in a Washington lumber mill town, the weekly ABC show plumbed disquieting, theretofore taboo subject matter and made the inexplicable a fixture of modern narrative television.

	</p>




<p>
	A major hit in its first season, “Twin Peaks” lost its momentum and ultimately its audience in year two. However, it spawned a feature-length prequel, 1992’s over-the-top “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”; 25 years later, the ongoing affection of a loyal cult of viewers sparked a limited-run third season for Showtime that picked up where the second season left off.</p>



<p>
	Later in his career, in such features as “Lost Highway” (1997), “Mulholland Drive” (which won him the best director award at Cannes in 2001) and “Inland Empire” (2006), Lynch flexed a super-heated style that pivoted on plots emphasizing doubled personalities, unexplained transformations and shocking acts of violence. The quiet yet quirky “The Straight Story” (1999) harkened back to the more reserved emotional pull of “The Elephant Man.”</p>



<p>
	The director himself was consistently reticent about sorting the meaning of his work for his viewers. In the book-length collection of interviews “Lynch On Lynch” (2005), he addressed the enigmatic core of his work with writer Chris Rodley.</p>



<p>
	“Well,” Lynch said, “imagine if you did find a book of riddles, and you could start unraveling them, but they were really complicated. Mysteries would become apparent and thrill you. We all find this book of riddles and it’s just what’s going on. And you can figure them out. The problem is, you figure them out inside yourself, and even if you told somebody, they wouldn’t believe you or understand it in the same way you do.”</p>



<p>
	In addition to his honorary Oscar, Lynch’s one-of-a-kind career was acknowledged by a special award (shared with his frequent star Laura Dern) at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards and a Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>
	He was born Jan. 20, 1946, in Missoula, Montana. His father was a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, and his peripatetic family lived in the plains states, the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast before settling in Alexandria, Virginia, where Lynch attended high school.</p>



<p>
	An indifferent student, Lynch focused on painting. A one-year stay at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and an abortive trip to Europe with his friend Jack Fisk (later a noted Hollywood production designer) were succeeded by his enrollment at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1965.

	</p>




<p>
	Living in a forbidding Philly neighborhood with his first wife and infant daughter Jennifer (later a director herself), Lynch began to dabble in film, directing the animated shorts “Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)” and “The Alphabet” (1968).</p>



<p>
	“The Grandmother” (1970), a combination of animation and live action, was filmed with money obtained from a grant by the newly founded American Film Institute. In 1971, Lynch moved to Los Angeles to study filmmaking at the AFI’s Conservatory for Advanced Film Studies, headquartered in the former Doheny mansion in Beverly Hills.</p>



<p>
	Beginning in 1972, Lynch began work on a feature at the AFI. Inspired by his bleak years as a print engraver and struggling artist in Philadelphia, a 21-page initial script began to take shape; Lynch would later say he had no memory of writing it. Over the course of the next five years, he made the film with several collaborators who would remain constants in his career, including sound designer Alan Splet, cinematographer Frederick Elmes and actor Jack Nance.</p>



<p>
	Shot laboriously, cheaply and on the fly for five years, “Eraserhead” was released by indie distributor Libra Films International in 1977. The disquieting black-and-white film followed the psychological descent of its maladroit hero Henry Spencer (Nance) after the birth of his monstrously malformed baby.</p>



<p>
	Critics were decidedly alarmed by the picture when it premiered at L.A.’s Filmex in 1977, but it took on a commercial life of its own when Libra opened the picture at midnight screenings in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Lynch would frequently appear at L.A. screenings, admonishing his mystified audiences, “Don’t ask about the baby.”</p>



<p>
	One enthusiastic viewer at a midnight show at L.A.’s Nuart Theatre was Stuart Cornfeld, a producer at Mel Brooks’ Brooksfilms. He urged Brooks to employ Lynch, and, after viewing “Eraserhead,” Brooks offered the director a job.</p>



<p>
	For his project, Lynch took on the story of John Merrick, whose sensational life story had already inspired Bernard Pomerance’s hit 1977 play. The film version of “The Elephant Man” was an entirely new enterprise, co-written by Lynch and starring a heavily made-up John Hurt as the sensitive Merrick, Anthony Hopkins as the London Hospital surgeon who became his guardian, and Brooks’ wife Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic West End stage star.

	</p>




<p>
	“The Elephant Man” had a powerful emotional impact, and became a box office and critical hit; Lynch received Oscar nods as best director and for best adapted screenplay, with the film also taking a nomination for best picture. The triumph led to a multiple-picture deal with Dino Di Laurentiis.</p>



<p>
	The sprawling space opera “Dune,” about galactic family dynasties warring over possession of a space-travel “spice” mined on a desert planet, had already defeated projected adaptations by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott when Lynch took on the material.</p>



<p>
	Filmed laboriously on Mexican soundstages with an enormous international cast, “Dune” sported an unusual Flash Gordon-meets-Antonio Gaudi production design, a memorable gallery of demented Lynchian villains and the director’s trademark amniotic visuals.</p>



<p>
	The picture satisfied no one: Both audiences attuned to the boisterous heroics of “Star Wars” and impatient critics rejected Lynch’s contorted, confusing and harshly digested reading of Herbert’s novel, and the film tanked on arrival. Lynch later told Chris Rodley that at the conclusion of the ordeal, “I was almost dead. Almost dead!”</p>



<p>
	However, Lynch’s second film for De Laurentiis defined the contours of his mature style. “Blue Velvet” starred Kyle McLachlan, who had played the messianic hero of “Dune,” as a small-town boy who is plunged into a whirlpool of sexual violence, murder and sadomasochism.</p>



<p>
	Featuring a potent cast that included Isabella Rossellini (with whom Lynch became involved romantically), Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell and, most notably, Dennis Hopper as its deranged, out-of-control villain, “Blue Velvet” polarized critics, but it cemented Lynch’s reputation as a fearless and daring film author. The film was the start of his collaboration with composer Angelo Badalamenti.</p>



<p>
	Four years later, the Lynch style was brought to the small screen with “Twin Peaks.” Starring McLachlan as eccentric FBI agent Dale Cooper, the series used the investigation of the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer as a springboard into a swirling narrative vortex involving sexual intrigue, drug addiction, prostitution, madness and demonic possession. TV audiences tuned in to track the mystery and remained for the series’ complexly interwoven characters and perverse, at times supernatural plot twists.

	</p>




<p>
	The show’s first season scored 14 Emmy nominations, including nods for Lynch for writing and directing the pilot, but declining ratings after the drawn-out revelation of Palmer’s killer and Lynch’s diminishing participation due to production of a new feature led to a cliffhanging wrap-up at the end of season two.</p>



<p>
	However, the “Twin Peaks” saga had legs. Actress Sheryl Lee was brought back from the dead to play Laura Palmer in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” which tracked the fateful last week of Palmer’s life in lurid, screaming detail. And Showtime cable audiences were baffled anew by 2017’s much-belated third season, which reunited McLachlan and several members of the original cast.</p>



<p>
	The truest legacy of “Twin Peaks” may have been its impact on the development of unusual long-form episodic series. Successors ranging from “Wild Palms” to “True Detective” all bore Lynch’s distinctive stylistic fingerprints.</p>



<p>
	Lynch’s first feature after “Twin Peaks,” 1990’s “Wild at Heart,” was an oddball exodus, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, in which an Elvis-fixated ex-con (Nicolas Cage) and his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Laura Dern) are pursued by the murderous minions of the girl’s jealous mother (Dern’s own mother Diane Ladd). Domestic reaction was mixed to the gory, sexually frank mix of “Detour” and “The Wizard of Oz,” but the Cannes jury was wowed.</p>



<p>
	Lynch’s association with Gifford continued with “Lost Highway,” for which the two collaborated on an original screenplay. A doppelganger murder mystery that foreshadowed “Mulholland Drive,” the disquieting, brutally effective thriller starred Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty and Patricia Arquette as the players in a homicidal foursome.</p>



<p>
	After spending most of the decade on the far side of narrative coherence, Lynch came back down to earth with “The Straight Story,” the first feature in which he took no hand in writing. In the incongruously Disney-distributed picture, based on a true story, Richard Farnsworth starred as an Iowa man who drives from Iowa to Wisconsin on a power mower to visit his seriously ill brother.</p>



<p>
	Though not a major hit, the film was critically well received, and proved to Lynch’s naysayers that he was capable of bringing life to material that was not extravagantly outrageous. Farnsworth received an Oscar nomination for his performance; the veteran actor and stunt man, who was suffering from terminal prostate cancer during the production of the film, died by suicide in 2000.

	</p>




<p>
	An enlarged version of a prospective pilot for a new TV series became what may have been Lynch’s most widely acclaimed film, and a defining summation of the filmmaker’s themes and narrative obsessions.</p>



<p>
	“Mulholland Drive” served a darkly satirical comment on the ways of Hollywood in the story of a young actress (Naomi Watts) whose relationship with an amnesiac stranger (Laura Elena Harring) becomes a hall-of-mirrors story of manipulation, betrayal and suicide. Lynch was nominated for a 2002 best director Oscar.</p>



<p>
	Some of the same themes came to the fore in “Inland Empire,” Lynch’s first film to be shot entirely on digital video, with Laura Dern starring as an on-the-skids actress involved in typical Lynchian psychic disorder. Owing to its format, still a relative rarity theatrically in 2007, the three-hour feature was little seen after its 2007 premiere at the Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>
	In 2022, he appeared as John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s “The Fablemans,” and also provided the voice of the mad scientist in “Robot Chicken.”</p>



<p>
	Beyond his work in film and TV, Lynch exhibited his paintings internationally and issued many solo and collaborative albums of music. He contributed a weekly comic strip, “The Angriest Dog in the World,” to the alternative weekly the Los Angeles Reader for eight years. His wry, deadpan weather reports were aired daily on the L.A. rock station Indie 103.1 for several years and continued on social media.</p>



<p>
	A devotee of transcendental meditation from the 1970s on, he established his David Lynch Foundation to promote the Eastern practice, and enlisted such stars as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Donovan for fund-raising concerts.</p>



<p>
	Despite persistent rumors of new feature and TV projects after “Twin Peaks” came to an end in 2017, Lynch focused on making music videos and composing music with collaborators including Christabell. He offered his name to the David Lynch Graduate School of Cinematic Arts at Maharishi University and a line of coffee beans and designed Silencio nightclubs in Paris and New York. </p>



<p>
	Lynch was married four times. He is survived by two daughters and two sons.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Digital rights advocacy organizations contend that Apple has failed to comply with its interoperability obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p>The groups made their case in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ARTICLE-19_Joint-submission_EC_PUBLIC-CONSULTATION_APPLE_ARTICLE-67.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] asking competition watchdogs to do more to ensure Apple's compliance with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/b4326c28-49cd-11ed-92ed-01aa75ed71a1.0006.01/DOC_1">Article 6(7)</a> of the DMA.</p>
<p>The letter is the work of four groups - the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://fsfe.org/index.en.html">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>, freedom of expression advocates <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.article19.org/">ARTICLE 19</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://edri.org/">European Digital Rights</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.datarights.ngo/">Data Rights</a> - plus three independent researchers.</p>

    

<p>Article 6(7) matters because it requires companies designated as gatekeepers – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft – to provide non-discriminatory access to, or interoperation with, designated software and hardware, to promote competition.</p>

        


        

<p>In September 2024, the commission <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/apple_ios_ipad_os_eu/">opened two proceedings against Apple</a> covering its interoperability obligations with regard to iOS connectivity features like the peer-to-peer file exchange tech AirDrop and how the iCompany should accommodate developer requests for interoperability.</p>
<p>The letter’s signatories argue that the commission's approach so far, "as laid out in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-markets-act-cases.ec.europa.eu/reports/compliance-reports">Apple’s compliance report</a> and as observed in practice so far, is clearly deficient and structurally incapable of delivering effective interoperability, as required by the DMA."</p>

        

<p>The rights groups list several recommendations they believe could help bring Apple into compliance.</p>
<p>First, they want the commission to forbid Apple from imposing Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) on developers solely at its own discretion. Any such agreement, they argue, should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with developer input noted in case there's disagreement.</p>
<p>Second, they want a standardized interoperability request form that developers can submit to Apple. The signatories think that will improve transparency and reduce the delaying tactics that have been reported by devs seeking information from Apple about APIs intended to make an app or product work with the iOS ecosystem.</p>

        

<p>Third, they want the commission to revisit <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/document/download/45321658-26ce-4ae0-a66a-c5261de5a5a9_en?filename=DMA.100204%20-%20Proposed%20measures.pdf">Paragraph 20(B)(e)</a> [PDF] of the DMA, which grants Apple the discretion to conceal symbols or accompanying descriptions related to its frameworks and libraries based on security concerns.</p>
<p>"We maintain that Apple should not be permitted to rely on security by obscurity, even though it is presently practiced in iOS," the letter says. "On the contrary, the developer should be allowed to claim that the implementation of an interoperability solution is in place based on Open Standards and publicly available documentation, the burden would fall on Apple to prove otherwise."</p>

</ul>
<p>The signatories also take issue with Apple's "Feedback Assistant" through which developers are supposed to be able to communicate about interoperability issues. They want the commission to make clear that Apple cannot provide third-party APIs that are less effective than its own APIs, and to ensure that Apple makes its APIs flexible, per the commission's intent.</p>
<p>What's more, they contend, tracking interoperability requests is made harder by the lack of a public bug tracking system – a sore point in the Apple developer community since at least 2011 when Tim Burks and Chris Verwymeren set up Open Radar, an unofficial bug-report-sharing site for third-party Apple developers.</p>
<p>"Bugs and errors in APIs commonly arise and necessitate timely and effective fixes by Apple," the letter’s authors state. "We therefore suggest the commission mandates improvements to Apple’s existing bug reporting system or creates a dedicated infrastructure for bug reporting, which should be publicly available on their website."</p>
<p>The letter goes on to claim that Apple, through its app notarization process, "can leverage multiple channels under the current request-driven approach as a means to block interoperability."</p>
<p>Pointing to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ish.app/blog/ish-jit-and-eu">Apple's denial</a> of an interoperability request to make its just-in-time (JIT) compilation APIs available to iSH, a Linux shell for iOS, the advocacy groups argue that the commission should reconsider how DMA obligations relate to one another lest Apple be allowed to continue strategically blocking interoperability.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors ask the commission to become more involved in the dispute resolution process, to reinforce the DMA's commitment to interoperability, and to promote a more open and transparent process – which has never been Apple's preferred approach to communication.</p>
<p>For its part, Apple last month published a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interoperability-Dec-2024.pdf">document</a> [PDF] warning that the DMA's interoperability requirements <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/19/apple_meta_interoperability/">could expose</a> personal information to the likes of Meta.</p>
<p>"As an example of our concerns, Meta has made 15 requests (and counting) for potentially far-reaching access to Apple's technology stack that, if granted as sought, would reduce the protections around personal data that our users have come to expect from their devices," the company said.</p>
<p>Were Apple to grant these requests, the iBiz said, Meta's apps would have access to all sorts of data that Apple itself has chosen not to access for the sake of privacy – much of which we suspect Apple could access via iCloud or other means if presented with a lawful demand for access.</p>
<p>Meta communications director Andy Stone <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/andymstone/status/1869553546380898609">responded</a> with his opinion that Apple is really saying “They don't believe in interoperability. In fact, every time Apple is called out for anti-competitive behavior, they defend themselves on privacy grounds that have no basis in reality." ®</p>

          <p>Early on Thursday morning, a Saturn V-sized rocket ignited its seven main engines, a prelude to lifting off from Earth.</p>
<p>But then, the New Glenn rocket didn't move.</p>
<p>And still, the engines produced their blue flame, furiously burning away methane.</p>
<p>The thrust-to-weight of the rocket must have been in the vicinity of 1.0 to 1.2, so the booster had to burn a little liquid methane and oxygen before it could begin to climb appreciably. But finally, seconds into the mission, New Glenn did begin to climb. It was slow, ever so slow. But it flew true.</p>
<h2>Flying safe</h2>
<p>After that the vehicle performed like a champion. The first stage burned for more than three minutes before the second stage separated at an altitude of 70 km. Then, the upper stage's two BE-3U engines appeared to perform flawlessly, pushing the Blue Ring pathfinder payload toward orbit. These engines burned very nearly for 10 minutes before shutting down, having reached an orbital velocity of 28,800 kph.</p>
<p>For the first time since its founding, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Blue Origin had reached orbit. The long-awaited debut launch of the New Glenn rocket, a super-heavy lift vehicle developed largely with private funding, had come. And it was a smashing success.</p>
<p>The only downer came a little bit later when Blue Origin's Ariane Cornell confirmed that the first stage did not successfully return to Earth. "We did in fact lose the booster," Cornell said during the company's webcast. Far below in the Atlantic Ocean the drone ship <em>Jacklyn</em> awaited, a lone and lonely sentinel, with no rocket to catch.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="11b316ff" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
			<p><em><span>Contributed by Deb Chatterjee, Intel</span></em></p>
<p><span>We are excited to usher in the dawn of a new era for the P4 programming language. For many years, the Tofino family of programmable Ethernet switches, powered by P4, has represented the cutting edge of network innovation. Tofino’s unprecedented levels of programmability have enabled organizations to shape their networks like never before. But there was always one limitation: the software driving this groundbreaking hardware remained closed source. Today, that changes. The Tofino P4 software is being open-sourced, and it’s about to revolutionize how we think about programmable networks.</span></p>
<p><span>This bold move from Intel to open-source the Tofino P4 software is more than just a licensing decision; it’s a call to action for the global developer community. It invites everyone—from seasoned network engineers to aspiring students—to participate, innovate, and contribute to shaping the future of networking. The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 code democratizes access to some of the most powerful tools in networking. Developers can now dive deep into the workings of Tofino switches, experiment with custom data plane designs without restrictions, and share and build upon others’ innovations to create groundbreaking solutions, utilizing the power and strength of an open-source community.</span></p>
<p><span>Open source thrives on collaboration. By releasing the Tofino P4 code, we’re creating a community where developers can propose and implement new features, researchers can experiment with cutting-edge ideas in programmable networking, and educators can use open-source tools to train the next generation of network engineers. Traditionally, access to high-performance network programming tools has been limited by closed-source software, high costs, or proprietary restrictions. Open-sourcing Tofino P4 removes these barriers, allowing anyone with the curiosity and skills to participate. This democratization is a game-changer for startups, academic institutions, and developers in underrepresented regions. Aspiring P4 developers can now explore, dissect, and learn from production-grade software. This real-world exposure will be valuable for understanding how P4 programming operates at scale. Educational institutions can even build programming curricula around this. In the words of Brad Burres, Intel Senior Fellow, “open sourcing software is the best way to accelerate industry innovation and lift all boats”.&nbsp; Nanda Kuruganti, Intel VP of Networking SW, points out that “P4 programming and an open ecosystem are the cornerstones of our networking strategy. By open-sourcing Tofino P4 software, we aim to empower the community to drive innovation and unlock the full potential of programmable networks.”</span></p>
<p><span>Developers now have access to the entire source code, which is organized in two main repos inside the p4lang structure. The p4c repo now additionally contains the Tofino compiler components, with subfolders such as arch, common, control-plane, driver, midend, test and docs. The <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/main/backends/tofino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tofino backend</a> is hierarchically at the same level as bmv2, ubpf and other backends. The newly introduced <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/open-p4studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-p4studio repo</a> contains all the other components of the Tofino P4 Studio, such as bf_driver, bf_diags, bf_utils and tofino_model.</span></p>
<p><span>We are immensely grateful to the following individuals within Intel who worked on the open sourcing effort – Glen Gibb, Han Wang, Prathima Kotikalapudi, Anil Samal, Vaishnavi Tipireddy, Shiv Kumar, Shuai Zhang, Rohit Nair, and Sai Pracheetha Beeyam. We also benefited immensely from the guidance from the P4 Technical Steering Committee members, Fabian Ruffy and Andy Fingerhut.</span></p>
<p><span>The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 software is not just a milestone—it’s an invitation. It’s a call for developers, researchers, educators, and network enthusiasts to come together and shape the future of programmable networking. We encourage developers to dive into the repository, read the code, and understand how Tofino P4 works. The more they learn, the more they can contribute. Whether it’s fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, every contribution helps the community grow.</span></p>
<p><span>We are asking P4 enthusiasts all over the world to spread the word about the open-sourcing of Tofino P4, and encourage their peers, colleagues, and organizations to join the P4 movement.</span></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.

I find that my students tend to think of the past in terms of great artworks and great historical figures —&nbsp;boiling the entire 16th century down to Cortez, </span><em>The Prince</em><span>, and the Mona Lisa, for instance. </span></p><p><span>I can’t really blame them for seeing the past this way. Historical experience tends to be preserved —&nbsp;and certainly tends to be </span><em>taught </em><span>— as a succession of famous cultural products that serve as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy" rel="">metonyms</a><span> for a larger story. The three millennia of ancient Egypt become personified by the Great Pyramid and King Tut’s death mask; the Ming Dynasty collapses into a blur of blue-and-white porcelain; the whole of Elizabethan England is remembered chiefly from the rather distinct perspective of a single person named William Shakespeare. </span></p><p><span>This “metonymic approach” is, honestly, </span><em>really</em><span> helpful for teaching. I use it all the time in my world history surveys. But it doesn’t really capture the texture of everyday life in the past. Precisely because these works are so exceptional — and hence so well-studied — we tend to place them as part of a nebulous “cultural heritage of humanity” rather than as specific products of a time and place. </span></p><p><span>That’s why I love it when archaeology presents us with a different type of iconic artifact: objects that offer a glimpse into the visceral reality of past lives. The Carmona wine urn belongs to this select group, alongside artifacts like the 2,500-year-old </span><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazyryk_rug" rel="">Pazyryk carpet</a><span> which

<p>As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.</p>



<p>I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.</p>



<p>I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.</p>



<p>When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer <a href="https://www.pugsleywood.com/lawyers/bryan-a-wood/">Bryan Wood</a>, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.</p>



<p>It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.</p>



<p>And then this slowly started to flourish.</p>



<p>One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.</p>



<p>They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.</p>



<p>We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.</p>



<p>Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.</p>



<p>And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.</p>



<p>Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.</p>



<p>It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.</p>



<p>I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.</p>



<p>So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.</p>



<p>Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.</p>



<p>Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.</p>



<p>My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.</p>



<p>For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.</p>



<p>It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.</p>



<p>To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.</p>



<p>Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.</p>



<p>With unfathomable levels of gratitude,</p>



<p>Nate Anderson </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-parent="true" id="row-unique-1"><div><p>Conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing has long held that bigger chips mean worse yields. Yet at Cerebras, we’ve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips – and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor?</p>
<p>The answer lies in rethinking the relationship between chip size and fault tolerance. This article will provide a detailed, apples-to-apples comparison of manufacturing yields between the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine and an H100-sized chip, both manufactured at 5nm. By examining the interplay between defect rates, core size, and fault tolerance, we’ll show how we achieve wafer scale integration with equal or better yields vs. reticle limited GPUs.</p>
<h3>What determines yield</h3>
<p>Like any manufacturing process, computer chips are prone to defects. Larger chips are more likely to encounter defects, thus as chips grow in size, yields fall exponentially with increasing die area. Even though larger chips generally run faster, early microprocessors were built to a modest size to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields and profit margins. In the early 2000s, this started to change. As transistor budgets grew to over 100 million, it became the norm to build processors with multiple independent cores per chip. Since all the cores were identical and independent, chip designers built-in core-level fault tolerance so that if one core suffered a defect, the remaining cores could still operate. For example in 2006 Intel released the Intel Core Duo – a chip with two CPU cores. If one core was faulty, it was disabled and the product was sold as an Intel Core Solo. Nvidia, AMD, and others all embraced this core-level redundancy in the coming years.</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="919" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-300x108.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-1024x368.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-768x276.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-1536x551.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-2048x735.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-350x126.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>Today, fault tolerance is widely used by high performance processors and it’s perfectly normal to sell chips with some cores disabled. AMD and Intel CPUs generally ship a flagship version with all cores enabled and a lower end version with a portion of cores disabled. Nvidia’s data center GPUs are substantially larger than CPU dies and as a result even its flagship models have some portion of cores disabled.</p>
<p>Take the Nvidia H100 – a massive GPU weighing in at 814mm<sup>2</sup>. Traditionally this chip would be very difficult to yield economically. But since its cores (SMs) are fault tolerant, a manufacturing defect does not knock out the entire product. The chip physically has 144 SMs but the commercialized product only has 132 SMs active. This means the chip could suffer numerous defects across 12 SMs and still be sold as a flagship part.</p>
<h3>Defect tolerance is the key to yield</h3>
<p>Traditionally, chip size directly dictated chip yields. In the modern era, yield is a function of both chip size and defect tolerance. 800mm<sup>2</sup> chips were once thought infeasible to commercialize due to yield, but by using defect tolerant design, they are now mainstream products.</p>
<p>The degree of defect tolerance can be measured by the amount of chip area that is lost when a defect occurs. For multi-core chips, this means the smaller the core, the greater the defect tolerance. If individual cores are small enough, it may be possible to build a very large chip.</p>
<h3>Wafer Scale Engine Cores</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01.jpg" width="1640" height="862" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01.jpg 1640w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-768x404.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-350x184.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px"></p>
					</div><div><p>At Cerebras, before committing to build a wafer-scale chip, we first designed a very small core. Each AI core in the Wafer Scale Engine 3 is approximately 0.05mm<sup>2</sup> or about 1% the size of an H100 SM core. Both core designs are fault tolerant. This means a defect in a WSE core would disable 0.05mm<sup>2</sup> of silicon while the same defect in an H100 disables ~6mm<sup>2</sup>. To a first order of approximation, the wafer scale engine is ~100x more fault tolerant than a GPU when considering the silicon area affected by each defect.</p>
<h3>The Routing Architecture</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="2050" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-768x615.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-1536x1230.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-2048x1640.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-350x280.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>But small cores alone aren’t enough. We developed a sophisticated routing architecture that allows us to dynamically reconfigure connections between cores. When a defect is detected, the system can automatically route around it using redundant communication pathways, preserving the chip’s overall computational capabilities by leveraging nearby cores.</p>
<p>This routing system works in concert with a small reserve of spare cores that can be used to replace defective units. Unlike previous approaches that required massive redundancy overhead, our architecture achieves high yield with minimal spare capacity through intelligent routing.</p>
<h3>A wafer scale walkthrough</h3>
<p>Defect tolerance at a chip level is fairly clear. Let’s now compare how a traditional GPU and a wafer-scale chip would yield using TSMC 5nm’s 300mm wafer:</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01.png" width="2146" height="1144" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01.png 2146w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-300x160.png 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-1024x546.png 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-768x409.png 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-1536x819.png 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-2048x1092.png 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-350x187.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2146px) 100vw, 2146px"></p>
					</div><div><p>On the left is a H100-like GPU: it is 814mm<sup>2</sup>, it has 144 fault tolerant cores, and a single 300mm wafer yields 72 full die chips. On the right we have the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine 3. It’s one giant square measuring 46,225mm<sup>2</sup>. It has 970,000 fault tolerant cores. One wafer yields one chip.</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="1071" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-300x125.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-1024x428.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-768x321.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-1536x642.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-2048x856.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-350x146.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>At the current TSMC 5nm node, TSMC’s process <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16028/better-yield-on-5nm-than-7nm-tsmc-update-on-defect-rates-for-n5"><span>reportedly</span></a> has ~0.001 defect per mm<sup>2</sup>. 72 GPU dies have total die area of 58,608mm<sup>2</sup>. Applying this defect density, this area would see a total of 59 defects. For simplicity, let’s assume each defect lands on a separate core. At 6.2mm<sup>2</sup> per core, this means 361mm<sup>2</sup> of die space would be lost of defects.</p>
<p>On the Cerebras side, the effective die size is a bit smaller at 46,225mm<sup>2</sup>. Applying the same defect rate, the WSE-3 would see 46 defects. Each core is 0.05mm<sup>2</sup>. This means 2.2mm<sup>2</sup> in total would be lost to defects.</p>
<p>Measuring the total area lost, the GPU in this case loses 164x more silicon area than the Wafer Scale Engine on an apple-to-apples basis on the same manufacturing node and defect rate.</p>
<p>The above makes a high-level point but simplifies a few details. First, not all areas of the chip are taken by the compute cores. Caches, memory controllers, and on-chip fabric take up a substantial amount of die size, perhaps up to 50%. However, these components can be designed to be fault tolerant in their own way. An H100 SM is likely smaller than 6.2mm<sup>2</sup> due to these components, though not by an order of magnitude. Second, a cluster of defects could overwhelm fault tolerant areas and disable the whole chip. In practice, even fault tolerant chips will not yield close to 100%. These caveats aside, the general rule that smaller cores make for greater fault tolerance still holds.</p>
<h3>Putting Cerebras in the Table</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="1029" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-300x121.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-1024x412.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-768x309.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-1536x617.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-2048x823.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-350x141.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>Let’s revisit the first table, now with the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine added. Like Nvidia’s data center GPUs, the WSE-3 is designed to be fault-tolerant and disables a portion of its cores to manage yield. Because our cores are so tiny, the number of cores is so much larger – 970,000 physical cores with 900,000 active on our current shipping product. This provides tremendous, fine grained, defect tolerance. Despite having built the world’s largest chip, we enable 93% of our silicon area, which is higher than the leading GPU today.</p>
<p>To summarize, Cerebras resolved the wafer scale manufacturing challenge by designing a small fault-tolerant core in combination with a fault tolerant on-chip fabric. While total chip area increased by ~50x compared to conventional GPUs, we reduced individual core size by ~100x. As a result, defects are far less damaging to the WSE than conventional multi-core processors. The third generation WSE engine achieves 93% silicon utilization – the highest among leading AI accelerators – demonstrating that wafer-scale computing is not just possible, but commercially viable at scale.</p>
