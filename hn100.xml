<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  

  <p>Over the years, Flutter has attracted millions of developers who built user interfaces across
every platform. Flutter began as a UI toolkit for mobile - iOS and Android, only. Then Flutter
added support for web. Finally, Flutter expanded to Mac, Windows, and Linux. Across this massive
expansion of scope and responsibility, the Flutter team has only marginally increased its size.
To help expand Flutter's available labor, and accelerate development, we're creating a fork
of Flutter, called Flock.</p>
<h2 id="flutters-labor-shortage">Flutter's labor shortage</h2>
<p>Let's do some back-of-the-napkin math to appreciate the Flutter team's labor shortage.</p>
<p>How many Flutter developers exist in the world, today? My guess is that it's on the order of
1,000,000 developers. The real number is probably higher, but one million should be reasonably
conservative.</p>
<p>How large is the Flutter team, today? Google doesn't publish this information, but my guess is
that the team is about 50 people strong.</p>
<p>That's 50 people serving the needs of 1,000,000. Doing a little bit of division, that means
that every single member of the Flutter team is responsible for the needs of 20,000 Flutter
developers! That ratio is clearly unworkable for any semblance of customer support.</p>
<p>A labor shortage can always be fixed through hiring. However, due to company-wide issues
at Google, the Flutter team's head count was frozen circa 2023, and then earlier in 2024
we learned of a small number of layoffs. It seems that the team may now be expanding again,
through outsourcing, but we're not likely to see the Flutter team double or quadruple its
size any time soon.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Google's corporate re-focus on AI caused the Flutter team to
de-prioritize all desktop platforms. As we speak, the Flutter team is in maintenance mode
for 3 of its 6 supported platforms. Desktop is quite possibly the greatest untapped value
for Flutter, but it's now mostly stagnant.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-limited-labor">The cost of limited labor</h2>
<p>Limited labor comes at a great cost for a toolkit that has rapidly expanded its user base, along
with its overall scope.</p>
<p>With so few developers to work on tickets, many tickets linger in the backlog. They can easily linger
for years, if they're ever addressed at all.</p>
<p>By the time a member of the Flutter team begins to investigate a ticket, the ticket might be years
old. At that point, the Flutter team developer typically asks for further information from the person
who filed the ticket. In my experience, when this happens to me, I've long since stopped working with
the client who had the initial issue. I've written hundreds of thousands of lines of code since then.
I often don't even remember filing the issue, let alone the obscure details related to the original
issue. The team can't fix the bug without information from me, and it's been too long for me to provide
information to the team. So the bug gets buried for a future developer to rediscover.</p>
<p>Timing isn't just an issue for eventually root causing and fixing bugs. It's also a major product
problem. Imagine that you're the engineering director, or CTO of a company whose next release is
blocked by some Flutter bug. What do you do if the team won't work on that bug for 2 years? Well,
if it's a serious bug for your company, then you stop using Flutter. You don't have a choice. You
need to keep moving forward. Your team doesn't know how to work on the Flutter framework, and the
Flutter framework team is either unresponsive, or at least completely non-committal towards a
fix. Oh well - can't use Flutter any more. Flutter won't survive if these kinds of experiences become
common.</p>

<p>Flutter has two very valuable qualities. First, it's open source, so any developer can see how
any part of Flutter is implemented, and can even change it. Second, the Flutter framework is
written in the same language as Flutter apps. Because of these two qualities, experienced Flutter
app developers, and package developers can contribute to the Flutter framework.</p>
<p>How many Flutter developers exist in the world today who are capable of contributing at a
productive level to the Flutter framework? Conservatively, I would guess there are about 1,000
of them. In other words, there are at least 1,000 Flutter developers in the world who could
conceivably be hired to the Flutter team, if the team wanted to hire that many developers.</p>
<p>Remember that ratio of 1 Flutter team member per 20,000 developers? If every capable Flutter
framework contributor in the world regularly contributed to Flutter, that ratio of 1:20,000
would drop to 1:1,000. That's still a big ratio, but it's <strong>much</strong> better than what it is
now.</p>
<p>Moreover, as more external contributors get comfortable submitting fixes and features to
Flutter, they'll tend to help train others to do the same. Thus, the support ratio would
continue to move in a better direction.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-work-directly-with-the-flutter-team">Why not work directly with the Flutter team?</h2>
<p>If increased external contributions is the path to a better Flutter world, then why fork
Flutter when everyone could just work directly with the Flutter team?</p>
<p>It's a tempting proposition to setup a concerted effort to contribute directly to Flutter.
After all, the Flutter team regularly touts the number of external contributions that it
rolls into each release. According to the Flutter public relations effort, they'd love all
those external contributions!</p>
<p>But, sadly, trying to work with the Flutter team delivers a different reality. While some
developers have had success working with the Flutter team, many other developers have found
it frustrating, if not unworkable. There are, no doubt, a number of factors that contribute
to this result. Different developers will experience different issues. But here are some of
them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited review labor:
<ul>
<li>The developers who don't have enough time to write code are the same developers tapped
to review contributions. Therefore, it can take a long time for review or updates.</li>
<li>The time crunch also seems to lend itself to contentious review conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything takes forever, and it always seems to be about non-critical details.</li>
<li>Communication monoculture - most of the team seems to expect a certain way of communicating,
which doesn't match the variety of personalities in the world. Thus, some people have an
exceptionally difficult time navigating otherwise quick and simple conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of the aforementioned issues, and probably others that aren't listed, is that the
total number of people who have ever contributed to the Flutter framework is currently less
than 1,500. That number includes people who dropped by, one time, to fix a typo in a Dart Doc
and then never contributed again. That's <strong>not</strong> the number of regular contributors who add
significant value.</p>
<p>Whatever your experience with contributions to Flutter, one has to critically assess why a
team that loves external contributions has only managed to merge contributions from 1,500
developers over a span of nearly a decade. My humble suggestion is that it's because the
inviting message of the PR team doesn't match the experience of actually pushing a change
through the team's policies, developer availability, and technical culture.</p>
<p>The only people who can change this reality are the people within the Flutter organization.
However, most of those people don't actually think any of this is a problem. I know, because
a number of them have expressed this to me, directly. There are a number of significant blind
spots for the Flutter team, which largely revolve around the fact that members of the team
have never been responsible for routinely delivering app features and fixes that are built
upon Flutter. In other words, I believe there are blind spots because Flutter team members
don't actually use Flutter. Thus, the urgency around many issues isn't appreciated, nor is
the urgency and time cost associated with submitting fixes directly to Flutter as an
external contributor.</p>
<p>If the Flutter team doesn't recognize the contribution problem, and therefore won't take
steps to address it, then what else can be done? That's where we find ourselves in this
post, and in this effort. We've decided that the one thing we can do to help the labor
issue is to fork Flutter.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-flock">Introducing Flock</h2>
<p>Our fork of Flutter is called Flock. We describe Flock as "Flutter+". In other words, we
<strong>do not</strong> want, or intend, to fork the Flutter community. Flock will remain constantly
up to date with Flutter. Flock will add important bug fixes, and popular community features,
which the Flutter team either can't, or won't implement.</p>
<p>By forking Flutter, we get to decide what gets merged. We won't lower the quality bar, but
by controlling merge decisions, we do gain the following opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit a much larger PR review team than the Flutter team. This means faster review times.</li>
<li>Recruit PR reviewers who are ready to facilitate contributions, instead of merely tolerating them.
This means support for a wider contributor audience.</li>
<li>Optimize policies. E.g., don't blindly demand design docs and conference calls when they won't
substantially add to the effectiveness of the task at hand.</li>
<li>Use contribution successes to socially promote more contributions.</li>
<li>We're all Flutter users - leverage team and company relationships to identify market priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Flock ships important bug fixes and features, the Flutter team can then choose to add those
to Flutter, on their schedule. The community will no longer be limited by the Flutter team's
availability, nor will the community need to beg the Flutter team to please accept a change. The
Flutter team can use Flock's solutions, or not, but all Flock users will have access to them,
eliminating your company and team's urgency and desperation.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-get-involved">How you can get involved</h2>
<p>Flock, as the name implies, will only go as far as the community that supports it. We would
love for you to get involved.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-test-the-fork">Alpha test the fork</h3>
<p>Flock's first step is to mirror Flutter. This means automatically mirroring the <code>master</code>,
<code>beta</code>, and <code>stable</code> branches, along with replicating all release tags. Additionally,
once the framework is mirrored, Flock will need to automatically build and upload the
engine, and make those engine binaries available to Flock users.</p>
<p>As we work through the mirroring process, it would be a big help if you would try building
your apps with Flock. You shouldn't see any difference between Flock and Flutter, and you
can configure Flock with a tiny Flutter Version Manager (FVM) configuration.</p>
<p>Check our instructions to <a href="https://flutterfoundation.dev/">get started</a>.</p>
<h3 id="become-a-reviewer">Become a reviewer</h3>
<p>Flock needs to recruit dozens of reviewers. Reviewers are responsible for enforcing a
quality bar that's similar to Flutter's. This includes requiring descriptive class, method,
and property names, effective Dart Docs, and appropriate tests.</p>
<p>But we want reviewers to go even further than that. We don't just want to tolerate contributions -
we want to facilitate them. Many of us have had the experience of getting a PR 90% to the finish
line only to have a Flutter team reviewer declare that it can't merge until we do something that
we don't know how to do. It's an awful experience, and we aim to avoid it with Flock.</p>
<p>We want Flock reviewers who are willing to step in and help a contributor achieve the final 10% of
the PR. This doesn't mean contributors get to be lazy. But if a contributor has done everything
that he knows how to do, and the PR is close to complete, then we want the reviewer to step in
and provide direction for the final 10%. This is how we educate contributors and ensure that the
next PR is 100% complete.</p>
<p>If you'd like to become a Flock reviewer, <a href="https://x.com/suprdeclarative">please reach out to us</a>.</p>
<h3 id="become-a-lead">Become a Lead</h3>
<p>Maintaining and extending a long-lived fork of Flutter requires some number of experts who
direct specific areas of the project. For example, I'm initially stepping up at the Director
of Flock, as well as the Framework Lead. Jesse Ezell has stepped up as the Engine Lead.</p>
<p>We'd like to bring in a Flutter Tool lead, who directs extensions to the <code>flutter</code> CLI tool.</p>
<p>We'd also like to break up the engine responsibilities with a Lead per platform: Android, iOS,
Mac, Windows, Linux.</p>
<p>If you'd like to direct efforts for an area of Flock, <a href="https://x.com/suprdeclarative">please reach out to us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lets-flock-together">Let's Flock together</h2>
<p>Let's shift Flutter into overdrive and help make it the universal UI toolkit it should
have been. Flutter has the potential to outshine every alternative in the market. But
it needs the community to Flock together to help get it there. Let's do this!</p>

I think that is when I realized just how dishonest so much of the “community” around WordPress really is.</p><p>I’ve watched people pour their lives into giving back only to have it all tossed out because their important work isn’t what Matt wanted people to focus on.</p><p>I’ve watched good people try to make the community stronger and protect users by contributing to privacy, accessibility, governance and so many more vital areas only to, not only have their contributions ignored, but to see the contributors themselves abused and pushed out of the community entirely for their basic advocacy.</p><p>I’ve watched WordPress company after WordPress company claim to be “better” in how it treats its people. The truth is nearly all of them used WordPress’ virtues as an excuse to under pay people and abuse them. From some of the most respected product companies to some of the most prominent agencies I’ve watched them chew up good people with threats that they “aren’t good enough to leave” and similar to continue to justify low pay and benefits.</p><p>I’ve watched a full cult form around Automattic, the company behind wordpress.com. In 2014 I even applied to work there but by that point I was already at a stage where I didn’t trust the org due to abuse I had seen a friend go through. I confess I took the paid trial but I intentionally did not take it seriously and I accepted another role before the trial started. All that is to say, Automattic was never honest about who it is so I really didn’t feel too bad at the time about going through such motions. They had the chance to change my mind then but that not only didn’t happen but the whole experience instead lowered my respect for the org even further.</p><p>The list goes on and on but WordPress was never an honest community, yet I stayed, for far too long.</p><p>I joined WP Engine in 2018 because it was the one company that really did seem to be honest about who they were. Like every other company they were in it to make money, but unlike every other company they didn’t hide that fact behind abusive language. They didn’t claim I was “family.” They didn’t claim their work was virtuous and therefore somehow “better” than non-WordPress orgs. No, they said they wanted to be the biggest host and went after that with the best pay I saw in the WordPress ecosystem and interesting work on top of it.</p><p>I left WP Engine in July of this year for a lot of reasons, but I don’t regret why I joined them. I stand by the fact that they were the most honest company in WordPress, an ecosystem where honesty is often harder to come by than in any other I’ve worked in.</p><h3 id="the-current-wordpress-implosion">The current WordPress implosion</h3><p>So that brings us to the current WordPress <del>drama</del> implosion. There are plenty of folks writing the timeline of events of what is going on. That isn’t why I’m writing this post. That said, up until September I was happily still working on Kana, my WordPress development environment, and exploring a few plugin ideas I’ve had, even if WordPress isn’t the best tool for blogging anymore.</p><p>I can’t do it anymore.</p><p>The utter hypocrisy of Matt Mullenweg’s actions isn’t really unsurprising to anyone who has watched Automattic for the last decade or more but it is my final straw. Yes, I should’ve left earlier when I saw friends hurt. Somehow I guess I always thought my actions would somehow help the situation. It was a naive position, I now realize.</p><p>I won’t say WP Engine is blameless in the wider world of WordPress and open source, I didn’t leave there on a whim after all. The nature of the attack on them now, however, is beyond the pale. It finally shows the world what WordPress really is, an abusive, predatory organization/community lying about its virtues to abuse other companies and organizations in an effort to get free work.</p><p>The truth is that WordPress is, at best, past its peak and we’re going to see more fights between the companies in its orbit as they each battle for a larger slice of a shrinking pie. That isn’t something anyone can change with its current leadership and project structure.</p><h2 id="so-long-wordpress">So Long WordPress</h2><p>With this action I finally see that there is no helping the situation and I fear that my continued involvement can only serve to signal to others that their own work and efforts are both safe and worthwhile. They are neither. I won’t be responsible for leading good people to an abusive ecosystem.</p><p>With this I’ve archived my last remaining WordPress projects, Kana and the theme for this site, until such a time as there is proper governance in the WordPress project. I’ve also stepped back and will no longer contribute to Meetups or other WordPress events (<a href="https://chriswiegman.com/2024/06/back-to-speaking/">something I was excited about rejoining just this past summer</a>). I’ve even stopped moderating jobs.wordpress.net, something I had done almost daily since the summer of 2013.</p><p>Should the project find new life, preferably with lesser ambitions that a huge share of the whole internet, and competent governance in the spirit of the virtues it claims to represent I will rethink my position. For now, however, <strong>So Long WordPress, and thanks for all the fish</strong>.</p><h2 id="a-note-to-the-many-good-people-still-in-wordpress">A note to the many good people still in WordPress</h2><p>Finally, a note to the many good people still working in WordPress:</p><p>Thank you, all of you, for the years of conversation and support. While I speak of WordPress as a whole there are many of you both individually and in smaller communities that have done so much for the people in WordPress. I look forward to continuing conversations and support for your work in the future, regardless of where we all wind up.</p><p>I do, however, ask that you please consider the effects your actions have on others and be careful not to lead new victims to future abuse.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				<h3>from the <i>that's-not-how-it-works</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>The NY Times has real difficulty not misrepresenting Section 230. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/06/another-day-another-ridiculous-ny-times-opinion-piece-that-is-confused-about-section-230-free-speech-online/">Over</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/13/ny-times-publishes-second-blatantly-incorrect-trashing-section-230-day-after-first-incorrect-article/">over</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/03/06/why-does-ny-times-seem-literally-incapable-reporting-accurately-section-230/">over</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/10/29/ny-times-continues-inability-to-report-accurately-section-230-content-moderation/">over</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/09/11/ny-times-got-it-backwards-section-230-helps-limit-spread-hate-speech-online/">over</a> again it has misrepresented how Section 230 works, even having to once run this astounding correction (to an article that had a half-page headline saying Section 230 was at fault):</p>
<div>
<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/7c3c67c0-30e7-4759-8ccb-20e3eb5d5f2d-RackMultipart20241026-165-31sqs8.png?ssl=1" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>A day later, it had to run another correction on a different article also misrepresenting Section 230:</p>
<div>
<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/ba1ed61c-a51c-4054-a911-b3db1b9e00e9-RackMultipart20241026-149-ok91so.png?ssl=1" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>You would think with all these mistakes and corrections that the editors at the NY Times might take things a bit more slowly when either a reporter or a columnist submits a piece purportedly about Section 230.</p>
<p>Apparently not.</p>
<p>Julia Angwin has done some amazing reporting on privacy issues in the past and has exposed plenty of legitimately bad behavior by big tech companies. But, unfortunately, she appears to have been sucked into nonsense about Section 230.</p>
<p>She recently wrote a terribly misleading opinion piece, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/opinion/tiktok-meta-social-media-law.html?unlocked_article_code=1.T04.otNY.oQ-Di6hLTB_u&amp;smid=url-share">bemoaning social media algorithms</a> and blaming Section 230 for their existence. The piece is problematic and wrong on multiple levels. It’s disappointing that it ever saw the light of day without someone pointing out its many flaws.</p>
<p><strong>A history lesson:</strong></p>
<p>Before we get to the details of the article, let’s take a history lesson on recommendation algorithms, because it seems that many people have very short memories.</p>
<p>The early internet was both great and a mess. It was great because anyone could create anything and communicate with anyone. But it was a mess because that came with a ton of garbage and slop. There were attempts to organize that information and make it useful. Things like Yahoo became popular not because they had a search engine (that came later!) but because they were an attempt to “organize” the internet (Yahoo originally stood for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle”, recognizing that there were lots of attempts to “organize” the internet at that time).</p>
<p>After that, searching and search algorithms became a central way of finding stuff online. In its simplest form, search is a recommendation algorithm based on the keywords you provide run against its index. In the early days, Google cracked the code to make that recommendation algorithm for content on the wider internet.</p>
<p>The whole point of a search recommendation is “the algorithm thinks these are the most relevant bits of content for you.”</p>
<p>The next generation of the internet was content in various silos. Some of those were user-generated silos of content, such as Facebook and YouTube. And some of them were professional content, like Netflix or iTunes. But, once again, it wasn’t long before users felt overwhelmed with the sheer amount of content at their fingertips. Again, they sought out recommendation algorithms to help them find the relevant or “good” content, and to avoid the less relevant “bad” content. Netflix’s algorithm isn’t very different from Google’s recommendation engine. It’s just that, rather than “here’s what’s most relevant for your search keywords,” it’s “here’s what’s most relevant based on your past viewing history.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Netflix somewhat famously perfected the content recommendation algorithm in those years, even <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2006/10/02/winner-take-all-outsourcing-netflix-will-pay-1-million-to-whoever-improves-their-recommendation-engine/">offering up a $1 million prize</a> to anyone who could build a better version. Years later, a team of researchers <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2009/09/22/netflix-1-million-award-shows-the-value-of-collaboration-but-kicks-up-new-privacy-questions/">won the award</a>, but Netflix <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2012/04/13/why-netflix-never-implemented-algorithm-that-won-netflix-1-million-challenge/">never implemented it</a>, saying that the marginal gains in quality were not worth the expense.</p>
<p>Either way, though, it was clearly established that the benefit and the curse of the larger internet is that in enabling anyone to create and access content, too much content is created for anyone to deal with. Thus, <em>curation</em> and <em>recommendation</em> is absolutely necessary. And handling both at scale requires some sort of algorithms. Yes, some personal curation is great, but it does not scale well, and the internet is all about scale.</p>
<p>People also seem to forget that recommendation algorithms aren’t just telling you what content they think you’ll <em>want</em> to see. They’re also helping to minimize the content you probably <em>don’t want to see</em>. Search engines choosing which links show up first are also choosing which links they won’t show you. My email is only readable because of the recommendation engines I run against it (more than just a spam filter, I also run algorithms that automatically put emails into different folders based on likely importance and priority).</p>
<p>Algorithms aren’t just a necessary part of making the internet usable today. They’re a key part of improving our experiences.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes algorithms get things wrong. They could recommend something you don’t want. Or demote something you do. Or maybe they recommend some problematic information. But sometimes people get things wrong too. Part of internet literacy is recognizing that what an algorithm presents to you is just a suggestion and not wholly outsourcing your brain to the algorithm. If the problem is people outsourcing their brain to the algorithm, it won’t be solved by outlawing algorithms or adding liability to them.</p>
<p>It being just a suggestion or a recommendation is also important from a legal standpoint: because recommendation algorithms are simply <em>opinions</em>. They are opinions of what content that algorithm thinks is most relevant to you at the time based on what information it has at that time.</p>
<p>And <em>opinions</em> are protected free speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>If we held anyone liable for opinions or recommendations, we’d have a massive speech problem on our hands. If I go into a bookstore, and the guy behind the counter recommends a book to me that makes me sad, I have no legal recourse, because no law has been broken. If we say that tech company algorithms mean they should be liable for their recommendations, we’ll create a huge mess: spammers will be able to sue if email is filtered to spam. Terrible websites will be able to sue search engines for downranking their nonsense.</p>
<p>On top of that, First Amendment precedent has long been clear that the only way a distributor can be held liable for <em>even harmful</em> recommendation is if the distributor had <em>actual knowledge of the law-violating nature of the recommendation</em>.</p>
<p>I know I’ve discussed this case before, but it always gets lost in the mix. In <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/938/1033/294363/">Winter v. GP Putnam</a>, the Ninth Circuit said a publisher was not liable for publishing a mushroom encyclopedia that literally “recommended” people eat poisonous mushrooms. The issue was that the publisher had no way to know that the mushroom was, in fact, inedible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We conclude that the defendants have no duty to investigate the accuracy of the contents of the books it publishes. A publisher may of course assume such a burden,&nbsp; but there is nothing inherent in the role of publisher or the surrounding legal doctrines to suggest that such a duty should be imposed on publishers. Indeed the cases uniformly refuse to impose such a duty.&nbsp; Were we tempted to create this duty, the gentle tug of the First Amendment and the values embodied therein would remind us of the social costs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not hard to transpose this to the internet. If Google recommends a link that causes someone to poison themselves, precedent says we can hold the <em>author</em> liable, but <em>not the distributor/recommender</em> unless they have actual knowledge of the illegal nature of the content. Absent that, there is nothing to actually sue over.</p>
<p>And, that’s good. Because you can’t demand that anyone recommending anything know with certainty whether or not the content they are recommending is good or bad. That puts way too much of a burden on the recommender, and makes the mere process of recommending <em>anything</em> a legal minefield.</p>
<p>Note that the issue of Section 230 does not come up even once in this history lesson. All that Section 230 does is say that websites and users (that’s important!) are immune from their editorial choices for third party content. That doesn’t change the underlying First Amendment protections for their editorial discretion, it just allows them to get cases tossed out earlier (at the very earliest motion to dismiss stage) rather than having to go through expensive discovery/summary judgment and possibly even all the way to trial.</p>
<p><strong>Section 230 isn’t the issue here:</strong></p>
<p>Now back to Angwin’s piece. She starts out by complaining about Mark Zuckerberg talking up Meta’s supposedly improved algorithms. Then she takes the trite and easy route of dunking on that by pointing out that Facebook is full of AI slop and clickbait. That’s true! But… that’s got nothing to do with legal liability. That simply has to do with… how Facebook works and how you use Facebook? My Facebook feed has no AI slop or clickbait, perhaps because I don’t click on that stuff (and I barely use Facebook). If there was no 230 and Facebook were somehow incentivized to do less algorithmic recommendation, feeds would still be full of nonsense. That’s why the algorithms were created in the first place. Indeed, studies have shown that when you remove algorithms, feeds are filled with more nonsense, because the algorithms don’t filter out the crap any more.</p>
<p>But Angwin is sure that Section 230 is to blame and thinks that if we change it, it will magically make the algorithms better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our legal system is starting to recognize this shift and hold tech giants responsible for the effects of their algorithms — a significant, and even possibly transformative, development that over the next few years could finally force social media platforms to be answerable for the societal consequences of their choices.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s back up and start with the problem.</em> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/ag/department-justice-s-review-section-230-communications-decency-act-1996"><em>Section 230, a snippet of law</em></a> <em>embedded in the 1996 Communications Decency Act, was initially intended to protect tech companies from defamation claims related to posts made by users. That protection made sense in the early days of social media, when we largely chose the content we saw, based on whom we “friended” on sites such as Facebook. Since we selected those relationships, it was relatively easy for the companies to argue they should not be blamed if your Uncle Bob insulted your strawberry pie on Instagram.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, this is wrong. From the earliest days of the internet, we always relied on recommendation systems and moderation, as noted above. And “social media” didn’t even come into existence until years after Section 230 was created. So, it’s not just wrong to say that Section 230’s protections made sense for early social media, it’s backwards.</p>
<p>Also, it is somewhat misleading to call Section 230 “a snippet of law embedded in the 1995 Communications Decency Act.” Section 230 was an entirely different law, designed to be a replacement for the CDA. It was the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act and was put forth by then Reps. Cox and Wyden as an alternative to the CDA. Then, Congress, in its infinite stupidity, took both bills and merged them.</p>
<p>But it was also intended to help protect companies from being sued <em>for recommendations</em>. Indeed, two years ago, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252645/20230119135536095_21-1333%20bsac%20Wyden%20Cox.pdf">Cox and Wyden explained this</a> to the Supreme Court in a case about recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At the same time, Congress drafted Section 230 in a technology-neutral manner that would enable the provision to apply to subsequently developed methods of presenting and moderating user-generated content. The targeted recommendations at issue in this case are an example of a more contemporary method of content presentation. Those recommendations, according to the parties, involve the display of certain videos based on the output of an algorithm designed and trained to analyze data about users and present content that may be of interest to them.</em> <strong><em>Recommending systems that rely on such algorithms are the direct descendants of the early content curation efforts that Congress had in mind when enacting Section 230</em></strong><em>. And because Section 230 is agnostic as to the underlying technology used by the online platform, a platform is eligible for immunity under Section 230 for its targeted recommendations to the same extent as any other content presentation or moderation activities.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the idea that 230 wasn’t meant for recommendation systems is wrong and ahistorical. It’s strange that Angwin would just claim otherwise, without backing up that statement.</p>
<p>Then, Angwin presents a very misleading history of court cases around 230, pointing out cases where Section 230 has been successful in getting <em>bad</em> cases dismissed at an early stage, but in a way that makes it sound like the cases would have succeeded absent 230:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Section 230 now has been used to shield tech from consequences for facilitating deadly</em> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/18-15175/18-15175-2019-08-20.html#:~:text=content%2Dneutral%20tools.-,DYROFF%20V.,drug%20transactions%20was%20not%20plausible."><em>drug sales</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/herrick-v-grindr-why-section-230-communications-decency-act-must-be-fixed"><em>sexual harassment</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5984807/Armslist-Decision.pdf"><em>illegal arms sales</em></a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/15-1724/15-1724-2016-03-14.html"><em>human trafficking</em></a><em>. And in the meantime, the companies grew to be some of the most valuable in the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But again, these links misrepresent and misunderstand how Section 230 functions under the umbrella of the First Amendment. None of those cases would have succeeded under the First Amendment, again because the companies had no actual knowledge of the underlying issues, and thus could not be held liable. All Section 230 did was speed up the resolution of those cases, without stopping the plaintiffs from taking legal action against <em>those actually responsible for the harms.</em></p>
<p>And, similarly, we could point to another list of cases where Section 230 “shielded tech firms from consequences” for things <strong>we want them shielded from consequences</strong> on, like <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/10/section-230-protects-gmails-spam-filter-rnc-v-google.htm">spam filters</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/08/20/appeals-court-says-course-twitter-can-kick-racists-off-platform/">kicking Nazis off your platform</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/15/court-to-rfk-jr-fact-checking-doesnt-violate-1st-amendment-nor-does-section-230-make-meta-a-state-actor/">fact-checking vaccine misinformation</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/07/23/section-230-works-russian-trolls-dont-get-to-sue-facebook-being-kicked-off-facebook/">election denial disinformation</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/22/changing-section-230-wont-make-internet-kinder-gentler-place/">removing hateful content</a> and much much more. Remove 230 and you lose that ability as well. And those two functions are tied together at the hip. You can’t get rid of the protections for the stuff Julia Angwin says is bad without also losing the protections for things we want to protect. At least not without violating the First Amendment.</p>
<p>This is the part that 230 haters refuse to understand. Platforms rely on the immunity from liability that Section 230 gives them to <em>make editorial decisions on all sorts of content</em>. Yet, somehow, they think that taking away Section 230 would magically lead to more removals of “bad” content. That’s the opposite of true. Remove 230 and things like removing hateful information, putting in place spam filters, and stopping medical and election misinfo becomes a bigger challenge, since it will cost much more to defend (even if you’d win on First Amendment grounds years later).</p>
<p>Angwin’s issue (as is the issue with so many Section 230 haters) is that she wants to blame tech companies for harms <strong>created by users</strong> of those technologies. At its simplest level, Section 230 is just <strong>putting the liability on the party actually responsible</strong>. Angwin’s mad because she’d rather blame tech companies than the people actually selling drugs, sexually harassing people, selling illegal arms or engaging in human trafficking. And I get the instinct. Big tech companies suck. But pinning liability on them won’t fix that. It’ll just allow them to get out of having important editorial discretion (making everything worse) while simultaneously building up a bigger legal team, making sure competitors can never enter the space.</p>
<p>That’s the underlying issue.</p>
<p>Because if you blame the tech companies, you don’t get less of those underlying activities. You get companies who won’t even look to moderate such content, because that would be used in lawsuits against them as a sign of “knowledge.” Or if the companies do decide to more aggressively moderate, you would get any attempt to speak out about sexual harassment blocked (goodbye to the #MeToo movement… is that what Angwin really wants?)</p>
<p><strong>Changing 230 would make things worse, not better:</strong></p>
<p>From there, Angwin takes the absolutely <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/29/third-circuits-section-230-tiktok-ruling-deliberately-ignores-precedent-defies-logic/">batshit crazy 3rd Circuit opinion in Anderson v. TikTok</a>, which <em>explicitly ignored</em> a long list of other cases based on misreading a non-binding throwaway line in a Supreme Court ruling, and gave no other justification for its ruling, as being a good thing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the court holds platforms liable for their algorithmic amplifications, it could prompt them to limit the distribution of noxious content such as nonconsensual nude images and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/06/opinion/fear-speech-social-media.html">dangerous lies intended to incite violence</a>. It could force companies, including TikTok, to ensure they are not algorithmically promoting harmful or discriminatory products. And, to be fair, it could also lead to some overreach in the other direction, with platforms having a greater incentive to censor speech.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except, it won’t do that. Because of the First Amendment it does the opposite. The First Amendment requires actual knowledge of the violative actions and content, so doing this will mean two things: companies taking either a much less proactive stance or, alternatively, taking one that will be much quicker to remove any controversial content (so goodbye #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter or protests against the political class).</p>
<p>Even worse, Angwin seems to have spoken to no one with actual expertise on this if she thinks this is the end result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My hope is that the erection of new legal guardrails would create incentives to build platforms that give control back to users. It could be a win-win: We get to decide what we see, and they get to limit their liability.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who is actively working to help create systems that give control back to users, I will say flat out that Angwin gets this backwards. Without Section 230 it becomes way more difficult to do so. Because the users themselves would now face much greater liability, and unlike the big companies, the users won’t have buildings full of lawyers willing and able to fight such bogus legal threats.</p>
<p>If you face liability for giving users more control, users get less control.</p>
<p>And, I mean, it’s incredible to say we need legal guardrails and less 230 and then say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the meantime, there are alternatives. I’ve already moved most of my social networking to</em> <a href="https://bsky.social/about/"><em>Bluesky</em></a><em>, a platform that allows me to manage</em> <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation"><em>my content moderation settings</em></a><em>. I also subscribe to several</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/opinion/social-media-algorithm-choice.html"><em>other feeds</em></a> <em>— including one that provides news from verified news organizations and another that shows me what posts are popular with my friends.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, controlling our own feeds is a bit more work than passive viewing. But it’s also educational. It requires us to be intentional about what we are looking for — just as we decide which channel to watch or which publication to subscribe to.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/06/why-im-joining-the-bluesky-board-to-support-a-vision-of-a-more-open-decentralized-internet/">board member of Bluesky</a>, I can say that those content moderation settings and the ability for others to make feeds and for them to be available for Angwin to choose what she wants are possible in large part due to Section 230. Without Section 230 to protect both Bluesky and its users, it makes it much more difficult to defend lawsuits over those feeds.</p>
<p>Angwin literally has this backwards. Without Section 230, is Bluesky as open to offering up third-party feeds? Are they as open to allowing users to create their own feeds? Under the world that Angwin claims to want, where platforms have to crack down on “bad” content, it would be a lot more legally risky to allow user control and third-party feeds. Not because providing the feeds would lead to legal losses, but without 230 it would encourage more bogus lawsuits, and cost way more to get those lawsuits tossed out under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Bluesky doesn’t have a building full of lawyers like Meta has. If Angwin got her way, Bluesky would need that if it wanted to continue offering the features Angwin claims she finds so encouraging.</p>
<p>This is certainly not the first time that the NY Times has directly misled the public about how Section 230 works. But Angwin certainly <em>knows</em> many of the 230 experts in the field. It appears she spoke to none of them and wrote a piece that gets almost everything backwards. Angwin is a powerful and important voice towards fixing many of the downstream problems of tech companies. I just wish that she would spend some time understanding the nuances of 230 and the First Amendment to be more accurate in her recommendations.</p>
<p>I’m quite happy that Angwin likes Bluesky’s approach to giving power to end users. I only wish she wasn’t advocating for something that would make that way more difficult.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p><em>Background: I’m Kyle, the founder of OpenPipe. OpenPipe is a managed fine-tuning service that makes it easy to build your own LLMs that achieve very high accuracy on a specific task. In this post we’ll go under the covers and explain RLHF, which is one of the techniques we use to accomplish this.</em></p><p>What do the following Hacker News stories have in common?</p><p>None reached the front page; in fact none of them even got any upvotes! But <strong>they were all identified by a fine-tuned model as being likely to do well on HN</strong>. And subjectively (as someone who spends far more time on HN than I should) I actually agree with the model on this one; those all look like stories that deserved more attention than they got.</p><p>In this post we’ll discuss how to build a <!--$--><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/reward_trainer" rel="noopener">reward model</a><!--/$--> that can predict the upvote count that a specific HN story will get. And in follow-up posts in this series, we’ll use that reward model along with reinforcement learning to create a model that can write high-value HN stories!</p><h3>RL and RLHF: A 2-Minute Intro</h3><p><!--$--><a href="https://huggingface.co/tasks/reinforcement-learning" rel="noopener">Reinforcement learning</a><!--/$--> (RL) is a set of ML techniques that improves a model's performance by letting it take actions in an environment, and then get rewarded or penalized for those actions. Based on the rewards or penalties, the model’s behavior is updated over time to (hopefully) do more of the actions that are rewarded, and avoid those that are penalized.</p><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) was developed by OpenAI and first described <!--$--><a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-from-human-preferences/" rel="noopener">here</a><!--/$--> as a way of adapting RL techniques to LLMs specifically. The first key step is to develop a <!--$--><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/reward_trainer" rel="noopener">reward model</a><!--/$-->, which is a model that takes an input and output from an LLM, and tries to predict how “good” the output is. The “human feedback” part of RLHF refers to using humans to rate or compare outputs, and using that human preference data to train reward models. However, there are often other signals you can use to determine an output’s quality and train your model, as we’ll see.</p><p>Once you have a reward model, the second step is to use it to improve the performance of your generation model, by training your model to create outputs that have a higher reward on average. There are lots of techniques possible here depending on your domain and the tools you have available—we’ll cover these in the next post!</p><h3>Whence Data?</h3><p>To train a good reward model, the most critical input is <strong>high-quality feedback data</strong>. This can take many forms. At OpenPipe we have some customers building “co-pilot” or autocomplete flows, where the model suggests an action that the user can accept or reject. In this case, tracking whether an output was accepted or rejected is a great signal. For certain applications like chatbots or recommendation systems, you can proactively offer the user several potential outputs to choose from, and use which option they preferred as your feedback signal.</p><p>In our case we’ll go with a readily available dataset: HN stories along with their upvote counts. Upvote counts are a great reward signal; while they’re somewhat noisy, upvote count is usually correlated with post quality. For convenience in this project, I’ve scraped every HN post and comment ever (all 41 million of them!) and uploaded the full set <!--$--><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenPipe/hacker-news" rel="noopener">here</a><!--/$-->. Using <!--$--><a href="https://pola.rs/" rel="noopener">Polars</a><!--/$-->, let’s take a quick look at how many posts and comments we have(1):</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,0cjXCFjnUcqeVy47SLH96YNpvdw.png" data-framer-height="622" data-framer-width="1206" height="311" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/0cjXCFjnUcqeVy47SLH96YNpvdw.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/0cjXCFjnUcqeVy47SLH96YNpvdw.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/0cjXCFjnUcqeVy47SLH96YNpvdw.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/0cjXCFjnUcqeVy47SLH96YNpvdw.png 1206w" width="603" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><h3>Defining the Task</h3><p>Ok, we have 5 million stories, that’s plenty to train a model! But we also have a problem. Our dataset has the story title, URL, date and submitter, but for most of the stories it doesn’t have the content, because it’s just an off-platform link. This might cause trouble for our reward model; a story’s content is often very important to whether users choose to upvote it or not. Without that information the reward model might not be able to make a good prediction!</p><p>One option would be to scrape the URLs for those 5 million posts (and hope they still exist). But to simplify, instead I’ll just limit to stories that have only text bodies, instead of links. That leaves us with ~150K stories to deal with.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,G6Zgc0MOhvkT5p4kCFfiuzrbZ2g.png" data-framer-height="573" data-framer-width="1754" height="286" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/G6Zgc0MOhvkT5p4kCFfiuzrbZ2g.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/G6Zgc0MOhvkT5p4kCFfiuzrbZ2g.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/G6Zgc0MOhvkT5p4kCFfiuzrbZ2g.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/G6Zgc0MOhvkT5p4kCFfiuzrbZ2g.png 1754w" width="877" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><p>Nice, that should be manageable! Let’s take a look at how those are distributed chronologically:</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,FbKFUkZPfeL9a1UuvFvZkhdaBs.png" data-framer-height="1470" data-framer-width="2970" height="735" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/FbKFUkZPfeL9a1UuvFvZkhdaBs.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/FbKFUkZPfeL9a1UuvFvZkhdaBs.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/FbKFUkZPfeL9a1UuvFvZkhdaBs.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/FbKFUkZPfeL9a1UuvFvZkhdaBs.png?scale-down-to=2048 2048w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/FbKFUkZPfeL9a1UuvFvZkhdaBs.png 2970w" width="1485" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><p><strong>Woah</strong>, the graph looks remarkably flat… as long as you focus on the 2008-2015 period, or 2016-2024 period. But in 2015 there is a stark discontinuity, where the number of stories (with text) shoots up by &gt;10x, and the average score drops by 5x! Is this some kind of <!--$--><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" rel="noopener">eternal September</a><!--/$-->?</p><p>To avoid potential data drift issues from that discontinuity, we’ll limit our dataset to the post-2016 stories. That way the model we create will be more attuned to what makes an HN story good or bad <em>today</em>, which will be helpful for future posts in the series.</p><p>Next, let’s quickly plot the distribution of story scores. For the rest of this exercise we’ll actually use the <strong>natural log of post score</strong> as the number we’re tracking, instead of the raw score itself. This smooths out the distribution a bit, which will hopefully make life easier for our model. Effectively, this transformation means that its task will be to predict the “order of magnitude” of a score rather than the score directly. This intuitively maps more closely to what we want, which is a prediction of the “order of magnitude” of a post’s score. A model that can tell us whether a story should get popular at all is more tractable than one that tries to guess whether it will get 120 vs 200 upvotes (a harder task).</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,wgwpMwqZBHayeABYiwohFXlJA.png" data-framer-height="569" data-framer-width="1769" height="284" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/wgwpMwqZBHayeABYiwohFXlJA.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/wgwpMwqZBHayeABYiwohFXlJA.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/wgwpMwqZBHayeABYiwohFXlJA.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/wgwpMwqZBHayeABYiwohFXlJA.png 1769w" width="884" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><h3>Training the Model</h3><p>Actually training the model is easy and fun! You can find the full code I used <!--$--><a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/best-hn/blob/main/stories_train_model_v3.py" rel="noopener">here</a><!--/$-->. A few things to call out:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Since this isn’t a generative task (we’re just trying to predict a single score, not a string of text) our model architecture options are wide open! We could use classic encoder models like <!--$--><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692" rel="noopener">RoBERTa</a><!--/$--> or <!--$--><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09543" rel="noopener">DeBERTaV3</a><!--/$-->, which are often used for this kind of problem. <strong>However</strong>, in practice I’ve found that modern LLMs that do well on generative tasks are also extremely strong on this kind of predictive task, so I’ve used <!--$--><a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B" rel="noopener">Llama 3.1 8B</a><!--/$--> here(2).</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>It’s super important that your training inputs includes all the information your model will need to make predictions. In this case, I included the post title, author, date, and content. All of those factors could be relevant to the chance a story gets voted up.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>I used the <!--$--><a href="https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel" rel="noopener">Liger Kernel</a><!--/$--> optimizations for both training and later inference. This sped up training time by ~30% and cut RAM usage significantly while maintaining model quality.</p></li></ul><p>Training on 114K stories for one epoch on an H100 on <!--$--><a href="https://www.runpod.io/" rel="noopener">Runpod</a><!--/$--> took about 1.5 hours and cost $4.05. That’s not much time for a model that (hopefully) understands all of HN!</p><p>We can also follow along the performance on our validation set as training happens:</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,pUUrTFODxi4Q2PACKEb2QTMGd4I.png" data-framer-height="842" data-framer-width="1398" height="421" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/pUUrTFODxi4Q2PACKEb2QTMGd4I.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/pUUrTFODxi4Q2PACKEb2QTMGd4I.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/pUUrTFODxi4Q2PACKEb2QTMGd4I.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/pUUrTFODxi4Q2PACKEb2QTMGd4I.png 1398w" width="699" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><p>The model finishes with a root mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.11. Remember, we’re asking the model to predict log(score). To translate that back to its accuracy on the real score we reverse the log: <em>e</em>^1.11 ~= 3. This means that <em>on average</em>, our model’s predicted score is off by a factor of <strong>3</strong>. Is that still good enough to be useful? We'll see!</p><h3>Running Inference</h3><p>Let’s see what our model thinks of all the HN stories! I used <!--$--><a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/best-hn/blob/main/inference.py" rel="noopener">this code</a><!--/$--> to run our model against the entire corpus of HN stories. I found that using the <!--$--><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index" rel="noopener">Transformers</a><!--/$--> library, along with the Liger Kernels we used for training gave adequate performance without resorting to an inference-focused library like <!--$--><a href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang" rel="noopener">sglang</a><!--/$-->. I again ran this on an H100 on RunPod, and it only took 15 minutes to process all 140K stories in the corpus.</p><p>Ok, let’s limit to our test set and see how well our model does at predicting scores! Here’s a heatmap comparing the model’s predicted log(Score) on the Y-axis to the real log(Score) on the X-axis:</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,pNpLANmHNfqWhOQC5OtE1BCVc4.png" data-framer-height="1170" data-framer-width="1750" height="585" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/pNpLANmHNfqWhOQC5OtE1BCVc4.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/pNpLANmHNfqWhOQC5OtE1BCVc4.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/pNpLANmHNfqWhOQC5OtE1BCVc4.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/pNpLANmHNfqWhOQC5OtE1BCVc4.png 1750w" width="875" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><p>Interesting! The correlation is actually not bad (0.53), but our model is very consistently over-estimating the score at the low end, and underestimating it at the high end. This is surprising; some variation on any given data point is expected, but such a consistent mis-estimation trend isn’t what we’d expect.</p><p>What causes this? I don’t know for sure, but I suspect this is an artifact of the <strong>randomness in getting to the HN front page</strong>. You can think of a post’s predicted score as</p><p><code>predicted_score = (probability_of_hitting_front_page * final_score_if_it_hits_front_page)</code></p><p>Even if the model gets <em>extremely good</em> at predicting <code>final_score_if_it_hits_front_page</code>, there’s still the inherent randomness of <code>probability_of_hitting_front_page</code> that is fundamentally unpredictable. As a result, the model learns to “hedge its bets” by predicting a score somewhere between 0 and the “true” predicted score if this story were to hit the front page.</p><p>So, <strong>how good are the stories it picks</strong>? Let’s take a look!</p><h3>Let’s see the stories!</h3><p>How well does the model do on identifying great HN stories? Here are the top 10 stories it predicts as most successful, with both the predicted and actual score(3).</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,fsY5awADsmvk74RkQJiPtZXtRrM.png" data-framer-height="964" data-framer-width="1736" height="482" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/fsY5awADsmvk74RkQJiPtZXtRrM.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/fsY5awADsmvk74RkQJiPtZXtRrM.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/fsY5awADsmvk74RkQJiPtZXtRrM.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/fsY5awADsmvk74RkQJiPtZXtRrM.png 1736w" width="868" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (max-width: 1199px) 100vw"></p><p>Ok, those seem… interesting. It seems like the model has correctly identified that service complaints (8/10) and people talking about indie apps making money (2/10) very reliably make it to the front page, which all 10 apparently did!</p><p>We can also look at the top stories that the model believes should be successful, but actually fell through the cracks.

Still a lot of complaints (4/10) but some more interesting content as well. There are some good diamonds in the rough there that probably should have sparked more discussion like <!--$--><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33413945" rel="noopener">dealing with Machiavellian co-founders</a><!--/$-->, <!--$--><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28747573" rel="noopener">pushing through burn-out</a><!--/$-->, and <!--$--><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25162971" rel="noopener">recording a signal from a single electron</a><!--/$-->.</p><h2>Part 2: Writing a Great HN Post</h2><p>Our reward model helps us define what a good HN post looks like. Is there anything else we can do with it? <strong>Yes</strong>! A fundamental property of machine learning is that if something can be measured, it can be optimized!

<blockquote>
<p>PAYPHONES at High Volume</p>
<p>Existing sites! Earn BIG $$. Money Back Guarantee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dropshipping AliExpress watches, AI-generated SEO spam websites... marginally
legal and ethical passive income schemes, that serve to generate that income
mostly for their promoters, can feel like a modern phenomenon. The promise of
big money for little work is one of the fundamental human weaknesses, though,
and it has been exploited by "business coaches" and "investment promoters" for
about as long as the concept of securities has existed. We used to refer mostly
to the "get rich quick" scheme, but fashions change with the time, and at the
moment "passive income" is the watchword of business YouTubers and Instagram
advertising.</p>
<p>And what income is more passive than vending machine coin revenue? Automated
vending has had a bit of a renaissance, with social media influencers buying
old machines and turning them into a business. The split of their revenue
between vending machine income and social media sponsorship is questionable,
but it's definitely brought some younger eyes to an industry that is as rife
with passive income scams as your average spam folder. Perhaps it's the
enforcement efforts of the SEC, or perhaps today's youth just need a little
more time to advance their art, but I haven't so far seen a vending machine
hustle quite as financialized as the post-divestiture payphone industry.</p>
<p>For much of the history of the telephone system, payphones were owned and
operated by telephone carrier. As with the broader telephone monopoly, there
were technical reasons for this integration. Payphones, more specifically
called coin operated telephones, were "dumb" devices that relied on the
telephone exchange for control. In the case of a manual exchange, you would
pick up a payphone and ask the operator for your party---and they would advise
you of the price and tell you to insert coins. The coin acceptor in the
payphone used a simple electrical signaling scheme to notify the operator of
which and how many coins you had inserted, and it was up to the operator to
check that it was correct and connect the call. If coins needed to be returned
after the call, the operator would signal the phone to do so.</p>
<p>With the introduction of electromechanical and then digital exchanges, coin
control became automated, but payphones continued to use specialized signaling
schemes to communicate with the coin control system. They had to be connected
to special loops, usually called "coin lines," with the equipment to receive
and send these signals. The payphone itself was a direct extension of the
telephone system, under remote control of the exchange, much like later devices
like line concentrators. It was only natural that they would be operated by the
same company that operated the control system they relied on.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of things have changed about the payphone industry. The 1968
Carterfone decision revolutionized the telephone industry by allowing the
customer to connect their own device. Coin operated telephones in the
traditional sense were unaffected, but Carterfone opened the door to a whole
new kind of payphone.</p>
<p>In 1970, burglar alarm manufacturer Robotguard blazed the trail into a new
telephone business. They imported a Japanese payphone that was a little
different from the American models of the time: it implemented coin payment
internally. Robotguard connected the payphone through one of their burglar
alarm autodialers, a device that was already fully compliant with telephone
industry regulations, and then hooked it up to a Southwestern Bell telephone
line in a department store in in St. Louis. By inserting a dime, the phone was
enabled and you could make a local call (the autodialer was used, in part, to
limit dialing to 7 digits to ensure that only local calls were made).</p>
<p>Robotguard had done their homework, consulting the same law firm that
represented Carterfone in the 1968 case. They believed the scheme to be legal,
since the modified Japanese payphone behaved, to the telephone company, just
like any other customer-owned phone. The New York Times quotes Southwestern
Bell, whose attitude is perhaps best described as resignation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spokesmen for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, the operating company
in that area, acknowledge that the equipment is in the store, that it is
working as described and that it appears completely legal. There is nothing
they can do about it at this time, they say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was, indeed, nothing that they could do about it. Robotguard had
introduced the Customer-Owned Coin-Operated Telephone, or COCOT, to the United
States. Payphones were now a competitive business.</p>
<p>Despite a certain air of inevitability, COCOTs had a slow start. First, there
would indeed be an effort by telephone companies to legally restrict COCOTs.
This was never entirely successful, but did result in a set of state
regulations (and to a lesser extent, federal regulations related to
long-distance calls) that made the payphone business harder to get into. More
importantly, though, the technical capabilities of COCOTs were limited. The
Robotguard design could charge only a fixed fee per call, which made it a
practical necessity to limit the payphone to local calls. Telephone company
payphones, which allowed long-distance calls at a higher rate, had an
advantage. Long-distance calls were also typically billed by minute, which made
it important for a payphone to impose a time limit before charging more. These
capabilities were difficult to implement in a reasonably compact, robust device
in the 1970s.</p>
<p>A number of articles will tell you that COCOTs became far more common as a
result of payphone deregulation stemming from the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T. I would
love to hear evidence to the contrary, but from my research I believe this is a
misconception, or at least not the entire story. In fact, payphones were
deregulated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, but that was done in large
part because COCOTs were already common and telephone companies were unhappy
that conventional payphones were subject to rate regulation while COCOTs were
not [1].</p>
<p>Divestiture did definitely open the floodgates of COCOTs, although I think that
the advances in electronics around that time were also a significant factor in
their proliferation. In any case, several manufacturers introduced COCOTs in
1984 and 1985.</p>
<p>These later-generation COCOTs were significantly more sophisticated than the
mechanical system used by Robotguard. To the user, they were pretty much
indistinguishable from carrier-operated payphones, charging varying rates based
on call duration and local or long distance. This local simulation of the
telephone exchange's charging decisions required that each COCOT have, in
internal memory, a prefix and rate table to determine charges. Early examples
used ROM chips shipped by their manufacturer, but over time the industry
shifted to remote programming via modems. These sophisticated,
electronically-controlled coin operated phones that did not rely on an
exchange-provided coin line came to be known as "smart payphones" and even,
occasionally, as "smartphones."</p>
<p>Smart payphones greatly simplified payphone operations and were even adopted by
the established telephone companies, where they could save money compared to
the more complex exchange-controlled system. But they also made COCOTs
completely practical, as good to the consumer as any other payphone. As COCOTs
became remotely programmable, the payphone business started to feel like a way
to generate---dare I say it---passive income. All you had to do was collect the
coins. Well, that and keep the phone in working order, which would become a
struggle for the thinly staffed and overleveraged Payphone Service Providers
(PSPs) that would come to dominate the industry.</p>
<p>One of the new entrants into the payphone business was a company that
specialized in exactly the kind of remote management these new smart payphones
required: Jaroth Inc., which would do business as Pacific Telemanagement
Solutions or PTS. Today, PTS is the largest PSP in the United States, but that
isn't saying a whole lot. They enjoyed great success in the 1990s, though, and
were so well-positioned as a PSP in the '00s that they often purchased the
existing payphone fleet from former Bell Operating Companies that decided to
abandon the payphone business.</p>
<p>The 1990s were a good time for payphones, and they were also a good time for
investment scams. Loose enforcement of regulations around investment offerings,
the Dot Com Boom, and a generally strong economy created a lot of opportunities
for "telecom entrepreneurs" that were more interested in moving money than
information.</p>
<hr>
<p>The problem of 1990s telecommunications companies funded in unscrupulous ways
is not at all unique to payphones, although it did reach a sort of apex there.
I will take this opportunity to go on a tangent, one of those things that I
have always wanted to write an article about but have never quite had enough
material for: MMDS, the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service.</p>
<p>MMDS was, essentially, cable television upconverted to a microwave band and
then put through directional antennas. It was often marketed as "Wireless
Cable," sort of an odd term, but it was intended as a direct competitor to
conventional cable television. I think it's fair to call it an ancestor of what
we now call WISPs, using small roof-mounted parabolic antennas as an
alternative to costly CATV outside plant. Some MMDS installations literally
were early WISPs: MMDS could carry a modified version of DOCSIS.</p>
<p>Wireless cable got a pretty bad rap, though. If you pay attention to WISPs, you
will no doubt have noticed that while the low capital investment required can
enable beneficial competition, it also enables a lot of companies that you
might call "fly by night." Some start out with good intentions and just aren't
up to the task, while some come from "entrepreneurs" with a history of fraud,
but either way they end up collecting money and then disappearing with it.</p>
<p>MMDS had a <em>huge</em> problem with shady operators, and more often of the "history
of fraud" type. Supposed MMDS startups would take out television and newspaper
ads nationwide offering an incredible opportunity to invest in this exciting
new industry. The scam took different forms in the details, but the most common
model was to sell "shares" of a new MMDS company in the four-to-five-digit
range. Investors were told that the company was using the capital to build
out their network and would shortly have hundreds of customers.</p>
<p>In practice, most of these "MMDS startups" were in cities with powerful
incumbent cable companies and, even worse, preexisting MMDS operators using the
limited spectrum available for such a wideband service. They never had any
chance of getting a license, and didn't have anyone with the expertise to
actually build an MMDS system even if they got one. They just pocketed the
money and were next seen on a beach in Mexico or in prison, depending on the
whims of fortune.</p>
<p>These wireless cable schemes became so common, and so notorious, that if you
asked a lot of people what wireless cable was the two answers you'd get are
probably "no idea" and "an old scam."</p>
<hr>
<p>It only takes a brief look at newspaper archives to find that the payphone
industry was a little sketchy. There are constant, nationwide, near-identical
classified ads with text like "buy and retire now" and "$150k yearly potential"
and "CALL NOW!". Sometimes more than one appear back to back, and they're still
nearly identical. None of these ads give a company name or really anything but
a phone number, and the phone numbers repeat so infrequently that I suspect the
advertisers were intentionally rotating them. This was pretty much the
Craigslist "work from home" post of the era.</p>
<p>To understand payphone economics better, let's talk a little about how the
payphone business operated. Telephone companies had long run payphones on the
same payment model, by finding a location for the payphone (or being contacted
by the proprietor of a location) and then offering the location a portion of
revenue. In the case of incumbent telcos, this was often a fixed rate per
call. So someone owned the location and the payphone operator paid them in
the form of a royalty.</p>
<p>COCOTs enabled a somewhat more complex model. A COCOT might be located in a
business, connected to a telephone company line, and remotely programmed by a
service provider, all of which were different companies from the person that
actually collected the money. The revenue had to get split between all of these
parties somehow, but COCOTS weren't regulated and that was all a matter of
negotiation.</p>
<p>Much like the vending machine industry today, one of the most difficult parts
of making money with a payphone was actually finding a good location---one that
wasn't already taken by another operator. As more and more PSPs spread across
the country, this became more and more of a challenge. So you can imagine the
appeal of getting into the payphone hustle without having to do all that
location scouting and negotiation. Thus all the ads for payphone routes for
sale... ostensibly a turnkey business, ready to go.</p>
<p>Ah, but people with turnkey, profitable businesses don't tend to sell them.
Something is up.</p>
<p>Not all of these were outright scams, or at least I assume some of them
weren't. There probably were some PSPs that financed expansion by selling
or leasing rights to some of their devices. But there were also a lot of...
well, let's talk about the second largest PSP of the late '90s.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 1994, Charles Edwards of Atlanta, Georgia had an idea. His
history is obscure, but he seems to have been an experienced salesman, perhaps
in the insurance industry. He put his talent for sales to work raising capital
ETS Payphones, Inc., which would place and operate payphones on the behalf of
investors.</p>
<p>The deal was something like this: ETS identified locations for payphones and
negotiated an agreement to place them. Then, they sold the payphone itself,
along with rights to the location, to an investor for five to seven thousand
dollars a pop. ETS would then operate and maintain the payphone while paying
a fixed monthly lease to the investor who had purchased it---something like
$83 a month.</p>
<p>It was a great deal for the investors---they didn't need any expertise or
really to do any work, since ETS arranged the location, installed the phones,
and even collected the coins. In fact, most investors purchased phones in
cities far from where they lived, such was the convenience of the ETS model.
There was virtually no risk for investors, either. ETS promised a monthly
payment up front, and the contract said that they would refund the investor
if the payphone didn't work out.</p>
<p>The ETS network was far larger than just Edwards could manage. Most of the
investment deals were sold by independent representatives, the majority of them
insurance agents, who could pick it up as a side business to earn some
commission. Edwards sold nearly 50,000 payphones on this basis, many of them in
deals of over $100,000. Small-time investors convinced of the value by their
insurance agents, many of them retirees, put over $300 million into ETS from
1996 to 2000.</p>
<p>There was, as you might have guessed, a catch. One wonders if the payphones
were even real. I think that at least many of them were; ETS ran job listings
for payphone technicians in multiple cities and occasionally responded to press
inquiries and complaints about malfunctioning payphones bearing their logo.
Besides, the telecom industry recognized ETS as a huge PSP in terms of both
installed base and call volume.</p>
<p>What definitely wasn't real was the revenue. ETS was a ponzi scheme. In 2000,
the SEC went for Charles Edwards, showing that ETS had never been profitable.
Edwards sponsored a NASCAR team and directed millions of dollars in salary and
consulting fees to himself, but in the first half of 2000 ETS lost $33 million.
The monthly lease payments to investors were being made from the capital put in
by newer investors, and even that was drying up.</p>
<p>SEC v. ETS went on for six years, in good part due to an appeal to the Supreme
Court based on ETS' theory that a contract that paid a fixed, rather than
variable, monthly rate could not be considered a security. In 2006, Charles
Edwards was convicted of 83 counts of wire fraud and sentenced to thirteen
years in prison.</p>
<p>Edwards was far from the only coin-op fraudster. ETS was not unusual except in
that it managed to be the largest. When a class-action firm and several state
attorneys general went after ETS, their press releases almost always mentioned
a few other similar payphone schemes facing similar legal challenges. Remember
all of those classified ads? I suspect some of them <em>were</em> ETS, but ETS also
had a more sophisticated sales operation than two-line classified ads. Most of
them were probably from competitors.</p>
<p>The payphone industry crashed alongside ETS; ETS almost certainly would have
collapsed (albeit likely more slowly) even if it had been above board.
Increasing cellphone ownership from the '90s to '00s made payphones
increasingly obsolete, and more and more established telcos and PSPs decided to
drop payphones. One of the reasons for PTS's ascent was its willingness to buy
out operators who wanted out: in 2008, PTS bought most of AT&amp;T's fleet. In
2011, they bought most of Verizon's fleet. Almost every incumbent telephone
company got out of the payphone business and most of them sold to PTS.</p>
<p>Given all that, you might think that payphone scams were only a thing of the
'90s. And they mostly were, but you can imagine that there was an opportunity
for anyone who could adapt the ETS model to the internet age.</p>
<p>Pantheon Holdings did just that. It's even more difficult to untangle the early
days of Pantheon than it is ETS. Pantheon operated through a variety of shell
companies and brands, but "the Internet Machine Company" was perhaps the most
to the point. Around 2005, Pantheon built "internet kiosks" where customers
could check their email, print documents, and even make phone calls for a
nominal cash or credit card payment. Sometimes called "global business
centers," these kiosks were presented as an exciting business opportunity to
mostly elderly investors who were given the opportunity to buy one for just
$18,000.</p>
<p>Once again, the kiosks were real, but the revenue was not. Pantheon placed the
machines in low-traffic locations and did nothing to market them. By 2009, more
than a dozen people had been convicted of fraud in relation to Prometheus.</p>
<p>Prometheus kiosks still turn up on the junk market.</p>
<p>[1] I spent quite a bit of time researching the history of payphone regulation
to try to understand exactly what did change in 1984, how many COCOTs operated
and on what legal basis from 1970-1984, etc. I did not have much success. What
I can tell is that COCOTs were very rare prior to 1984 (so rare that the FCC
apparently didn't know of any, according to a 1984 memo, despite the 1970
example), and by the late '80s were very common. The FCC seems to have taken
the view, in 1984, that COCOTs had <em>always</em> been legal, and just weren't being
made or used on any significant scale. That's somewhat inconsistent, though,
with the fact that suddenly after 1984 divestiture a bunch of companies started
making COCOTs for the first time. My best guess right now is that from 1970-1984
COCOTs were probably legal but were something of a gray area because of the lack
of any regulations specifically applying to them. Some combination of divestiture
broadly "shaking up" the phone industry, electronics making COCOTs much more
feasible, and who knows what else lead multiple companies to get into the COCOT
business in the mid-'80s. That lead the FCC to issue a series of regulatory
opinions on COCOTs that consistently upheld them as legal, culminating in the
1996 act dropping payphone regulation entirely.</p>

<h2>2024.10.28: The sins of the 90s: <span>Questioning a puzzling claim about mass surveillance. #attackers #governments #corporations #surveillance #cryptowars</span></h2>
<p>Meredith Whittaker,
president of the Signal Foundation,
gave an interesting
<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/keynote-meredith-whittaker/">talk</a>
at NDSS 2024
titled "AI, Encryption, and the Sins of the 90s".</p>
<p>I won't try to summarize everything the talk is saying:
go watch the talk video yourself,
or at least read through the transcript.
But I'll say something here about
what the "sins" part of the talk's title is referring to.</p>
<p>The talk says that, in the 1990s,
"cryptosystems were still classified as munitions and subject to strict export controls".
The talk describes the "crypto wars" as
"a series of legal battles, campaigns, and policy debates that played out in the US across the 1990s",
resulting in "the liberalization of strong encryption in 1999",
allowing people to "develop and use strong encryption without being subject to controls".</p>
<p>OK, that sounds familiar.
Which parts are the "sins"?</p>
<p>Answer:
the talk claims that
"the legacy of the crypto wars was to trade privacy for encryption—and to usher in an age of mass corporate surveillance".</p>
<p>Wow.
That sounds bad, and surprising,
definitely something worth understanding better.
If cryptographic export controls had instead remained in place after 1999,
how would that have improved privacy and reduced corporate surveillance?</p>
<p>Answer:
the talk claims that,
without strong cryptography,
"the metastatic growth of SSL-protected commerce and
RSA-protected corporate databases would not have been possible".</p>
<p>Wait, what?
Let's look at the facts.</p>
<h2>1. Would commerce exist without strong cryptography?</h2>
<p>Internet commerce was already booming by 1999.
Let's look specifically at the history of Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon was founded in 1994.
Its initial public stock offering was in
<a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/566f6509-4b15-4cd4-929a-1cba79f822b2.pdf">1997</a>.
Amazon was sued
by Barnes &amp; Noble in
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/book-giant-attacks-amazon/">1997</a>,
and was sued
by Wal-Mart
in <a href="https://money.cnn.com/1998/10/16/companies/walmart/">1998</a>.
Bezos was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year
in <a href="https://time.com/archive/6737319/jeffrey-preston-bezos-1999-person-of-the-year/">1999</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bezos’ vision of the online retailing universe was so complete, his Amazon.com site so elegant and appealing, that it became from Day One the point of reference
for anyone who had anything to sell online. And that, it turns out, is everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon's
<a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/revenues_annual">revenue</a>
was
15.75 million dollars in 1996,
147.79 million dollars in 1997,
609.82 million dollars in 1998,
and 1.64 billion dollars in 1999.
Amazon was competently executing a business plan that from the outset
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazons-original-1997-letter-to-shareholders">explicitly prioritized growth</a>.</p>
<p>Where does anyone get the idea that
continued cryptographic export controls
would have stopped the growth of Internet commerce,
rather than simply limiting the <em>security level</em> of Internet commerce?
How do we reconcile this idea
with the observed facts of Amazon already growing rapidly in the 1990s?
The export controls were still in place;
to the extent that
Internet commerce was encrypted at all,
it was encrypted primarily with
a weak cryptosystem, namely 512-bit RSA.</p>
<p>Just to emphasize how fast Amazon's growth was at that point:
Amazon's revenue was more than doubling every year.
If that had kept up,
Amazon's revenue in 2023 would have been more than 26000000 billion dollars.
In reality, Amazon's revenue in 2023 was <em>only</em> 575 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, 575 billion dollars is a lot of money,
and Amazon is now
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/amazon-wins-partial-dismissal-us-ftcs-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-10-01/">fighting antitrust regulators</a>.
But how is Amazon's growth before and after 1999
a story about a change in cryptography regulation,
rather than a story about
customers liking a convenient shopping site
that provided fast, reasonably reliable deliveries
of an ever-expanding collection of products
at competitive prices?</p>
<p>These are natural questions
for anyone checking whether the talk's claims match the available evidence.
But the talk doesn't answer any of these questions.
Look, for example, at the full paragraph containing
the "would not have been possible" quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not that 1999 wasn’t a win, at least in a narrow sense. Indeed, we can craft a
counterfactual history in which the liberalization of encryption didn’t happen, in which we
instead accepted some janky, backdoored, government-standard cryptosystem—some
sad Clipper chip DES admixture—and that instead became the thing: a world in which
strong cryptosystems did not receive the benefit of many eyes and open scrutiny. But of
course the future from then to now would have been very different—not least of all
because the metastatic growth of SSL-protected commerce and RSA-protected
corporate databases would not have been possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from irrelevant details,
how is the "counterfactual history"
of a "janky, backdoored, government-standard cryptosystem"
different from the reality
of export-controlled cryptography in the late 1990s,
when <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45539-6_1">95%</a>
of SSL connections were limited to RSA-512?
The explosion of Internet commerce <em>was already happening</em> at that point.</p>
<p>Where does the "would not have been possible"
claim come from?
I'm not allergic to the phrase "of course",
but I try to limit it to cases where things are <em>really</em> obvious,
which is definitely not the situation here.</p>
<h2>2. Would commerce exist without security?</h2>
<p>Government regulations
are just one of many sources of weak cryptography.
Weak cryptography, in turn,
is just one of many sources of Internet-security failures.</p>
<p>Companies reported spending
<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/il/Documents/risk/cybersecurity-insights-2023-budgets-benchmarks-financial-services-institutions.pdf">more than 0.5% of revenue in 2023</a>
on things labeled as "cybersecurity".
A cybersecurity company named CrowdStrike accidentally
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-says-about-85-million-its-devices-affected-by-crowdstrike-related-2024-07-20/">took down millions of Windows computers</a>
in July 2024,
causing long service outages for many other companies.
CrowdStrike had been given control over all those computers
because it was saying that this would help
protect those computers against attacks.
Delta Airlines,
in a lawsuit filed this month against CrowdStrike,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/delta-airlines-crowdstrike-outage-lawsuit-43bb230d2edf235bb9f7928c4279fec2">said that</a>
the outage
"crippled its operations for several days,
costing more than $500 million in lost revenue and extra expenses".
Meanwhile there are endless reports of ransomware running rampant,
as illustrated by BlackCat
disrupting various health-care services for
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-ransomware-alphv-blackcat-pharmacy-outages/">weeks</a>
starting in February 2024.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the evident disruptions,
Internet commerce continues.</p>
<p>Do we want better security to stop the attacks?
Yes.
Does not having better security
mean that the entire system of Internet commerce will be destroyed?</p>
<p>Um, well, it's <em>conceivable</em> that there will be <em>such</em> a dramatic increase in attacks
that we'll all retreat to non-Internet commerce
(because, y'know, non-Internet commerce is secure).
But somehow the attackers don't seem interested in
killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</p>
<p>Let's rewind to 1999.
The CIH virus had destroyed data on
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-the-cih-virus-on-the-endangered-list/">a million computers</a>,
and was just one of many examples of attacks.
This didn't stop the Internet from skyrocketing in popularity;
it simply prompted effort to fix vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>One of the vulnerabilities at that time was the use of RSA-512.
From the perspective of stopping attacks,
this vulnerability was
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1000">important</a> to fix.
But, from the same perspective,
there were many other vulnerabilities
that were also important to fix,
including many that were
<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">cheaper to exploit</a>
than attacking RSA-512.
My own experience is that exploitable buffer overflows
were very easy to find back then.</p>
<p>Does it sound plausible if someone picks <em>one</em> of the system vulnerabilities in 1999
and claims that fixing <em>this</em> vulnerability
is what made the difference between Internet commerce succeeding
and Internet commerce failing?
I'd expect such a claim to be backed by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>evidence that Internet commerce was on such a knife's edge
  (rather than being a clear win for its convenience)
  and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an explanation of what was so special about <em>this</em> vulnerability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise the claim sounds like nothing more than wishful thinking
about the importance of some particular area of security.</p>
<h2>3. Would corporate databases exist without strong cryptography?</h2>
<p>Let's move on to the second part of the claim that,
without strong cryptography,
"the metastatic growth of SSL-protected commerce and
RSA-protected corporate databases would not have been possible".</p>
<p>The mass-surveillance industry is much older than 1999.
See, for example,
the book
<a href="https://ibmandtheholocaust.com/about-ibm-and-holocaust">"IBM and the Holocaust"</a>,
which traces how IBM's punch-card databases were used to
"organize nearly everything in Germany and then Nazi Europe,
from the identification of the Jews in censuses, registrations, and ancestral tracing programs to the
running of railroads and organizing of concentration camp slave labor".</p>
<p>Does a database not count as a "corporate database"
if the decisions of what's going into the database
are being made by a government,
in this case the Nazis?
Does that make the database less evil?
Also, does the level of evil depend on
whether this was a database operated <em>by IBM for the Nazis</em>
or a database operated <em>by the Nazis using technology provided by IBM</em>?
Somehow I don't think these distinctions mattered
for people in the concentration camps.</p>
<p>As the 20th century continued,
more and more powerful technology
made surveillance less and less expensive.
Here's a
<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11896/chapter/13#360">quote</a>
from a 2007 study
"Engaging privacy and information technology in a digital age",
issued by a committee formed by
the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in the late 1950s, the computer became a central tool of organizational surveillance. It addressed problems of space and time in the management of records and data analysis and fueled the trend of centralization of records. The power of databases to aggregate information previously scattered across diverse locations gave institutions the ability to create comprehensive personal profiles of individuals, frequently without their knowledge or cooperation. The possibility of the use of such power for authoritarian purposes awakened images of Orwellian dystopia in the minds of countless journalists, scholars, writers, and politicians during the 1960s, drawing wide-scale public attention to surveillance and lending urgency to the emerging legal debate over privacy rights.</p>
<p>One of the sectors that immediately benefited from the introduction of computer database technology was the credit-reporting industry. ...
But the credit and insurance industries were not alone. Banks, utility companies, telephone companies, medical institutions, marketing firms, and many other businesses were compiling national and regional dossiers about their clients and competitors in quantities never before seen in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely the 1960s surveillance dossiers
by "the credit-reporting industry"
and "marketing firms" and so on
count as examples of "corporate databases".</p>
<p>What's the mechanism by which continued cryptographic export controls
would have supposedly stopped the growth of surveillance?
How do we reconcile this with the observed facts
of government surveillance and corporate surveillance
already exploding in the second half of the 20th century,
when cryptographic export controls were in place?
Why does it matter for this growth whether databases were "RSA-protected" or not?
Or, more to the point, whether they were protected by
something stronger than RSA-512?</p>
<p>The talk doesn't answer any of these questions either.</p>
<h2>4. Getting personal</h2>
<p>I was, as the talk mentions,
one of the people fighting export controls in the 1990s.
The reason I was taking action
is that I had studied the situation and was troubled by it.
In particular,
I had concluded that the export controls were contributing to attacks.
If I was wrong about that,
then I'd like to understand why.</p>
<p>The talk claims that moving to stronger cryptography
had the negative effect of creating attacks:
specifically, of creating corporate mass surveillance.
I'd like to understand the rationale for this claim.
But I don't see where the talk explains the supposed mechanism,
or provides any evidence,
or addresses the contrary evidence
provided by 20th-century surveillance.</p>
<p>Beyond claiming that
the <em>actions</em> against export controls contributed to corporate surveillance,
the talk claims that these actions came from a narrow <em>perspective</em>
of seeing the government as the only problem.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The talk claims that
  "strategic mistakes in the 1990s—in particular, the mistake of
  trusting industry and 'the free market'
  while viewing the government as the sole threat to
  fundamental rights—is a big part of how we got here".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The talk criticizes the
  "dated, market-centric folk wisdom that is
  content to leave the governance of significant choices about fundamental rights—like
  expression and privacy—to a handful of private companies, assuming the invisible hand
  will work some BCorp magic".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The talk criticizes
  "conflating encryption with privacy and focusing narrowly on the tech itself—on
  encryption as the goal, not a means to the goal—while focusing concerns about privacy
  invasion solely on governments, assumed to be always on the verge of tyranny—while
  ignoring (or even celebrating) the interests of market actors".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In context,
the talk is attributing these perspectives to those of us fighting the "crypto wars".</p>
<p>Here the talk is simply wrong.
We're on record publicly explaining our goals,
and those records demonstrate a much broader perspective
than what the talk claims.</p>
<p>Consider, for example,
the 1993
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230917050735/https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">"Cypherpunk's Manifesto"</a>
from Eric Hughes.
The manifesto is all about real-world privacy.
Encryption isn't mentioned until the fifth paragraph;
it's one of multiple items that privacy is described as <em>relying</em> upon.
The next paragraph after that is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak
of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want
to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter
of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This document isn't "viewing the government as the sole threat":
it's explicitly stating the opposite.
It also isn't "conflating encryption with privacy".</p>
<p>As another example,
here's are some 1995 quotes from the first
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/export/1995/0922-cohn-1.txt">brief</a>
that my lawyers filed in <em>Bernstein v. U.S.</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The uses for cryptography range from protecting the privacy of
attorney/client correspondence, financial transactions and medical records
transmitted over wires, to preventing piracy of cable TV, cellular phone,
telephone lines or satellite signals.  Every bank ATM uses cryptography.
...
If the government is successful here, it will eliminate
anonymity, forcing citizens to reveal their private associations to the
government and others, including high-tech criminals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't "focusing concerns about privacy invasion solely on governments":
it explicitly includes other attackers.
As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit put it in its
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/export/1999/0506-order.html">1999 decision</a>
in the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we are surveilled by our government, by criminals, or by our neighbors,
it is fair to say that never has our
ability to shield our affairs from prying eyes been at such a
low ebb. The availability and use of secure encryption may
offer an opportunity to reclaim some portion of the privacy
we have lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government was the <em>defendant</em> in my court case.
That's because this was a court case
against regulations imposed by the government.
But the records show that we were considering a broader range of <em>attackers</em>.</p>
<p>Export regulations weren't the only problems
I started taking actions to address.
Example from 1993: I
<a href="https://seclists.org/interesting-people/1993/Jul/94">wrote</a>
<a href="https://seclists.org/interesting-people/1993/Jul/127">letters</a>
that stopped NIST's announced
<a href="https://www.mhonarc.org/archive/html/pem-dev/1993-06/msg00058.html">plan</a>
to give its DSA patent to PKP,
a partnership between Caro-Kann Corporation and the RSA corporation.
Example from 1995: I
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/gnu.misc.discuss/c/eW5MsGzJWoQ/m/HSW0FSdeR5QJ">helped</a>
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/gnu.misc.discuss/c/eW5MsGzJWoQ/m/usmbCdsq5UsJ">people</a>
understand that DH could be used as a replacement for RSA;
the DH patent was due to expire in 1997,
whereas the RSA patent wasn't due to expire until 2000.
Do these actions sound like
"ignoring (or even celebrating) the interests of market actors"?</p>
<p>The talk's narrative of supposed 1990s blindness
is everywhere in the talk,
not just in the quotes I've given above.
For example,
the talk says that 
"one of the world's most profitable business models" in 2024
is
"mass surveillance of a scale and granularity unimaginable in the 1990s".</p>
<p>"Unimaginable"?
Seriously?
How is this not the scale and granularity of surveillance
predicted by Orwell in the 1940s?</p>
<p>Oh, you want a surveillance-capitalism version?
Richard Stallman's 1997 essay
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html">"The right to read"</a>
started with a dystopian short story
about a future in which
"you could go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your books".
Here are two sentences from the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his software class, Dan had learned that each book had a copyright
monitor that reported when and where it was read, and by whom, to
Central Licensing. (They used this information to catch reading
pirates, but also to sell personal interest profiles to retailers.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's worldwide fine-grained surveillance
for an unholy alliance of
marketers and the government,
just like the reality in 2024.</p>
<h2>5. Searching for sources</h2>
<p>The talk has a general statement that it draws on analyses by
"Dr. Sarah Myers West, Dr. Chris Gilliard, Dr. Karina Rider, and Dr. Matthew Crain".
The talk transcript ends with a list of references and URLs.</p>
<p>One of those sources is Rider's 2016 master's thesis
<a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/items/b1857a13-d974-4d04-b4cc-d00e1560cf1c">"The Privacy Paradox: Privacy, Surveillance, and Encryption"</a>.
Rider searched Congressional hearings starting in 1993 for the word "encryption",
and then reviewed and summarized the arguments.</p>
<p>As an interesting example,
the thesis quotes
Microsoft lawyer Ira Rubinstein telling Congress in 1997
that "industry is in a position to assist law enforcement
and national security in achieving their objectives because we are able to
sell U.S. products in mass volume".</p>
<p>The thesis doesn't mention that
there was already a well-established tradition
of corporations making money by enabling government surveillance.
Remember IBM working with the Nazis?
How about IBM working with NSA
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20220805-nsa.html">to make DES weak enough for NSA to break</a>?</p>
<p>Regular readers of my blog will recall that,
in the 1990s,
NSA modified its export controls to create
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/export/dtn/V3N4_10_92.pdf">special exceptions</a>
for low-security cryptography from the RSA corporation,
specifically 40-bit RC2 and 40-bit RC4.
This was the result of a public
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240617211107/http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp93/rosenthal.html/">agreement</a>
between the government and the Software Publishers Association.
Presumably NSA was happy
solidifying the market position of cryptography that NSA could break.
It's not as if the corporations involved
were putting a higher priority on <em>security</em> than on <em>making money</em>.</p>
<p>As another example,
consider Project Shamrock,
in which
telegraph companies sent NSA copies of millions of telegrams,
even though the lawyers at three of those companies had
<a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94755_II.pdf#page=161">"recommended against participation because they considered the program
to be in violation of the law and FCC regulations"</a>.
That's a quote from a 400-page Congressional study
"Intelligence activities and the rights of Americans: Book II"
issued in 1976.</p>
<p>The arrangement between telegraph companies and NSA was secret for
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/how-a-30-year-old-lawyer-exposed-nsa-mass-surveillance-of-americans-in-1975/">decades</a>.
As one historian put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data created and collected by these firms
could be shared with the government quietly, protected from public scrutiny and outrage
by the twin concealments of classification and corporate secrecy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, oops, that isn't actually a quote about the telegraph companies.
It's a quote from the talk
that this blog post is commenting upon,
a quote specifically about what happened with Internet companies "following the 90s",
as if the mass-surveillance industry were something new.</p>
<p>For people who study the history and incentives,
it's completely unsurprising to see 21st-century examples
of corporations and governments working together on surveillance.
I mentioned some examples in a
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/talks.html#2012.09.24">2012 talk</a>.
The 2013 Snowden disclosures included
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">more examples</a>.
I'll take a moment here to recommend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj3PN5-n108">my own 2015 talk</a>
about the corporate incentives,
including further examples
of attack activities by corporations.
But the point I'd like to emphasize here is that
corporate surveillance was already burgeoning in the 20th century.
The surveillance scandals that Congress investigated in the 1970s
weren't just government scandals.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the thesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ability to ensure privacy for consumers in
market transactions against criminals was therefore paired with offers to work cooperatively with
government to ensure LEAs and intelligence agencies obtained decrypted communications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does "paired" mean?</p>
<p>Yes,
there was an overlap between
(1) the corporations asking Congress for freedom to sell strong cryptographic software
and
(2) the corporations offering to support government surveillance.
Sometimes the corporations were pointing to #2 as an argument for #1.</p>
<p>But "paired" sounds to me like it's saying
that one of these wouldn't exist without the other.
That's not true.
 #1 and #2 are each examples of
corporations pursuing their money-making goals;
neither one relies on the other.
The telegraph companies secretly delivering copies of telegrams to NSA
weren't selling cryptographic software.</p>
<p>The thesis continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Privacy from criminals in the market had the paradoxical effect of facilitating the contraction of
privacy from police surveillance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess this is the specific source of the surprising claim
highlighted at the beginning of this blog post,
namely that
"the legacy of the crypto wars was to trade privacy for encryption—and to usher in an age of mass corporate surveillance".
But, again,
what's the mechanism that's
supposed to have created this negative effect,
and how do we reconcile this with the observed facts of what was happening already?</p>
<p>The thesis continues by claiming that
"in the year 2000 ...
NSA began investing billions of dollars in secret efforts to break commercial
encryption systems".</p>
<p>No, 2000 isn't when that began.
Tanja Lange and I recently wrote a paper
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">"Safe curves for elliptic-curve cryptography"</a>,
including an appendix that summarizes
NSA's resources in the mid-1990s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federation of American Scientists used public data to conclude in 1996 [98]
that the "NSA budget is around $3.6 billion", including "roughly 20,000
direct-hire NSA staff". Even if personnel expenses for an average staff member
were as high as $100000, NSA would have had $1.6 billion in 1996 to spend on
equipment.</p>
<p>Declassification requests by journalists led to partial declassification in 2013
of internal NSA history books from 1998 and 1999. These books confirm the
20,000 number; see, e.g., [145, page 23]. These books also say [146, page 291]
that NSA spent $199 million in 1984 on a single contract to buy 21,000 IBM PC
XTs so as to put a PC on each desk; that NSA spent $150 million in 1985 on a
single network-hardware contract; and that "computer power was the essential
ingredient in cryptanalysis".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another internal NSA document says that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230430105513/https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/nsa-early-computer-history/6586785-nsa-key-role-in-major-developments-in-computer-science.pdf">"since the middle of the last century, automation has been used as a way to greatly
ease the making and breaking of codes"</a>
and gives examples of NSA's investments in cryptanalytic hardware.</p>
<p>Meanwhile NSA was also spending money attacking cryptography in other ways.
NSA and CIA
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/national-security/cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage/">secretly purchased Crypto AG</a>
in 1970,
and sabotaged the cryptography that Crypto AG was selling.
As another example,
NSA hoped that developing DES would
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"drive out competitors"</a>
such as
<a href="https://www.ithistory.org/honor-roll/dr-martin-john-m-atalla">Atalla Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>The thesis attributes its claimed 2000 starting date to the Snowden documents.
This doesn't have pinpoint references,
but seems to be alluding to an
<a href="https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/media/f94a2e13-0001-0014-0000-000000035532/media-35532.pdf">internal GCHQ presentation</a>
from 2010.
The presentation says that
"for the past decade, NSA has lead an aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies"
such as "SSL" and "SSH" and "VPNs";
that "cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming on line";
and that
"vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable."</p>
<p>Is this saying that NSA started attacking cryptography around 2000?
No.
It's talking specifically about NSA trying,
evidently with some level of success,
to attack particular "Internet encryption technologies".</p>
<p>How is any of this supposed to show that
<em>preserving</em> cryptographic export controls
would have made surveillance <em>harder</em>?</p>
<p>Later the thesis describes the corporate-plus-government objectives as follows:
"how could informational privacy in the market be assured so that American
technology firms could dominate world markets,
all while securing avenues for LEA surveillance?"</p>
<p>Yes, there's an objective of world domination
for big technology firms such as,
to take a 21st-century example, Facebook.
Yes, mass surveillance is the centerpiece of Facebook's business model.
Yes, Facebook shares data with the government.</p>
<p>But how did Facebook's rise to dominance supposedly rely on "informational privacy"?
What's the mechanism
by which preserving cryptographic export controls
would supposedly have prevented Facebook's dominance?
How do we reconcile this with reports from 2010 saying that
connections to Facebook
<a href="https://cdt.org/insights/dont-get-hijacked-on-the-net-firesheep-and-https/">weren't even encrypted</a>?
Facebook had already grown to half a billion users at that point.</p>
<h2>6. The future</h2>
<p>I hope you're troubled by mass surveillance.
I hope you have the time and energy to do something about it.
I know many of my readers are doing this already.</p>
<p>Doing something doesn't mean
magically solving the whole problem all at once.
It means picking a specific task
where you can reasonably hope to make progress,
and working on that.</p>
<p>For example,
maybe you engage in the policy fight against
<a href="https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~preneel/Open_letter_CSAR_aug24_still_unacceptable.pdf">surveillance mandates</a>.
Or maybe you expose
<a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">the money flow behind those mandates</a>.
Or, as a programming example, maybe you work on tools for
<a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">decentralization</a>.
There's much more to do.</p>
<p>But wait: what if there's some fundamental incompatibility
between stopping government surveillance
and stopping corporate surveillance?
If you try to stop government surveillance
then maybe you're helping the corporations!
If you try to stop corporate surveillance
then maybe you're helping the government!</p>
<p>Instead of enthusiastically working on making the situation better,
you start worrying that you might be making the situation worse.
This sort of concern can be paralyzing.
Safest not to do anything, right?
No matter how bad the status quo is,
if you avoid action then
at least you know you aren't doing any damage.
Primum non nocere.</p>
<p>When a talk claims that preserving cryptographic export controls
would have stopped the mass-surveillance industry,
the talk isn't just making a claim for an audience of historians.
It's influencing future action.
It's telling you that there's a tradeoff:
an unhappy choice between stopping one bad thing
and stopping another bad thing.
It's telling you to pause,
and to worry that <em>your</em> actions will similarly have bad effects.
That's the most important reason
to look at whether the claim is actually true,
as I've been doing in this blog post.</p>
<p>I'll close with a recommendation for further reading:
Phil Rogaway's paper
<a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral.html">"The moral character of cryptographic work"</a>.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>

Featuring a more capable CPU with the world’s fastest CPU core,<sup>4</sup> the new iMac is up to 1.7x faster than iMac with M1. Users will feel this performance across everyday activities like multitasking between their favorite apps and browsing webpages in Safari. And with an immensely powerful GPU featuring Apple’s most advanced graphics architecture, iMac with M4 handles more intense workloads like photo editing and gaming up to 2.1x faster than iMac with M1. This also enables a smoother gameplay experience in titles like the upcoming Civilization VII. The new iMac comes standard with 16GB of faster unified memory — configurable up to 32GB.

                 <div><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-intelligence-is-available-today-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/" target="_blank">Apple Intelligence</a> ushers in a new era for the Mac, bringing personal intelligence to the personal computer. Combining powerful generative models with industry-first privacy protections, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to unlock new ways for users to work, communicate, and express themselves on Mac. It is available in U.S. English with macOS Sequoia 15.1. With systemwide Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write. With the newly redesigned Siri, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac and other Apple products. New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months. Image Playground gives users a new way to create fun original images, and Genmoji allows them to create custom emoji in seconds. Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to take actions across the system and draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.

        <div>Apple Intelligence does all this while protecting users’ privacy at every step. At its core is on-device processing, and for more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute gives users access to Apple’s even larger, server-based models and offers groundbreaking protections for personal information. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Robert Bork, a professor of art history at the University of Iowa and a specialist in the study of Gothic architecture, was working in his office when a student knocked on the door. Throughout the room were pictures of Cologne Cathedral, an 1880 church in Germany and one of Dr. Bork’s favorite buildings. The images, seemingly, caught the student’s attention. “Dr. Bork,” he said. “Why does it look so evil?”</p><p>There is nothing inherently scary or sinister about the structure. As an example of Gothic architecture, it bears many iconic elements of the style: pointed arches, flying buttresses, tall spires, rib vaults, window tracery, and stained glass. But it was never meant to invoke fear. So the student’s question was interesting to the professor. “I asked him why he said that,” Dr. Bork tells <em>AD.</em> “And he replied, ‘Well, it looks just like the skyscraper in <em>Ghostbusters.</em>’”</p><figure><p><span><p>Cologne Cathedral in Cologne, Germany</p>
</span><span>Photo: Sparwasser/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>For decades, Gothic architecture has been a go-to style for production designers, writers, and even musicians looking to convey terror through physical spaces. In <em>Dracula</em> (1931) Carfax Abbey is based on Whitby Abbey, a Gothic monastery; Manderly from Alfred Hitchcock’s R<em>ebecca</em> (1939) pulls inspiration from Gothic houses; and more modern films and shows like <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/crimson-peak-set-design-exclusive-video"><em>Crimson Peak</em></a> (2015) and <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/wednesday-on-netflix-inside-the-castle-used-for-nevermore-academy"><em>Wednesday</em></a> (2022) keep the trope alive.</p><p>“The idea of Gothic buildings being scary or haunted is fairly recent,” says Michael Crosbie, an architect and professor of the course Architecture in Film at Hartford University. “In the early to mid 20th century, there were a lot of Gothic buildings in movies that showed them as haunted places.”</p><p>One could argue that repetition has perhaps conditioned viewers to think of the style as scary, so creators continue using it, prompting something of a never-ending loop. But their original introduction into horror media was always a deliberate choice. “It’s not random,” Dr. Bork says. “There are good reasons.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Notre-Dame in Paris is among the most famous Gothic buildings.</p>
</span><span>Photo: Pete Douglass/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>Gothic architecture first emerged in the 12th century and was most closely related with church architecture, though other uses did exist. In religious settings, it was meant to suggest the superhuman. “Buildings were supposed to make you feel like you were in the presence of a bigger, more mysterious God,” Dr. Bork says. Architects did this by circumventing many of the “rules” previously established in Romanesque architecture, which had been widespread in the decades before and has roots in <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/greek-architecture-101" target="_blank">Greek</a> and <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/roman-architecture-101" target="_blank">Roman</a> classicism.</p><figure><p><span><p>Built in 1790, the exterior of the Pantheon in Paris showcases a neoclassical style, with direct references to Greek and Roman design.</p>

In fact, each order of Greek design—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—was based on the human body, and therefore felt safe, approachable, and familiar. As Gothic architecture emerged, many <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/neoclassical-architecture-explained" target="_blank">classical traditions</a> receded. “In the Middle Ages, [architects] left behind the human metaphor and moved to the superhuman,” Dr. Bork adds.</p><p>Suddenly, columns became arbitrarily tall and stretched, ornamentation grew bolder, and interiors felt more cavernous thanks to new construction techniques that allowed higher ceilings and required less interior columns. Architects pushed the envelope and were willing to experiment outside of what was previously deemed correct or right. The general vertical presence through elongated columns and high ceilings was meant to evoke a heavenly reach.</p><figure><p><span><p>Inside Notre Dame Basilica of Montreal. Gothic interiors were designed to symbolize a higher power.</p>
</span><span>Photo: Felipe Mulè/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>Though perhaps intimidating in their grandeur, they weren’t intended to inspire fear. “It was supposed to be positive, transcendent, and godly, not scary,” Dr. Bork explains. However, the designs assumed a less favorable association in the early 16th century during the Renaissance, when there was once again a desire for the rules, order, and “perfection” of classical antiquity. “It was perceived as lawless, chaotic, and disorderly because it didn’t follow the rules of classicism,” Dr. Bork explains. “It got stuck with that association.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Throughout the next two centuries, the style largely lost favor, until Horace Walpole, a writer, decided he wanted his own “little Gothic castle.” In 1749, he built his estate in London, called Strawberry Hill, modeled off of Gothic cathedrals and medieval castles. Defined by arched windows, stained glass, turrets, and battlements, the residence is largely considered the first Gothic Revival building and contributed to the widespread re-interest in the historic aesthetic.</p><figure><p><span><p>Strawberry Hill House in west London</p>
</span><span>Photo: Sam Mellish/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>The 18th century then saw a boom in neo-Gothic buildings, many of which were residences. Today, they are recognizable for their use of pointed arches (seen on doors, windows, and gables), high-pitched roofs, and vergeboard (wooden trim attached to gables).</p><p>Perhaps coincidentally, philosopher Edmund Burke published <em>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</em> around this same time, in 1757, which became an extremely an influential text that detailed what he called sublime art. “Whatever is in any sort terrible or is conversant about terrible objects or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime,” he wrote. Burke separated the beautiful from the sublime, and aesthetic theories generally classify the sublime as work that showcases greatness beyond measurement, comprehension, or experience; its magnitude is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><p>The interiors of Strawberry Hill</p>

His novel, <em>Castle of Otranto,</em> was reportedly inspired by a dream he had while living at Strawberry Hill. Set in a castle in the Middle Ages, the epic details a lord and his family living in a haunted mansion. “In the late 18th and 19th century, Gothic became associated with spookiness, which got wound into ideas of the exotic and sublime,” Dr. Bork says. “By the 20th century, you have movies and mass media that start using this.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Today, filmmakers—and, more broadly, storytellers—use these ingrained historical associations to great effect. “When I teach my course, I approach architecture as a character in a film,” Crosbie says. “The character has a role, which is to get across and reinforce themes.” If the idea is to express something otherworldly or beyond comprehension—say, a ghost—what better style to use than Gothic? Of course, not every viewer will know its history, but, subconsciously, these messages may still come across.</p><p>Jennifer Spence, a production designer who has worked on movies such as <em>The Nun</em> (2018), <em>Splinter</em> (2008), and those in the <em>Insidious</em> (2013, 2015), <em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2010, 2011, 2012), and <em>Annabelle</em> (2017, 2019) franchises, notes that the style’s age is also compelling. “If you’re writing a story with a ghost, there has to be an origin,” she says. “An older home offers decades of opportunities for backstories to happen, maybe they got murdered or something else happened to them in the home.”</p><figure><p><span><p>An illustration of a neo-Gothic residence leans into horror motifs including bats, dead plants, and a seemingly abandoned home.</p>

On the other hand, Mordor, the evil kingdom, pulls from a Gothic vocabulary and includes pointed arches, pinnacles, and diagonal forms. “They were absolutely riffing on a well-informed knowledge of Romanesque and Gothic style when they put those films together,” he says. “And so, generations of kids have seen that by now and that colors their views.”</p><figure><p><span><p>A set in <em>Annabelle: Creation,</em> designed by Jennifer Spence</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://candost.blog/on-good-software-engineers/">https://candost.blog/on-good-software-engineers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41968892">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <p>Setting expectations for software engineers is tricky for all managers. Every company has different needs and a different structure, tech stack, and culture. Whenever someone joins a team, one of the manager’s challenges is aligning the organization’s expectations with those of the new joiner. As there’s no universal guidance on this subject, I set out to find a simple definition that would help managers frame the fundamental things they expect from software engineers.</p>
<p>I first found definitions of 10x engineers, superstars, or rockstar developers, which aren’t definitions of good engineers in any way. Someone may produce a lot of work but it’s often at the cost of team spirit and results in low-quality code. Ultimately, the team is demoralized and the organization bears the cost of substandard code.</p>
<p>I also looked at different career progression frameworks or career matrices (which aim to give engineers perspective on how to map their professional development to roles) to see how tech- or product-driven organizations define good engineers. I found that all were incomplete (I wrote about the good, the bad and the ugly of these frameworks <a href="https://candost.blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-career-ladders-and-frameworks/">here</a>. In general, career frameworks are helpful in defining roles, but they don’t define a good engineer. After sharing my thoughts and findings with peers, well-respected engineers and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7243636598557347840/">on LinkedIn</a>, I arrived at one definition of a good software engineer.</p>
<p><em>A good engineer is one whom I, as a manager or peer, can trust to progress a project, knowing that they will deliver a solution by working with the team and producing good quality, again and again.</em></p>
<p>This definition applies to software engineers at all levels (from junior to staff+). We can’t expect a junior engineer to drive a big project; their scope will be limited. Yet, we can expect them to deliver small, unambiguous tasks with high quality again and again. We can expect good senior+ engineers to drive and deliver a feature or project. When it comes to staff+ engineers, this expectation will span over big and long-term projects with many unknowns.</p>
<p>It’s a super simple definition but has a lot of subtleties around how a good engineer, at any level, will approach and deliver a project by using many hard and soft skills. Let’s delve into them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers know how to influence others and the organization to deliver a solution as a team.</strong> At any seniority level, a good engineer must know how to communicate well both in written and spoken form. An engineer’s work always depends on collaboration (code reviews, pair programming, <a href="https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/">RFCs</a>, <a href="https://candost.blog/adrs-rfcs-differences-when-which/">ADRs</a>, feedback, etc.). Good collaboration demands clear communication, <a href="https://candost.blog/importance-of-the-feedback/">giving and receiving feedback</a> giving and receiving feedback, and <a href="https://candost.blog/the-must-have-skill-for-every-leader-listening-with-empathy/">listening with empathy</a>. However, these soft skills are not enough.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers understand the processes they are operating in while taking a project from an idea to a solution.</strong> There are different approaches when it comes to doing code reviews or writing <a href="https://candost.blog/adrs-rfcs-differences-when-which/">RFCs or ADRs</a>. Each organization uses different methodologies like Kanban, Scrum, or Scrumban. Some organizations use Tech Radar to help teams make technology choices. Good engineers know the processes and guidelines so thoroughly that they know where they can bend the rules. They don’t stop there; they take their time to understand the organization as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers spend extra time learning the environment they’re in, going beyond the processes so they can independently drive the work.</strong> They learn how the organization works, about its culture, norms, and people. As they need to adapt to the organizational requirements to deliver a job of good quality, they have to develop not only hard skills but people and organizational skills. If the organization is hierarchical, they’ll have a difficult time driving a solution <a href="https://candost.blog/how-to-handle-and-overcome-objections-to-your-proposal-at-work/">when they face rejection from a more senior person</a>. If the organization works with short-lived task forces instead of long-living teams, their work style will be focused on speed and getting things done quickly. In any situation, they’ll need to find how to implement quality sustainably.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers take a proactive approach and embed quality elements into their deliverables to increase consistency and velocity.</strong> There is no need to ask for extra permission to write tests when you do test-driven development; no discussion will be needed if you consider refactoring as part of the new feature implementation. A good engineer chooses their approach wisely. If they inherit a legacy codebase, they look for ways to make it better, step by step. If they work with giving estimations, they include all these to keep a good level of quality. But above all, a good engineer needs to understand what quality means in their current circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers understand the stakeholders’ needs and fine-tune their approach so they don’t unnecessarily delay the delivery.</strong> They might need to do a proof of concept first or a full solution design upfront. Even when working in the same place, the organization evolves and changes; good engineers <a href="https://candost.blog/learnings-on-dealing-with-ambiguity/">adapt to these changes</a> and adjust the project’s codebase accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers constantly work on reducing complexity in the codebase to consistently provide high quality.</strong> They seek a modular design, separate concerns at every level while keeping the right amount of cohesion, and have a good testing setup and strategy. These are quality levers, and they know how to adjust them according to the organization, the situation, and the people around them. Keeping the same implementation and delivery strategies rarely works; good engineers constantly adapt and have a learning mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers are reliable in constantly changing organizations.</strong> They seek to learn at every chance, even if it puts them in uncomfortable situations, such as publicly admitting mistakes, holding themselves accountable, and looking for ways to prevent the same mistakes from happening again. If a good engineer doesn’t know how to tackle a problem, they don’t avoid tackling it. They have a growth mindset and eagerness to learn. But they don’t stop there.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers are team players regardless of personality type.</strong> They recognize a problem and offer a solution. They don’t throw the problem over the fence and ask others to fix it.</p>
<p>I’ve covered good engineers in detail. But what makes a great engineer? <strong>Great engineers do all of the above but <em>proactively</em>.</strong> If they see a broken process, <a href="https://candost.blog/strong-ownership-culture-in-a-team/">they don’t walk past the problem</a> or wait for someone else’s permission. <a href="https://candost.blog/bias-towards-action/">They take action to fix it</a>. If they can’t change the process themselves, they don’t complain without bringing solutions to the people who can change it.</p>
<p>These expectations will not be easy for inexperienced engineers, but their scope will be limited at first. They will gain experience in time. If they keep learning, stay reliable, and improve quality day-to-day, it’s safe to call them good engineers.</p>
<p>I already hear some of you saying, “Well, Candost, you expect a lot of things from a good engineer.” No, I don’t. I strongly believe all that I’ve mentioned is a basic expectation from any engineer. More generally, these expectations apply to, in fact, any good employee.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

It's basically a curated stream of cool videos, and I would feel totally safe letting my daughter browse it alone (she never does because we usually watch them together, but the curation is that good). Videos on all sorts of topics, and good enough to be really entertaining for both kids and adults - I can spend an evening there easily. They also have a really fantastic gift guide.</p>

                  <p>This is a great idea! Recommendation algos are weaponized against kids and would be great to have some way of managing it.
There is a similar problem with movies as well. It is hard to know whether a movie is appropriate for a child e.g. some kind of violence may be acceptable but not adult themes. So marking a movie PG-13 for example doesn't help much. There are some crowd-sourced solutions to this right now such as <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews" rel="nofollow">https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews</a> But LLMs could really help automate this</p>

And we're not talking promotion of a few posts, YC is now doing multiple batches a year and has hundreds of companies per batch meaning we're seeing a LOT of promotion / advertisements on this site coming via Launch HN threads as well as jobs ad threads.</p><p>I don't think Xerox park would have done as well if 5% of the people get got the opportunity for a microphone in the auditorium every week and the other 95% did not. That would seem like a caste system. I understand that YC funds this website so the caste system is inevitable but I don't see why moderation should further stratify it - unless you're prioritizing advertising YC companies over a great community.</p><p>Next, I see this "HN is not for self promotion" do a lot of downstream damage on the community in the sense that it's much better for big, existing trillion dollar companies than smaller players. If a small bootstrapped startup writes a blog post and mentions there product, people will complain about "blogspam" and "this blog post is really just an ad for a link at the end". But if Google or Amazon have a new announcement for a new product, nobody complains that it's an advertisement, even though it's often as much or more one. The end result is that the website tends to focus more "corporate" news than "hacker" news as a downstream consequence of a well-meaning "no self-promotion" rule.</p><p>Finally, as we've discussed over email, the rules around self-promotion are extremely opaque and in many cases algorithmically enforced by closed algorithms. This leads to a lot of confusion around what's allowed and a lot of ambiguous favoritism.</p><p>I understand this site is called "Hacker" news and there's some mystique around the "hacker" building "just for fun" , the purism around intellectual curiosity that you don't want tainted by dirty commercialism. I just think that once the website has decided it's going to be the media arm of one of the most powerful venture capital firms in the world, the ship has sailed.If people really want pure tech news, they should go to <a href="https://lobste.rs/" rel="nofollow">https://lobste.rs/</a> . I've personally found in recent years quality of interesting conversation is much higher on /r/saas, Indie Hackers board, and Small Bets campfire, as well as various Discords, all because they allow self-promotion and don't encourage the "self-promotion police" who frequently show up aghast someone would try to make money on the internet (unless it's their daddy FAANG employer).</p><p>Another rule I've seen in various places be very effective is a simple guideline to contribute 10x as much non-promotional content as promotional content. If someone only posts links to their projects and nothing else, I see how that gets spammy. But if someone regularly contributes they should get a pass. I understand that's partially how the submission system works via algorithmic enforcement, but , see above about its opaque and ambiguous nature.</p><p>Show HN is a "place" for self-promotion but it's a pretty bad place if 99% of submissions get entirely lost and ignored and I think you should encourage more places for promotion without inflicting a caste system where only YC companies and certain golden children get special rules.</p><p>Overall, HN's guidelines against self-promotion are too rigid, there's too few opportunties for small players to promote, which makes the discussion here less egalitarian, more corporate, and less interesting. You'd be better served encouraging more self-promotion in threads like these.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Nice idea, but right now the villagers mostly say some variation on "I eagerly await the valiant hero's return!".

                  <p>Building Split Flap Displays. Started 18 months ago and kept me on a super interesting learning path. First shot was using open source designs (<a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap">https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap</a>), but then kept building more and more parts myself. Coming from a software engineering background, getting into designing mechanical things – and then more importantly the electronics around it - has been really challenging, but also very rewarding. At this point I have my own screen printed flaps, custom PCB Design and a, what I consider, really smart protocol that allows me to daisy chain a basically arbitrary number of display elements.

Uses PID control to maintain any course I set on the chartplotter, using the cross-track error and heading. I’ve had it out on the water a few times now and it works great.

- Built and trained a compact TensorflowJS model (~3MB) that runs entirely in-browser
- Model lazy loads only when users are submitting reviews
- Classifies uploaded photos into Menu, Food &amp; Drink, or Vibes (interior/exterior)
- Zero server costs for inference, quick enough classification feedback</p><p>This approached solved several problems:
1. Reduced server costs by moving inference to the client

You can currently link to other recipes. So if you make a sauce, that can be a recipe on its own, and it can be linked from another recipe.

Raga is a term for a particular scale of notes (both ascending and descending).</p><p>Until now, this has mostly been in the domain of research and there is a ton of published literature out there. At the very basic level, if you have just voice, it is trivial to apply a pitch detection algorithm like YIN to get a pitch estimate and then analyse the sequence to figure out the raga. This doesn't work as well in a concert setup where speeds are higher due to gamakas, different instruments are used alongside and counterpoint melodies may make the music polyphonic. A lot of papers apply a variety of ML models (neural nets and otherwise) using several different features (cepstrum and mel-cepstrum, pitch distributions etc) with varying results.</p><p>So this is an interesting exercise in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. If anyone else is working on or has worked on this, I'd love to hear from you.</p><p>[1] -  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga" rel="nofollow">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga</a>)</p></div></td></tr>

I hope I'm wrong though, I still want this to succeed, for once in my life, I want to actually succeed on at least one thing. I want to contribute some good thing to the society.</p><p>First, what is it? It's a bookmarking app alternative to Pocket or Raindrop.io. Yeah, you can already tell it's not the most original idea. What makes it different, though, it's supposed to be self-hostable and additionally it's easy to deploy as it's only single binary file with no other runtime dependency--the database uses SQLite, which you can include it as a library in Rust.</p><p>What problems I'm facing while developing this? Honestly? I don't know, but I can't finish the last 10% progress of the app. It's funny--I first wrote it in Go, and it almost reached MVP. But, instead, I decided to just rewrite in Rust. Well, at least I got to learn new language while building this app, two birds one stone, or in Bahasa Indonesia, swimming while drinking water.</p><p>But now, I just can't force myself to continue. And I don't know why. Maybe perfectionism? It definitely doesn't have to do with skill though.</p><p>There are also another thing I'm working on: recovering from depression. One year ago, out of nowhere, I lost all my motivation doing anything--including university. I lost all my friends. Since then, I'm at the lowest point of my life. I visited psychiatrist multiple times. I don't know if it was effective, but recently I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>The Tagbox Project is also one of the efforts for me to recover from depression. The depression phase made me realize that I _want my works to have a positive effect on the world, even for just a little bit_. I don't want my skill to be used for evil companies that throws away moral and ethics. Specifically AI stuff, but that's OOT of this thread.</p><p>Here are the links if you're interested,</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/muhrizqiardi/tagbox_rs/" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/muhrizqiardi/tagbox_rs/</a></p><p>This link is only the Rust rewrite version.

                  <p>Even without the other problems, I can assure you that the vast majority of managers will think that a 80% done project is almost done. The truth is the remaining 20% is where you have to fit everything together so you revisit an rewrite most of the project. It's a different kind of work that feels boring because you already did those things maybe 3,4 times already. It helps to understand the phase of the project you are in, to reduce the frustration. It also helps to do something even very small, every day and focus on that. One day you will run out of things to do.</p>

I would try to perhaps solve the mental health problem first perhaps before tackling big projects. Maybe try gym, hiking, somehow finding friends, talk to more people, solve your sleep, eat better - something.

You can export the colors for use with Tailwind, CSS, Figma, and Adobe.</p><p>I started working on this because for design projects I was almost always getting handed brand style guides that were missing thought into accessible colors pairs and lacked tints/shades, where I had to fill in the gaps. There's lots of color tools out there, but this supports multiple swatches, checking the contrast of multiple color pairs at the same time and the HSLuv based color picker makes it easier to explore accessible colors.</p><p>It's really only usable on desktop right now but I'd love any feedback good or bad on if it's useful and what to work on next! There's actually a lot of directions to go in, and it's tricky to balance more features with keeping it simple. 
Some tips:</p><p>- The "Load examples" menu in the top-left lets you compare the colors from Tailwind, IBM Carbon and United States Web Design System.</p><p>- The "contrast" menu lets you see how WCAG 2 contrast checks compare against APCA when "vs black/white" is turned on. WCAG 2 has known inaccuracies, especially for dark mode. APCA is the candidate contrast method for WCAG 3 that's meant to improve on this.</p><p>- Use the "..." menu to create a swatch based on a brand color.</p><p>- Use the "..." menu to "flip to dark/light palette" to create a dark theme. Or just manually flip the lightness curves horizontally.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I created a Weird Clock that shows the local sunrise and sunset within a conventional 12-hour clock face.  This normally would only work on a 24-hour clock face, which is kind of unfamiliar to most people, so I developed a way to show a 24-hour day within a 12-hour clock face; essentially it shows a 2-turn spiral so both night and day will fit.  This needs to know your location in order to compute your local sunrise and sunset, so don't freak out when the browser asks for location permission!  Includes option to enter lat/long and other goodies. Works on phones but better on a large screen. https:\\www.coolweird.net</p>

I'm between a few projects at the moment though but the biggest one is an image processing application I've been working on for quite some time. A lot of stuff I've programmed and learned about over the last 3 years has been leading up to the goal of making something like this haha. I wanted to leverage OpenCL for compute but I had a lot of trouble getting OpenGL OpenCL interoperability to work.</p><p>A big motivation for such a project is my passion for photography. I've taken many thousands of photos over just the last 2 years alone. A lot of them are digital, and so far a few dozen rolls of film. A big challenge for me is that I'm not satisfied with the tools available to develop the raw files that are free or open source. Either they're quite finnicky, or they have noticeable issues with color transformations.</p><p>I've done a lot of rendering projects over the last few years relating to color that have been focused on getting a better understanding of working with color spaces. Lots of 2D and 3D fractals haha.</p><p>Unfortunately I've had quite a turbulent life the last few years so development is very off/on. Every autumn for me seems to be a period of change, this one no different as I'm moving and I'm a bit uncertain of things. However, a side project to all of this has been an OpenGL project where I'm working on things related to voxels! I did a lot of research on data structures like interval trees, octrees, segment trees, etc. It does seem that a lot of people jump for the octree approach, however I've been able to render a lot of voxels with just a hashmap of chunks and a 3d array haha (albeit, mostly initial implementation of chunk generation, single threaded at that!). With this I'm hoping to explore OpenGL compute as I intend of generating world geometry in compute shaders :D</p><p>I havent published a project in a while and I'm hoping to get back to putting things out there, so hopefully some of the stuff I've been working on goes well and I can put it up on GitHub or something</p></div></td></tr>

Years of Buddhist meditation only got me so far. But two months of this new technique, and I finally see a path to being able to program my emotional self like I program a computer. Here's how it works.</p><p>Step one. Identify the negative belief you want to change. This is the core belief. It is something you feel is true. For example, “I am a bad manager.”</p><p>Step two. Create a statement related to the belief that you believe is not true. This is the false statement. For example, “No employees Ive managed have thought I did anything right as a manager.”</p><p>Step three. This is the training step. You spend a few minutes following your breathe to quiet your mind. Then you think the false statement and watch the emotional reaction the mind has to it. The reaction is an aversion, a kind of disgust. Then, say the false statement and the core belief together. “No employees I’ve managed have thought I did anything right as a manager. I’m a bad manager.” Repay the false statement and core belief together again and again, watching how the mind rejects the false statement and that aversion feeling lingers as the core belief is thought.</p><p>Step four. Repeat the training step in  daily sessions. During the session, repeated think the false belief and core belief. The session should last at least ten minutes. The daily sessions should be repeated for at least a week, and longer for more deeply held core beliefs. Over time, you come to reject the core belief just like you reject the false statement.</p><p>Here's why I think it works. There is a rational part of the mind in the prefrontal cortex. It is what we think with. But it is not where our beliefs are. We can rationalize our way to a new belief or to change a belief. Instead, beliefs are felt. And they’re felt in the limbic emotional part of the brain. The limbic system is mute and cannot think with words. The prefrontal cortex can’t directly talk to the limbic system with words. Instead, the prefrontal cortex must communicate with emotion. You have to train the limbic system to feel differently about a belief. You can’t use positive affirmations because they are not felt as strongly as aversion.</p></div></td></tr>

I know on paper the circuit ratings are nearly 2x, but in practice it sounds like it's closer to 1.5x for the average kettle comparison.</p><p>80% efficiency for the heating coil, 1.6L of water, you need about ~750kJ (200Wh) get to a boil from 10C tap water.</p><p>So you'll need at least 70Wh output from your battery, and it needs to provide 1kW continuously.  Accounting for conversion losses and some buffer to avoid deep discharge I'll target 80Wh.  At 1kW that's a continuous 13C discharge rate, which is pretty high.  Hobby-oriented LiPo packs will do it, but I'm not sure how they would hold up for consumer product safety and longevity.  LiFePO cells could be a good choice since density is _less_ of a concern, and are readily available with 20+C continuous discharge.</p><p>I don't know my power electronics very well, so I'm not sure the best way to merge the outputs.  Any conversions are going to eat into total power and thus boil time, just rectifying the AC will take 20%.  Maybe it makes the most sense to have two separate coils, one direct from AC and a second from the battery?  With smaller cells in series, say 10+, to get a decent voltage it could end up with a manageable current to use directly with the 1kW boost.  In that case the only expensive power electronics needed would be to charge the batteries.</p><p>Also have to figure out how much recharge time matters to people, since by default it would be an hour or so.</p><p>It's going to have a chunky, heavy base, and guessing it will have to be pretty expensive for what it does, but I like it.</p></div></td></tr>

Who's going to pay hundreds of dollars for a battery-powered kettle just so they can save 1-2 minutes of time (and less if you're just making enough boiling water for 1 cup).  I use a little 100V (900W I think, according to the label) kettle to make tea, either 1 or 2 cups at a time, and while it's certainly not as speedy as those EU/UK market kettles, and a bit slower than a US kettle, it's fast enough.</p><p>A battery-powered one might save me 1 minute of time at best, but will cost probably at least 5-10x as much for the kettle, it'll be MUCH larger than my current kettle (that battery pack and power electronics needs space) which is a problem with my tiny kitchen, and I have to worry about how long the battery will last and how to dispose of it later and if I can even replace it.</p><p>This is really a solution in search of a problem.</p></div></td></tr>

Broadly speaking, it's an event based programming model, where "events" are things like "gaining a new belief", "dropping a belief", "selecting a plan to execute" (aka an "intention"), etc. AgentSpeak programs (normally) run "forever" cycling through a "reasoning cycle" that involves perceiving the world, updating beliefs, choosing intentions, executing intentions, communicating with other agents, etc.</p><p>And to commit a little self-plagiarism, from a recent post on LinkedIn:</p><p>----</p><p>On the one hand, AgentSpeak is basically a logic programming language with a lot of #prolog in its heritage. On the other hand, the runtime is all Java and to do anything interesting you have to write your custom Environment class and other helper functions in #Java. And while the interop is seamless in a way, getting your head around the execution model and knowing what's really happening at runtime can be a bit tricky.</p><p>Still, it's starting to make sense. And I do think this #BDI inspired approach has a lot going for it. I'm just looking forward to getting to the point where I can really start to exercise this. I have a few things that I want to accomplish soon:</p><p>1. I want to create a BDI agent that I can connect to an #XMPP server so I can talk with it from anywhere.</p><p>2. I want to start working on customized perception, using neural networks and various sensors (web-cam, microphone, accelerometer, distance sensor, etc.) to create an embodied agent that can truly sense its environment.</p><p>3. I want to take a stab at integrating some symbolic reasoning. I've given thought to trying to adapt the "belief base" to be an #RDF triplestore (probably #Apache #Jena) and include a reasoning engine or two. This all starts to get really speculative from here, but I spent a lot of time working on abductive inference a couple of years ago, and I'd like this thing to be able to use abductive inference, along with deductive reasoning, rule induction, possibly case based reasoning, etc. all in one system.</p><p>4. Might experiment with implementing a #Blackboard architecture and have specialized "problem solving" agents that collaborate by using the Blackboard in some situations. What would be really interesting here would be to figure out how to seamlessly translate in and out of a structured representation that lets you use existing specialized code for things like, eg. R for statistical operations.</p><p>5. And of course, experimenting with continual learning, as opposed to the "batch training job" stuff that we all use for ANN's today. This gets <i>really</i> speculative as well, but I want to explore contrastive learning, Hebbian learning, associative learning, operant conditioning (ala Pavlov), etc.</p><p>[5] above is why you'll see me spending as much time lately with Developmental Psychology, Infant Development, and Cognitive Psychology books, as with "AI" books per-se. I still believe that getting an AI that can learn from its environment, and build up useful mental representations with the minimal set of hard-coded behaviors, will be the best way to make progress with regards to #AGI.</p><p>----</p><p>I didn't mention it in the LinkedIn post, but as part of all  of this, I've been building a hardware platform for some time now as well, where said platform is meant to support "perceiving the environment" so the system can learn from the physical world. It's not finished yet, but today it includes a GPS receiver so it can "know" it's location in physical space, a 6-DOF accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope board so it can sense movement (of itself), and two microphones (for stereo audio input). Future plans include one or two webcams to emulate vision, and possibly some other sensors: IR and/or ultrasonic distance sensors, temperature sensor, humidity and barometric pressure sensors, etc.</p><p>Also in the "speculative / for the future" category: AgentSpeak programs don't have any inherent notion of learning built into the model. All "plans" (aka "desires" or "candidate intentions") have to be coded by the developer up-front. This is obviously pretty limiting if you're trying to create truly autonomous agents, so another area I want to dig into is how we might combine work on "AI Planning"[5] to dynamically create new plans.</p><p>And since this has kind of turned into a big brain-dump of stuff that's on my mind, I'll finish by saying that I've been chewing on some ideas about explicitly modeling other "mental states" that aren't part of the base BDI model. Things like "attitudes", "values", different emotional states (eg "boredom", "frustration", etc.), "curiosity", "confusion" / "cognitive dissonance", and so on.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://jason-lang.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://jason-lang.github.io/</a></p><p>[3]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93...</a></p><p>[4]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_model" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93...</a></p><p>[5]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_schedul...</a></p></div></td></tr>
