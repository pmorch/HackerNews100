<p dir="auto">[ N.B I have edited the title to emphasize this is more a theoretical exploration of battery design than practical advice to fix your hardware issues - sorry to disappoint those coming for the latter ]</p>
<p dir="auto">Picture the scene, you're an engineer at an electric vehicle company and your boss comes to you and says: <em>"Jeremy we've got a problem!"</em> (your name is Jeremy by the way) <em>"It's these damn batteries, there's just too many of them in the car and it's weighing us down but we really want our customers to be able to drive 400 miles without having to stop and charge!"</em> - What do you do? How do you debug your battery? It's a black box of magic right?!? Wrong. Use simulation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The <strong>"and"</strong> problem</h2><a id="user-content-the-and-problem" aria-label="Permalink: The &quot;and&quot; problem" href="#the-and-problem"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It seems like there's no good solution in the market today. Batteries are either designed to be high energy <strong>or</strong> high power, not high energy <strong>and</strong> power. If we stick a bunch of high energy batteries in the vehicle we might get more range but then when we try to accelerate they overheat because the rated power is too low and the losses in the system are too high. This causes us to over-engineer the cooling system (adding weight and cost) and we also find that batteries operating at higher temperatures lose capacity faster. Also there are other constraints on the battery design, such as safety, lifetime, weight and last but by no means least cost.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below is an indicative spider-plot of the main metrics that battery engineers tend to care about when designing or selecting cells which often compete with one another.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/spider.png"><img src="https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/spider.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A good intro into cell design can be found at <a href="https://www.batterydesign.net/power-versus-energy-cells/" rel="nofollow">batterydesign.net</a>. Below is an image taken from that site of the difference between high power and high energy. Thinner electrodes tend to be better for drawing larger currents because there is less material in the way of ion transport but they have more inactive material (i.e. current collectors and separators - the gold, grey and yellow bits) per unit volume making them less energy dense.</p>

<p dir="auto">This problem is even bigger for your buddy designing batteries for electric aircraft as the peak power needed for take-off and landing is much higher (10 x) than the power needed for cruising. So you have to prioritize power and sacrifice range - aircraft also find it really hard to top-up charge mid flight 🤣. For a great perspective on the prospects of electric flight I recommend <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04139-1" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Luckily you know an engineer at your battery supplier and can call them to discuss the problem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The curse of dimensionality</h2><a id="user-content-the-curse-of-dimensionality" aria-label="Permalink: The curse of dimensionality" href="#the-curse-of-dimensionality"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The battery supplier is well aware of the difficulties in designing batteries and explains they have been spending years on the problem, testing different designs trying to optimize for different use cases. It takes at least 1 day to build and fully test one single design in the lab with all the characterization experiments they need to run and up to 1 month for cells selected for accelerated ageing tests. This is where the cell is cycled really hard constantly and the data collected is then extrapolated to a real-world driving scenario (car mostly parked on your driveway), but going from one scenario to another isn't so straight-forward as the ageing effects are non-linear. A rough estimate for how much it costs to build and test a new battery design on a single cell (one data point) is around $1000.</p>
<p dir="auto">That might not sound too much but now consider how many different design decisions go into making one battery. You have to choose materials:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Anode</li>
<li>Cathode</li>
<li>Electrolyte</li>
<li>Separator</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each solid material can be tuned by:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Thickness</li>
<li>Porosity (amount of space for solid active material or for liquid ion transporting material)</li>
<li>Particle size</li>
<li>Composition if a mixture of materials</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Then you have geometric factors like</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Form factor - cylindrical, prismatic, pouch</li>
<li>Size i.e. 18650</li>
<li>Number of tabs</li>
<li>Current collector thickness</li>
<li>Safety features like venting cap and central mandrel.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each electrolyte composition can be altered too and this is often where the secret sauce actually is (but maybe more on that another day).</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's say conservatively there are 20 things you might want to change. If you collect 3 different data points changing each thing one at a time (original design, some number higher, some number lower) whilst keeping everything else constant (usually a good scientific approach) that's 3<sup>20</sup> possible combinations of changes!</p>
<p dir="auto">That's 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3</p>

<p dir="auto">Now testing 3,486,784,401 batteries is obviously a <strong>ridiculous</strong> thing to do and no reasonable battery developer would carry out that many experiments. Even if you parallelize by say 1000 and have a huge test facility cycling batteries constantly that's still over 1 million experiments for each cycler channel which would take at least 1 million days and cost over $1B dollars!</p>
<p dir="auto">This is known as the curse of dimensionality (the more things you have to vary, the <strong>exponentially</strong> more combinations you have to test) and unfortunately battery engineers have this curse pretty bad! In fact several battery unicorns are spending basically all their money on R&amp;D and still trying to bring their new technology to market without having yet put a single cell inside a single car.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A solution to the "and" problem?</h2><a id="user-content-a-solution-to-the-and-problem" aria-label="Permalink: A solution to the &quot;and&quot; problem?" href="#a-solution-to-the-and-problem"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your battery cell designer has some hope for your problem though, they have been testing a new material which could deliver more energy density while retaining high power. An anode with a mixture of graphite and silicon. This being silicon valley and all you are pretty excited as there must be plenty of that around and you ask when can you get some batteries to test out....?</p>
<p dir="auto">Well... your battery supplier says, <em>"we're still evaluating that material and it may be a little while longer. The initial tests in the lab look good though and there are already some cells on the market with silicon but they've had a few issues."</em> More on this in a bit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Typically, the cell designers won't actually be making all the modifications and carry out all these tests themselves. They will have their own suppliers of materials and they will be doing a lot of the tests too. Let's take the anode as an example:</p>
<p dir="auto">The anode is the negative electrode in the cell and hosts ions in what we call the active material (think itty bitty particles). The Li ions intercalate which basically means squeeze inside the crystalline lattice of the host material and this causes the material to change in size. Once inside a process like diffusion occurs where ions migrate to the center of the material (a spherical particle for the sake of argument). As the concentration of Li ions inside the host material changes we call this lithiation i.e. filling up with lithium. This is an electrochemical process and requires electron transfer to take place which occurs when current is supplied or drawn from the cell.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's a great and easy to understand video by The Limiting Factor on how batteries work at the particle and atomic level.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://youtu.be/4-1psMHSpKs" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c723e07f96c61e9a4b99573df420329dd16b35101b16b3d6a3b282183a10d805/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f342d3170734d4853704b732f302e6a7067" alt="" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/4-1psMHSpKs/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Adding silicon to an anode gives more capacity to the cell as there are more host sites for lithium per unit volume but this does have one or two drawbacks. The first is what happens to the cell voltage:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Voltage Hysteresis</h3><a id="user-content-voltage-hysteresis" aria-label="Permalink: Voltage Hysteresis" href="#voltage-hysteresis"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are typically several stages of the process of lithiation where the crystal structure tends to form stable phases as the degree of lithiation increases or decreases. The chemical potential of the lithiated particles is directly related to the degree of lithiation (hard to measure) and this basically translates to the open circuit potential or voltage of the material (easier to measure).</p>
<p dir="auto">Without diving too much deeper into the physics we can safely say, as you charge and discharge, ions move in and out of the host material and voltage changes. The voltage changes more slowly when materials are changing from one stable phase to the next. Careful analysis of the open-circuit potential and it's derivative with respect to lithiation or capacity (dVdQ) can then reveal what the material inside might be because crystals are "somewhat" predictable. They have characteristic plateaus in voltage at certain degrees of lithiation. On the flip side: if you know the material you can predict the state of charge (SoC) from the voltage (something the battery systems designers really like to know). I say "somewhat" because silicon unfortunately suffers from voltage hysteresis meaning that the voltage when charging and discharging in a cycle follows different paths, even when cycling very slowly, say 1 cycle per day.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/hysteresis.png"><img src="https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/hysteresis.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It sounds like a fairly trivial thing to know how much charge your battery has left, why not just measure the current in and out constantly (a technique known as coulomb counting). However, counting is prone to error, if say a sensor fails or has a low accuracy or systematic error the predictions will drift over time. Voltage can be measured and gives an instant snapshot of the state of the battery and is therefore usually used as the indicator of SoC.</p>
<p dir="auto">But is voltage reliable? No not really. Voltage has its issues too and depends on how far from equilibrium the system is. Often what happens is the battery is left at rest and then cells connected in parallel start to equalize their open circuit potentials and current re-balances. The overall charge left in the system is still the same but the voltage at rest has relaxed closer to equilibrium compared with when you switched the system off (this also happens inside the cell as well as between cells). Voltage also depends on temperature, ageing, and also whether you are charging or discharging the battery (hysteresis).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Swelling &amp; Cracking</h3><a id="user-content-swelling--cracking" aria-label="Permalink: Swelling &amp; Cracking" href="#swelling--cracking"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Another problem with silicon is that the particles swell to around 80% bigger when lithiated compared to de-lithiated. This is an issue because this causes stress to the particle itself which may break up and no-longer form an active part of the material, and it may also impact its surrounding host material, either breaking that or breaking its connection with it. These mechanical effects cause accelerated ageing of the cell where active material inventory is lost more quickly and cell capacity decreases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/cracking.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/cracking.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Fortunately, making the particles smaller, helps both with the voltage hysteresis and the effects of swelling, it also increases the active surface area per unit mass of the silicon and this helps lower the losses associated with the reactions in the battery.</p>
<p dir="auto">How do I know all this you might wonder? Well, there is a certain amount of intuition to these things and I have a PhD and several more years subsequently researching electrochemical systems. But the main reason is that these systems can be explored, tested and evaluated with computational simulations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PyBaMM to the rescue</h2><a id="user-content-pybamm-to-the-rescue" aria-label="Permalink: PyBaMM to the rescue" href="#pybamm-to-the-rescue"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's look at some cool things you can do with simulation to help debug your battery problem. <a href="https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/">PyBaMM</a> is open-source and written in Python (that's the <strong>Py</strong> bit). The "BaMM" stands for <strong>Ba</strong>tery <strong>M</strong>athematical <strong>M</strong>odelling.</p>
<p dir="auto">First off, what is going on inside when I charge and discharge and why is my voltage changing the way it does? Which physical processes and their related design features have the biggest effect on the voltage?</p>

<p dir="auto">Here we can clearly see the big difference in voltage when we stop discharging the battery and start resting. But what exactly is going on here? A useful feature of PyBaMM is to split the voltage into its constituent components, known as overpotentials. You have the ideal potential of the battery for a certain state of charge when everything is in equilibrium: the open-circuit potential (OCP) and then you have all the voltage losses associated with things not being at equilibrium.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here we can immediately learn a few things:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A large portion of the change in voltage of the cell is just the open circuit voltage changing as a function of lithiation (SoC), but other processes are certainly significant.</li>
<li>At the point that the current stops, the voltage relaxes a great deal almost instantly. You can see the green reaction overpotential, purple Ohmic electrolyte potential and brown Ohmic electrode overpotential go from being thick sections to disappearing. This makes sense as these processes are all related to current and ion transport.</li>
<li>The orange and to an extent the red concentration overpotentials are slower to disappear which means that ions are still moving in the system when no reactions are taking place and this is due to the build up of concentration gradients inside the active solid and electrolyte.</li>
<li>The electrolyte losses due to concentration (overpotential) during discharge are fairly sizeable (around 100 mV) but they disappear much faster than within the active material meaning that diffusion is much easier in the electrolyte than within the solid.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We can inspect the concentration profiles in both solid particles and the electrolyte to confirm these findings. Below are 5 snapshots at the start of the rest period and afterwards.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="plotter = pybamm.QuickPlot(solutions=[solution], output_variables=[

<p dir="auto">The concentration in the positive particle is still not equal as a function of radius. We can intuitively guess then that changing some feature of the positive particle may have some effect on the relaxation behavior of the cell. Let's see what the current positive particle radius is and where changing this value has a significant effect.</p>

<p dir="auto">Now the contributions of the positive solid particle to the voltage at rest is resolved much more quickly than before. This is because the smaller particle size allows for faster diffusion of lithium ions in and out of the particle. This is a good example of how the model can be used to investigate the effect of different parameters on the performance of a battery.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is just one example of how to use modelling to debug your battery problem. <strong>PyBaMM</strong> also has many other examples including one on modelling <a href="https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/examples/notebooks/models/differential-capacity-hysteresis-state.html" rel="nofollow">hysteresis</a> in silicon anodes. Also as we can see here a single experiment takes a matter of seconds and with some of the simpler models only a matter of ms. This helps engineers really battle the curse of dimensionality. For example the Ragone plot below sweeping over some of the common parameters you might investigate changing contains 6500 data points and with each one taking less than 1s running one after the other on a single core would take under 2 hours to compute, already a massive saving compared to weeks with our 1000 channel cycler lab (each experiment takes less than an hour in the lab but we have to prepare the materials and build the cells too). With parallel computing this number can be cut to less than a minute.</p>

We know from the documents that various domains belonging to Snapchat, Amazon and Youtube were of interest. It's not known if any other user traffic was intercepted, or just proxied on. This type of information we can't obtain from looking at the archived Onavo Protect apps, rather for the time being, we have to rely on the content in the court documents made available to the public.</p><p>Over time the success of their strategy to employ a transparent TLS proxy was diminishing due to improved security controls in Android.  Additionally certificate pinning adoption was said to be an issue. As an alterative, Facebook were considering using the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491?hl=en&amp;ref=doubleagent.net#:~:text=Google%20Play%20permits%20the%20use,that%20they%20are%20accessibility%20tools." rel="noreferrer">Accessibility API</a> as an alternative. </p><figure><img src="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="818" height="161" srcset="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-14.png 600w, https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-14.png 818w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Page 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is what Google has to say about using the accessibility features on their operating system:</p><blockquote>"only services that are designed to help people with disabilities access their device or otherwise overcome challenges stemming from their disabilities are eligible to declare that they are accessibility tools."</blockquote><p>It's somewhat telling of a company that would consider abusing features designed to support people with disabilities for a competitive advantage. Generally, Android accessibility functionality misuse is attributed to malicious applications such as <a href="https://blog.pradeo.com/accessibility-services-mobile-analysis-malware?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">banking malware</a>.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Mark Zuckerberg states the need for "<em>reliable analytics</em>" on Snapchat:</p><figure><img src="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="617" height="335" srcset="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-4.png 600w, https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png 617w"></figure><p>The solution?

Facebook had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel/?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">acquired </a>Onavo for approximately $120M USD in 2013 and needed to put this technology in good use. That price point should give a clear indication on the value they placed on the ability to gain competitor intelligence from people's phones and tablets. </p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/notes-on-analytics-and-tracking-in-onavo-protect-for-ios-904bdff346c0?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">Prior research</a> on the iOS version notes that the Onavo VPN app was collecting some usage telemetry from iPhones. On Android we can see the app was pulling much more fine grained statistics from their user's devices by utilizing permissions granted under the pretext of showing the user app data usage (we will see how this looked in an embedded video below). But that was not enough, Facebook wanted to take this one step further and intercept encrypted traffic towards specific competitor's analytics domains in order to obtain data on the "<strong>in-app actions"</strong>.</p><p>All they would need to do is to get the user to install a custom certificate into the user's phone's trust store (and be on specific Android releases).</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p>The wiretapping claim is new and perhaps not to be confused with the prior controversy and litigation: </p><p>In 2023, two subsidiaries of Facebook was ordered to pay a total of $20M by the Australian Federal Court for "engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law", according to the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/20m-penalty-for-meta-companies-for-conduct-liable-to-mislead-consumers-about-use-of-their-data?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">ACCC</a>.</p><p>Facebook had shutdown Onavo in 2019 after an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">investigation </a>revealed they had been paying teenagers to use the app to track them. Also that year, Apple went as far as to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220609072355/https://www.vox.com/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app" rel="noreferrer">revoke Facebook's developer program certificates</a>, sending a clear message. </p><p>Despite the apps being taken offline, we are able to find old archived versions which enabled the technical insights offered in this post. </p></div></div><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h2><p>Websites and applications on end user devices trust remote websites or servers over HTTPS/TLS due to public certificates that are stored in the device's trust store. These "certificate authority" certs are the "trust anchor" that applications rely on to verify they communicating with the intended party. These certificates are generally distributed and stored within the operating system. By adding your own self-signed certificate to the appropriate trust store, it is often possible to intercept encrypted TLS traffic. Corporations may also do this as a means of inspecting outbound traffic from employee's devices. Security testers may also do this on their own devices. There are legitimate reasons for doing this. The question here is if what Facebook did was legitimate, meaning, was it legal or not.</p><div><p>There is some irony that the documentation for software that Facebook is said to employ to do the interception contains the following <a href="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslBump?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">warning</a>:</p></div><blockquote>HTTPS was designed to give users an expectation of privacy and security. Decrypting HTTPS tunnels without user consent or knowledge may violate ethical norms and may be illegal in your jurisdiction. </blockquote><p>Unlike iOS on the iPhone, Google has made numerous changes to make it extremely difficult to install a CA cert that will be trusted by most applications on the phone. In Android 11, released in September 2020, Google had completely blocked the mechanism which the app used to prompt a user to install the cert and no application would trust any certificate in the user store by default.</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p>People have asked "<i><em>what about cert pinning? wouldn't this have prevented successful MITM of the traffic?</em></i>"</p><p>While that would be the case, as we will see later, at the time, the Snapchat app did not to cert pinning for it's analytics domain. This would likely hold true for the other app domains. So it appears Facebook had leveraged off this technical limitation / oversight by it's competitors.</p></div></div><p>So today, technically speaking, is is simply is not possible to do what Facebook had done back in 2016 to 2019. But it worked - so how did they do it? Fortunately, at least with Android and the Play store ecosystem, we are able to often go back in time and sometimes dig up old Android app packages.</p><p>The first thing is to install the Onavo app on a test handset to see how users would interact with the app.  Despite the VPN connectivity not working and the actual backend service being down, we do get a glimpse on how the application coerces the user into accepting multiple permissions:</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://doubleagent.net/content/media/2024/04/zszPzD8NSHAFb9W1_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

And this type of information is valuable, to the tune of $120M (what FB paid in the acquisition).</p><figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJpCkIEbkAAsckm?format=jpg&amp;name=small" alt="Image" loading="lazy" width="486" height="680"></figure><p>The Android manifest includes the <code>uses-permission</code> directive <code>android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</code> which is what we are agreeing to in the screenshot above:</p><figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJptvfla8AA0rVZ?format=png&amp;name=medium" alt="Image" loading="lazy" width="903" height="412"></figure><p>Continuing with the "application stats" feature (assumed to be the original core functionality), we can dump the schema of the local database on the handset to get an idea on exactly what it was collecting on the device itself:</p><figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJpyTakbIAAeD_A?format=png&amp;name=large" alt="Image" loading="lazy" width="1882" height="460"></figure><p>Mostly it seems they could just obtain statistics on in app usage of other applications and of course the network traffic usage for the apps. It's still somewhat high level statistics and clearly not enough granularity for what Mark was after, implied by one of the emails in the court documents. Intercepting the actual encrypted traffic towards the analytics domains of various competitors on the other hand, would do the trick. And to do this, Facebook would have to get a CA certificate somehow on the device.</p><p>But we don't see any prompt to install any certificate. This is because the VPN did not successfully connect to the remote service, which appears to be precondition. Time or interest permitting, I may go back to figure out how to trigger the certificate installation prompt.</p><figure><img src="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/GJo--s8aQAAYwtL.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1062" height="365" srcset="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/GJo--s8aQAAYwtL.png 600w, https://doubleagent.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/GJo--s8aQAAYwtL.png 1000w, https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/GJo--s8aQAAYwtL.png 1062w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Connections timing out, and a tcpdump shows that all traffic from the device is dropped after the VPN connection is initiated</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="onto-the-ca-certificates">Onto the CA certificates</h3><p>Decompiling the app, we do see the functionality is there.

A user would have to manually install the certificate. It would no longer be possible to have Facebook's CA cert installed directly in the app.</p><p>Another notable change in Android 7 - According to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-config?ref=doubleagent.net" rel="noreferrer">Android documentation</a> (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote>By default, secure connections (using protocols like TLS and HTTPS) from all apps trust the pre-installed system CAs, and <strong>apps targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) and lower also trust the user-added CA store by default</strong></blockquote><p>In other words, it appears other apps would have trusted certs in the user store from Android Marshmallow (Android 6) and below, but from Android 7, released in August 22, 2016, they would no longer be trusted at all by other applications, unless due to a security configuration in the app's manifest file.</p><p>Another  improvement to Android in version 7 was that it was made impossible to install certificates into the system store by <em>any</em> means except by fully rooting the device. </p><p>Regardless, the functionality remained in both the older version and newer, all the way to the last published app in 2019. The actual MITM certificate was removed in 2017. Detail in the court documents may offer plausible explanation:</p><blockquote>Where is the key generated that's used for the SSL bump and how it protected from abuse? (e.g., is generated on the device, specific to that device, and never leaves the device, or is there a shared key that's downloaded with the app and installed)<p><strong>The certificate is generated on the server and being sent to the device</strong></p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="933" height="104" srcset="https://doubleagent.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-15.png 600w, https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Page 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736</span></figcaption></figure><p>So we need to go back to much older releases before 2019, specifically a version from September 2017. The certificates in this version are found as assets named "<code>old_ca.cer</code>" and "<code>new_ca.cer</code>".

            <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 23:52:32 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://posixcafe.org/blogs/2024/07/27/0/">https://posixcafe.org/blogs/2024/07/27/0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41090222">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>A large contributor to the "feel" of an Operating System comes from the software it chooses to include by default. There are entire linux distributions that differentiate themselves just based on the default configured software. There is room for so many options of base software because there are in general many different options to pick. Linux being just a kernel itself specifically creates an environment which encourages this (to some extent). This is both a blessing and a curse, for people wanting to write software targeting linux there now is some matrix of options they must test under if they want it to work with all the various software choices. BSD systems, unlike Linux, tend to include more than just a kernel by default, generally including some "blessed" c library, c compiler, libraries and programs. This makes targeting the system a bit easier, in the sense that you can assume there is a larger set of software on a BSD machine than you could with some system that uses a Linux kernel. Even with BSD however, not all of the software is in control of those in charge of the system itself, there is still a large amount of shared code between these systems for things like the c compiler. There are some pros and cons to this situation. On the plus side these systems get to reap the benefits of the work put in to these other projects (gnu, llvm, and so on), but this also does lead to there being some differences in design. Put in another way, if someone wanted the ability to touch every line of code (in the upstream sense), they would have to be a member of some non trivial amount of communities.</p>
<p>Plan 9 is unique in this sense that everything the system needs is covered by the base install. This includes the compilers, graphical environment, window manager, text editors, ssh client, torrent client, web server, and the list goes on. Nearly everything a user can do with the system is available right from the get go. I think this is super important for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Everything is one monorepo, a single commit hash communicates your entire kernel and user space state.
</li><li>
There is a consistency of design between all the code in the system.
</li><li>
There is no matrix of configurations to test your software against.
</li><li>
Programs can assume the presence of a fairly large collection of software.
</li><li>
There is an encouragement to write new software that adapts to the Plan 9 style instead of importing existing software.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course some downsides to this approach as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Plan 9 implementations tend to not be as feature rich as the proper upstream variants.
</li><li>
There is a larger barrier to entry when adding new programs or features to the system.
</li><li>
In general the system becomes somewhat isolated from the general flow of software outside of it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I generally like to think the pros outweight the cons, but I do acknowledge this design is part of the reason why Plan 9 has generally been stuck as just a hobbyist curiosity.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight this difference because I think in general people are not aware of the amount of independent implementations that have been written for 9front as part of following this design. There is no other system that provides this many examples of its own interfaces, that are by themselves generally useful programs.</p>
<p>Some examples I'm fond of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ssh.c/f.html">ssh</a>
</li><li>

</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ip/torrent.c/f.html">torrent client</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ktrans/f.html">Japanese, Korean &amp; Chinese IME</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ip/cifsd/f.html">SMB server</a>
</li><li>
<a href="http://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/520d698c3e9ec8f76923965481aa15862f9f3c81/sys/src/cmd/ip/tinc.c/f.html">tinc VPN</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically because of this design, Plan 9 becomes an excellent learning resource for anything that it supports. It becomes a sandbox for individuals to learn and experiment with any topic of operating systems. In these regards I do think that Plan 9 is a truly unique collection of software.</p>
<p>If by some chance this writing interested you in the Plan 9, I encourage you to download the 9front iso and give it a go. As of the time of this writing the amd64 <a href="http://9front.org/releases/2024/04/28/0/">release iso</a> is a measily 467M and includes everything I've talked about.</p>

<p>Created by the Norwegian development studio <a href="https://www.badgerpunch.com/">Badger Punch Games</a>, it is an ambitious follow-up to the spectacular Commodore 64 homebrew <strong>Rogue 64</strong> — a game that earned a ton of praise upon its release in 2022 from indie outlets as well as from more mainstream outlets like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rogue64-roguelike-new-game-commodore-64-c64-badgerpunch-games/">Destructoid</a>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the game is a roguelike inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft and sees players exploring a maze of dungeons as one of three character archetypes (a fighter, a rogue, or a mage), in search of unimaginable treasure. Along the way, there are various secrets, items, and enemies to encounter, with the ultimate goal being to navigate the various levels and kill the tentacled monster hiding out at the end.</p>
<p>The first we heard that Badger Punch was <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/roguecraft-is-a-stunning-new-roguelike-coming-to-amiga-this-year">working on a follow-up to Rogue 64 was at the beginning of 2023</a>, but it was actually announced even earlier than that, with <a href="https://x.com/sphair/status/1571850810069336064">the devs teasing the logo as early as September 2022</a>. Since then, we've been eagerly anticipating updates about the game and were excited earlier this month to see it finally go on pre-order, with the help of <a href="https://www.thalamusdigital.co.uk/">Thalamus Digital</a>.</p>
<p>The game is now expected to be released later this year, in September, so we thought it might be a good time to have a chat with its two core developers, the programmer Ricki Sickenger and artist Henning Ludvigsen, to discuss their incredible development journey so far. They gave us a little more context on how Badger Punch was originally formed, why they wanted to develop a new title for the Amiga, and why the game has taken a bit longer to make than initially expected.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Time Extension: Can you tell us a bit about Badger Punch Games? How did the core team come together?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ludvigsen:</strong> We got to know each other in the early 90s, as we were both members of the same Amiga demo group. We’re both based in Norway, but we live on opposite sides of the country. Ricki’s in the west and I'm in the East.</p>
<p>In the late 90’s both of us started working on an MMORPG game called <strong>Darkfall Online</strong> with a bunch of other friends. To make a really long and complicated story very short, it basically ended up with us moving to Athens, Greece to merge with another company and to make the game, and it took almost 10 years of really hard work. Towards the end, Ricki moved back to Norway while I was stuck there for a little bit longer. We kept in touch daily and just started working on a small game for Xbox Indie Live, just for fun. And that’s when Badger Punch Games became a reality. And we’ve just kept going since then. Still, just as a side project, just for fun.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> Obviously, as you mentioned, Roguecraft isn’t the team’s first game. You’ve released multiple projects across a wide range of platforms in the past, including Commodore 64. What made you want to tackle a project for Amiga machines? What is your own personal history with the hardware?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sickenger:</strong> I got my Amiga 500 around 1990, after having a C64 for a few years. I immediately started teaching myself 68k assembly and started making small intros and other things in assembly, [before] getting into the Amiga demoscene. I have fond memories of coding on the Amiga, and after making a few games on the C64 I really wanted to get back into assembly on the Amiga. The Amiga hits the sweet spot for me regarding capabilities and what you can accomplish on it as a hobby project. It really is a cool machine to make things for.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ludvigsen:</strong> My own personal history with the Amiga was getting a taste of it by borrowing my big brother’s Amiga 1000 without permission. However, I was using the C64/C128 for a few more years before finally getting my hands on an Amiga CDTV, which I will admit was a strange choice. Still, it was enough to get me hooked on creating music and pixel art and getting introduced to (and included) in the demo scene. At a later point, I replaced the CDTV with an Amiga 1200, and I stepped up my game even further. I still have my lovely A1200 to this day.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> What have been some of the advantages and disadvantages of working with the Amiga hardware?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sickenger:</strong> The big advantage compared to the C64, is that the Amiga is much faster and has dedicated coprocessors that lighten the load for the CPU. The blitter makes it pretty easy to add a lot of moving graphics on the screen, and the ability to set up your own 32-color palette lets us customize the colors to the game. Henning did an excellent job of making a palette and graphics that really showcase the Amiga’s graphical capabilities.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage I guess is that it is easy to get a bit over-ambitious when developing for the Amiga. That would be okay in a commercial sense, but not when you're trying to make games as a hobby while having a job and other commitments. Roguecraft was supposed to take about 6 months to develop and ended up taking 2 years. Also, the coprocessors like the Blitter and Copper add a layer of complexity to the coding that can get in the way before you gain experience with the Amiga architecture.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> On your website, Roguecraft is described as an enhanced version of Rogue 64 — a game that you previously released for the Commodore 64. What were some of the main things you wanted to incorporate into this expanded version of the game to take advantage of the more powerful hardware?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sickenger:</strong> With Roguecraft we wanted to explore the possibilities of the Amiga hardware, so we changed to isometric graphics and added quite a few new things while keeping the same gameplay as Rogue64.</p>
<p>Using the isometric style we were able to add a lot more detail to the dungeons and the monsters. Also, using an isometric view just gave us more depth to the visuals.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> We’re huge fans of the game’s pixelated isometric graphics. How did you develop the look of the game? What were the influences you drew on?</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Ludvigsen:</strong></strong></strong> We wanted to give using an isometric view a try, as we’ve never really done anything like that earlier. There are no real influences to the visuals, except that we do love the Lovecraftian universe, and thought it would be cool to use that as an inspiration. There’s also where the name “Roguecraft” came from; It’s a Rogue-style game set in the Lovecraft universe. The style just happened organically over time — as the palette gradually got established so did the visual style.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> What other tools are you using for this project? Is it mostly bespoke stuff or are there any common toolsets you’re taking advantage of?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sickenger:</strong> Each room is pre-made in a lovely program called <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>. Tiled supports isometric tilesets, and helped us enormously. We have scripts that convert the Tiled room data into assembly data so they can be used in-game.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Ludvigsen:</strong></strong> For the pixel art, I’m using Photoshop. I found a YouTube tutorial called '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q36EyvaYG8">HD Index Painting in Photoshop</a>' by “Dan Fessler which really helped me establish a pipeline that worked for me. We tweaked this pipeline to work well with our limited 32-color Amiga palette. The cool thing with this workflow is that you can work pretty much non-destructively in Photoshop using most of the tools and still stay within the established 32-color palette. We’re also using Tiled for building the rooms based on the tile sets we’re creating, which has worked tremendously well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are over 100 room variations, and as you progress in the game, the rooms get more dark and gritty. That keeps the levels from feeling too repetitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> Let’s talk about the dungeons in the game. The game features randomly generated levels. Could you explain how these were built? What were some of the rules you set in place to ensure these were fun to play and not needlessly repetitive?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sickenger:</strong> We used some common techniques and some simplifications to generate the dungeons. Every level in the dungeon is a 5x5 grid of rooms. The randomizing algorithm removes a room at a time, and then for each room it has removed, it checks that you still can access every room from every other room. That means we haven’t split the dungeon in two. If the dungeon has been split, we re-add the room and randomly pick another room to remove. We keep doing this until we have reached the minimum number of rooms, or until we have had to re-add rooms a certain number of times. Rooms are placed in the dungeon depending on how many exits they have and where they fit. There are over 100 room variations, and as you progress in the game, the rooms get more dark and gritty. That keeps the levels from feeling too repetitive.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Time Extension:</strong> Just as a final question, how much work is still left to do on the game at this stage? How are you feeling about things as you’re getting closer to the release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ludvigsen:</strong> The game is done, and it has been for quite a while. The pre-orders for the physical boxes opened on July 1st, which is exciting!</p>
<p>As a developer, there are always things that you know about and would have loved to keep polishing on, but we’ve focused on not falling into crazy amounts of feature creep and keeping a fairly basic and hopefully fun game experience.</p>
<p>From what we’ve seen so far, the reviews and feedback have been overwhelmingly positive which is more than we ever hoped for, so we’re currently just hoping that we’ve squished all the bugs before the big release. Also, releasing the game under the legendary Thalamus Digital banner is something we're nerding out about.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're interested in checking the game out, Roguecraft is currently available to pre-order now from <a href="https://www.thalamus.shop/product/roguecraft-amiga">Thalamus Digital's website</a> in three different versions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page">
				<p>A ‘tritone substitution’ is a popular trick for making your music sound more sophisticated.  I’ll show you a couple of videos with lots of examples.  But since I’m mathematician, let me start with the bare-bones basics.</p>
<p>The fifth note of the major scale is called the <b>dominant</b>.   In the key of C it’s G.</p>
<p>A <b>dominant seventh chord</b> is a 4-note chord where you start at the dominant and go up the major scale skipping every other note.  In the key of C it’s the notes in boldface here:</p>
<p><b>G</b> A <b>B</b> C <b>D</b> E <b>F</b></p>
<p>Below I’ve drawn blue edges from G to B, from B to D, and from D to F:</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/dominant_seventh_in_c.jpg">
</p>
<p>Any dominant seventh chord has two notes that are opposite each other—shown in orange here.   We say they’re a <b>tritone</b> apart.</p>
<p>A tritone is very dissonant, so the dominant seventh chord really wants to ‘resolve’ to something more sweet.   This tendency is a major driving force in classical music and jazz!   There’s a lot more to say about it.</p>
<p>But never mind.  What if we take my picture and rotate it 180 degrees?   Then we get a new chord!  This trick is called a <b>tritone substitution</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at it:</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/dominant_seventh_in_c_and_tritone_substitution.jpg">
</p>
<p>Here you see our original dominant seventh chord (with notes connected by blue edges):</p>
<p>G B D F</p>
<p>and its tritone substitution (with notes connected by red edges):</p>
<p>C♯ F G♯ B</p>
<p>Each note in the tritone substitution is a tritone higher than the corresponding note in the dominant seventh chord—so it’s the point on the opposite side of the circle.</p>
<p>But two notes in the dominant seventh were directly opposite each other to begin with: B and F.   So these two notes are also in the tritone substitution!</p>
<p>This makes the tritone substitution sound a lot like the original dominant seventh chord.</p>
<p>See the square of notes?   Three are in the original dominant seventh, and three are in the tritone substitution.    Musicians like such squares of notes, even though they’re quite dissonant.  They’re called <b>diminished seventh chords</b>.   But let me stop here instead of blasting you with too much information.</p>
<p>Let’s actually listen to some tritone substitutions:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSvO5Tb18tI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/davidbennettpiano">David Bennett</a> plays a bunch of songs that use tritone substitutions.   I’m very glad to learn that the slippery, suave sound at a certain point of The Girl from Ipanema comes from using a tritone substitution.   He also plays a version <i>without</i> the tritone substitution, and you can hear how boring it is by comparison!</p>
<p>Music theorists tend to bombard their audience with more information than nonexperts can swallow in one sitting.  David Bennett could have made a nice easy video full of examples where musicians apply a tritone substitution to a dominant seventh chord in its most natural position, where it starts at the 5th note in the major scale.   But you can also take a dominant seventh chord and move it up or down, getting a chord called a <b>secondary dominant</b>, and then do a tritone substitution to <i>that</i>.   And Bennett feels compelled to show us all the possibilities, and how they get used in fairly well-known tunes.</p>
<p>If you start getting overwhelmed, don’t feel bad.  Let me show you another explanation of tritone substitutions:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGER2AiVfN0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span></p>
<p>I really love the friendly, laid-back yet analytical style of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@michaelkeithson">Michael Keithson</a>.   He’s great at explaining how you could have invented harmony theory on your own starting from a few basic principles.  He’s like the music theory teacher I always wish I had.</p>
<p>His pose above is a parody of the sneaky punch that a tritone substitution can pack.  Speaking of which, if you want to sound like a hipster, you say <b>tritone sub</b>.  Don’t mix this up with the submarine used by the Greek sea god born of Poseidon and Aphrodite: that’s the ‘Triton sub’.</p>
<p>In this video Keithson explains tritone subs.  He starts out basic.  Then he gets into all the ways you can use a tritone sub.  You may want to quit at some point when it gets too complicated.  I think it’s better to just zone out and listen to his piano playing.  Even if you don’t follow all his words, you’ll get a sense of what tritone subs can do!</p>
<p>Understanding tritone subs well requires understanding dominant chords, and Keithson has a good lesson on those, too:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGRTLk1nAlo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span></p>

<p dir="auto">This is the main repository of managarm, a microkernel-based operating system.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What is special about managarm?</strong> Some notable properties of managarm are:
(i) managarm is based on a microkernel while common Desktop operating systems like Linux and Windows use monolithic kernels,
(ii) managarm uses a completely asynchronous API for I/O
and (iii) despite those internal differences, managarm provides good compatibility with Linux at the user space level.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Aren't microkernels slow?</strong> Microkernels do have some performance disadvantages over monolithic kernels.
managarm tries to mitigate some of those issues by providing good abstractions (at the driver and system call levels)
that allow efficient implementations of common user space functionality (like POSIX).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Is this a Linux distribution?</strong> No, managarm runs its own kernel that does not originate from Linux.
While the managarm user space API supports many Linux APIs (e.g. epoll, timerfd, signalfd or tmpfs),
managarm does not share any source code (or binaries) with the Linux kernel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Official Discord server:</strong> <a href="https://discord.gg/7WB6Ur3" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/7WB6Ur3</a>. This is our primary real-time communication channel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Official IRC channel:</strong> <code>#managarm</code> on <code>irc.libera.chat</code>, with many more available! Type <code>/msg alis list managarm</code> to find them.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>64-bit operating system with SMP (i.e., multicore) and ACPI support.</li>
<li>Fully asynchronous microkernel and servers.</li>
<li>Support for many modern hardware devices such as USB 3 controllers.</li>
<li>Networking support.</li>
<li>POSIX and Linux API compatibility.</li>
<li>Support for Linux-style special files (epoll, signalfd, ...) and pseudo file systems (<code>/sys</code>, <code>/proc</code>, ...).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trying out managarm</h2><a id="user-content-trying-out-managarm" aria-label="Permalink: Trying out managarm" href="#trying-out-managarm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to try out managarm without building the whole OS, you can download a
xz-compressed <a href="https://builds.managarm.org/repos/files/managarm/latest/image.xz" rel="nofollow">nightly image</a>;
these images are automatically compiled on <a href="https://builds.managarm.org/" rel="nofollow">our build server</a>
and reflect the current state of Managarm development.
To run the (uncompressed) image using qemu, we recommend the following flags:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2048 -cpu host,migratable=off -device qemu-xhci -device usb-kbd -device usb-tablet -drive id=hdd,file=image,format=raw,if=none -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=hdd -vga vmware -debugcon stdio</code></p>

    	  <p>Aphex Twin’s “Vordhosbn” just got a surprising video reveal, showing how the track was made. So let’s revisit trackers and 90s underground music culture.<span id="more-80168"></span></p>
<p>You’re probably familiar with the term “white label,” but where did that term originate?”? Back in the early days of DJing, DJs were very territorial about their crate digging. Sometimes, in order to avoid rival DJs looking at their decks to ID their selections (this is way before the days of Shazam, remember), DJs would rip off the labels of a particularly rare record, leaving the white label residue with no identifying information.</p>
<p>Similarly, the 90s were an interesting time for music production. With the advent of computer sequencers, music became more complex – and in the wild west days before YouTube tutorials, concert phone vids, and everyone using Ableton Live, there was legitimate mystery behind how some of the most complex electronic music was made. Max? SuperCollider? Some homebrew software unavailable to the plebs? </p>
<p>If mystery in electronic music production was a game in the 90s, then Richard D. James was its undisputed winner. As Aphex Twin and a host of other pseudonyms, he created mind-bending sequences. As an interview subject, he was equal parts prankster and cagey. Sure, there was an idea of what the IDM greats were up to – Autechre and Plaid used Max, Squarepusher used Reaktor, Aphex used…something? The mystery has always been part of James’ appeal – here is a man who has claimed to sleep only four hours a night, or to have built or heavily modified all of his hardware, or to be sitting on hundreds if not thousands of unreleased tracks, among other tall tales.</p>
<p>Around 2014, something flipped with Richard D. James. After releasing Syro, his first album in 13 years as Aphex Twin, he unleashed the floodgates with a massive hard drive dump onto SoundCloud – seems he wasn’t lying about all those tracks after all. Following up with this, today you can see the <a href="https://aphextwin.warp.net/">debut of a custom Bleep store for Aphex Twin</a>, including loads of unreleased bonus tracks to go with his albums.</p>
<p>Of most interest to the nerds, however, has got to be this seemingly innocuous video, in which we get a trollingly-effected screencast video of Drukqs track “Vordhosbn”, playing out in the vintage tracker PlayerPro. James had previously identified PlayerPro as his main environment for making Drukqs – now we have video of it in action:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/223378825" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" title="pp" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, there we have it. A classic Aphex Twin track with the curtain drawn up. What can we learn from this video? A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayerPro’s tracks were all monophonic, so the chords in “Vordhosbn” had to be made using multiple tracks</li>
<li>As expected with a tracker, it’s largely built from samples – likely from James’ substantial hardware collection</li>
<li>Hey, those oscilloscopes and spectral displays are fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps what’s best about this video is that it shows an Aphex classic for what it is – a track, composed in much the same way as any other electronic musician might do it. It doesn’t detract from the special qualities of Aphex’s music, but it does show us what was really going on behind all the mystery – music-making.</p>
<h3>Keep Track of It</h3>
<p>It’s worth spending a moment to celebrate trackers. Long before the days of piano rolls, trackers were the best way to make intricate sequences using a computer. YouTube is riddled with classic jungle tracks from the mid-90s using software like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OctaMED">OctaMed</a>:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSj92M0N65M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For a dedicated community, trackers are still the way to go. And there’s no better tracker around now than Renoise – whose developers have done a fantastic job bringing the tracker workflow into the 21st century. Check out this video of Venetian Snares’ “Vache” done in Renoise:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGK-EzEa45U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like most trackers, Renoise has something of a steep learning curve to get all the key commands right; once you’re there, however, you’ll find it to be a very nimble environment for wild micro-edits and crazy sequences. There’s definitely a reason why it remains a tool of choice for breakcore producers!</p>

    <p>There are two things that connect the names Gauss, Riemann, Hilbert and Noether. One is their outstanding breadth of contributions to the field of mathematics. The other is that each was a professor at the same university in Göttingen, Germany. </p>

<p>Although relatively unknown today, Göttingen, a small German university town, was for a time one of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Gottingen">most productive centers of mathematics</a> in history. </p>

<p>Göttingen’s rise to mathematical primacy occurred over generations, but its fall took less than a decade when its stars were pushed abroad by the advent of National Socialism, the ideology of the Nazi Party. The university’s best minds <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.4.20180926a/full/">left Germany in the early 1930s</a>, transferring its substantial mathematical legacy to Princeton, New York University, and other British and American universities. By 1943, <a href="https://assets.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/20150530122143/Annual-Report-1942.pdf">16 former Göttingen</a> faculty members were in the U.S.</p>

<p>The story of the rise and fall of mathematics in Göttingen has largely been forgotten, but names associated with the place still appear frequently in the world of mathematics. Its legacy survives today in other mathematical research powerhouses around the world.</p>

<h2>Founding of the university</h2>

<p>In 1734, King George II, who ruled both the United Kingdom and a large area of land in Northern Europe, founded a <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/history-of-the-university-%E2%80%93-an-overview/90607.html">university in Göttingen</a>, Germany. </p>

<p>The Enlightenment was by this point in full swing in northern Germany. For example, <a href="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/17th_leibniz.html">mathematician Gottfried Leibniz</a> developed calculus less than 100 miles north of the new university, just 50 years before its founding. </p>



<p>Finding themselves in the midst of the Enlightenment, scientific researchers at the new University of Göttingen had more academic freedom than <a href="https://brill.com/view/title/15703">generations past</a>. <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001/acprof-9780198206606-chapter-2">They were promised</a> intellectual autonomy and freedom from close religious supervision. Instead, they were recruited solely to advance knowledge and carry out original research. The education of students was also more <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Challenges_to_the_Enlightenment.html?id=k7baAAAAMAAJ">egalitarian</a> than it had been previously in Europe, as both rich and poor were admitted and trained.</p>

<p>By the late 18th century, the university in Göttingen was a well-known center of scientific learning in Germany. Its enduring mathematical prowess, however, originated in <a href="http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/gauss.html">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>. Often referred to as the prince of mathematics, his research at Göttingen between 1795 and 1855 spanned from algebra to magnetism to astronomy.</p>

<p>Gauss’s discoveries were groundbreaking, but the reputation that he started in Göttingen only grew as <a href="https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/en/burmann.xhtml">mathematicians from across Europe</a> flocked to the town. Bernhard Riemann, the head of mathematics at Göttingen from 1859 to 1866, invented Riemannian geometry, which paved the way for Einstein’s future work on relativity. Felix Klein, the chair of mathematics from 1886 to 1913, was the first to describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle">Klein bottle</a>, a 3-dimensional object with just one side, similar to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-weird-world-of-one-sided-objects-101936">Mobius strip</a>. </p>

<p>Klein was instrumental in hiring the next generation of mathematicians to Göttingen. This generation included <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Runge.html">Carl Runge</a>, who helped invent a key part of today’s most accurate weather prediction software, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">Runge-Kutta time stepper</a>; Hermann <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski.html">Minkowski</a>, who is perhaps best known for his work on relativity; and David Hilbert. </p>

<p>Hilbert’s <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/%7Esmahanta/hilbert.html">famous 23 problems</a>, presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, guided mathematical research for the entire 20th century. During his career as professor and head of the math department at Göttingen, he mentored an astounding<a href="https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=7298"> 76 Ph.D. students</a>, many of whom went on to make seminal discoveries of their own. </p>

<h2>The exodus</h2>

<p>After Gauss’s appointment at the university until the early 1930s, Göttingen’s mathematical prowess survived in an environment of constant political turmoil, including the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War and World War I.</p>

<p>But the wave of nationalism that accompanied the Nazis’ rise to power in the early 1930s transformed Göttingen. The 1933 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Professional_Civil_Service">Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service</a> made it illegal for any non-Aryan, specifically Jews, to serve as a professor or teacher in Germany. In response to this and other <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitic-legislation-1933-1939">anti-Semitic legislation</a>, Jewish scholars, professors with Jewish connections and anyone who opposed Nazism fled Germany. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/noether.html">Emmy Noether</a>, who had been the first female professor of mathematics at Göttingen and was described by Einstein as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1935/05/04/archives/the-late-emmy-noether-professor-einstein-writes-in-appreciation-of.html">the most important woman in the history of mathematics</a>, left in 1933 to teach at Bryn Mawr College. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Courant">Richard Courant</a> left in 1933 to help found the top U.S. applied mathematics institute at New York University. <a href="https://www.ias.edu/hermann-weyl-life">Hermann Weyl</a>, who had been appointed Hilbert’s successor as chair of mathematics in Göttingen, moved to Princeton, where he helped to transform the Institute for Advanced Studies into a research powerhouse.</p>

<p>Hilbert was asked in 1934 by the minister of science under the Nazi regime whether mathematics in Göttingen had suffered from the departure of the Jews and friends of the Jews. <a href="https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/scientific-exodus">He replied</a>: “Suffered? It hasn’t suffered, Mr. Minister. It doesn’t exist anymore!” Hilbert was right. Only one of the pre-Nazi full professors stayed past 1934. </p>

<p>The center of mathematics shifted quickly during the Nazi era and in the wake of World War II. Courant, Weyl and others helped move it to the U.K. and the U.S., where most of the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/mathematics">top-ranked mathematics programs</a> are located today. </p>

<p>These countries’ mathematical heritage is in Göttingen. Its story is their story.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <center><img src="https://boogiemath.org/assets/img/zariski.283fce0c.png" width="80%"></center> <p>I am always excited when I stumble upon a biography of a mathematician I wasn’t previously aware of. It’s strange (or perhaps not, given we’re talking about mathematics) how many brilliant minds in the field lack the biographical treatment they deserve. Consider just a few luminaries from the first half of the 20th century:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Hasse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helmut Hasse<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <p>For physicists, it’s a bit different. I think they are much better covered.
The reason might be that their work is more directly connected to everyday life. Just think of nuclear energy
or the theory of relativity, which is crucial for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPS<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> to work properly.</p> <p>So, recently I came across the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3HX6kUq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biography of Oscar Zariski<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.
Zariski (1899-1986) was one of the founders of modern algebraic geometry.</p> <p>My wish is that one day I will be able to read Zariski’s book Algebraic Surfaces from 1935, as well as the 1971 version, which includes notes from his students—remarkable mathematicians like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hartshorne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin Hartshorne<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Mumford<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.
Zariski mentioned that with this book, he began doing real mathematics, real algebraic geometry. In it, he reconstructed the algebraic geometry developed by the Italian school using the modern algebra introduced by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmy Noether<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Krull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolfgang Krull<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <p>But what about his life?
Let’s consider the following paragraph from the book:
“I spent hours and hours doing math problems without a teacher forcing me. Whole books of algebra
problems – I did them one after another. I was only seven or eight, but I always wanted mathematics.”</p> <p>That might be something you’d find in many biographies of world-renowned mathematicians, right? However, Carol Parikh notes: “Although Zariski was by all accounts an exceptionally quick and eager math student, the full extent of his gifts became apparent relatively late in life. He was almost twenty-five before he published his first paper and almost fifty when he did his great work on holomorphic functions...”</p> <p>In fact, Zariski remained active and productive even into his eighties.</p> <p>But how did Zariski’s story begin? It seems his older brother Moses played a significant role in shaping young Oscar. He taught him elementary algebra, and even when Oscar began surpassing him, he never resented it. While Oscar was in gymnasium, Moses would buy math and philosophy books for him during his business trips to Moscow and Petrograd. Oscar was especially interested in Hegel and Marx.</p> <p>I think it’s difficult for us today to fully grasp the hope that the Russian Revolution brought to the working people. There’s the following paragraph in the biography that illustrates this well: “He crossed the border into Italy in the late winter of 1921, having decided to enroll at the University of Pisa. On the platform at Udine, where he had stopped to change trains, he was recognized as Russian. Before he could even step into the waiting room, he found himself surrounded by a crowd of railway workers eager to hear about the revolution.”</p> <p>Of course, Italy was a turbulent country at that time, and Parikh continues: “Had there been a Fascist among the workers, the warmth of his welcome might have been quite otherwise...”</p> <p>But back to mathematics.
I was quite surprised when I read the following paragraph: “In the fall of 1921 the University of Rome was the most important center
of algebraic geometry in the world. What is now known as 'the Italian School' had been started by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Cremona" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luigi Cremona<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>...
It was only after 1900, however, as a result of the combined efforts of three great
Italian mathematicians –

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federigo_Enriques" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federigo Enriques<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Severi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Francesco Severi<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>
– that the Italians
had carried algebraic geometry off in a startling new direction.”</p> <p>In many history books on mathematics, you read so much about Göttingen mathematicians that you might easily get the impression that most of the important work was done there. Of course, that was not the case. I was surprised to learn that algebraic geometry actually began in Rome.</p> <p>However, Zariski later regretted not engaging with Göttingen mathematics earlier: “It was a pity that my Italian teachers never told me there was such a tremendous development of algebra connected with algebraic geometry.”</p> <p>The leader of the algebra revolution in Göttingen was, of course, Emmy Noether. Emmy Noether is one of my favorite mathematicians, and I’m always happy when I discover something new about her. Her lectures were legendary, but there are two anecdotes from Zariski’s biography that I hadn’t heard before: “Once, for example, when she was lecturing, her slip came down. She bent down, pulled off the slip, threw it into the corridor, and kept on lecturing.” And another: “Noether would be so eager to get her thoughts down that she would write across a wet blackboard, leaving her students to wait patiently for it to dry so they could read it.”</p> <p>There was at least some interaction with Göttingen, though. It is mentioned that Edmund Landau visited Rome at some point, and when he heard that the young Zariski liked to play chess, he invited him to a game. “But how can we play with all these people around?” asked Zariski, as they were in the middle of a party. “Easily,” Landau replied. “Blank. You know, without a board.”</p> <p>Zariski and other mathematicians and physicists regularly gathered at Caffè Greco to gossip and play chess. It’s interesting how important cafés were at that time. A recurring theme in the biographies of European mathematicians from the first half of the 20th century is their role in cafés. Just think of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vienna circle<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>
or the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Caf%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottish Café<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <p>What also surprised me in the biography was the striking difference between Jews in Italy and in Poland. Last year, I read Leopold Infeld’s autobiography, where he describes the Jewish ghettos in Poland as being almost completely isolated from the general population. In contrast, Zariski’s wife, Yole, who was an Italian Jew, was raised as an Italian and was largely unfamiliar with Jewish traditions. She was utterly surprised when she first saw the Jewish quarter in Warsaw, remarking: “The Jews in side curls and kaftans made me feel that I was living in two different nations.”</p> <p>But the story in the book that I liked the most is this one: Zariski was, of course, very much obsessed with mathematics. On the day he and his fiancée Yole were getting married, with Yole already dressed in white and veiled and the rabbi standing by, the bridegroom was nowhere to be found. It turned out he was working on a mathematical problem. Luckily, Yole was neither angry nor surprised; she was amused. Ha! I need to tell this to my wife.</p></div></div>]]></description>
