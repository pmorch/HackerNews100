  <div><p><span><em>This blog also appears in our <a href="http://www.eff.org/Age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age Verification Resource Hub</a>: our one-stop shop&nbsp;for users seeking to understand what age-gating laws actually do, what’s at stake, how to protect yourself, and why EFF opposes all forms of age verification mandates. Head to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/EFF.org/Age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFF.org/Age</a> to explore our resources and join us in the fight for a free, open, private, and yes—safe—internet.</em></span></p>
<p><span>EFF </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/blocking-access-harmful-content-will-not-protect-children-online-no-matter-how"><span>is against</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-guide-terminology"><span>age gating and age verification</span></a><span> mandates, and we hope we’ll win in getting existing ones overturned and new ones prevented. But mandates are </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/missouri-age-verification-law-porn-id-check-vpns/"><span>already in effect</span></a><span>, and every day many people are asked to verify their age across the web, despite </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/hack-age-verification-company-shows-privacy-danger-social-media-laws"><span>prominent</span></a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jmzd972leo"><span>cases</span></a><span> of sensitive data getting leaked in the process.</span></p>
<p><span>At some point, you may have been faced with the decision yourself: should I continue to use this service if I have to verify my age? And if so, how can I do that with the least risk to my personal information? This is our guide to navigating those decisions, with information on what questions to ask about the age verification options you’re presented with, and answers to those questions for some of the top most popular social media sites. Even though there’s no way to implement mandated age gates in a way that fully protects speech and privacy rights, our goal here is to help you minimize the infringement of your rights as you manage this awful situation.</span></p>
<h3><span>Follow the Data</span></h3>
<p><span>Since we know that leaks happen despite the best efforts of software engineers, we generally recommend submitting the absolute least amount of data possible. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be possible for everyone. Even facial age estimation solutions where pictures of your face never leave your device, offering some protection against data leakage, are not a good option for all users: facial age estimation works less well for </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/19/how-accurate-are-age-checks-for-australias-under-16s-social-media-ban-what-trial-data-reveals"><span>people</span></a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Yoti-Age-Estimation-White-Paper-July-2025-PUBLIC-v1.pdf"><span>color</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359246"><span>trans and nonbinary people</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-face-recognition-doesnt-know-your-face-is-a-face/"><span>people with disabilities</span></a><span>. There are some systems that use fancy cryptography so that a digital ID saved to your device won’t tell the website anything more than if you meet the age requirement, but access to that digital ID isn’t available to everyone or for all platforms. You may also not want to register for a digital ID and save it to your phone, if you don’t want to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/digital-identification-must-be-designed-privacy-and-equity-10"><span>take the chance</span></a><span> of all the information on it being exposed upon request of an over-zealous verifier, or you simply don’t want to be a part of a digital ID system</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re given the option of selecting a verification method and are deciding which to use, we recommend considering the following questions for each process allowed by each vendor:</span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Data:</b><span> What info does each method require?</span></li>
<li><b>Access: </b><span>Who can see the data during the course of the verification process?</span></li>
<li><b>Retention:</b><span> Who will hold onto that data after the verification process, and for how long?</span></li>
<li><b>Audits: </b>How sure are we that the stated claims will happen in practice? For example, are there external audits confirming that data is not accidentally leaked to another site along the way? Ideally these will be in-depth, security-focused audits by specialized auditors like <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/technical-assurance/">NCC Group</a> or <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/services/software-assurance/">Trail of Bits</a>, instead of audits that merely certify adherence to standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> <span>Who will be aware that you’re attempting to verify your age, and will they know which platform you’re trying to verify for?</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>We attempt to provide answers to these questions below. To begin, there are two major factors to consider when answering these questions: the tools each platform uses, and the overall system those tools are part of.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, most platforms offer </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-guide-terminology"><b>age estimation</b></a><b> options like </b><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/face-scans-estimate-our-age-creepy-af-and-harmful"><b>face scans</b></a><span> as a first line of age assurance. These vary in intrusiveness, but their main problem is inaccuracy, particularly for marginalized users. Third-party age verification vendors </span><a href="https://docs.privateid.com/age"><span>Private ID</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.k-id.com/facial-age-estimation"><span>k-ID</span></a><span> offer on-device facial age estimation, but another common vendor, </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/facial-age-estimation-faq-frequently-asked-questions/"><span>Yoti</span></a><span>, sends the image to their servers during age checks by some of the biggest platforms. This risks leaking the images themselves, and also the fact that you’re using that particular website, to the third party.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, there’s the </span><b>document-based verification services</b><span>, which require you to submit a hard identifier like a government-issued ID. This method thus requires you to prove both your age and your identity. A platform can do this in-house through a designated dataflow, or by sending that data to a third party. We’ve already seen examples of how this can fail. For example, Discord routed users' ID data through its general customer service workflow so that a third-party vendor could perform manual review of verification appeals. No one involved ever deleted users' data, so when the system was breached, Discord had to apologize for the catastrophic disclosure of </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/"><span>nearly 70,000 photos</span></a><span> of users' ID documents. Overly long retention periods expose documents to risk of breaches and historical data requests. Some document verifiers have retention periods that are needlessly long. This is the case with </span><a href="https://incode.com/privacy-policy/#data-security"><span>Incode</span></a><span>, which provides ID verification for Tiktok. Incode holds onto images forever by default, though TikTok should&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>automatically</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>start</span></a><span> the deletion process on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span>Some platforms offer alternatives, like proving that you own a </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-credit-card-for-age-verification"><span>credit card</span></a><span>, or asking for your </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-credit-card-for-age-verification%2Cuse-an-email-address-for-age-verification"><span>email</span></a><span> to check if it appears in databases associated with adulthood (like home mortgage databases). These tend to involve less risk when it comes to the sensitivity of the data itself, especially since credit cards can be replaced, but in general still undermine anonymity and pseudonymity and pose a risk of tracking your online activity. We’d prefer to see more assurances across the board about how information is handled.</span></p>
<p><span>Each site offers users a menu of age assurance options to choose from. We’ve chosen to present these options in the rough order that we expect most people to prefer. Jump directly to a platform to learn more about its age checks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Meta"><span>Meta – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Threads</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#Google"><span>Google – Gmail, YouTube</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#TikTok"><span>TikTok</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#Everywhere-Else"><span>Everywhere Else</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span><a id="Meta"></a>Meta – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Threads</span></h2>
<h3><span>Inferred Age</span></h3>
<p><b>If Meta can guess your age, you may never even see an age verification screen.</b><span> Meta, which runs Facebook, Threads, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, first tries to use information you’ve posted to guess your age, like </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/age-verification/"><span>looking</span></a><span> at “Happy birthday!” messages. It’s a creepy reminder that they already have quite a lot of information about you.</span></p>
<p><span>If Meta cannot guess your age, or if Meta infers you're too young, it will next ask you to </span><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/3679110085670782"><span>verify your age</span></a><span> using either facial age estimation, or by uploading your photo ID.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Face Scan</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to use facial age estimation, you’ll be </b><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/3679110085670782"><b>sent</b></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1386337538619854"><b>to</b></a> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/292521846402382/?helpref=search&amp;query=verification&amp;search_session_id=eb136014aeff03e55d346abf03249d73&amp;sr=14"><b>Yoti</b></a><b>, a third-party verification service.</b><span> Your photo will be uploaded to their servers during this process. Yoti </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/effective-facial-age-estimation-a-privacy-preserving-approach-to-age-assurance/"><span>claims</span></a><span> that “as soon as an age has been estimated, the facial image is immediately and permanently deleted.” Though it’s not as good as not having that data in the first place, Yoti’s </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/security/"><span>security measures include</span></a><span> a bug bounty program and annual penetration testing. Researchers from Mint Secure found that Yoti’s app and website are </span><a href="https://mint-secure.de/dataprotection-it-security-risks-with-ageverificationapp-yoti/"><span>filled with trackers</span></a><span>, so the fact that you’re verifying your age could be not only shared to Yoti, but leaked to third-party data brokers as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may not want to use this option if you’re worried about third parties potentially being able to know you’re trying to verify your age with Meta. You also might not want to use this if you’re worried about a current picture of your face accidentally leaking—for example, if elements in the background of your selfie might reveal your current location. On the other hand, if you consider a selfie to be less sensitive than a photograph of your ID, this option might be better. If you do choose (or are forced to) use the face check system, be sure to snap your selfie without anything you'd be concerned with identifying your location or embarrassing you in the background in case the image leaks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Upload ID</span></h3>
<p><b>If Yoti’s age estimation decides your face looks too young, or if you opt out of facial age estimation, your next recourse is to </b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/671565971895323/"><b>send Meta a photo of your ID</b></a><b>.</b><span> Meta </span><a href="https://help.instagram.com/966909308115586/"><span>sends</span></a><span> that photo to Yoti to verify the ID. Meta says it will </span><a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/1266914157405903/"><span>hold onto that ID image</span></a><span> for 30 days, then delete it. Meanwhile, Yoti claims it will delete the image </span><a href="https://developers.yoti.com/age-verification/identity-verification"><span>immediately after verification</span></a><span>. Of course, bugs and process oversights exist, such as accidentally replicating information in logs or support queues, but at least they have stated processes. Your ID contains sensitive information such as your full legal name and home address. Using this option not only runs the (hopefully small, but never nonexistent) risk of that data getting leaked through errors or hacking, but it also lets Meta see the information needed to tie your profile to your identity—which you may not want. If you don’t want Meta to know your name and where you live, or rely on both Meta and Yoti to keep to their deletion promises, this option may not be right for you.</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="Google"></a>Google – Gmail, YouTube&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><span>Inferred Age</span></h3>
<p><b>If Google can guess your age, you may never even see an age verification screen.</b><span> Your Google account is typically connected to your YouTube account, so if (like mine) your YouTube account is old enough to vote, you may not need to verify your Google account at all. Google first uses </span><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/extending-our-built-in-protections-to-more-teens-on-youtube/"><span>information it already knows</span></a><span> to try to guess your age, like how long you’ve had the account and your YouTube viewing habits. It’s yet another creepy reminder of how much information these corporations have on you, but at least in this case they aren’t likely to ask for even more identifying data.</span></p>
<p><b>If Google cannot guess your age, or decides you're too young, Google will next ask you to verify your age.</b><span> You’ll be given a variety of options for how to do so, with availability that will depend on your location and your age.</span></p>
<p><span>Google’s methods to assure your age include ID verification, facial age estimation, verification by proxy, and digital ID. To prove you’re over 18, you may be able to use facial age estimation, give Google your credit card information, or tell a third-party provider your email address.</span></p>
<h3><span>Face Scan</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to </b><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-selfie-for-age-verification"><b>use facial age estimation</b></a><b>, you’ll be sent to a website run by Private ID, a third-party verification service.</b><span> The website will load </span><a href="https://docs.privateid.com/age"><span>Private ID’s verifier</span></a><span> within the page—this means that your selfie will be checked without any images leaving your device. If the system decides you’re over 18, it will let Google know that, and only that. Of course, no technology is perfect—should Private ID be mandated to target you specifically, there’s nothing to stop it from sending down code that does in fact upload your image, and you probably won’t notice. But unless your threat model includes being specifically targeted by a state actor or Private ID, that’s unlikely to be something you need to worry about. For most people, no one else will see your image during this process. Private ID will, however, be told that your device is trying to verify your age with Google and Google will still find out if Private ID thinks that you’re under 18.</span></p>
<p><span>If Private ID’s age estimation decides your face looks too young, you may next be able to decide if you’d rather let Google </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085"><span>verify your age</span></a><span> by giving it your credit card information, photo ID, or digital ID, or by letting Google send your email address to a third-party verifier.</span></p>
<h3><span>Email Usage</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to </b><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-an-email-address-for-age-verification"><b>provide your email address</b></a><b>, Google sends it on to a company called VerifyMy.</b><span> VerifyMy will use your email address to see if you’ve done things like get a mortgage or paid for utilities using that email address. If you use Gmail as your email provider, this may be a privacy-protective option with respect to Google, as Google will then already know the email address associated with the account. But it does tell VerifyMy and its third-party partners that the person behind this email address is looking to verify their age, which you may not want them to know. VerifyMy uses “</span><a href="https://verifymy.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Verifymy-White-Paper-Innovative-age-assurance-Email-address-as-the-new-benchmark-for-frictionless-age-estimation.pdf"><span>proprietary algorithms and external data sources</span></a><span>” that involve sending your email address to “</span><a href="https://verifymy.io/age-verification-and-estimation/google-age-assurance-privacy-policy/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5"><span>trusted third parties, such as data aggregators</span></a><span>.” It claims to “ensure that such third parties are contractually bound to meet these requirements,” but you’ll have to trust it on that one—we haven’t seen any mention of who those parties are, so you’ll have no way to check up on their practices and security. On the bright side, VerifyMy and its partners do claim to delete your information as soon as the check is completed.</span></p>
<h3><span>Credit Card Verification</span></h3>
<p><b>If you choose to let Google </b><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-credit-card-for-age-verification"><b>use your credit card information</b></a><b>, you’ll be asked to set up a Google Payments account. </b><span>Note that debit cards won’t be accepted, since it’s much easier for many debit cards to be issued to people under 18.</span> <span>Google will then charge a small amount to the card, and refund it once it goes through. If you choose this method, you’ll have to tell Google your credit card info, but the fact that it’s done through Google Payments (their regular card-processing system) means that at least your credit card information won’t be sitting around in some unsecured system. Even if your credit card information happens to accidentally be leaked, this is a relatively low-risk option, since credit cards come with solid fraud protection. If your credit card info gets leaked, you should easily be able to dispute fraudulent charges and replace the card.</span></p>
<h3><span>Digital ID</span></h3>
<p><b>If the option is available to you, you may be able to use your digital ID to verify your age with Google.</b><span> In </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cuse-a-digital-id-for-age-verification"><span>some regions</span></a><span>, you’ll be given the option to use your digital ID. In some cases, it’s possible to only reveal your age information when you use a digital ID. If you’re given that choice, it can be a good privacy-preserving option. Depending on the implementation, there’s a chance that the verification step will “</span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/digital-identity-leaders-and-privacy-experts-sound-the-alarm-on-invasive-id-systems"><span>phone home</span></a><span>” to the ID provider (usually a government) to let them know the service asked for your age. It’s a complicated and varied topic that you can learn more about by visiting </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-identity"><span>EFF’s page on digital identity</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Upload ID</span></h3>
<p><b>Should none of these options work for you, your final recourse is to send Google a photo of your ID.</b><span> Here, you’ll be asked to take a photo of an acceptable ID and send it to Google. Though </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cfind-valid-types-of-id-for-age-verification"><span>the help page only states</span></a><span> that your ID “will be stored securely,” the verification process page says ID “will be deleted after your date of birth is successfully verified.” Acceptable IDs </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10071085#zippy=%2Cfind-valid-types-of-id-for-age-verification%2Cget-country-specific-guidance"><span>vary by country</span></a><span>, but are generally government-issued photo IDs. We like that it’s deleted immediately, though we have questions about what Google means when it says your ID will be used to “improve [its] verification services for Google products and protect against fraud and abuse.” No system is perfect, and we can only hope that Google schedules outside audits regularly.</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="TikTok"></a>TikTok</span></h2>
<h3><span>Inferred Age</span></h3>
<p><b>If TikTok can guess your age, you may never even see an age verification notification.</b><span> TikTok first tries to use information you’ve posted to estimate your age, looking through your videos and photos to analyze your face and listen to your voice. By uploading any videos, </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/how-we-process-face-and-voice-information"><span>TikTok believes you’ve given it consent</span></a><span> to try to guess how old you look and sound.</span></p>
<p><b>If TikTok decides you’re too young, appeal to revoke their age decision before the deadline passes.</b><span> If TikTok cannot guess your age, or decides you're too young, it will automatically revoke your access based on age—including either restricting features or deleting your account. To get your access and account back, you’ll have a </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><span>limited</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#1"><span>amount of time</span></a><span> to verify your age. As soon as you see the notification that your account is restricted, you’ll want to act fast because in some places you’ll have as little as 23 days before the deadline passes.</span></p>
<p><span>When you get that notification, you’re given </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><span>various</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><span>options</span></a><span> to verify your age based on your location.</span></p>
<h3><span>Face Scan</span></h3>
<p><b>If you’re given the option to use facial age estimation, you’ll be </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/personalized-ads-and-data/how-we-process-face-and-voice-information"><b>sent to Yoti</b></a><b>, a third-party verification service.</b><span> Your photo will be uploaded to their servers during this process. Yoti </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/effective-facial-age-estimation-a-privacy-preserving-approach-to-age-assurance/"><span>claims</span></a><span> that “as soon as an age has been estimated, the facial image is immediately and permanently deleted.” Though it’s not as good as not having that data in the first place, Yoti’s </span><a href="https://www.yoti.com/security/"><span>security measures include</span></a><span> a bug bounty program and annual penetration testing. However, researchers from Mint Secure found that Yoti’s app and website are </span><a href="https://mint-secure.de/dataprotection-it-security-risks-with-ageverificationapp-yoti/"><span>filled with trackers</span></a><span>, so the fact that you’re verifying your age <em>could</em> be leaked not only to Yoti, but to third-party data brokers as well.</span></p>
<p><span>You may not want to use this option if you’re worried about third parties potentially being able to know you’re trying to verify your age with TikTok. You also might not want to use this if you’re worried about a current picture of your face accidentally leaking—for example, if elements in the background of your selfie might reveal your current location.

If you do choose (or are forced to) use the face check system, be sure to snap your selfie without anything you'd be concerned with identifying your location or embarrassing you in the background in case the image leaks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Credit Card Verification</span></h3>
<p><b>If you have a credit card in your name, TikTok will </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><b>accept</b></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><b>that</b></a><b> as proof that you’re over 18.</b><span> Note that debit cards won’t be accepted, since it’s much easier for many debit cards to be issued to people under 18. TikTok will charge a small amount to the credit card, and refund it once it goes through. It’s unclear if this goes through their regular payment process, or if your credit card information will be sent through and stored in a separate, less secure system. Luckily, these days credit cards come with solid fraud protection, so if your credit card gets leaked, you should easily be able to dispute fraudulent charges and replace the card. That said, we’d rather TikTok provide assurances that the information will be processed securely.</span></p>
<h3><span>Credit Card Verification of a Parent or Guardian</span></h3>
<p><b>Sometimes, if you’re between 13 and 17, you’ll be </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><b>given</b></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><b>the option</b></a><b> to let your parent or guardian confirm your age.</b><span> You’ll tell TikTok their email address, and TikTok will send your parent or guardian an email asking them (a) to confirm your date of birth, and (b) to verify their own age by proving that they own a valid credit card. This option doesn’t always seem to be offered, and in the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTok/comments/1fapmrg/i_got_banned_for_being_underage_which_im_not_im/"><span>one case</span></a><span> we could find, it’s possible that TikTok never followed up with the parent. So it’s unclear how or if TikTok verifies that the adult whose email you provide is your parent or guardian. If you want to use credit card verification but you’re not old enough to have a credit card, and you’re ok with letting an adult know you use TikTok, this option may be reasonable to try.</span></p>
<h3><span>Photo with a Random Adult?</span></h3>
<p><b>Bizarrely, if you’re between 13 and 17, TikTok </b><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok#3"><b>claims</b></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok#2"><b>to offer</b></a><b> the option to take a photo with literally any random adult to confirm your age.</b><span> Its help page says that any trusted adult over 25 can be chosen, as long as they’re holding a piece of paper with the code on it that TikTok provides. It also mentions that a third-party provider is used here, but doesn’t say which one. We haven’t found any evidence of this verification method being offered. Please do let us know if you’ve used this method to verify your age on TikTok!</span></p>
<h3><span>Photo ID and Face Comparison</span></h3>
<p><b>If you aren’t offered or have failed the other options, you’ll have to verify your age by submitting a copy of your ID and matching photo of your face.</b><span> You’ll be sent to Incode, a third-party verification service. In a disappointing failure to meet the industry standard, Incode itself </span><a href="https://incode.com/privacy-policy/#data-security"><span>doesn’t automatically delete</span></a><span> the data you give it once the process is complete, but TikTok does </span><a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/minimum-age-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>claim</span></a> <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/underage-appeals-on-tiktok"><span>to</span></a><span> “start the process to delete the information you submitted,” which should include </span><a href="https://developer.incode.com/reference/cleansingleonboardingsession"><span>telling Incode</span></a><span> to delete your data once the process is done. If you want to be sure, you can ask Incode to </span><a href="https://developer.incode.com/docs/incode-verify-identity-deletion-process#/"><span>delete that data yourself</span></a><span>. Incode tells TikTok that you met the age threshold without providing your exact date of birth, but then TikTok wants to know the exact date anyway, so it’ll ask for your date of birth even after your age has been verified.</span></p>
<p>TikTok itself might not see your actual ID depending on its implementation choices, but Incode will.&nbsp;<span>Your ID contains sensitive information such as your full legal name and home address. Using this option not only runs the (hopefully small, but never nonexistent) risk of that data getting accidentally leaked through errors or hacking. If you don’t want TikTok or Incode to know your name, what you look like, and where you live—or if you don't want to rely on both TikTok and Incode to keep to their deletion promises—then this option may not be right for you.</span></p>
<h2><a id="Everywhere-Else"></a><span>Everywhere Else</span></h2>
<p><span>We’ve covered the major providers here, but age verification is unfortunately being required of many other services that you might use as well. While the providers and processes may vary, the same general principles will apply. If you’re trying to choose what information to provide to continue to use a service, consider the “follow the data” questions mentioned above, and try to find out how the company will store and process the data you give it. The less sensitive information, the fewer people have access to it, and the more quickly it will be deleted, the better. You may even come to recognize popular names in the age verification industry:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.404media.co/spotify-uk-age-check-verification-yoti/"><span>Spotify</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/biometrics-id-verification/uk-digital-identity-firm-yoti-secures-20m-in-debt-funding"><span>OnlyFans</span></a><span> use Yoti (just like Meta and Tiktok), </span><a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/40879605713172-Age-Assurance-FAQs"><span>Quora</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202510/discord-partners-manual-age-verification-data-breach-includes-selfies"><span>Discord</span></a><span> use </span><a href="https://www.k-id.com/facial-age-estimation"><span>k-ID</span></a><span>, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it should be clear by now that <strong>none of the age verification options are perfect in terms of protecting information, providing access to everyone, and safely handling sensitive data</strong>. That’s just one of the reasons that EFF is against age-gating mandates, and is working to stop and overturn them across the United States and around the world.</span></p>

<p>The Tesla Cybertruck program is in shambles. The latest data indicate production is running at roughly 10% of its planned capacity. Meanwhile, the Ford F150 Lightning outsold the Tesla Cybertruck in 2025 and was then canceled for not selling enough. </p>



<p>Is this what is coming for the Cybertruck?</p>



<p>Tesla is actively trying to hide its Cybertruck sales performance. We have to do the math ourselves.</p>



<p>Unlike virtually every other automaker that reports sales by model and region, Tesla bundles its vehicles into two broad categories: “Model 3/Y” and “Other Models.”</p>	
	



<p>The “Other Models” category includes the Model S, Model X, Cybertruck, and the Tesla Semi.</p>



<p>Model S and Model X sales have been relatively stable at a low volume, typically hovering around 5,000 to 6,000 units combined per quarter globally. If we assume a generous 6,000 units for S and X in Q4 2025 (aided by a slight update), that leaves only roughly <strong>5,600 units</strong> for the Cybertruck and Semi combined.</p>



<p>Considering the Semi is still in pilot production with negligible volume, we are looking at roughly 5,500 for the entire quarter globally (though it is still mostly North American).</p>



<p>This is a disaster compared to the truck’s peak and the company’s stated capacity.</p>



<p>We previously reported in July that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/02/tesla-confirms-cybertruck-sales-are-down-to-just-5000-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla confirmed Cybertruck sales were down to ~5,000 units</a> in Q2 2025. It seems the “recovery” never happened, despite price cuts and the introduction of a short-lived, cheaper trim.</p>



<p>For the full year 2025, it could bring the total to about 21,500 Cybertrucks globally.</p>



<p>According to 2025 full-year data, the Ford F-150 Lightning delivered approximately 27,300 units in the US.</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. Ford officially announced it was <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/fords-f-150-lightning-sales-jumped-40-just-as-ford-announced-its-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending F-150 Lightning production in December</a> to pivot to its new EREV (extended-range electric vehicle) strategy. Yet, even as a “lame duck” product with widely publicised retirement plans, the Lightning still managed to find more buyers than Tesla’s Cybertruck.</p>



<p>While Ford’s sales dipped about 18% year-over-year as they wound down the program, Tesla’s numbers crashed by nearly 50% despite the company doing everything it can to keep the program alive.</p>



<p>Tesla and Elon Musk have thrown everything at the Cybertruck program, and it’s not working. They released a cheaper stripped-down version and <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled it months later because it wasn’t selling</a>.</p>



<p>Last quarter, Musk even had his private company SpaceX <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/18/elon-musks-spacex-bought-tens-of-millions-worth-of-cybertrucks-tesla-cant-sell/">buy over 1,000 Cybertrucks</a>, which is about 20% of Tesla’s quarterly Cybertruck sales, and sales were still down more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter.</p>



<p>What happens with the Cybertruck from here?</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>SpaceX can’t keep buying Cybertrucks, and I don’t know of any vehicle program that sells at 10% of its production capacity and survives.</p>



<p>It’s such a big hill to climb.</p>



<p>As I previously said, I think if Tesla were to distance itself from Musk’s toxic brand and do things such as give up on the 4680 cells, which appear to have contributed to the Cybertruck being more expensive and having a shorter range than originally announced, it could likely significantly boost Cybertruck sales.</p>




	<p>Enough to fill production capacity? Probably not, but it could get a lot closer.</p>



<p>Short of that, I don’t know where this can go. I think most other automakers would have written off the program already, but Musk can’t because of his ego. It would be admitting defeat.</p>



<p>It shows just how much he has changed in the last few years (beyond the obvious white-nationalist stuff), as Musk originally said <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/08/03/tesla-cybertruck-elon-musk-kick-most-ass/">Tesla would pivot to a more traditional design if the Cybertruck failed</a>. It has failed. Now what?</p>

<p>The indefinite pause, first reported by Fox News, is scheduled to take effect Jan. 21. It targets individuals deemed a potential "public charge", a legal standard used to determine if a non-citizen is likely to become primarily reliant on the state for subsistence.</p> 
<p>According to an internal State Department memo, consular officers have been directed to refuse visas under existing legal authorities while the agency conducts a comprehensive reassessment of its screening and vetting protocols.</p> 
<p><strong>Expanded Criteria for Refusal</strong></p> 
<p>The list of affected jurisdictions includes Somalia, Russia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria, Thailand, and Yemen.</p> 
<p>The directive follows a November 2025 cable from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that instructed global diplomatic posts to implement more rigorous screening. Under the updated guidance, officers are empowered to deny visas based on a "totality of circumstances," including:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Health and Age:</strong> Applicants who are elderly or have chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer face heightened scrutiny.</li> 
 <li><strong>Physical Condition:</strong> Consular staff may consider obesity a factor for denial if it is projected to lead to expensive, long-term medical costs.</li> 
 <li><strong>Financial and Personal Skills:</strong> Vetting now places greater emphasis on English language proficiency, education, and immediate financial resources.</li> 
 <li><strong>Benefit History:</strong> Any past reliance on government cash assistance or institutionalisation is treated as a significant "red flag."</li> 
</ul> 
<p>"The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people," State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</p> 
<p><strong>Context of the Crackdown</strong></p> 
<p>The suspension follows a series of aggressive immigration manoeuvres by the Trump administration in its first year back in office. Somalia has reportedly come under specific focus following a major taxpayer-funded benefit fraud scandal in Minnesota involving individuals of Somali descent.</p> 
<p>While the "public charge" provision has existed in the Immigration and Nationality Act for decades, its application has varied significantly between administrations. The 2022 Biden-era rules limited the scope of the test primarily to cash assistance and long-term care, excluding non-cash programs like SNAP (food stamps) or Medicaid. The new policy seeks to reverse that leniency, granting officers broad discretion to predict an applicant's future economic burden.</p> 
<p>The State Department noted that exceptions to the pause will be "very limited" and granted only to those who can demonstrably clear the public charge threshold.</p> 
<p><strong>List of Countries</strong></p> 
<p>The full list of countries comprises of Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, January 13</strong></p>



<p>A farm in Saxony has been left with 4,000 tons of potatoes in what Berliner Morgenpost is calling “a story about the absurdities of our food system”. </p>



<p>A trader ordered the harvest but after the potatoes were harvested and stored, it became clear that the supply on the market was greater than the demand. The market price had fallen and although everything was financially settled, the potatoes remained.</p>



<p>4,000 tons is almost four million kilograms or the weight of 800 adult elephants. Stacking as high as Berlin’s TV Tower, so many potatoes could feed hundreds of thousands of people.</p>



<p>The first truckful of these potatoes, which were stored in cool, dry halls on a farm south of Leipzig, are now on their way to Berlin to be distributed for free. While Ecosia is financing the transport from Saxony to Berlin, the Berliner Morgenpost is helping to organise the free distribution.</p>



<p>The collaborative initiative plans to save the 4,000 tons of potatoes from being wasted. Registration to collect some free potatoes is now closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, those who registered on time will receive an email stating whether their application was accepted or rejected. If it was accepted, they will received details about the date, approximate time and information about collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can still help the project. Berliner Morgenpost is looking for more places from which the potatoes can be distributed and accepting financial donations for further truckloads. You can find out more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4000-tonnen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.4000-tonnen.de</a>.<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/kommentar-stromausfall-berlin-krisenmanagement.html"></a></p>

   <p>LIBERTY COUNTY, Ga. — What brings Greg Reyes to this Walmart south of Savannah are the low prices. He and his wife keep a close eye on their limited budget; she's retired and he's disabled. Their grocery list is always the same. But the prices have been changing.</p>   <p>"I used to pay like $40 a year ago, and now we're paying like $60," Reyes says. In his bags today are some chicken, turkey and beef. Other things simply had to go. "We don't buy ice cream no more because it's expensive," Reyes says. "It's kind of sad, but we have to do it like that."</p>   
   <p>The cost of living in the U.S. rose 2.7% in December compared with a year before, according to Tuesday's federal data. That's a steady slowdown after a yearslong stretch of intense inflation, but still painful.<em> </em>The past year also brought a global trade war, as President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports. And the world continued to grapple with extreme weather, from droughts to downpours.</p>   <p>All of this is showing up in our shopping carts.</p>

   <p>Since 2018, NPR has <a href="https://www.npr.org/tags/755496161/npr-shopping-cart" target="_blank">tracked the prices</a> of dozens of items at this suburban Walmart superstore. Walmart is America's most popular retailer and the world's largest, which gives it the power to negotiate with suppliers for some of the lowest and most stable prices.</p>   <p>Here's what we learned on our latest price-check visit, in December. (Or skip the analysis<em> </em>to see the <a href="https://npr.org/nx-s1-5638908#responsive-embed-gkjRi">full details of NPR's shopping cart</a>.)</p>   <h3>Prices in NPR's basket rose 5% on average last year</h3>   <p>Almost half the items on NPR's shopping list got more expensive in 2025, including shrimp, Oreo cookies, Coca-Cola and Dove soap. Some price increases, notably on items made in China and Vietnam, appear to be tariff related. Other price hikes had to do with weather events affecting harvests of crops such as cacao and coffee beans.</p>

   <p>Just under a quarter of the items on NPR's list got cheaper, including eggs, milk and Cheerios. And many packaged foods stayed the same after years of price hikes.</p>   <p>As affordability became Americans' top concern, big brands began to worry about shoppers switching to store-label competitors or skipping some purchases altogether. To entice weary shoppers, NPR found, Walmart offered more discounts in December than it had in previous years.</p>   <p>A few disclaimers about our method:<br></p>   <ul><li>We went through almost every aisle in this Walmart to come up with the 114 items. (The full table is below.) To account for possible changes in package sizes, we focused on the price per unit, whether it was an ounce of salsa or a square foot of aluminum foil.<br></li><li>NPR reached out to the producers of all the items on our list that changed in price. Most companies did not respond. The few that did — including Kikkoman and Campbell's — noted that Walmart, as the retailer, has ultimate control over the prices that shoppers see on shelves.<br></li><li>A Walmart spokesperson said in a statement: "We remain dedicated to providing our customers Every Day low prices, with the goal of having the lowest price on a basket of goods over time." A store, for example, might extract deals from suppliers or charge slightly more for several items in order to sell something else at a break-even price or even below cost.</li></ul>   <h3>Tariffs loom over store shelves</h3>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-illustrations-20260107/tariffs.html" id="responsive-embed-walmart-illustrations-20260107-tariffs"> Loading... </p>

   <p>With tariffs being the biggest story in retail in 2025, signs of their impact inevitably showed up in Walmart's aisles. Though it's hard to pin any price increase on tariffs with certainty, the through line was noticeable.</p>   <p>Some of the biggest price jumps were on items imported from countries saddled with hefty tariffs: Walmart's store-brand paper folders made in China (up 46%), swai fish fillets from Vietnam (up 34%), Farberware's plastic measuring spoons made in China (up 19%) and Schwinn's infant bike helmet, which used to be made in China but is now made in Vietnam (up 18%).</p>   <p>Walmart, Farberware and Schwinn did not comment on the impact of tariffs to NPR, but several other companies did. Dole, whose canned pineapple from Southeast Asia got 25% more expensive, cited weather-related crop shortages and tariffs on goods imported from the region.</p>

   <p>Reynolds Wrap, whose aluminum foil rose in price by 13%, called out "historic and sustained cost increases over the past year, driven by tariffs, global supply pressures, rising energy costs, and limited availability." Much of U.S. aluminum comes from Canada, and these imports now face a 50% tax.</p>   <p>Walmart in May warned that new tariffs would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5399154/walmart-higher-prices-tariffs" target="_blank">lead to higher prices</a>, as Trump threatened 145% tariffs on goods from China. The White House later paused, changed up and even rolled back some of its trade plans, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/g-s1-97936/trump-tariffs-executive-order-beef-coffee-fruit" target="_blank">namely on food items</a>. By August, Walmart officials said <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5509592/walmart-tariff-costs-rising-earnings" target="_blank">tariff costs were rising "each week,"</a> although the company was able to mitigate many of them. In November, incoming Walmart CEO John Furner said tariffs brought "less impact" than expected early in the year.</p>   
   <h3>Climate chaos roiled many industries</h3>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-illustrations-20260107/climate.html" id="responsive-embed-walmart-illustrations-20260107-climate"> Loading... </p>

   <p>Some of the items with the worst price hikes are repeat offenders: coffee, beef and chocolate. They, too, were affected by tariffs — such as beef and coffee <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/21/nx-s1-5470131/us-coffee-prices-brazil-trump-tariffs" target="_blank">coming from Brazil</a> — but the main culprit was the weather.</p>   <p>At this Walmart, the price of Maxwell House ground Colombian coffee rose by 46% in 2025 and its breakfast K-Cups by 34%. The costs of Hershey's and Lindt chocolates jumped around 26%. A pound of ground beef went up 30%, and the store now prominently displays a cheaper option: a blend of beef and ground pork.</p>   <p>The cost of coffee beans has soared as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5553625/coffee-day-farmers-industry-climate-change-labor-stenophylla" target="_blank">climate change</a> has brought erratic rainfall patterns, floods and droughts to farmlands. Cacao harvests, too, have come up short for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/29/1240947073/cocoa-price-chocolate-kitkat-hershey" target="_blank">three years straight</a>; West African farmers, who grow most of the world's supply, have dealt with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/1256575139/hershey-chocolate-prices-cocoa-shortage-climate-change" target="_blank">extreme weather</a>, changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. And the U.S. beef supply is at its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5534424/beef-prices-record-high-cost" target="_blank">lowest in decades</a>, driving cattle prices to <a href="https://esmis.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/release-files/g445cd121/kw52m9471/x346g4492/LDP-M-375.pdf" target="_blank">record highs</a>, in part because of drought.</p>   <p>Kraft Heinz (which owns Maxwell House), Hershey and Lindt &amp; Sprüngli in statements all cited the unprecedented higher costs of key raw materials, adding that they've also absorbed or offset part of those costs.</p>   <h3>Shrinkflation continues in the laundry aisle</h3>   <p>When inflation peaked after the COVID-19 pandemic, some manufacturers stealthily raised prices by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1198910739/consider-this-shrinkflation-is-real" target="_blank">shrinking their products</a> — shampoo, paper towels, chips and candy — while charging the same or slightly more. In 2022, for example, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/26/1147894382/walmart-price-inflation-supply-chain-economy" target="_blank">NPR's Walmart visit found</a> that Dove soap bars had shrunk by a quarter of an ounce, while rising in price by a few cents. (Dove maker Unilever did not comment.)</p>   <p>Last month, NPR spotted one case of shrinkflation: Tide laundry detergent. But the company says it's actually efficiency.</p>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-tide-shrinkflation-20260108/" id="responsive-embed-walmart-tide-shrinkflation-20260108"> Loading... </p>

   <p>NPR first spotted Tide selling <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/26/1147894382/walmart-price-inflation-supply-chain-economy" target="_blank">less laundry detergent per bottle</a> in 2022: The amount of liquid had shrunk to 92 ounces from 100 ounces before the pandemic, and the price had risen by a dollar. After that, the cost stayed the same, but the contents shrank to 84 ounces in 2024 and then to 80 ounces in December.</p>   <p>The label continuously promised enough detergent for 64 loads of laundry.</p>   <p>Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Tide as well as Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo (whose price rose almost 18%), told NPR that both products saw "meaningful upgrades" in the past year. Tide specifically got the "most significant upgrade to its liquid formula in over 20 years," according to the company, with a "boosted" level of active cleaning ingredients and updated dosage instructions.</p>   <p>"The result is superior cleaning performance in a smaller dose," a Procter &amp; Gamble representative said.</p>   <h3>Good news! Some things are cheaper</h3>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/walmart-illustrations-20260107/cheaper.html" id="responsive-embed-walmart-illustrations-20260107-cheaper"> Loading... </p>

   <p>The biggest price drop finally came for eggs after record highs earlier in the year due to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration" target="_blank">persistent bird flu</a>. By December, the price of a dozen eggs at Walmart dropped 30%. The cost of butter also dipped, by almost 16%, thanks to a glut in dairy production.</p>   <p>And as inflation-weary shoppers tighten their belts, brands have started doing something they rarely do: lowering prices. PepsiCo (maker of Lay's, Cheetos and Tostitos) last month said it would <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/beverages/pepsico-to-eliminate-nearly-20-of-products-reduce-prices" target="_blank">cut prices to boost sales</a>. General Mills (maker of Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Annie's) also confirmed it <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823717-general-mills-inc-gis-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank">plans to discount</a> roughly two-thirds of its offerings. NPR's price check found Cheerios costing 19% less than a year ago.</p>   <p>A Walmart spokesperson also told NPR that the chain has added more discounts (or "rollbacks," in Walmart parlance) than it had in the past two years. The company cited 13,000 of them in the first three quarters of 2025, of which about 2,000 became permanent price cuts.</p>   <p data-pym-loader="" data-child-src="https://apps.npr.org/datawrapper/gkjRi/11/" id="responsive-embed-gkjRi">Loading...</p>

<p>It is crazy, absolutely crazy to depend on open source to be free (as beer). It is not okay - it is not okay to consider that this labor fell from the sky and is a gift, and that the people/person behind are just doing it for their own enjoyments.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine that what we’re doing today is the only way. Begging/busking for donations, hoping to get noticed. Hoping for a <a href="https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902">lifeline</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, a solution. Or an idea, really. Incredibly half-baked. Poke all the holes you want. It’s very unwrought and <em>muy</em> unripe.</p>

<p>GitHub should charge every org $1 more per user per month and direct it into an Open Source fund, held in escrow.</p>

<p>Those funds would then be distributed by usage - every mention in a package.json or requirements.txt gets you a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>You know how the money you pay to Spotify is very very very approximately (and not really fairly) distributed among artists that you listened to? Yes, Spotify is a very flawed model and artists are not doing well. But it is <em>a</em> model??</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the idea. Call it the “Open Source Fund” thing, <strong>make it opt-out</strong>. Give every org a magical badge - or the ability to set their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hxdhb0BE2U">profile’s background css</a>.</p>

<p>Or don’t! Let’s not do anything! People’s code and efforts - fueling incredibly critical bits of infrastructure all around the world - should just be up for grabs. Haha! Suckers!</p>

<p>Alright, I don’t <em>know</em> how you fund Linux (does Linux appear in a requirements file). Hmm. Maybe <code>FROM</code> commands from Dockerfiles are also read &amp; applied. Maybe we at least start somewhere?</p>

<p>Anyway, you all smarter than me people can figure it out. I just cannot accept that what we have is “GOOD”. xx</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The FBI raided the home of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post" data-link-name="in body link">Washington Post</a> reporter early Wednesday in what the newspaper called a “highly unusual and aggressive” move by law enforcement, and press freedom groups condemned as a “tremendous intrusion” by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link">Trump administration</a>.</p><p>Agents descended on the Virginia home of Hannah Natanson as part of an investigation into a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified government materials. The Post is “reviewing and monitoring the situation”, a source at the newspaper said.</p><p>“It’s a clear and appalling sign that this administration will set no limits on its acts of aggression against an independent press,” Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, told the Guardian.</p><p>Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2011456849711612019" data-link-name="in body link">a post on X</a> that the raid was conducted by the justice department and FBI at the request of the “department of war”, the Trump administration’s informal name for the department of defense.</p><p>The warrant, she said, was executed “at the home of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Washington Post</a> journalist who was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor. The leaker is currently behind bars.”</p><p>The statement gave no further details of the raid or investigation. Bondi added: “The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Trump administration</a> will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”</p><p>The reporter’s home and devices were searched, and her Garmin watch and phone seized, the newspaper said. A warrant obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/washington-post-reporter-search/" data-link-name="in body link">the Post</a> cited an investigation into Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with a top secret security clearance who has been accused of accessing and taking home classified intelligence reports.</p><p>Natanson, the Post said, covers the federal workforce and has been a part of the newspaper’s “most high-profile and sensitive coverage” during the first year of the second Trump administration.</p><p>As the paper noted in its report, it is “highly unusual and aggressive for law enforcement to conduct a search on a reporter’s home”.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/24/trump-federal-government-workers/" data-link-name="in body link">first-person account</a> published last month, Natanson described herself as the Post’s “federal government whisperer”, and said she would receive calls day and night from “federal workers who wanted to tell me how President Donald Trump was rewriting their workplace policies, firing their colleagues or transforming their agency’s missions”.</p><p>“It’s been brutal,” the article’s headline said.</p><p>Natanson said her work had led to 1,169 new sources, “all current or former federal employees who decided to trust me with their stories”. She said she learned information “people inside government agencies weren’t supposed to tell me”, saying that the intensity of the work nearly “broke” her.</p><p>The federal investigation into Perez-Lugones, the Post said, involved documents found in his lunchbox and his basement, according to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">FBI</a> affidavit.</p><p>In a statement, Bruce D Brown, president of the Reporters’ Committee for Freedom of the Press, condemned the raid.</p><p>“Physical searches of reporters’ devices, homes and belongings are some of the most invasive investigative steps law enforcement can take,” he said.</p><p>“There are specific federal laws and policies at the Department of Justice that are meant to limit searches to the most extreme cases because they endanger confidential sources far beyond just one investigation and impair public interest reporting in general.</p><p>“While we won’t know the government’s arguments about overcoming these very steep hurdles until the affidavit is made public, this is a tremendous escalation in the administration’s intrusions into the independence of the press.”</p><p>Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, demanded a public explanation from the justice department “why it believes this search was necessary and legally permissible”.</p><p>In a statement, Jaffer said: “Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy.</p><p>“Attorney General Bondi has weakened guidelines that were intended to protect the freedom of the press, but there are still important legal limits, including constitutional ones, on the government’s authority to use subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists.</p><p>“Searches of newsrooms and journalists are hallmarks of illiberal regimes, and we must ensure that these practices are not normalized here.”<br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>When I <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/02/03/presenting-nukemap/">created the NUKEMAP in 2012</a>, the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/">Google Maps API</a> was&nbsp;<em>amazing</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_6768" id="identifier_1_6768" title="For non-coders: an API is a code library that lets third-party developers use someone else’s services. So the Google Maps API lets you develop applications that use Google Maps: you can say, “load Google Maps into this part of the web page, add an icon to it, make the icon draggable, and when someone clicks a button over here, draw circles around that icon that go out to a given radius, and color the circles this way and that way.” That’s the basics of NUKEMAP’s functionality, more or less.">1</a></sup> It was the best thing in town for creating Javascript mapping mash-ups, cost <em>literally nothing</em>, had an active developer community that added new features on a regular basis, and actually seemed like it was interested in people using their product to develop cool, useful tools.</p>
<div id="attachment_6853"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6853" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1" alt="At left, the original NUKEMAP from 2005; at right, the Google Maps NUKEMAP from 2012." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?resize=1024%2C411&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?resize=600%2C241&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?resize=768%2C308&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?resize=1536%2C616&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Old-NUKEMAP.jpg?w=1854&amp;ssl=1 1854w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6853">NUKEMAPs of days gone by: On the left is the original NUKEMAP I made way back in March 2005, which used MapQuest screenshots (and was extremely limited, and never made public) and was done entirely in PHP. I made it for my own personal use and for teaching. At right, the remade original <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/02/03/presenting-nukemap/">NUKEMAP from 2012</a>, which used the Google Maps API/Javascript.</p></div>
<p>Today, pretty much all of that is now untrue.&nbsp;The API codebase has stagnated in terms of&nbsp;<em>actually useful features</em> being added (many neat features have been removed or quietly deprecated; the new features being added are generally incremental and lame), which is really quite remarkable given that the Google Maps stand-alone website (the one you visit when you go to Google Maps to look up a map or location) has had a <em>lot</em> of neat features added to it (like its 3-D mode) that have&nbsp;<em>not</em> been ported to the API code (which is why <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap3d/">NUKEMAP3D is effectively dead</a> — Google deprecated the Google Earth Plugin and has never replaced it, and no other code base has filled the gap).<sup><a href="#footnote_2_6768" id="identifier_2_6768" title="Before people e-mail me about how CesiumJS fills the Google Earth Plugin gap — it doesn’t, because it doesn’t give you the global coverage of 3D buildings that you need to make sense of the size of a mushroom cloud. If they change that someday, I’ll take the time to port the code, but I don’t see many signs that this is going to happen, because global 3D building shapes are still something that only Google seems to own. If you do want to render volumetric mushroom clouds in the stand-alone Google Earth program, there is a (still experimental and incomplete) feature in NUKEMAP for exporting cloud shapes as KMZ files. See the NUKEMAP3D page for more information on how to use this.">2</a></sup></p>
<p>But more importantly, the&nbsp;changes to the pricing model that have been recently put in place are, to put it lightly,&nbsp;<em>insane,&nbsp;</em>and <em>punishing</em> if you are an educational web developer that builds anything that people actually find useful.</p>
<p>NUKEMAP gets around 15,000 hits a day on a slow day, and around 200,000 hits a day per month, and has done this consistently for over 5 years (and it occasionally has spikes of several hundred thousand page views per day, when it goes viral for whatever reason). While that’s pretty impressive for an academic’s website, it’s what I would call “moderately popular” by Internet terms. I don’t think this puts the slightest strain on Google’s servers (who also run, like, <em>all of YouTube</em>). And from 2012 through 2016, Google didn’t charge a thing for this. Which was pretty generous, and perhaps unsustainable. But it encouraged a lot of experimentation, and something like NUKEMAP wouldn’t exist without that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, they started charging. It wasn’t too bad — at most, my bill was around $200 a month. Even that is pretty hard to do out-of-pocket, but I’ve had the good fortune to be associated with an institution (my employers, the College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology) that was willing to foot the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in 2018, Google changes its pricing model, and my bill jumped to more like $1,800 p<em>er month</em>. As in, over $20,000 a year. Which is several times my main hosting fees (for&nbsp;<em>all</em> of my websites).</p>
<p>I reached out to Google to find out why this was. Their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/">new pricing sheet</a> is… a little hard to make sense of. Which is sort of why I didn’t see this coming. They do have a “<a href="https://mapsplatformtransition.withgoogle.com/calculator">pricing calculator</a>,” though, that lets you see exactly how terrible the pricing scheme is, though it is a little tricky to find and requires having a Google account to access. But if you start playing with the “dynamic map loads” button (there are other charges, but that’s the big one) you can see how expensive it gets, quickly. I contacted Google for help in figuring all this out, and they fobbed me off onto a non-Google “valued partner” who was licensed to deal with corporations on volume pricing. Hard pass, sorry.</p>

<p>I know that Google in theory supports people using their products for “social causes,” and if one is at a non-profit (as I am), <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/google-earth-and-maps.html">you can apply for a “grant”</a> to defray the costs, assuming Google assume’s you’re doing good. I don’t know how they feel about the NUKEMAP, but in any case, it doesn’t matter: people at educational institutions (even not-for-profit ones, like mine) are <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/eligibility/"><em>disqualified</em></a> from applying. Why? Because Google wants to capture the educational market in a revenue-generating way, and so directs you to their <a href="https://edu.google.com/">Google for Education</a> site, which as you will quickly find is based on a very different sort of model. There’s no e-mail contact on the site, as an aside: you have to claim you are representing an entire educational institution (I am not) and that you are interested in implementing Google’s products on your campus (I am not), and if you do all this (as I did, just to get through to them) you can finally talk to them a bit.</p>
<p>There is <em>literally nothing</em> on the website that suggests there is any way to get Google Maps API credit, but they do have a way to request discounted access to the Google Cloud Platform, which appears to be some kind of machine-learning platform, and after sending an e-mail they did say that you could apply for Google Cloud Platform funds to be used for Google Maps API.</p>
<p>By which point I had already, in my heart, given up on Google. It’s just not worth it. Let me outline the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They clearly don’t care about small developers. That much is pretty obvious if you’ve tried to develop with their products. Look, I get that licensing to big corporations is the money-maker. But Google pretends to be developing for more than just them… they just don’t follow through on those hopes.</li>
<li>They can’t distinguish between universities as entities, and academics as university researchers. There’s a big difference there, in terms of scale, goals, and resources. I don’t make university IT policy, I do research.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They are fickle. It’s not just the fact that they change their pricing schemes rapidly, it’s not just that they deprecate products willy-nilly. It’s that they push out new products, encourage communities to use them to make “amazing” things, and then don’t support them well over the long term. They let cool projects atrophy and die. Sometimes they sell them off to other companies (e.g., SketchUp), who then totally change them and the business model. Again, I get it: Google’s approach is throwing things at the wall, hoping they stick, and believes in disruption more than infrastructure, etc. etc. etc. But that makes it pretty hard to justify putting all of your eggs in their basket.</li>
<li>I don’t want to worry about whether Google will think my work is a “social good,” I don’t want to worry about re-applying every year, I don’t want to worry about the branch of Google that helps me out might vanish tomorrow, and so on. Too much uncertainty. Do you know how hard it is to get in contact with a real human being at Google? I’m not saying they’re impossible — they did help me waive some of the fees that came from me not understanding the pricing policy — but that took literally&nbsp;<em>months&nbsp;</em>to work out, and in the meantime they sent a collection agency after me.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>But most of all: today there are <em>perfectly viable alternatives</em>. Which is why I don’t understand their pricing model change, except in terms of, “they’ve decided to abandon small developers completely.” After a little scouting around, I decided that <strong><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a></strong> completely fit the bill (and whose rates are more like what Google used to charge), and that <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, an open-source Javascript library, could make for a very easy conversion. It took a little work to make the conversion, because Leaflet out of the box doesn’t support the drawing of great circles, but I <a href="https://github.com/nuclearsecrecy/Leaflet.greatCircle">wrote a plugin</a> that does it.</p>
<div id="attachment_6859"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6859" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of NUKEMAP 2.65" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?resize=600%2C377&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nukemap.2.65.jpg?resize=768%2C483&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6859"><a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/">NUKEMAP</a> as of this moment (version 2.65; I make small incremental changes regularly), with its Mapbox GL + Leaflet codebase. Note that a while back I started showing the 1 psi blast radius as well, because I decided that omitting it caused people to underestimate the area that would be plausibly affected by a nuclear detonation.</p></div>
<p>Now, even MapBox’s pricing scheme can add up for my level of map loads, but they’ve been extremely generous in terms of giving me “credits” because they support this kind of work. And getting that worked out was a matter of sending an e-mail and then talking to a real person on the phone. And said real person has been extremely helpful, easy to contact, and even reaches out to me at times when they’re rolling out a new code feature (like Mapbox GL) that he thinks will make the site work better and cheaper. Which is to say: in every way, the opposite of Google.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So NUKEMAP and <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/missilemap/">MISSILEMAP</a> have been converted entirely over to MapBox+Leaflet. The one function that wasn’t easy to port over was the “Humanitarian consequences” (which relies on Google’s Places library), but I’ll eventually figure out a way to integrate that into it.</p>
<p>More broadly, the question I have to ask as an educator is: would I encourage a student to develop in the Google Maps API if they were thinking about trying to make a “break-out” website? Easy answer: no way. With Google, becoming popular (even just “moderately popular”) is a losing proposition: you will find yourself owing them a lot of money. So I won’t be teaching Google Maps in my data visualization course anymore — we’ll be using Leaflet from now on.&nbsp;I apologize for venting, but I figured that even non-developers might be interested in knowing on how these things work “under the hood” and what kinds of considerations go into the choice of making a website these days.</p>

At top, me standing out my office (for an entire 24 hours) in the wake of a 20 kt detonation in downtown NYC using the weather conditions that exist as I am posting this: I am very very dead. At bottom, I instead run quickly into the basement bowling alley in the Stevens University Howe Center (my preferred shelter location, because it’s fairly deep inside a multi-story rocky hill, on top of which is a 13 story building), and the same length of time gives me, at most, a slight up-tick in long-term cancer risk.</p></div>
<p>More positively, I’m excited to announce that a little while back, I added a new feature to NUKEMAP, one I’ve been wanting to implement for some time now. The NUKEMAP’s fallout model (<a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/faq/#fallout">the Miller model</a>) has always been a little hard to make intuitive sense out of, other than “a vague representation of the area of contamination.” I’ve been exploring some other fallout models that could be implemented as well, but in the meantime, I wanted to find a way to make the current version (which has to advantage of being very quick to calculate and render) more intuitively meaningful.</p>
<p>The Miller model’s contours give the dose intensity (in rad/hr) at H+1 hour. So for the “100 rad/hr” contour, that means: “this area will be covered by fallout that, one hour after detonation, had an intensity of 100 rad/hr, assuming that the fallout has actually arrived there at that time.” So to figure out what your exposure on the ground is, you need to calculate when the fallout actually arrives to you (on the wind), what the dose rate is at time of arrival, and then how that dose rate will decrease over the next hours that you are exposed to it. You also might want to know how that is affected by the kind of structure you’re in, since anything that stands between you and the fallout will cut your exposure a bit. All of which makes for an annoying and tricky calculation to do by hand.</p>
<p>So I’ve added a feature to the “Probe location” tool, which allows you to sample the conditions at any given distance from ground zero. It will now calculate the time of fallout arrival (which is based on the distance and the wind settings), the intensity of the fallout at the time of arrival, and then allow you to see what the total dose would be if you were in that area for, say, 24 hours after detonation. It also allows you to apply a “protection factor” based on the kind of building you are in (the protection factor is just a divisor: a protection factor of 10 reduces the total exposure by 10). All of which can be used to answer questions about the human effects of fallout, and the situations in which different kinds of shelters can be effective, or not.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_6768" id="identifier_3_6768" title="I’ll eventually update the NUKEMAP FAQ about how this works, but it just uses Wigner’s standard t-1.2 fission product decay rate formula.">3</a></sup></p>
<p>There are some more NUKEMAP features actively in the works, as well. More on those, soon.</p>
<ol><li id="footnote_1_6768">For non-coders: an API is a code library that lets third-party developers use someone else’s services. So the Google Maps API lets you develop applications that use Google Maps: you can say, “load Google Maps into this part of the web page, add an icon to it, make the icon draggable, and when someone clicks a button over here, draw circles around that icon that go out to a given radius, and color the circles this way and that way.” That’s the basics of NUKEMAP’s functionality, more or less.<span> [<a href="#identifier_1_6768">↩</a>]</span></li><li id="footnote_2_6768">Before people e-mail me about how <a href="https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/">CesiumJS</a> fills the Google Earth Plugin gap — it doesn’t, because it doesn’t give you the global coverage of 3D buildings that you need to make sense of the size of a mushroom cloud. If they change that someday, I’ll take the time to port the code, but I don’t see many signs that this is going to happen, because global 3D building shapes are still something that only Google seems to own. If you do want to render volumetric mushroom clouds in the stand-alone Google Earth program, there is a (still experimental and incomplete) feature in NUKEMAP for exporting cloud shapes as KMZ files. See the <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap3d/">NUKEMAP3D page</a> for more information on how to use this.<span> [<a href="#identifier_2_6768">↩</a>]</span></li><li id="footnote_3_6768">I’ll eventually update the <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/faq/">NUKEMAP FAQ</a> about how this works, but it just uses Wigner’s standard <em>t</em><sup>-1.2</sup> fission product decay rate formula.<span> [<a href="#identifier_3_6768">↩</a>]</span></li></ol>

<p>This is a brief blog post to highlight the growth of the Servo community in recent years, particularly since <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a> took over the project maintenance in 2023.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn’t talk about the technical achievements, though there have been tons of them in the last years. <em>A picture is worth a thousand words</em> so just take a look at <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-a-new-web-engine-written-in-rust/">this slide from my latest Servo talk</a> which shows how <a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> was rendered with Servo at the beginning of 2023 vs September 2025.</p>

<p>So like <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-revival-2023-2024/">we did last year</a>, let’s take a look at the PRs merged on the main <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo repository on GitHub</a> since 2018.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PRs</strong>: total number of PRs merged.</li>
<li><strong>Contributors</strong>: average number of contributors per month.</li>
<li><strong>Contributors ≥ 10</strong>: average number of contributors that have merged more than 10 PRs per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a clarification, these numbers don’t include PRs from bots (<code>dependabot</code> and <code>Servo WPT Sync</code>).</p>
<p>Checking this we can see we are close to <strong>double the numbers from last year</strong>! The numbers in 2025 are way bigger than in the previous years (even checking the numbers from 2018-2019), showing a healthy community working on Servo.</p>



<p>The next chart is a different view of the same data but split per month, with the number of PRs landed every month, the number of contributors and the number of contributors with more than 10 patches. It shows the evolution over the years and the high activity last year.</p>


<h2 id="number-of-contributors" tabindex="-1">Number of contributors <a href="#number-of-contributors">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s focus on the last 3 years, since the project reactivation, and the numbers of contributors to the Servo project.</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>2023</th>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Contributors</strong></td>
        <td>54</td>
        <td>129</td>
        <td>146</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>≥ 100 PRs</strong></td>
        <td>1 (2%)</td>
        <td>3 (2%)</td>
        <td>8 (5%)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>≥ 10 PRs</strong></td>
        <td>8 (15%)</td>
        <td>29 (22%)</td>

        <td><strong>Only 1 PR</strong></td>
        <td>31 (57%)</td>
        <td>53 (41%)</td>
        <td>55 (38%)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>The number of contributors to Servo has tripled since 2023, reaching <strong>146 different contributors in 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If we analyze the rest of the data in this table, we can see that the percentage of contributors that do a single PR to Servo in a year has been reduced, meaning that Servo contributors are now usually doing more than one PR to the project.</p>
<p>If we check the number of contributors that have done more than 10 PRs in a year, we see the percentage almost doubling from 15% to 29% in the last 3 years.</p>
<p>And for the top contributors doing more than 100 PRs in a year, we have gone from 1 in 2023 and 3 in 2024 to 8 last year, which represent the 5% of the Servo contributors, showing a good team of very active contributors to the project.</p>
<h2 id="wpt-pass-rate" tabindex="-1">WPT pass-rate <a href="#wpt-pass-rate">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">WPT</a> evolution in 2025.</p>

</figure>
<p>You can check more information about WPT pass-rates at <a href="https://servo.org/wpt/">Servo’s website</a> (where you can also find an explanation of the <em>Score</em> number).</p>
<p>Note that these numbers differ from <a href="https://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a> because we’re still not running all the WPT tests in Servo, so the total numbers here are smaller.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to extract conclusions from this data, but it shows the Servo project keeps progressing and supporting more web platform features as time passes.</p>
<p>Sometimes these numbers grow artificially as new tests are added to WPT for features that Servo already supports (for example, the biggest jump last year was in October getting 188,281 new subtests passing without any change in Servo, just because new tests were added to WPT).</p>

</figure>
<p>We are about to reach <strong>35,000 stars on GitHub</strong>. It’s good to see the project has not stopped growing since the beginning, and the curve has become steeper in recent years.</p>
<h2 id="other" tabindex="-1">Other <a href="#other">#</a></h2>
<p>If we check to the <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/governance/README.md">official project roles</a>, we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 administrators</li>
<li>17 TSC members</li>
<li>25 maintainers</li>
<li>18 contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also started doing <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/10/20/servo-0.0.1-release/"><strong>Servo releases</strong></a>, we have done <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/releases">3 so far</a>.</p>
<p>Also the TSC has setup <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/11/21/sponsorship-tiers/">sponsorship tiers</a> for donations. We got <a href="https://servo.org/#acknowledgements"><strong>4 bronze sponsors</strong></a> in 2025 and we hope to increase the number of sponsorships in 2026.</p>
<p>Regarding donations, we have defined a <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/FUNDING_REQUEST.md"><strong>funding process</strong></a> to request usage of that money. We are currently using it to sponsor <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/09/17/your-donations-at-work-funding-jdm/">Josh Matthews’ contributions</a>, and <a href="https://www.azabani.com/2025/12/18/shoestring-web-engine-ci.html">pay for self-hosted runners to speed up CI times</a>.</p>
<p>Servo has been present in several events last year, we ended up giving <a href="https://servo.org/about/"><strong>10 talks</strong></a> all around the globe.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1">Wrap-up <a href="#wrap-up">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea here was to do a quick recap of the Servo stats in 2025. Taking a look at these numbers every now and then is useful, and gives you a different perspective about the status of the project, that one can easily ignore during the day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>In general things have grown a lot in 2025, who knows what would happen in 2026, but we hope we can at least keep similar numbers or maybe even keep growing them further. That would be really great news for the Servo project.</p>
<p>Igalia is really proud of what the whole Servo community has achieved together in the recent years, and we hope for a bright future for the project going forward.</p>
<p>As an aside note, by the end of the month I’ll be at <a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/talk/review/PQPRDZ8DM7L8SYHBKGNZUJZUWGEXQTTP">FOSDEM talking about Servo</a>, other Servo folks like <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/dazabani">Delan Azabani</a> and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/mrobinson">Martin Robinson</a> will also be there. If you are around, don’t hesitate to say hi and ask anything about the project.</p>

  <p>I can’t overstate how much I hate GitHub Actions. I don’t even remember hating any other piece of technology I used. Sure, I still make fun of PHP that I remember from times of PHP4<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but even then I didn’t <em>hate</em> it. Merely I found it subpar technology to other emerging at the time (like Ruby on Rails or Django). And yet I hate GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>With Passion<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>





    <img src="https://xlii.space/images/github-actions-workflow-failed-small_hu_41b5aaa5fc955172.jpg" width="659" height="400" alt="">
  


<h2 id="road-to-hell">Road to Hell</h2>
<p>Day before writing these words I was implementing <code>build.rs</code> for my <a href="https://github.com/exlee/tmplr">tmplr</a> project. To save you a click - it is a file/project scaffold tool with human readable (and craftable) template files. I (personally) use it very often, given how easy it is to craft new templates, by hand or with aid of the tool, so check it out if you need a similar tool.</p>
<p>The <code>build.rs</code> used <code>CUE</code> to generate <code>README.md</code>, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> and also a version/help file to guarantee consistency. It was fun thing to do, it took approx. 1.5h and I even <a href="https://dev.to/exlee/buildrs-ing-documentation-with-cuelang-3h2a">wrote an article</a> about it. For myself and future generations.</p>
<p>I was happy with the results and didn’t check CI output which, quite unsurprisingly, failed. I was using <code>cue</code> binary inside <code>build.rs</code> and without it build simply couldn’t progress. When I woke up next day and saw e-mail from CI notifying me about failed build I immediatelly knew my day isn’t going to start with puppies and rainbows.</p>
<p>It took couple attempts to search and push GitHub Action that would install <code>CUE</code> and then I got the worst of the worst results: One system in matrix failing to build.</p>
<p>A word of explanation. I’m building <code>tmplr</code> for 4 platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux ARM</li>
<li>macOS ARM</li>
<li>Linux x86_64</li>
<li>macOS x86_64</li>
</ul>
<p>Makes sense, right? Even though my user base can be counted on a fingers of one-arm-less and second-arm-hook-equipped pirate, it’s still a thing “One Should Do”.</p>
<p>And with all that - Linux ARM failed with “command can’t be found”. <code>CUE</code> installed and ran nicely for all other 3 targets, but for some reason it failed for Linux ARM.</p>
<p>In case you don’t care about <em>why</em> I hate GitHub but your mind started to wonder to “what went wrong” let me tell you; because I know.</p>
<p>So supposedly cross build that happens in matrix is heavily isolated. When I install <code>CUE</code> I install it only on x86_64 Linux host and macOS ARM host. macOS has zero issues running x86_64 binary and no issues are raised when Linux x86_64 tries to run x86_64 binary. But GitHub Actions is nice enough to <strong>hide</strong> x86_64 binary from arm64 runner, so that it won’t break.</p>
<p>Thank you GitHub Actions. What would’ve I done without you.</p>
<h2 id="broken-loop">Broken Loop</h2>
<p>And so my least favorite feedback loop started and went like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for possible fix</li>
<li>Change <code>ci.yml</code></li>
<li><code>jj squash --ignore-immutable &amp;&amp; jj git push</code> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Open “Actions” tab</li>
<li>Open latest run</li>
<li>Open Linux ARM run</li>
<li>Wait couple of seconds</li>
<li>Hate Life</li>
<li>Offer the Universe choice words it won’t soon forget</li>
<li>Rinse &amp; repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>I got quite efficient when it comes to points 8 and 9 but otherwise the whole loop still took around 2-3 minutes to execute.</p>
<p>FOR. A. SINGLE. CHANGE.</p>
<p>Yes. For a single change. Like having an editor with 2 minute save lag, pushing commit using program running on cassette tapes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> or playing chess over snail-mail. It’s 2026 for Pete’s sake, and we<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> won’t tolerate this behavior!</p>
<p>Now of course, in some Perfect World, GitHub could have a local runner with all the bells and whistles. Or maybe something that would allow me to quickly check for progress upon the push<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> or even something like a “scratch commit”, i.e. a way that I could testbed different runs without polluting history of both Git and Action runs.</p>
<p>But no such perfect world exists and one is at the whim of heartless YAML-based system.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-off">Breaking off</h2>
<p>I suffered only 30 minutes of such loops. Could’ve done it for longer but I was out of colorful language to use and felt without it the process just isn’t the same.</p>
<p>There is a wise saying in the internet that goes like:</p>
<p><strong>For the love of all that is holy, don’t let GitHub Actions manage your logic. Keep your scripts under your own damn control and just make the Actions call them!</strong></p>
<p>This is what everyone should do. This is what I did.</p>
<p>I deleted <code>build.rs</code> (with a sliver of sadness because it was really nice - but sacrifices had to be made). I moved all the generation from <code>build.rs</code> to GNU Makefile, committed the darn files into repository, reverted changes to CI and called it a day. Problem solved.</p>
<h2 id="exit-code-0">Exit Code: 0</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions, Friends &amp; Gentlefolk, is the reason why we can’t have (some) nice things. I can’t count how many hours I’ve lost debugging the runners or trying to optimize the build process. It’s a sorry process every single time, a time that would be better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>And yet there are some benefits, like macOS builds that would be quite hard to get otherwise. I don’t know any other system that would be easier to setup than GitHub Actions (if you know one, let me know) but it seems there’s no escape.</p>
<p>We are all doomed to GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>…but at least I dodged the bullet early.</p>

<p><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 8</a>, the latest release of the popular web application framework based on Ruby, excised <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>&nbsp;from its standard technology stack. Redis is no longer required to queue jobs, cache partials and data, and send real-time messages. Instead, Rails’s new features—<a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue">SolidQueue</a>&nbsp;for job queuing, <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cache">SolidCache</a>&nbsp;for caching, and <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cable">SolidCable</a>&nbsp;for transiting ActionCable messages—run entirely on your application’s existing relational database service. For most Rails applications, Redis can be discarded.</p>
<p>I know how that sounds. The Redis key-value store is fast, adept, and robust, and its reliability made it the preferred infrastructure for Rails job queueing and caching for more than a decade. Countless applications depend on Redis every day.</p>
<p>However, Redis does add complexity. SolidQueue, SolidCache, and SolidCable sparked something of an epiphany for me: <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>&nbsp;such as relational database tables can be just as capable as a specialized solution.</p>
<p>Here, let’s examine the true cost of running Redis, discover how SolidQueue works and supplants a key-value store, and learn how to use SolidQueue to migrate an application’s job queues to vanilla PostgreSQL (or SQLite or MySQL). Web development is already too complicated—let’s <em>simplify</em>.</p>
<h2 id="h.r03o9apwrc9f">The True Cost of Redis</h2>
<p>What does Redis cost beyond its monthly hosting bill? Setup and ongoing maintenance are not free. To use Redis you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy, version, patch, and monitor the server software</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence">Configure a persistence strategy</a>. Do you choose RDB snapshots, AOF logs, or both?</li>
<li>Set and watch <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/memory-limit/)">memory limits</a>&nbsp;and establish <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/eviction-policy">eviction policies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to those taxes, there are other ongoing burdens to infrastructure and interoperability. You must also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustain network connectivity, including firewall rules, between Rails and Redis</li>
<li>Authenticate your Redis clients</li>
<li>Build and care for a high availability (HA) Redis cluster</li>
<li>Orchestrate the lifecycles of Sidekiq processes across deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, when something goes wrong with a job, you’re faced with debugging Redis and your RDBMS, two data stores with very different semantics, switching context between different query languages and tools. And then there’s the issue of two separate backup strategies. (You tested them both, right?)</p>
<p>In a “Redis-less” Rails stack, things are simpler. If Rails or PostgreSQL fails, everything stops.</p>
<h2 id="h.35fl6getq7lw">How SolidQueue Works</h2>
<p>Redis is a very different data store than PostgreSQL. In many ways, Redis is treated as if it’s memory: atomic, volatile, and very fast. So how does SolidQueue manage to replace it with PostgreSQL?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#sql-for-update-share">PostgreSQL 9.5</a>&nbsp;enhanced its SQL <code>FOR UPDATE</code>&nbsp;clause to add &nbsp;<code>SKIP LOCKED</code>. The <code>FOR UPDATE</code>&nbsp;clause creates an exclusive row lock. <code>SKIP LOCKED</code>&nbsp;further skips any rows currently locked. This mechanism makes running database-backed job queues viable, even at scale.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when a worker needs a job:</p>
<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM solid_queue_ready_executions
WHERE queue_name = 'default'
ORDER BY priority DESC, job_id ASC
LIMIT 1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
</code></pre>
<p>A free worker always picks up the next available job.</p>
<p>This database optimization solves the fundamental problem that plagued earlier database queue implementations: <em>lock contention</em>. A worker never waits for another and a worker never blocks. Multiple workers can query simultaneously and PostgreSQL guarantees each claims a unique job. When a worker finishes processing, it releases the lock and deletes the execution record.</p>

<p>The SolidQueue architecture centers on three tables:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>All jobs are stored in <code>solid_queue_jobs</code>. The table persists job metadata, such as the name of the job, its Ruby class, and timestamps to record when the job started and finished. By default, every queueing request &nbsp;is recorded in this table and retained permanently, even after the job completes.</li>
<li>A scheduled job waits in <code>solid_queue_scheduled_executions</code>&nbsp;until its scheduled time arrives.</li>
<li>A job ready to run immediately is queued to solid_queue_ready_executions, where a worker &nbsp;claims it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Job tables can churn rapidly and steadily (there are hordes of inserts and deletes), but PostgreSQL’s MVCC design handles this fine with its built-in autovacuum process. No special tuning required.</p>
<p>A handful of processes coordinate this flow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers poll <code>solid_queue_ready_executions</code>&nbsp;at configurable intervals (as fast as 0.1 seconds for high-priority queue/se</li>
<li>Jobs are claimed and subsequently executed with <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>&nbsp;to control concurrency.</li>
<li>Dispatchers poll <code>solid_queue_scheduled_executions</code>&nbsp;once per second, moving due jobs into the ready table.</li>
<li>Schedulers manage recurring tasks by enqueueing jobs per defined timetables.</li>
<li>A supervisor process monitors all these, tracking heartbeats and restarting crashed processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These separate concerns may be SolidQueue’s most elegant feature. Each process type operates on different tables with different polling intervals optimized for its workload. The processes never interfere with each other, and the database handles all coordination through vanilla transactional database semantics.</p>
<h2 id="h.sihc6y9b6bdz">Scheduling Recurring Jobs with SolidQueue</h2>
<p>Recurring jobs add to the costs inherent with Redis, as you often must integrate yet another library to schedule regular jobs. For example, assuming an application uses <a href="https://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a>&nbsp;for its <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">ActiveJob</a>&nbsp;adapter, <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq-cron/sidekiq-cron">sidekiq-cron</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">whenever</a>&nbsp;are two popular solutions to schedule repetitive jobs.</p>
<p>Nothing supplemental is required; however, if you use SolidQueue. It includes <em>cron</em>-style recurring jobs out of the box. Simply edit <em>config/recurring.yml</em>. The configuration file should look hauntingly familiar:</p>
<pre><code>
# config/recurring.yml
production:

&nbsp; cleanup_old_sessions:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CleanupSessionsJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every day at 2am
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: maintenance

&nbsp; send_daily_digest:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: DailyDigestJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every day at 9am
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: mailers

&nbsp; refresh_cache:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CacheWarmupJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every hour
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: default</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how SolidQueue’s recurring jobs work in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the scheduler runs it finds the jobs due and enqueues each job to run. In the list above, for example, the task <strong>refresh_cache</strong>&nbsp;causes CacheWarmupJob&nbsp;to run at the top of each hour.</li>
<li>Concurrently, the scheduler also queues a new job to run at the time of the next occurrence in the series. Continuing the example, an hourly task that runs at 8:00 AM schedules itself to run again at 9:00 AM.</li>
<li>The 9:00 AM task schedules itself for 10:00 AM, ad infinitum.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern is borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a>, another database-backed queue system. It’s crash-resistant because schedules are deterministic. “Every hour” always resolves to the top of the hour, regardless of when the scheduler process starts.</p>

<p>If you want more detail on everything SolidQueue is doing under the hood, <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/authors/hans-j%C3%B6rg-schnedlitz.html)">Hans-Jörg Schnedlitz</a>&nbsp;over at AppSignal gives a really <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2025/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-solid-queue-for-ruby-on-rails.html">thorough treatment</a>&nbsp;of all its pulleys and belts.</p>
<h2 id="h.fcj9kedvqxg0">Job Concurrency: The Feature You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2>
<p>If you’ve historically used Rails at mere mortal scale, you may be unaware that Sidekiq also offers <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting">concurrency limits as a paid feature</a>&nbsp;in Sidekiq Enterprise. If you’re considering using Sidekiq, concurrency limiting alone is worth the additional expense for the Enterprise edition.</p>
<p>But SolidQueue gives you this, and more, for free! Simply add <code>limits_concurrency</code>&nbsp;to any job.</p>
<pre><code>class ProcessUserOnboardingJob &lt; ApplicationJob
&nbsp; limits_concurrency to: 1, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; key: -&gt;(user) { user.id }, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; duration: 15.minutes

def perform(user)&lt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Complex onboarding workflow
&nbsp; end
end
</code></pre>
<p><code>limits_concurrency to: 1</code> ensures only one <code>ProcessUserOnboardingJob</code>&nbsp;job runs per user at any one time.</p>
<p>The <code>duration</code>&nbsp;parameter is also essential, as it defines how long SolidQueue guarantees the concurrency limit. If a job crashes, say, the semaphore eventually expires, preventing deadlocks caused by crashed workers that never release their locks.</p>

<p>The implementation uses two tables: <code>solid_queue_semaphores</code>&nbsp;to track concurrency limits and <code>solid_queue_blocked_executions</code>&nbsp;to hold jobs waiting for semaphore release. When a job finishes, it releases its semaphore and triggers a dispatcher to unblock the next waiting job. It’s elegant, database-native, and requires zero external coordination.</p>
<h2 id="h.7uttb9o3suc">Monitor SolidQueue with Mission Control</h2>
<p>The no-fee version of Sidekiq’s web user interface is okay. <a href="https://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq Pro</a>&nbsp;($949/year) and Sidekiq Enterprise (starting at $1,699/year) offer enhanced dashboards.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs">Mission Control Jobs</a>&nbsp;is free, open source, and designed specifically for Rails 8’s SolidQueue ecosystem:</p>
<pre><code># config/routes.rb
mount MissionControl::Jobs::Engine, at: "/jobs"</code></pre>
<p>With this single line in your routes, you now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Real-time” job status across all queues</li>
<li>Failed job inspection with full stack traces</li>
<li>Retry and discard controls with batch operations</li>
<li>Scheduled job timeline visualization</li>
<li>Recurring job management</li>
<li>Queue-specific metrics and throughput graphs</li>
</ul>
<p>Even better, Mission Control can inspect your database schema. When you inspect a failed job, you can see its job arguments (just like Sidekiq), but you can also query the job data with everyone’s favorite query language, SQL:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT j.queue_name, COUNT(*) as failed_count
FROM solid_queue_failed_executions fe
JOIN solid_queue_jobs j ON j.id = fe.job_id
WHERE fe.created_at &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY j.queue_name;</code></pre>
<p>SQL is a language you already know running in tools you already use. No external parsing. No timestamp arithmetic. Just SQL.</p>
<h2 id="h.uutpk7t1qdui">The Migration Path: From Sidekiq to SolidQueue</h2>
<p>It’s almost trivial to migrate from Sidekiq to SolidQueue.</p>
<h4 id="h.6tqlll68u3lx"><strong>Step 1: Change the Rails queue adapter</strong></h4>
<p>Rails’s queue adapter setting specifies which queuing backend is used for processing background jobs asynchronously. Set it to <code>:solid_queue</code>.</p>
<pre><code># config/environments/production.rb
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.48tk995bmllm"><strong>Step 2: Install SolidQueue</strong></h4>
<p>The SolidQueue gem must be installed separately from Rails. The gem includes two tasks to add SolidQueue’s tables to the application’s database.</p>
<pre><code>$ bundle add solid_queue
$ rails solid_queue:install
$ rails db:migrate
</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.lgvjgjkwngjq"><strong>Step 3: Replace sidekiq-cron schedules</strong></h4>
<p>Assuming you are using Sidekiq, convert your <em>config/sidekiq.yml</em>&nbsp;cron schedules to <em>config/recurring.yml</em>. The config is similarly shaped, but you’ll need to update key names and convert classic cron strings to Fugit’s preferred natural language:</p>
<pre><code># OLD: config/sidekiq.yml
:schedule:
&nbsp; cleanup_job:
&nbsp; &nbsp; cron: '0 2 * * *'
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CleanupJob
# NEW: config/recurring.yml
production:
&nbsp; cleanup_job:
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: CleanupJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every day at 2am</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.okb5m1d38hf6"><strong>Step 4: Update your Procfile</strong></h4>
<p>A <em>Procfile</em>&nbsp;enumerates the processes to launch on application start. To kick off SolidQueue, add the task <code>solid_queue:start</code>&nbsp;(replacing Sidekiq, say).</p>
<pre><code>web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
jobs: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.kcexuaodcr9"><strong>Step 5: Blast the old stack</strong></h4>
<p>Redis and Sidekiq are now obsolete. You can remove any corresponding gems from the <em>Gemfile</em>. Run Bundler to remove the dependencies from <em>Gemfile.lock</em>.</p>
<pre><code># Gemfile - DELETE
# gem "redis"&lt;
# gem "sidekiq"
# gem "sidekiq-cron"

$ bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle clean --force
</code></pre>
<p>Your existing ActiveJob jobs work without modification. All retry strategies, error handling, and job options transfer directly.</p>
<h2 id="h.wlovlujo8ygl">When NOT To Use SolidQueue</h2>
<p>Some applications <em>need</em>&nbsp;Redis. Here are some candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re processing thousands of jobs per second sustained (not spikes, but consistent, sustained load).</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/patterns/twitter-clone">Job latency under 1ms</a>&nbsp;is critical to your business. This is a real and pressing concern for real-time bidding, high frequency trading (HFT), and other applications in the same ilk.</li>
<li>You have complex <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/pubsub">pub/sub</a>&nbsp;patterns across multiple services</li>
<li>You require intensive <a href="https://redis.io/commands/incr">rate limiting or counters</a>&nbsp;that benefit from Redis’s atomic operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a benchmark, Shopify engineer John Duff presented some numbers at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsKXPnB6SvQ">Big Ruby 2013</a>: 833 requests/second, 72ms average response time, 53 servers with 1,172 worker processes. At that scale—twelve years ago—Shopify needed Redis-level infrastructure. Are you there yet?</p>
<p>You definitely do not need Redis if processing is less than 100 jobs/second or job latency tolerance is greater than 100ms. You may need Redis if processing 100-1000 jobs/second (test both, measure), traffic is spiky, (Black Friday sales, ticket releases), or sub-100ms job queue latency is required.</p>
<h2 id="h.89fwv929byv">Practical Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through a real-world setup.</p>
<h4 id="h.z0h9xlzcbc5g"><strong>Step 1: Generate a New Rails 8 App</strong></h4>
<pre><code>$ rails new myapp --database=postgresql
$ cd myapp</code></pre>
<p>Rails 8 auto-configures SolidQueue, SolidCache, and SolidCable. You’re halfway done already.</p>
<h4 id="h.zg9fxrl7idv2"><strong>Step 2: Set Up Queue Database</strong></h4>
<p>SolidQueue needs to know where to store its tables. The recommended approach is a separate database connection (even if it’s the same physical database server).</p>
<p>Update your <em>config/database.yml</em>:</p>
<pre><code>development:
&nbsp; primary: &amp;primary_development
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *default
&nbsp; &nbsp; database: myapp_development
&nbsp; queue:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *primary_development
 &nbsp; database: myapp_queue_development
&nbsp; &nbsp; migrations_paths: db/queue_migrate
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using SQLite or MySQL, the <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue#usage-in-development-and-other-non-production-environments">official SolidQueue documentation</a>&nbsp;has examples for those setups.</p>
<p>Now tell SolidQueue to use its own connection in <em>config/environments/development.rb</em>:</p>
<pre><code>Rails.application.configure do
&nbsp; config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue
&nbsp; config.solid_queue.connects_to = { database: { writing: :queue } }
end</code></pre>
<p>Run db:prepare&nbsp;and Rails handles everything automatically:</p>
<pre><code>$ rails db:prepare</code></pre>
<p>Rails creates the queue database and loads the schema. No custom rake tasks needed.</p>
<h4 id="h.pa0mbxf4u4v9"><strong>Step 3: Configure Mission Control Authentication</strong></h4>
<pre><code># config/environments/development.rb (add to existing config block)
config.mission_control.jobs.http_basic_auth_user = "dev"
config.mission_control.jobs.http_basic_auth_password = "dev"</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.r2b45yiwzwp1"><strong>Step 4: Mount Mission Control</strong></h4>
<pre><code># config/routes.rb
mount MissionControl::Jobs::Engine, at: "/jobs"</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.c01npuo8gacb"><strong>Step 5: Create Procfile.dev</strong></h4>
<pre><code>web: bin/rails server
jobs: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.xbucvuurw84q"><strong>Step 6: Start Everything</strong></h4>
<pre><code># Start all the servers for Rails from the shell
$ bin/dev</code></pre>
<h2 id="h.uwzeg39z7ejc">How to Test SolidQueue</h2>
<p>Create a test job, enqueue it, and watch it in Mission Control:</p>
<pre><code># Generate a new job class from the shell
$ rails generate job EmailReport</code></pre>
<p>Open the new Ruby file and add this code.</p>
<pre><code># Job definition
class EmailReportJob &lt; ApplicationJob
&nbsp; queue_as :default
&nbsp; retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 5
&nbsp; def perform(user_id)
&nbsp; &nbsp; user = User.find(user_id)
&nbsp; &nbsp; ReportMailer.weekly_summary(user).deliver_now
&nbsp; end
end</code></pre>
<p>Next, run the Rails console and queue an immediate job.</p>
<pre><code>console&gt; EmailReportJob.perform_later(User.first.id)</code></pre>
<p>While in the console, queue a scheduled job, too.</p>
<pre><code>console&gt; EmailReportJob
.set(wait: &nbsp;1.week)
.perform_later(User.first.id)</code></pre>
<p>Make it recurring in <em>config/recurring.yml</em>:</p>
<pre><code>production:
&nbsp; weekly_reports:&lt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; class: EmailReportJob
&nbsp; &nbsp; schedule: every monday at 8am
&nbsp; &nbsp; queue: mailers
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you might want to kick over your server and visit <em>http://localhost:3000/jobs</em>&nbsp;to admire your handiwork in Mission Control Jobs.</p>
<h2 id="h.bnimljph36vz">Common Gotchas</h2>
<h4 id="h.tdrame9uyjrz"><strong>Single Database Setup (Alternative)</strong></h4>
<p>SolidQueue recommends the use of a separate database connection, but you can run everything in one database, if you prefer.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Copy the contents of <em>db/queue_schema.rb</em>&nbsp;into a regular migration</li>
<li>Delete <em>db/queue_schema.rb</em></li>
<li>Remove <strong>config.solid_queue.connects_to</strong>&nbsp;from your environment configs</li>
<li>Run rails db:migrate</li>
</ol>
<p>This works fine for smaller apps, but at the cost of operational flexibility. The Rails team recommends the separate connection approach. See the <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue#single-database-configuration">official docs</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<h4 id="h.kihrnukaqm9t"><strong>Mission Control in Production</strong></h4>
<p>Don’t forget to add authentication to limit access to Mission Control in production environments! The development example uses Basic Auth, but you’ll want something more robust for production:</p>
<pre><code># config/initializers/mission_control.rb
Rails.application.configure do
&nbsp; config.mission_control.jobs.base_controller_class = 
&nbsp; &nbsp; "AdminController"
end</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.c9ykr0ue1yq7"><strong>Polling Intervals</strong></h4>
<p>The default polling interval is 1 second for scheduled jobs and 0.2 seconds for ready jobs. If you’re migrating from Sidekiq and notice jobs feel “slower,” check your expectations. In my experience, SolidQueue’s defaults work well for most applications. Sub-second latency usually doesn’t matter for background jobs.</p>
<h4 id="h.ravxl7lujbix"><strong>ActionCable and Turbo Streams</strong></h4>
<p>If you’re using ActionCable (or anything that depends on it like Turbo Streams), you’ll need to configure SolidCable with its own database connection too. Add a cable database to your database.yml:</p>
<pre><code># config/database.yml
production:
&nbsp; primary:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *default
&nbsp; &nbsp; database: myapp_production
&nbsp; cable:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;&lt;: *default
&nbsp; &nbsp; database: myapp_cable_production
&nbsp; &nbsp; migrations_paths: db/cable_migrate</code></pre>
<p>Then in <em>config/cable.yml</em>:</p>
<pre><code>production:
&nbsp; adapter: solid_cable
&nbsp; connects_to:
&nbsp; &nbsp; database:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; writing: cable
&nbsp; polling_interval: 0.1.seconds
&nbsp; message_retention: 1.day</code></pre>
<h4 id="h.xrhl635f4dkm"><strong>Polling Interval</strong></h4>
<p>The polling_interval of 0.1 seconds means your ActionCable server polls the database 10 times per second—light enough for PostgreSQL to handle without breaking a sweat. This gives you 100ms latency for real-time updates, which feels plenty snappy for Turbo Streams, live notifications, or even chat.</p>
<h2 id="h.dxpb7fhjiuyb">Does it Scale</h2>
<p>You may be asking the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBwWbFpkl">timeless question</a>:</p>

<p><strong>bUT doES iT ScALe?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes, it scales. A better question, though, is “Does it scale enough for me?” To answer, you can start with this lovely formula from Nate Berkopec’s 2015 article <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/2015/07/29/scaling-ruby-apps-to-1000-rpm.html">“Scaling Ruby Apps to 1000 RPM”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Required app instances = request rate (req/sec) × average response time (sec)</strong></p>
<p>Let’s do the math for a typical app. Say your app is getting 100 requests per minute, with a 200ms average response time. That’s ~1.67 requests per second. Multiply by 0.2 seconds and you get 0.083 application instances required. You need 8% of one application instance to handle your load.</p>
<p>As an anecdote, 37signals <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2025/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-solid-queue-for-ruby-on-rails.html">processes 20 million jobs per day</a>. That’s roughly 230 jobs per second running all on PostgreSQL sans Redis. Unless you’re processing millions of jobs per day, PostgreSQL can handle your load.</p>
<p>Here’s a side by side comparison of Redis and Sidekiq versus SolidQueue.</p>

<h2 id="h.ppt79y831p8v">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Redis and Sidekiq are masterfully engineered and Rails applications have benefited immeasurably from the combination for over a decade. But for most Rails apps, Redis and Sidekiq solve a problem you don’t have at a cost you can’t afford.</p>
<p>Give SolidQueue a spin. Your infrastructure simplifies, your operational burden lightens, and you can focus on building a product instead of maintaining a stack.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="0" data-index="0"><span>Natural language is a wonderful interface, but just because we suddenly </span><span>can </span><span>doesn't mean we always </span><span>should. </span><span>LLM inference is slow and expensive, often taking tens of seconds to complete. Natural language interfaces have orders of magnitude more latency than normal graphic user interfaces. This doesn't mean we shouldn't use LLMs, it just means we need to be smart about how we build interfaces around them.</span></p><h2 id="2" data-index="2"><span>The Latency Problem</span></h2><p id="3" data-index="3"><span>There's a classic CS diagram visualizing latency numbers for various compute operations: nanoseconds to lock a mutex, microseconds to reference memory, milliseconds to read 1 MB from disk. LLM inference usually takes 10s of seconds to complete. Streaming responses help compensate, but it's </span><span>slow.</span></p><p><img height="512" width="1024" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreieb5yelu7aryalqfyl36vlr4uxtw7kr2qfi2ycod3r3fpn4gao77u"></p><p id="5" data-index="5"><span>Compare interacting with an LLM over multiple turns to filling in a checklist, selecting items from a pulldown menu, setting a value on a slider bar, stepping through a series of such interactions as you fill out a multi-field dialogue. Graphic user interfaces are fast, with responses taking milliseconds, not seconds. But. But: they're not smart, they're not responsive, they don't shape themselves to the conversation with the full benefits of semantic understanding.</span></p><div id="6" data-index="6"><p><img alt="A popup dialogue with multiple conditional checkboxes, sliders, and text areas" height="523" width="903" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreie73h5hzlxwldypecvxfoakvb2vjwlnkeo3xfca2i56btk7pupepq"></p></div><p id="7" data-index="7"><span>This is a post about how to provide the best of both worlds: the clean affordances of structured user interfaces with the flexibility of natural language. Every part of the above interface was generated on the fly by an LLM.</span></p><h2 id="9" data-index="9"><span>Popup-MCP</span></h2><p id="10" data-index="10"><span>This is a post about a tool I made called </span><a href="https://github.com/inanna-malick/popup-mcp" target="_blank">popup-mcp</a><span> (MCP is a standardized tool-use interface for LLMs). I built it about 6 months ago and have been experimenting with it as a core part of my LLM interaction modality ever since. It's a big part of what has made me so fond of them, from such an early stage. Popup provides a single tool that when invoked spawns a popup with an arbitrary collection of GUI elements.</span></p><p id="12" data-index="12"><span>You can find popup </span><a href="https://github.com/inanna-malick/popup-mcp" target="_blank">here</a><span>, along with instructions on how to use it. It's a local MCP tool that uses stdio, which means the process needs to run on the same computer as your LLM client. Popup supports structured GUIs made up of elements including multiple choice checkboxes, drop downs, sliders, and text boxes. These let LLMs render popups like the following:</span></p><p><img height="321" width="826" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreiaudad7f2bb5emzzjsibxirsqmxyvu4vydvdv24szpxe6qgumhjj4"></p><p id="14" data-index="14"><span>The popup tool supports conditional visibility to allow for context-specific followup questions. Some elements start hidden, only becoming visible when conditions like 'checkbox clicked', 'slider value &gt; 7', or 'checkbox A clicked &amp;&amp; slider B &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; slider C &gt; 8' become true. This lets LLMs construct complex and nuanced structures capturing not just their next stage of the conversation but </span><span>where they think the conversation might go from there</span><span>. Think of these as being a bit like conditional dialogue trees in CRPGs like Baldur's Gate or interview trees as used in consulting. The previous dialog, for example, expands as follows:</span></p><p><img height="618" width="1148" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreieh3yet67ktdel4v4lq7unu6s247q5p5q37wmqyn2jcnos6wivwxm"></p><p id="16" data-index="16"><span>Because constructing this tree requires registering nested hypotheticals about how a conversation might progress, it provides a useful window into an LLM's internal cognitive state. You don't just see the question it wants to ask you, you see the followup questions it would ask based on various answer combinations. This is incredibly useful and often shows where the LLM is making incorrect assumptions. More importantly, this is </span><span>fast</span><span>. You can quickly explore counterfactuals without having to waste minutes on back-and-forth conversational turns and restarting conversations from checkpoints.</span></p><p><img height="495" width="1157" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreid56ezwkkrojlnrftxqpbyjvazkmv7qaiyqsjn52x337inbpwk7yi"></p><p id="19" data-index="19"><span>Speaking of incorrect LLM assumptions: every multiselect or dropdown automatically includes an 'Other' option, which - when selected - renders a textbox for the user to elaborate on what the LLM missed. This escape hatch started as an emergent pattern, but I recently modified the tool to _always_ auto-include an escape hatch option on all multiselects and dropdown menus.</span></p><p id="20" data-index="20"><span>This means that you can always intervene to </span><span>steer </span><span>the LLM when it has the wrong idea about where a conversation should go.</span></p><h2 id="22" data-index="22"><span>Why This Matters</span></h2><p id="23" data-index="23"><span>Remember how I started by talking about latency, about how long a single LLM response takes? This combination of nested dialogue trees and escape hatches cuts that by ~25-75%, depending on how well the LLM anticipates where the conversation is going. It's surprising how often a series dropdown with its top 3-5 predictions will contain your next answer, especially when defining technical specs, and when it doesn't there's always the natural-language escape hatch offered by 'Other'.</span></p><p id="25" data-index="25"><span>Imagine generating a new RPG setting. Your LLM spawns a popup with options for the 5 most common patterns, with focused followup questions for each.</span></p><p><img height="532" width="1152" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreieorvdy22u4m7mm7bk26rteg2u2pi777nftvwxaoerdtpoe7dd5ze"></p><p id="27" data-index="27"><span>This isn't a generic GUI; it's fully specialized using everything the LLM knows about you, your project, and the interaction style you prefer. This captures 90% of what you're trying to do, so you select the relevant options and use 'Other' escape hatches to clarify as necessary.</span></p><p><img height="697" width="1620" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreiboyo3ocrfgqeixutelvsztbj4f3behvjxbvcnejyinfsiaszhtcu"></p><p id="29" data-index="29"><span>These interactions have latency measured in milliseconds: when you check the 'Other' checkbox, a text box instantly appears, without even a network round-trip's worth of latency. When you're done, your answers are returned to the LLM as a JSON tool response.</span></p><p id="31" data-index="31"><span>You should think of this pattern as providing a reduction in amortized interaction latency: it'll still take 10s of seconds to produce a followup response when you submit a popup dialog, but if your average popup replaces &gt; 1 rounds of chat you're still taking less time per unit of information exchanged.  That's what I mean by amortized latency: that single expensive LLM invocation is amortized over multiple cheap interactions with deterministically rendered GUI run on your local machine.</span></p><h2 id="33" data-index="33"><span>Claude Code Planning Mode</span></h2><p id="34" data-index="34"><span>I started hacking on this a few months before Claude Code released their AskUser tool (as used in planning mode). The AskUser tool provides a limited selection of TUI (terminal user interface) elements: multiple-choice and single-choice (with an always-included ‘Other’ option) and single-choice drop-downs. I originally chose not to publicize my library because of this, but I believe the addition of conditional elements is worth talking about.</span></p><p><img height="396" width="1518" src="https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:qvywnipfiyrd6v4qdf4x27wy&amp;cid=bafkreie5ayfyu6dyvhxsjjbvcabyycftya4okv6f26xndqrf45lhc3prxy"></p><p id="36" data-index="36"><span>Further, I have some feature requests for Claude Code. If anyone at Anthropic happens to be reading this these would all be pretty easily to implement:</span></p><ul><li><p id="37.0" data-index="37.0"><span>Make the TUI interface used by the AskUserQuestion tool open and scriptable, such that plugins and user code can directly modify LLM-generated TUI interfaces, or directly generate their own without requiring a round-trip through the LLM to invoke the tool.</span></p></li><li><p id="37.1" data-index="37.1"><span>Provide pre and post-AskUser tool hooks so users can directly invoke code using TUI responses (eg filling templated prompts using TUI interface responses in certain contexts).</span></p></li><li><p id="37.2" data-index="37.2"><span>Extend the AskUser tool to support conditionally-rendered elements.</span></p></li></ul><h2 id="39" data-index="39"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p id="40" data-index="40"><span>If you have an LLM chat app you should add inline structured GUI elements with conditionally visible followup questions to reduce amortized interaction latency. If you'd like to build on my library or tool definition, or just to talk shop, please reach out. I'd be happy to help. This technique is equally applicable to OS-native popups, terminal user interfaces, and web UIs.</span></p><p id="42" data-index="42"><span>I'll be writing more here. Publishing what I build is one of my core resolutions for 2026, and I have one hell of a backlog. Watch this space.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Reporting Highlights</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chokeholds:</strong> We found over 40 cases of agents using chokeholds and other moves that can block breathing. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die,” said a 16-year-old citizen.</li>



<li><strong>Former Police Are Appalled:</strong> We showed former police and immigration officials videos of incidents. They said agents are out of control. One said it’s “the kind of action which should get you fired.”</li>



<li><strong>Banned Tactics, No Punishment:</strong> There is a federal ban on chokeholds and similar tactics. But there is no sign of punishment for officers who’ve used them.</li>
</ul>



<p>These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.</p>

<p>Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.</p>



<p>An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQUtnnViSSc/?hl=en">wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck</a>, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trendy_viewz_1/video/7539167585011551501">pass out</a>. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-q83KCOZw">eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing</a>.</p>



<p>After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.</p>



<p>But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.</p>



<p>Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.</p>



<p>In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf">unless deadly force is authorized</a>.”</p>




<p>About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.</p>



<p>We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.</p>



<p>This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.</p>



<p>“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”</p>



<p>“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.</p>



<p>Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2026/01/portland-police-responding-to-report-of-shooting-by-federal-immigration-agent.html">shot a man and woman</a> in a hospital parking lot.</p>



<p>Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”</p>



<p>Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.</p>



<p>“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.</p>



<p>Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.</p>



<p>Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">how often it detains citizens</a> or <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/trump-ice-smashed-windows-deportation-arrests/">smashes through vehicle windows</a> during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.</p>



<p>Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.</p>




<p>But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.</p>



<p>That norm has now been broken.</p>

<p>Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.</p>



<p>Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.</p>



<p>One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.</p>



<p>“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”</p>



<p>DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.</p>



<p>McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.</p>



<p>Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.</p>



<p>“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”</p>



<p>DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”</p>



<h3>After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.</h3>

<p>In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.</p>




<p>Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.</p>



<p>According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”</p>



<p>Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.</p>



<p>Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.</p>



<p>But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.</p>



<p>The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2774482">strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death</a>.</p>



<p>“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”</p>



<p>In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsflare-807969-distressing-moment-man-appears-fallback_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsflare-807969-distressing-moment-man-appears-1_2.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><span>Video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest shows him shaking violently while suffering an apparent seizure in the front seat of his car, with officers continuing to attempt the arrest.</span> <span>Newsflare</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf">use-of-force policy</a> states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”</p>



<p>In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested <a href="https://x.com/dhsgov/status/1986881395432820927">he had only pretended to have a medical crisis</a> while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72041374/zapata-rivera-v-unknown-federal-agent-john-doe/">“These statements were lies,”</a> Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)</p>



<p>A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”</p>




<p>Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”</p>



<h3>DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.</h3>

<p>When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”</p>



<p>But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.</p>



<p>In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.</p>



<p>Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LuisHipolito-fallback_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LuisHipolito.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><span>In the video of Hipolito’s arrest, four agents can be seen pulling at his body, choking him and pinning him to the pavement.</span> <span>@the_moxie_report</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”</p>



<p>That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.</p>



<p>The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.</p>



<p>Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.</p>



<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-27/are-you-gonna-let-him-die-agents-pile-on-protester-who-convulses-and-struggles-to-breathe">limped into court days after the incident</a>. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.</p>



<h3>Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.</h3>

A third video, from Chicago, <a href="https://spaces.hightail.com/space/ERClkyY4Cj/files/fi-ee68b78b-2ba0-4355-b2a1-49e1d5243c7c/fv-946d3e13-2b8d-4317-bb54-fbe69fd3ef09/2025.10.31.MP4">shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt</a>. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.</p>



<p>Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.</p>




<p>“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.</p>



<p>Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”</p>

<p>Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.</p>



<p>When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.</p>



<p>“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”</p>



<p>McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.</p>



<p>Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.</p>

<p>In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/51miOmd1qUM">agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground</a>.</p>



<p>“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”</p>



<p>DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.</p>



<p>Along with two <a href="https://x.com/fordfischer/status/1969150886422155594">similar</a> <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-throw-elderly-woman-to-the-ground_n_690271b2e4b0e763a61c8a22">choking incidents</a> at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.</p>



<p>“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”</p>




<p>“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”</p>



<p>“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”</p>



<h3>Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.</h3>

<p>In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/15/dhs-launches-operation-charlottes-web-target-criminal-illegal-aliens-terrorizing">Charlotte operation</a> was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1995599514078732776?s=20">commander-at-large Gregory Bovino</a> claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1995599514078732776?s=20">chased down</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuaPCS67Ii8">landscapers</a>, construction workers and <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article312950879.html">U.S. citizens</a> in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.</p>



<p>Freelance photographer <a href="https://www.ryanmurphyphoto.com/bio">Ryan Murphy</a>, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.</p>



<p>“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”</p>



<p>Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.</p>



<p>“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.</p>



<p>“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”</p>



<p>There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/homeland-security-crcl-civil-rights-immigration-border-patrol-trump-kristi-noem">lack of consequences amid gutted oversight</a>. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”</p>



<p>As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-agents-detained-mistreated-citizens-congressional-investigation">where citizens — and protesters — abound</a>, takes another.</p>



<p>DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.</p>




<h3>Experts may think there’s abuse. But holding officers to account? That’s another matter.</h3>

<p>Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.</p>



<p>Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.</p>



<p>From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.</p>



<p>Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.</p>

<p>The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.</p>



<p>“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.</p>



<p>In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.</p>



<p>In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)</p>



<p>In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5aTGJd4Rw">video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/durango-colorado-ice-protester.html">reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation</a>, which announced it was looking into the incident.</p>



<p>In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/fbi-will-investigate-after-ice-agent-shoots-renee-good-in-minneapolis">cut the state out</a> of its investigation.</p>



<p>Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.</p>




<p>The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”</p>



<h3>How We Did It</h3>



<p>ProPublica journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.</p>



<p>We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.</p>



<p>Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.</p>



<p>We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.</p>

<div><p>The old lesson from the Wizard of Oz experiment says that a regular expression probably <i>isn't</i> too crude, if you're willing to take the time to design it. Though you could <i>probably</i> get away with running a regex golf algorithm (e.g. <a href="https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb" rel="nofollow">https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb</a>) over the list of matching titles, and the union of some list of non-matching-but-close titles (chosen to get good discrimination) with some list of way-off titles (to avoid overfitting). (You <i>could</i> treat the whole HN title database, other than the ones you've identified, as losers, but that risks hardcoding the absence of a post you accidentally missed, and would also take slightly longer – though Peter Norvig's first algorithm takes time linear in the number of losers, so it might not be too expensive. I don't know how expensive his improved versions are, given large lists of losers: <a href="https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313-part2.ipynb" rel="nofollow">https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313-part2.i...</a>.

The "Show New" (two clicks away) probably gets tinier, miniscule fraction of clicks. The intersection of people who are interested in the project and those who have clicked "Show New" would be very nearly null.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I have a habit of skimming the OpenJDK commit log every few weeks. Many commits are too complex for me to grasp in the limited time I have reserved for this ... <em>special hobby</em>. But occasionally something catches my eye.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/858d2e434dd">this commit</a> stopped me mid-scroll:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>858d2e434dd 8372584: [Linux]: Replace reading proc to get thread CPU</span></p><p><span>time with clock_gettime</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The diffstat was interesting: <code>+96 insertions, -54 deletions</code>. The changeset adds a 55-line JMH benchmark, which means the production code itself is actually reduced.</p>
<h2 id="the-deleted-code"><a href="#the-deleted-code">The Deleted Code</a></h2>
<p>Here's what got removed from <code>os_linux.cpp</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {</span></p><p><span>  pid_t  tid = thread-&gt;osthread()-&gt;thread_id();</span></p><p><span>  char *s;</span></p><p><span>  char stat[2048];</span></p><p><span>  size_t statlen;</span></p><p><span>  char proc_name[64];</span></p><p><span>  int count;</span></p><p><span>  long sys_time, user_time;</span></p><p><span>  char cdummy;</span></p><p><span>  int idummy;</span></p><p><span>  long ldummy;</span></p><p><span>  FILE *fp;</span></p><p><span>  os::snprintf_checked(proc_name, 64, "/proc/self/task/%d/stat", tid);</span></p><p><span>  fp = os::fopen(proc_name, "r");</span></p><p><span>  if (fp == nullptr) return -1;</span></p><p><span>  statlen = fread(stat, 1, 2047, fp);</span></p><p><span>  stat[statlen] = '\0';</span></p><p><span>  fclose(fp);</span></p><p><span>  // Skip pid and the command string. Note that we could be dealing with</span></p><p><span>  // weird command names, e.g. user could decide to rename java launcher</span></p><p><span>  // to "java 1.4.2 :)", then the stat file would look like</span></p><p><span>  //                1234 (java 1.4.2 :)) R ... ...</span></p><p><span>  // We don't really need to know the command string, just find the last</span></p><p><span>  // occurrence of ")" and then start parsing from there. See bug 4726580.</span></p><p><span>  s = strrchr(stat, ')');</span></p><p><span>  if (s == nullptr) return -1;</span></p><p><span>  // Skip blank chars</span></p><p><span>  do { s++; } while (s &amp;&amp; isspace((unsigned char) *s));</span></p><p><span>  count = sscanf(s,"%c %d %d %d %d %d %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu",</span></p><p><span>                 &amp;cdummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy,</span></p><p><span>                 &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy,</span></p><p><span>                 &amp;user_time, &amp;sys_time);</span></p><p><span>  if (count != 13) return -1;</span></p><p><span>  return (jlong)user_time * (1000000000 / os::Posix::clock_tics_per_second());</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This was the implementation behind <code>ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code>. To get the current thread's user CPU time, the old code was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Formatting a path to <code>/proc/self/task/&lt;tid&gt;/stat</code></li>
<li>Opening that file</li>
<li>Reading into a stack buffer</li>
<li>Parsing through a hostile format where the command name can contain parentheses (hence the <code>strrchr</code> for the last <code>)</code>)</li>
<li>Running <code>sscanf</code> to extract fields 13 and 14</li>
<li>Converting clock ticks to nanoseconds</li>
</ol>
<p>For comparison, here's what <code>getCurrentThreadCpuTime()</code> does and has always done:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time() {</span></p><p><span>  return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);</span></p><p><span>}</span></p><p><span>jlong os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid_t clockid) {</span></p><p><span>  struct timespec tp;</span></p><p><span>  clock_gettime(clockid, &amp;tp);</span></p><p><span>  return (jlong)(tp.tv_sec * NANOSECS_PER_SEC + tp.tv_nsec);</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Just a single <code>clock_gettime()</code> call. There is no file I/O, no complex parsing and no buffer to manage.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8210452">original bug report</a>, filed back in 2018, quantified the difference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"getCurrentThreadUserTime is 30x-400x slower than getCurrentThreadCpuTime"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gap widens under concurrency. Why is <code>clock_gettime()</code> so much faster? Both approaches require kernel entry, but the difference is in what happens next.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>/proc</code> path:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>open()</code> syscall</li>
<li>VFS dispatch + dentry lookup</li>
<li>procfs synthesizes file content at read time</li>
<li>kernel formats string into buffer</li>
<li><code>read()</code> syscall, copy to userspace</li>
<li>userspace <code>sscanf()</code> parsing</li>
<li><code>close()</code> syscall</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID)</code> path:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>single syscall → <code>posix_cpu_clock_get()</code> → <code>cpu_clock_sample()</code> → <code>task_sched_runtime()</code> → reads directly from <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/8449d3252c2603a51ffc7c36cb5bd94874378b7d/include/linux/sched.h#L586"><code>sched_entity</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>/proc</code> path involves multiple syscalls, VFS machinery, string formatting kernel-side, and parsing userspace-side. The <code>clock_gettime()</code> path is one syscall with a direct function call chain.</p>
<p>Under concurrent load, the <code>/proc</code> approach also suffers from kernel lock contention. The <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8372584">bug report</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading proc is slow (hence why this procedure is put under the method slow_thread_cpu_time(...)) and may lead to noticeable spikes in case of contention for kernel resources."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-two-implementations?"><a href="#why-two-implementations?">Why Two Implementations?</a></h2>
<p>So why didn't <code>getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code> just use <code>clock_gettime()</code> from the start?</p>
<p>The answer is (probably) POSIX. The standard mandates that <code>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID</code> returns total CPU time (user + system). There's no portable way to request user time only. Hence the <code>/proc</code>-based implementation.</p>
<p>The Linux port of OpenJDK isn't limited to what POSIX defines, it can use Linux-specific features. Let's see how.</p>
<h2 id="the-clockid-bit-hack"><a href="#the-clockid-bit-hack">The Clockid Bit Hack</a></h2>
<p>Linux kernels since 2.6.12 (released in 2005) <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eee51b0ae5c52a77ed65ad59b55002d1397b40d5/include/linux/posix-timers_types.h#L10-L19">encode clock type information directly</a> into the <code>clockid_t</code> value. When you call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_getcpuclockid.3.html"><code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code></a>, you get back a clockid with a specific bit pattern:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Bit 2:    Thread vs process clock</span></p><p><span>Bits 1-0: Clock type</span></p><p><span>  00 = PROF</span></p><p><span>  01 = VIRT  (user time only)</span></p><p><span>  10 = SCHED (user + system, POSIX-compliant)</span></p><p><span>  11 = FD</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The remaining bits encode the target PID/TID. We’ll come back to that in the bonus section.</p>
<p>The POSIX-compliant <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code> returns a clockid with bits <code>10</code> (SCHED). But if you flip those low bits to <code>01</code> (VIRT), <code>clock_gettime()</code> will return user time only.</p>
<p>The new implementation:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>static bool get_thread_clockid(Thread* thread, clockid_t* clockid, bool total) {</span></p><p><span>  constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_TYPE_MASK = 3;</span></p><p><span>  constexpr clockid_t CPUCLOCK_VIRT = 1;</span></p><p><span>  int rc = pthread_getcpuclockid(thread-&gt;osthread()-&gt;pthread_id(), clockid);</span></p><p><span>  if (rc != 0) {</span></p><p><span>    // Thread may have terminated</span></p><p><span>    assert_status(rc == ESRCH, rc, "pthread_getcpuclockid failed");</span></p><p><span>    return false;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p><p><span>  if (!total) {</span></p><p><span>    // Flip to CPUCLOCK_VIRT for user-time-only</span></p><p><span>    *clockid = (*clockid &amp; ~CLOCK_TYPE_MASK) | CPUCLOCK_VIRT;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p><p><span>  return true;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p><p><span>static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {</span></p><p><span>  clockid_t clockid;</span></p><p><span>  bool success = get_thread_clockid(thread, &amp;clockid, false);</span></p><p><span>  return success ? os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid) : -1;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And that's it. The new version has no file I/O, no buffer and certainly no <code>sscanf()</code> with thirteen format specifiers.</p>
<h2 id="profiling-time!"><a href="#profiling-time!">Profiling time!</a></h2>
<p>Let's have a look at how it performs in practice. For this exercise, I am taking the <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/858d2e434dd#diff-0151b4192746117a72e6da834a5e97aaad57c4d99b0438ae7eba9c0002826f0a">JMH test included in the fix</a>, the only change is that I increased the number of threads from 1 to 16
and added a <code>main()</code> method for simple execution from an IDE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aside: This is a rather unscientific benchmark, I have other processes running on my desktop etc. Anyway, here is the setup: Ryzen 9950X, JDK main branch at commit <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/8ab7d3b89f656e5c">8ab7d3b89f656e5c</a>. For the "before" case, I reverted the fix rather than checking out an older revision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the result:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode      Cnt     Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  8912714    11.186 ± 0.006  us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample              2.000          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample             10.272          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample             17.984          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample             20.832          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample             27.552          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample             56.768          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample             79.709          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample           1179.648          us/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>We can see that a single invocation took 11 microseconds on average and the median was about 10 microseconds per invocation.</p>
<p>The CPU profile looks like this:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="CPU profile before the fix" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/before.svg" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom, open in a new tab for interactivity</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The CPU profile confirms that each invocation of <code>getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code> does multiple syscalls. In fact, most of the CPU time
is spent in syscalls. We can see files being opened and closed. Closing alone results in multiple syscalls, including futex locks.</p>
<p>Let's see the benchmark result with the fix applied:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode       Cnt     Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  11037102     0.279 ± 0.001  us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample               0.070          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample               0.310          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample               0.440          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample               0.530          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample               0.610          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample               1.030          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample               3.088          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample            1230.848          us/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The average went down from 11 microseconds to 279 nanos. This means the latency of the fixed version is 40x lower
than the old version. While this is not a 400x improvement, it's within the 30x - 400x range from the original report. Chances are
the delta would be higher with a different setup.
Let's have a look at the new profile:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="CPU profile after the fix" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/after.svg" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom, open in a new tab for interactivity</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The profile is much cleaner. There is just a single syscall. If the profile is to be trusted then most of the time is spent in JVM, outside of the kernel.</p>

<p>Barely. The bit encoding is stable. It hasn't changed in 20 years, but you won't find it in the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/clock_gettime"><code>clock_gettime(2)</code> man page</a>.
The closest thing to official documentation is the kernel source itself, in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4702f4eceb639b6af199151e352e570943619d98/kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c"><code>kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c</code></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eee51b0ae5c52a77ed65ad59b55002d1397b40d5/include/linux/posix-timers_types.h"><code>CPUCLOCK_*</code> macros</a>.</p>
<p>The kernel's policy is clear: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">don't break userspace</a>.</p>

<p>My take: If <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/bd569425330c6f5644c232b4b253e9ab905fcdba/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/kernel-posix-cpu-timers.h">glibc depends on it</a>, it's not going away.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-further"><a href="#pushing-further">Pushing Further</a></h2>
<p>When looking at profiler data from the 'after' run, I spotted a further optimization opportunity: A good portion of the remaining syscall is spent inside a radix tree lookup. Have a look:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="Zoomed-in CPU profile showing radix tree lookup" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/radix.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When the JVM calls <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code>, it receives a <code>clockid</code> that encodes the thread's ID. When this <code>clockid</code> is passed to <code>clock_gettime()</code>,
the kernel extracts the thread ID and performs a radix tree lookup to find the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/8ec7c826d97b390879df2a03dfb035c70af86779/include/linux/pid.h#L57"><code>pid</code> structure</a> associated with that ID.</p>
<p>However, the Linux kernel has a fast-path. If the encoded PID in the <code>clockid</code> is 0, the kernel interprets this as "the current thread" and skips the radix tree lookup entirely, jumping to the current task's structure directly.</p>
<p>The OpenJDK fix currently obtains the specific TID, flips the bits, and passes it to <code>clock_gettime()</code>. This forces the kernel to take the "generalized path" (the radix tree lookup).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4702f4eceb639b6af199151e352e570943619d98/kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c#L57-L95">source code</a> looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>/*</span></p><p><span> * Functions for validating access to tasks.</span></p><p><span> */</span></p><p><span>static struct pid *pid_for_clock(const clockid_t clock, bool gettime)</span></p><p><span>{</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>  /*</span></p><p><span>  * If the encoded PID is 0, then the timer is targeted at current</span></p><p><span>  * or the process to which current belongs.</span></p><p><span>  */</span></p><p><span>  if (upid == 0)</span></p><p><span>      // the fast path: current task lookup, cheap</span></p><p><span>      return thread ? task_pid(current) : task_tgid(current);</span></p><p><span>  // the generalized path: radix tree lookup, more expensive</span></p><p><span>  pid = find_vpid(upid);</span></p><p><span>  [...]</span></p></pre></div>
<p>If the JVM constructed the entire <code>clockid</code> manually with PID=0 encoded (rather than obtaining the <code>clockid</code> via <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code>), the kernel could take the fast-path and avoid the radix tree lookup altogether.
The JVM already pokes bits in the <code>clockid</code>, so constructing it entirely from scratch wouldn't be a bigger leap compatibility-wise.</p>
<p>Let's try it!</p>
<p>First, a refresher on the <code>clockid</code> encoding. The <code>clockid</code> is constructed like this:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>clockid for TID=42, user-time-only:</span></p><p><span>  1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1110_1010_1101</span></p><p><span>  └───────────────~42────────────────┘│└┘</span></p><p><span>                                      │ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)</span></p><p><span>                                      └─── 1 = per-thread</span></p></pre></div>
<p>For the current thread, we want PID=0 encoded, which gives <code>~0</code> in the upper bits:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>  1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1101</span></p><p><span>  └─────────────── ~0 ───────────────┘│└┘</span></p><p><span>                                      │ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)</span></p><p><span>                                      └─── 1 = per-thread</span></p></pre></div>
<p>We can translate this into C++ as follows:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>// Linux Kernel internal bit encoding for dynamic CPU clocks:</span></p><p><span>// [31:3] : Bitwise NOT of the PID or TID (~0 for current thread)</span></p><p><span>// [2]    : 1 = Per-thread clock, 0 = Per-process clock</span></p><p><span>// [1:0]  : Clock type (0 = PROF, 1 = VIRT/User-only, 2 = SCHED)</span></p><p><span>static_assert(sizeof(clockid_t) == 4, "Linux clockid_t must be 32-bit");</span></p><p><span>constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME = static_cast&lt;clockid_t&gt;(~0u &lt;&lt; 3 | 4 | 1);</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And then make a tiny teensy change to <code>user_thread_cpu_time()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time(bool user_sys_cpu_time) {</span></p><p><span>  if (user_sys_cpu_time) {</span></p><p><span>    return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);</span></p><p><span>  } else {</span></p><p><span>   - return user_thread_cpu_time(Thread::current());</span></p><p><span>   + return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME);</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/compare/master...jerrinot:jdk:jh_faster_getCurrentThreadUserTime?diff=unified&amp;w">change above</a> is sufficient to make <code>getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code> use the fast-path in the kernel.</p>
<p>Given that we are in nanoseconds territory already, we tweak the test a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the iteration and fork count</li>
<li>Use just a single thread to minimize noise</li>
<li>Switch to nanos</li>
</ul>
<p>The benchmark changes are meant to eliminate noise from the rest of my system and get a more precise measurement of the small delta we expect:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>@State(Scope.Benchmark)</span></p><p><span>@Warmup(iterations = 4, time = 5)</span></p><p><span>@Measurement(iterations = 10, time = 5)</span></p><p><span>@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SampleTime)</span></p><p><span>@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)</span></p><p><span>@Threads(1)</span></p><p><span>@Fork(value = 3)</span></p><p><span>public class ThreadMXBeanBench {</span></p><p><span>    static final ThreadMXBean mxThreadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();</span></p><p><span>    static long user; // To avoid dead-code elimination</span></p><p><span>    @Benchmark</span></p><p><span>    public void getCurrentThreadUserTime() throws Throwable {</span></p><p><span>        user = mxThreadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();</span></p><p><span>    }</span></p><p><span>    public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {</span></p><p><span>        Options opt = new OptionsBuilder()</span></p><p><span>                .include(ThreadMXBeanBench.class.getSimpleName())</span></p><p><span>                .build();</span></p><p><span>        new Runner(opt).run();</span></p><p><span>    }</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The version currently in JDK main branch gives:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode      Cnt       Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  4347067      81.746 ± 0.510  ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample               69.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample               80.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample               90.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample               90.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample               90.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample              230.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample             1980.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample           653312.000          ns/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>With the manual <code>clockid</code> construction, which uses the kernel fast-path, we get:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode      Cnt       Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  5081223      70.813 ± 0.325  ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample               59.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample               70.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample               70.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample               70.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample               80.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample              170.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample             1830.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample           425472.000          ns/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The average went down from 81.7 ns to 70.8 ns, so about a 13% improvement. The improvements are visible across all percentiles as well.
Is it worth the loss of clarity from constructing the <code>clockid</code> manually rather than using <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code>?
I am not entirely sure. The absolute gain is small and makes additional assumptions about kernel internals, including the size of <code>clockid_t</code>. On the other hand, it's still a gain without any downside in practice. <em>(famous last words...)</em></p>
<h2 id="browsing-for-gems"><a href="#browsing-for-gems">Browsing for Gems</a></h2>
<p>This is why I like browsing commits of large open source projects. A 40-line deletion eliminated a 400x performance gap. The fix required no new kernel features, just knowledge of a stable-but-obscure Linux ABI detail.</p>
<p>The lessons:</p>
<p><strong>Read the kernel source.</strong> POSIX tells you what's portable. The kernel source code tells you what's possible. Sometimes there's a 400x difference between the two. Whether it is worth exploiting is a different question.</p>
<p><strong>Check the old assumptions.</strong> The <code>/proc</code> parsing approach made sense when it was written, before anyone realized it could be exploited this way. Assumptions get baked into code. Revisiting them occasionally pays off.</p>
<p>The change landed on December 3, 2025. Just one day before the <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/26/">JDK 26 feature freeze</a>. If you're using <code>ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code>, JDK 26 (releasing March 2026) brings you a free 30-400x speedup!</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <i>1/14/2026</i>
    
    <p>I am an LLM productivity skeptic.</p>
<p>I find LLMs useful as a sort of digital clerk - searching the web for me, finding documentation, looking up algorithms. I even find them useful<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> in a limited coding capacity; with a small context and clear guidelines.</p>
<p>But doing "prompt-driven development" or "vibe coding" with an Agentic LLM was an incredibly disapointing experience for me. It required an immense amount of baby sitting, for small code changes, made slowly, which were often wrong. All the while I sat there feeling dumber and dumber, as my tokens drained away.</p>
<p>Of course that was <em>my</em> experience, and <em>my</em> preference. I genuinely don't mind if other people vibe code. Go for it! I do not deny this kind of coding is enabling a lot of people - who aren't experienced devs - to create things they would never otherwise be able to create. (Also, sometimes they pay me to clean them up afterwards, which is nice.)</p>
<p>But that is not enough for the vocal proponents. It's the future! You'll be left behind! Software has changed forever! And then, inevitably, comes the character evaluation, which goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You - a senior dev - are resisting this change due to deeply held psychological fears of being made irrelevant and/or having to learn new things. You are stuck in your ways and unwilling to change them because you are afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has always baffled me, because quite frankly I <em>like</em> the idea of agentic coding. I often feel the actual implementation is a bottleneck to the things I want to create. I would love it if I could just sit around making specs (yes I am a programmer who enjoys this) and have little machines implement it for me perfectly. It's a wonderful fantasy world, and I wish I could inhabit it. That's why I was so disappointed.</p>
<p>And it made me think - why are these people so insistent, and hostile? Why can't they live and let live? Why do they need to convince the rest of us? And to be honest, I am developing my own character evaluation. It's not very charitable, but it is making a lot of sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You tried agentic coding. You realised it was better at programming than you are. You see a lot of accomplished, prominent developers<sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> claiming they are more productive without it. Could they just be that much better at programming than I am? No! They are just threatened. They are the ones who are insecure! I'm a great developer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's projection. Their evangelism is born of insecurity.</p>
<h2>An Open Question</h2>
<p>I am still willing to admit I am wrong. That I'm not holding the agents properly. That doing this is it's own skill and I have not spent enough time with it. I have changed my mind on tech before, and I'm sure I will do so again.</p>
<p>LLM evangelists - are you willing to admit that you just might not be that good at programming computers? Maybe you once were. Maybe you never were.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    <div>
      <p>We get asked about AI a lot. Whether we’re going to add it to Yarn Spinner, whether we use it ourselves, what we think about it. Fair questions. Time to write it all down.</p>
<p>Yarn Spinner doesn’t use the technology that’s currently being called AI. We don’t have generative AI features in the product, and we don’t use code generation tools to build it, and we don’t accept contributions we know contain generated material. Let’s talk about why.</p>
<p>TL;DR: AI companies make tools for hurting people and we don’t want to support that.</p>
<h2 id="the-past">The Past</h2>
<p>A little history first. We come from a background that did a decent amount of work with AI and ML (terms we shouldn’t but will use interchangeably because everyone else does).</p>
<p>We gave talks about it for game developers and non-programmers. We wrote little ML bots for games. We did research and academic work. We wrote books<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> about using ML in games, mostly for procedural animation. It was a fun series of techniques to explore, and explore we did.</p>
<p><img src="https://yarnspinner.dev/images/oreilly-ai-ml-books.png" alt="O’Reilly books on AI and ML that we wrote"></p>
<p>When we started at university, neural networks and deep learning (the main underlying techniques most AI products use today) were just too slow and hard to work with. By the time we finished our doctorates, that had changed. Tools like TensorFlow made this stuff easier and fun, and the increase in GPU access made training and inference possible for people without Big Tech budgets. For quite a while, we were genuinely excited about the potential.</p>
<p>Then things started to change.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say exactly when. Maybe it was always like this and we just didn’t see it. But by the end of 2020 (a year famous for absolutely nothing world changing whatsoever happening /s) it was clear that the AI we liked was not what the tech companies were interested in. They were increasingly about generative imagery, chatbots writing your material for you, and summaries of art instead of exposure to it. Efforts to mitigate known problems (reinforcing cultural biases, being difficult to make deterministic or explainable) were disparaged and diminished. Researchers and developers who raised concerns were being fired.</p>
<p>Things have only gotten worse since.</p>
<p>If you look at what AI companies promote now, it’s not what we wanted. When you boil down everything they say and strip it right back, what they make are tools to either fire people or demand more work without hiring anyone new to help. That’s the problem AI companies want to solve.</p>
<p>Anything else they achieve is a happy accident on the road to firing as many of your friends and colleagues as possible.</p>
<p>AI is now a tool for firing people, in a time when getting re-employed is especially difficult and being unemployed can be life-threatening. We don’t want to be part of that. Until this is fixed we won’t use AI in our work, nor integrate it into Yarn Spinner for others to use.</p>
<p>We don’t want to support the companies making these tools or normalise their behaviour. So we don’t.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>There’s a comment we see every so often, always phrased as a <em>fait accompli</em>: “you’ll be left behind if you don’t adopt AI”, or its cousin, “everyone is using it”. We disagree.</p>
<p>This isn’t the right approach regardless of our opinions on AI. It’s tool driven development. The goal should never be “we use this tool”. It should be “how do we help you make better games?”.</p>
<p>Great games are made when people are passionate about an idea and push it into existence. Often this means reduction, not addition. Changing ideas. Keeping yourself and colleagues healthy. Being willing to adapt and take feedback. Good tools need to do the same.</p>
<p>We’re constantly asking “how would this help make better games?” and following where that leads. The exploration matters, and most of the time we find an idea doesn’t survive even a little scrutiny. We’d rather have fewer polished features that solve real problems than a load of garbage that exists for the sake of marketing copy.</p>
<p>We’re proud of Yarn Spinner. We don’t think it’s a coincidence it’s used in <a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/showcase/">so many games</a>. Our process works, and we’re always adding new features. We also change and remove features if they don’t meet the needs of devs. We’re always chatting, internally and with other game devs and even non-devs, about potential ideas and approaches. We’re going to keep asking “how would this help make better games?” and ship what survives that gauntlet.</p>
<p>Who knows. Maybe the world will change and we can take another look at ML.</p>
<h2 id="likely-to-be-frequently-asked-questions">Likely to be Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Why do you only care about people getting fired? I read that AI is also bad for SOME OTHER REASON!</strong> There are so many issues AI (and in particular the companies making it) have. Some are potential or even hypothetical concerns that might eventuate. Some are very real and happening right now in front of our eyes. Some are <strong>much</strong> worse than people being fired. Some of these worse issues appeared between us starting this blog post and publishing it. If the labour concerns around AI suddenly vanished, there are still many issues we’d need to see fixed before we’d be comfortable using it. But it’s stronger to argue a single point at a time. The labour concerns can be fixed and should be pushed back on. Once that’s sorted we can look at the next issue.</p>
<p><strong>Why don’t you do ML correctly so no one gets hurt?</strong> Given our background and experience, we probably could make our own AI tooling in a way we feel is helpful, ethical, and doesn’t fund companies we disagree with. Two problems with this. First, these things take a lot of time to make, and like we said, most ideas don’t survive initial exploration. It would be very difficult to balance exploring an idea while also building new models to test it. Second, while we could make our own tools, most people can’t. If they saw us using a technique and wanted to try it, they’d end up supporting the very companies we object to. We don’t want to normalise it, so we have to not use it.</p>
<p><strong>My boss wants me to use AI for work, am I part of the problem?</strong> Getting and keeping a job is a necessity, and this has only gotten worse recently. If you can push back on this, do. But no one will fault you for wanting to keep your job.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to ban people who use AI from using Yarn Spinner?</strong> No. While we wish you didn’t use it, we get this is <em>our</em> line in the sand, not yours. We’ll still advocate against these tools and we’re still concerned about the harm they do. You need to realise that if you use them, you’re both financially and socially supporting dodgy companies doing dodgy things. They will use your support to push their agenda. If these tools are working for you, we’re genuinely pleased. But please also stop using them.</p>
<p><strong>I kinda like using AI and no one at my work is getting fired?</strong> This comment pops up a few times, often from programmers. Unfortunately, because of how messy the term AI now is, the same concerns still apply. Your adoption helps promote the companies making these tools. People see you using it and force it onto others at the studio, or at other workplaces entirely. From what we’ve seen, this is followed by people getting fired and overworked. If it isn’t happening to you and your colleagues, great. But you’re still helping it happen elsewhere. And as we said, even if you fixed the labour concerns tomorrow, there are still many other issues. There’s more than <em>just</em> being fired to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>Are you zealots or luddites who just hate AI?</strong> Nah. Just upset at the people making these things. There’s great potential in AI and machine learning, and it’s being squandered to make already dodgy rich people richer and more dodgy. We still keep up with developments because we hope one day we can explore it again. But for now, the people pushing these tools aren’t people we want to give money or support to.</p>

<p>In the past few months the MetaBrainz team has been fighting a battle against unscrupulous AI companies ignoring common courtesies (such as robots.txt) and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/29/ai_web_crawlers_are_destroying/">scraping the Internet in order to build up their AI models</a>. Rather than downloading our dataset in one complete download, they insist on loading all of MusicBrainz <strong>one page at a time</strong>. This of course would take hundreds of years to complete and is utterly pointless. In doing so, they are overloading our servers and preventing legitimate users from accessing our site.</p>
<p>Now the AI scrapers have found ListenBrainz and are hitting a number of our API endpoints for their nefarious data gathering purposes. In order to protect our services from becoming overloaded, we’ve made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/api/metadata.html#post--1-metadata-lookup-">/metadata/lookup</a> API endpoints (GET and POST versions) now require the caller to send an <a href="https://listenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/api/index.html#authentication">Authorization token</a> in order for this endpoint to work.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://labs.api.listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz Labs API</a> endpoints for mbid-mapping, mbid-mapping-release and mbid-mapping-explain have been removed. Those were always intended for debugging purposes and will also soon be replaced with a new endpoints for our upcoming improved mapper.</li>
<li>LB Radio will now require users to be logged in to use it (and API endpoint users will need to send the Authorization header). The error message for logged in users is a bit clunky at the moment; we’ll fix this once we’ve finished the work for this year’s Year in Music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for these hassles and no-notice changes, but they were required in order to keep our services functioning at an acceptable level.</p>

He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators.
