<p>N.B. I'm in a mood tonight, so this will be less of a well-considered essay and more of a rant, partially in the vein of <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf"><em>Fuck Nuance</em></a>. Don't take anything here <em>too</em> seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Why does nobody care about anything?</strong> The world is full of stuff that could be excellent with just 1% more effort. But people don't care.</p>
<p>Have been to the DMV? It sucked? There is a human being whose job it is to be in charge of the DMV. They do not care that it sucks.</p>
<p>Ever used a piece of software that's buggy as hell, looks bad, but still costs money, presumably because the company behind it has found some regulatory capture to justify their existence? The programmer who wrote it probably doesn't care. Their manager definitely doesn't care. The regulators don't care.</p>
<p>You might think "something something incentive systems". No. At my big tech job I had the pleasure of interviewing a few programmers who worked for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Systems">a large healthcare company that engages in regulatory capture</a>. Let me assure you: They. Do. Not Care.</p>
<p>I've met a few people that work for municipal governments. Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>Here's a dumb example. This bike lane ends at the bottom of a hill near me. It merges onto the sidewalk at a crazy sharp angle. Cyclists are coming down this hill at 20mph or so. Tons of people can't make this angle at that speed and hit the vertical curb face, damaging their bike and injuring themselves. If they're unlucky, they go flying into the signpost.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/7811f103-f2e7-4f31-9291-e5cbd0df8d69.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why does this ramp suck so much? For literally the exact same effort it took to build, it could have been built 10x better. Make the angle 20 degrees instead of 70. Put the ramp just after the sign instead of just before it. Make the far curb face sloped instead of vertical. Put some visual indication the lane ends 50 feet uphill. Why wasn't this done?</p>
<p><strong>Because the engineer who designed it and the managers at the department of transportation do not give a shit</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't even a pro- or anti-bikes thing. The ramp was getting built by whatever mandate. You're the engineer. Do you make it bad, or do you spend 1% more time thinking about it and make it good for literally the same cost? You make it bad, because you do not care.</p>
<p>I actually pointed this ramp out to the director of the Seattle Department of Transportation during a walking tour. He made a note of it over a year ago that I assume was promptly forgotten about. He does not care.</p>
<p>Here's another example. Street lights. Seattle has been engaging in a program to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_street_light#Health_concerns">reduce everyone's natural melatonin production up to 5x</a> by replacing the sodium lights with harsh-white LEDs.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/cf8cbb5d-6112-452a-8c99-14f010daeaa9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These new lights objectively suck to anyone not driving. If your house is near one, they suck. If you're walking your dog at night (which starts at 5PM for much of the year in Seattle), they <em>really</em> suck.</p>
<p>But whoever made the decision to switch the lights does not care. It's entirely possible they don't even live in the city, but instead live in a pleasant exurb. Or maybe they don't walk at night and have never considered that other people do.</p>
<p>White LEDs reduce car crashes by 0.1% and that is measurable, but sleep quality and aesthetics are not measurable. You just have to care about them. And nobody cares.</p>
<p>But that's enough city stuff. Plenty of people don't care about plenty of other things.</p>
<p>You put on your turn signal in traffic to merge. The person who could let you in is looking straight ahead, zoned out. Why would they look around to see if they could cooperate with anyone? They're already in the lane they need to be in. They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>You're at the airport. There's a group in front of you on the escalator taking up the full width, preventing anyone from walking by. They do not care.</p>
<p>You're on the sidewalk and someone has headphones in, walking in the center of the path. A mom and stroller are behind them. They can't hear her "excuse me" to get their attention. They have not even considered the possibility that anyone in the world exists but them. They do not care.</p>
<p>The McDonalds touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.</p>
<p>At work the junior engineer sends you some code to review. The code was clearly written in a first draft, and then just iteratively patched until the tests passed, then immediately sent to you to review without any further improvement. They do not care.</p>
<p>The guy on the hiking trail is playing his shitty EDM on his bluetooth speaker, ruining nature for everyone else. He does not care.</p>
<p>The doctor misdiagnosis your illness whose symptoms are in the first paragraph of the trivially googleable wikipedia article. He does not care.</p>
<p>People don't pick up after their dogs. The guy at the gym doesn't re-rack the weights. The lady at the grocery store leaves the cart in the middle of the parking lot. They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>I could continue in this vein for another few pages, but it would be boring at you get the point. We are surrounded by antisocial bastards.</p>
<p>Some of them like the people who don't pick up after their dogs are legitimately just assholes.</p>
<p>Others, like the bureaucrats in the city who mess up our lives in more indirect ways are more a victim of The System. But they are still guilty of lacking the personal agency to fight it or leave in protest, and I still — potentially unjustly — condemn them.</p>
<p>We have examples like Elon who, through sheer force of will, defeat armies of people who don't care. For his many faults, you can't say the man doesn't care.</p>
<p>When I <em>joined</em> my former Big Tech job, everyone cared. Over time, <a href="https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/incentives-as-selection-effects/">incentives attracted</a> a different set of people who didn't care as much. Eventually those people became the majority. It's painful to work with people who don't care if you care a lot, and eventually I left because of it.</p>
<p>Now, I'm at a small startup full of people who care. Customer bug reports go right to our chatroom. We fix them immediately. I feel guilty I wrote the bugs at all. We reach out to users to see if we can make their lives better. We care.</p>
<p>I want to live in a community where everyone cares.</p>
<p>The one place in the world you get this vibe is probably Japan. Most people just <em>really care</em>. Patrick McKenzie refers to this as <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11+nice+things"><em>the will to have nice things</em></a>. Japan has it, and the US mostly does not.</p>
<p>In Japan, you get the impression that everyone takes their job and role in society seriously. The median Japanese 7-11 clerk takes their job more seriously than the median US city bureaucrat. And the result is obvious if you visit both places.</p>
<p>Is it possible for us to care in the US? To foster the will to have nice things? I think we actually had this in the aftermath of WW2. The country was mostly on the same page about progress, values, the future. But over a few generations, more and more people defect. Living among defectors is demoralizing and causes more defections (much like my own departure from my Big Tech job!). Eventually society is full of defectors.</p>
<p>But I don't think this is a full explanation. Most people aren't <em>assholes</em>, they merely won't go <em>out of their way</em> to add to the world. And I can feel myself getting pulled in that direction.</p>
<p>I used to go a lot more out of my way to add to the world. A few years ago, <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1742621644022305246">I installed</a> a bunch of dog bag dispensers on the telephone poles of my neighborhood. I still keep them stocked.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/088bdb08-d0aa-449c-8727-ba41bad8e5c1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was, somewhat naively, hoping that somehow I could get a snowball of care going. I built curb ramps on legacy curbs that lacked them. I lobbied the city to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dGoH7hL9ytXKNXaRA">open new park space</a>. Improve crosswalks. And much more!</p>
<p>But the snowball never started. Nobody cares. Rather, there is a tiny minority of activists who care. They spend all their free time doing activist stuff — basically fighting the city to try to make the bureaucrats care about little bits here and there.</p>
<p>But I've come to accept that I just don't have the disposition to fight all the time. I'm not a fighter. I care <em>a lot</em> and I just want to live in a place where other people care.</p>
<p>We're not going to move to Japan, but would absolutely be willing to move within the US.</p>
<p>Does such a community really exist? Where <em>everyone</em> cares? Or at least a supermajority? Or does it need to be built?</p>

			<p>The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is widely considered to be a dry and unemotional document. Published by the <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/why-lane-markings-disappear-in-the-rain-and-why-glow-in-the-dark-lines-never-work/">Department of Transportation</a>, it outlines the basic specifications of all the street signs you could expect to see out on roads and highways across the United States. Most are familiar, but if you dive deeper into its pages, you can find some unsettling relics from darker times.</p>
<p>Back in the mid-20th century, America was tangling with the realities of nuclear war. Top generals contemplated targeting strategies, while engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself.</p><div>
<p><img src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/vidframe_min_top1.png" alt="Vidframe Min Top" width="800" height="26"></p>
<p><img src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/vidframe_min_bottom1.png" alt="Vidframe Min Bottom" width="800" height="26"></p></div>

<p>Against this bleak backdrop, government administrators turned to the concept of Civil Defense. The idea was to do whatever could be done to protect the citizens of the nation from the horrors of nuclear war and its immediate aftermath. In turn, the Department of Transport worked up some rather depressing road signs to help people get where they needed to be in these bleak and trying times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_175639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175639"><a href="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959.png" alt="stop sign and speed sign" width="876" height="627" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959.png 876w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959-300x215.png 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-175639"><em>In this case, “emergency” means “nuclear apocalypse.”</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip open the 1961 edition of the MUTCD, and you’ll find an important section on Civil Defense. It featured a handful of designs for traffic management in a post-nuclear world. Perhaps most interesting was the “MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED” sign, designated CD-4. It’s purpose was highly unique:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED” sign may be used on highways where radiological contamination is such as to limit the permissable exposure time for occupants of vehicles passing through the area. Since any speed zoning would be impractical under such emergency conditions, no minimum speed limit can be prescribed by the sign in numerical terms. Where traffic is supervised by a traffic regulation post, official instructions will usually be given verbally, and the sign will serve as an occasional reminder of the urgent need for all reasonable speed.</p></blockquote>

You really wouldn’t want to be the person sent out to stand there long enough to bolt it up. Base image credit: depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, if you saw this sign, you’re supposed to be gunning it as fast as you can while still staying on the road. The intention is to limit your exposure to radiation as much as possible while traveling through contaminated areas.</p>

<p>The 1971 edition of the MUTCD expanded further on the Civil Defense section. The DOT had by this time developed a standardized sign for marking directions to fallout shelters, where citizens could wait out radioactive contamination falling from the sky after a nuclear attack. The document also specified a sign for decontamination centers, where those suffering radiation exposure might be treated by experienced personnel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_175636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175636"><a href="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-173602.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-173602.png" alt="fallout shelter sign" width="949" height="599" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-173602.png 949w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-173602-300x189.png 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-173602-768x485.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-175636"><em>The Fallout Shelter sign, as shown in MUTCD, 1971 edition.</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Further signs in this series include the “AREA CLOSED” sign used to designate areas of high radiological or biological contamination that are too unsafe for travel. The DOT also specified a blue “Evacuation Route” sign marked with the Civil Defense logo. It was intended to guide citizens to safety along pre-planned routes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Department of Transport prepared these signs for when things really hit the fan. Thankfully, the worst fears of the Cold War never came to pass, and these signs weren’t needed in any major emergency situation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_175642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175642"><a href="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421.png" alt="evacuation route sign " width="882" height="713" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421.png 882w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421-300x243.png 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421-768x621.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-175642"><em>The “AREA CLOSED” sign is impressively tame. You’d think it would be covered in nuclear warning symbols or something.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And yet! Some of these signs persist in the MUTCD standard to the day. The most <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/11th_Edition/Chapter2hthu2n.pdf">recent edition</a> still includes some of these signs—like EM4-1b ‘FALLOUT SHELTER’—but now places them under the category of Emergency Management signs. The bleak term of “Civil Defense” is no longer very relevant in government administrative circles.</p>
<p>Us car enthusiasts do like driving fast. Still, when the government has put out a sign telling you to floor it, you know the situation has to be dire. In the end, most of these signs have never been put to use, and that’s something we can all be thankful for. Regardless, the Department of Transport stands ready with signage prepared to deal with whatever might happen down the line.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://www.rqlite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/j.png" alt="" width="131" height="126"></a></strong><a href="https://www.rqlite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rqlite</a> is a lightweight, open-source, distributed relational database built on <a href="http://sqlite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raft</a>. With its <a href="https://philipotoole.com/replicating-sqlite-using-raft-consensus/">origins dating back to 2014</a>, its <a href="https://rqlite.io/docs/design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design</a> has always prioritized reliability, and quality. The robustness of rqlite is also a testament to its disciplined testing strategy: after more than 10 years of development and deployments, users have reported fewer than 10 instances of <a href="https://gobyexample.com/panic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panics</a> in production.</p>
<p>Testing a distributed system like rqlite is no small feat. It requires careful consideration of various layers: from individual components to the entire system in operation. Let’s explore how rqlite is tested, following its philosophy of maintaining quality without unnecessary complexity.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Testing Pyramid: An Effective Approach</h3>
<p><a href="https://philipotoole.com/2021-rqlite-cmu-tech-talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sloc-test-300x257.png" alt="" width="300" height="257" srcset="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sloc-test-300x257.png 300w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sloc-test.png 668w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>Testing rqlite adheres to the well-known <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>testing pyramid</strong></a>, which prioritizes unit tests as the foundation, supported by integration tests, and capped with minimal end-to-end (E2E) tests. This strategy reflects decades of software development experience, ensuring test suites remain efficient, targeted, and easy to debug — and in my experience this approach <strong>works</strong>.</p>
<h4>Unit Testing: The Core of Quality</h4>
<p>At the base of the pyramid lies <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Arqlite%2Frqlite+path%3A*_test.go&amp;type=code" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>unit testing</strong></a>, covering isolated components. Unit testing dominates rqlite’s test suite because it offers the best balance of speed and precision. Given that rqlite’s database layer is built around SQLite, a “shared nothing” architecture, most database-related functionality can be reliably tested with unit tests.</p>
<p>Testing is a huge part of the design process. If a component cannot be unit-tested easily, it often signals issues with its design. A little dependency injection during testing is a good thing, but too much indicates an over-reliance on other components. And an emphasis on clean interfaces ensures that components remain focused on a single task.</p>
<p>As of version 8.34.0, <strong>the entire rqlite code base is approximately 75,000 lines long</strong> (including tests, but excluding imported packages). Of that rqlite’s unit test suite comprises <strong>27,000 lines of source code</strong>, making it the largest testing investment. Despite its breadth, the entire suite runs in just a few minutes, <a href="https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/rqlite/rqlite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enabling frequent testing</a> during development.</p>
<hr>
<h4>System-Level Testing: Validating Consensus</h4>
<p>Above unit testing lies <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v8.36.4/system_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>system-level testing</strong></a>, which focuses on the interplay between the Raft consensus module and SQLite. Distributed databases often rely on consensus for correctness, making this layer crucial. Tests in this category validate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication of SQLite statements across nodes.</li>
<li>Behavior of read operations at different consistency levels.</li>
<li>Resilience during cluster disruptions, such as node failures and subsequent recoveries, as well as Leader elections.</li>
</ul>
<p>System tests include both single-node and multi-node configurations, ensuring the database operates correctly under varying cluster conditions. As of version 8.34.0, approximate <strong>7000 lines of system-level tests</strong> <strong>exist</strong>, offering comprehensive coverage of these interactions.</p>
<hr>
<h4>End-to-End Testing: A Minimal Layer</h4>
<p>End-to-end testing in rqlite serves as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>smoke check</strong></a>, verifying that the system starts, clusters, and performs basic operations. Written in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v8.36.4/system_test/e2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these tests launch real rqlite clusters</a> to ensure “happy path” functionality, guarding against embarrassing issues like a cluster failing to start due to a bug in command-line flag parsing.</p>
<p>End-to-end tests are deliberately limited to scenarios that cannot be tested at lower levels. Over-reliance on end-to-end testing is avoided because debugging failures in such tests can become prohibitively costly. For instance, a misconfigured dependency deep in the stack might surface in an end-to-end test, but tracing the root cause would require navigating through numerous layers.</p>
<p>For version 8.340, only <strong>5000 lines of end-to-end tests</strong> <strong>exist</strong>, demonstrating a targeted approach.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Performance Testing: Pushing the Limits</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png" alt="" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">Beyond functional correctness, rqlite undergoes performance testing to evaluate its limits under load. These tests measure metrics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum INSERT rates.</li>
<li>Handling of concurrent queries.</li>
<li>Memory and disk usage during heavy operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A notable example involves testing with large SQLite databases, sometimes exceeding <strong>2GB</strong>. Such scenarios highlight bottlenecks like rqlite’s memory management or disk write latencies, which are intrinsic to its architecture. Generating such large datasets efficiently remains an ongoing challenge, with potential solutions involving prebuilt SQLite databases stored in cloud buckets.</p>
<p>Performance testing also ensures stability, identifying issues like <a href="https://philipotoole.com/plugging-a-memory-leak-in-rqlite/">memory leaks</a> or unexpected Leader elections under stress.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Testing rqlite has taught me valuable lessons, many of which resonate beyond database development:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Unit testing is the most effective way to build confidence in your system. If a bug exists, you’ll likely find it faster here than in an integration or E2E test.</li>
<li><strong>Be Deliberate:</strong> Adding tests at higher levels must be justified. Excessive integration or end-to-end tests can bog down development and debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt and Iterate:</strong> For example, performance tests revealed that <strong><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fsync</a> calls</strong> were the primary bottleneck, leading to further optimizations in disk usage – such as compressing Raft log entries before writing them to disk.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency Matters:</strong> With a suite that runs in a matter of minutes, I can iterate rapidly, a crucial advantage in maintaining an active open-source project.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Quality Matters</h3>
<p>By adhering to the testing pyramid and focusing on targeted, efficient tests, rqlite maintains high quality while minimizing overhead. Whether through unit tests for component reliability, system tests for distributed consensus, or end-to-end tests for sanity checks, every layer serves a purpose.</p>
<p>As rqlite continues to evolve, so will its testing practices. With distributed systems becoming increasingly complex, maintaining simplicity in testing will remain a cornerstone of its design philosophy. After all, the goal is not just to build a database but to build one that works reliably, and is easy to operate, in the real world.</p>

<p>WASM notebooks come with common Python packages installed, but you may need to
<a href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/wasm/#supported-packages">install additional packages using micropip</a>.</p>
<p>The obtained URL encodes your notebook code as a parameter, so it can be

<p>To view a notebook in read-only mode, with
code cells locked, append <code>&amp;mode=read</code> to your URL's list of query parameters
(or <code>?mode=read</code> if your URL doesn't have a query string).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?mode=read</code></li>
</ul>

<p>To hide the <code>marimo.app</code> header, append <code>&amp;embed=true</code> to your URL's list of query
parameters (or <code>?embed=true</code> if your URL doesn't have a query string).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?embed=true</code></li>
<li><code>https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?mode=read&amp;embed=true</code></li>

how to embed marimo notebooks in your own webpages.</p>
<h3 id="excluding-code">Excluding code<a href="#excluding-code" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, WASM notebooks expose your Python code to viewers. If you've
enabled read-only mode, you can exclude code with
<code>&amp;include-code=false</code>. If you want to include code but have it be hidden
by default, use the parameter <code>&amp;show-code=false</code>.</p>
<p>A sufficiently determined user would still be able
to obtain your code, so <strong>don't</strong> think of this as a security feature; instead,
think of it as an aesthetic or practical choice.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Apple is already testing the initial batch of processors produced for its devices by TSMC Arizona, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips" data-url="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Nikkei Asia. </a>To begin with, the tests intend to compare the Arizona output to see if the quality is similar to chips produced in TSMC’s cutting-edge fabs in Taiwan. If the chip quality verification testing does not encounter any hiccups, the source says that the first batch of mass-produced chips from the Arizona fab is expected to arrive at iDevice makers as early as this quarter. If this is the case, Apple will likely be TSMC’s first American customer to use locally made chips. AMD and Nvidia will likely follow suit soon, as they’re also running wafer test production there.</p><p>The entry of locally produced chips in the American market is a big win for the United States’ push for silicon independence, especially as it massively relies on Taiwan for the majority of its most advanced chips. Taiwan is located in a high-risk location, with the belligerent CCP-controlled China having the island in its sights. The island is also prone to natural disasters, which can disrupt semiconductor production and result in supply crunch situations.</p><p>However, even if Apple gives the go signal to TSMC and the latter starts making chips in Arizona, the processors still need to be shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until TSMC completes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-to-become-first-customer-for-amkors-dollar2-billion-arizona-chip-packaging-facility" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-to-become-first-customer-for-amkors-dollar2-billion-arizona-chip-packaging-facility">its facility in Peoria, Arizona</a>. But whatever the case, this is a significant push in the right direction for the U.S., especially as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-postpones-mass-production-at-arizona-fab-to-2025" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-postpones-mass-production-at-arizona-fab-to-2025">Arizona fab has been delayed</a> for about a year due to various issues. Aside from TSMC and Amkor, other suppliers to these companies, like LCY Chemical, are also setting up in Arizona. That way, they could stay near their client and simplify logistics.</p><p>Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/50-percent-of-tsmcs-arizona-employees-are-from-taiwan-despite-recent-controversies-company-plans-to-hire-more-us-workers-over-time" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/50-percent-of-tsmcs-arizona-employees-are-from-taiwan-despite-recent-controversies-company-plans-to-hire-more-us-workers-over-time">importing about half of its employees</a> from Taiwan, it seems that the common American is also slowly benefitting from TSMC’s presence in Arizona, especially as it’s reported that the company has started aggressive recruitment from American universities. It has also partnered with the Arizona State University for workforce development and research, helping drive American innovation.</p><p>After what seems to be its initial success with Apple, the Arizona fab is expected to output chips using more advanced technology. TSMC will produce 3nm chips in the U.S., and Taiwan has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/taiwanese-govt-clears-tsmc-to-make-2nm-chips-abroad-country-lowers-its-silicon-shield" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/taiwanese-govt-clears-tsmc-to-make-2nm-chips-abroad-country-lowers-its-silicon-shield">given TSMC the go-signal</a> to manufacture 2nm chips abroad. With the CHIPS and Science Act now bearing fruit, the U.S. could once again appear on the semiconductor production world map and give it more stability in its silicon supply chain.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-BCL5Yjuh2QQdA7CwKjWnX4"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

          <p>Texas has sued insurance provider Allstate, alleging that the firm and its data broker subsidiary used data from apps like GasBuddy, Routely, and Life360 to quietly track drivers and adjust or cancel their policies.</p>
<p>Allstate and Arity, a "mobility data and analytics" firm founded by Allstate in 2016, collected "trillions of miles worth of location data" from more than 45 million people, then used that data to adjust rates, according to Texas' lawsuit. This violates Texas' Data Privacy and Security Act, which requires "clear notice and informed consent" on how collected data can be used. A statement from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the suit is the first-ever state action targeting comprehensive data privacy violations.</p>
<p>“Our investigation revealed that Allstate and Arity paid mobile apps millions of dollars to install Allstate’s tracking software,” Paxton said in a statement. “The personal data of millions of Americans was sold to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent in violation of the law. Texans deserve better, and we will hold all these companies accountable.”</p>
<h2>Latitude, longitude, and future rates</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Allstate%20and%20Arity%20Petition%20Filed.pdf">Texas' complaint</a> (PDF), the data collected included "a phone's geolocation data, accelerometer data, magnetometer data, and gyroscopic data, which monitors details such as the phone's altitude, longitude, latitude, bearing, GPS time, speed, and accuracy."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article class="page" lang="en"><h2>The Shepherd 1.0.0 released!</h2><p lang="en">Ludovic Courtès — December 12, 2024</p><p>Finally, twenty-one years after its
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2003-04/msg00007.html">inception</a>
(twenty-one!), the Shepherd leaves <a href="https://0ver.org/">ZeroVer</a>
territory to enter a glorious 1.0 era.  This 1.0.0 release is published
today because we think Shepherd has become a solid tool, meeting user
experience standards one has come to expect since systemd changed the
game of free init systems and service managers alike.  It’s also a major
milestone for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, which has been relying on
the Shepherd from a time when doing so counted as <em>dogfooding</em>.</p><p>To celebrate this release, the amazing Luis Felipe López Acevedo
designed a new logo,
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/shepherd/graphics.git">available</a>
under CC-BY-SA, and the project got <a href="https://gnu.org/software/shepherd">a proper web
site</a>!</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/shepherd-logo.svg" alt="Logo of the Shepherd."></p><p>Let’s first look at what the Shepherd actually <em>is</em> and what it can
do for you.</p><h2>At a glance</h2><p>The Shepherd is a minimalist but featureful service manager and as such,
it <em>herds services</em>: it keeps track of services, their state and their
dependencies, and it can start, stop, and restart them when needed.
It’s a simple job; doing it right and providing users with insight and
control over services is a different story.</p><p>The Shepherd consists of two commands: <code>shepherd</code> is the daemon that
manages services, and <code>herd</code> is the command that lets you interact with
it to inspect and control the status of services.  The <code>shepherd</code>
command can run as the first process (PID&nbsp;1) and serve as the “init
system”, as is the case on <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Getting-Started-with-the-System.html">Guix
System</a>;
or it can manage services for unprivileged users, as is the case with
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html">Guix
Home</a>.
For example, running <code>herd status ntpd</code> as root allows me to know what
the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon is up to:</p><pre><code>$ sudo herd status ntpd
● Status of ntpd:
  It is running since Fri 06 Dec 2024 02:08:08 PM CET (2 days ago).
  Main PID: 11359
  Command: /gnu/store/s4ra0g0ym1q1wh5jrqs60092x1nrb8h9-ntp-4.2.8p18/bin/ntpd -n -c /gnu/store/7ac2i2c6dp2f9006llg3m5vkrna7pjbf-ntpd.conf -u ntpd -g
  It is enabled.
  Provides: ntpd
  Requires: user-processes networking
  Custom action: configuration
  Will be respawned.

and I can open <code>/var/log/ntpd.log</code> to view more.  Running <code>herd stop ntpd</code> would terminate the <code>ntpd</code> process, and there’s also a <code>start</code> and
a <code>restart</code> action.</p><p>Services can also have <em>custom actions</em>; in the example above, we see
there’s a <code>configuration</code> action.  As it turns out, that action is a
handy way to get the file name of the <code>ntpd</code> configuration file:</p><pre><code>$ head -2 $(sudo herd configuration ntpd)
driftfile /var/run/ntpd/ntp.drift
pool 2.guix.pool.ntp.org iburst</code></pre><p>Of course a typical system runs quite a few services, many of which
depend on one another.  The <code>herd graph</code> command returns a
representation of that <em>service dependency graph</em> that can be piped to
<code>dot</code> or <code>xdot</code> to visualize it; here’s what I get on my laptop:</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/service-graph.svg" alt="Example of a service dependency graph."></p><p>It’s quite a big graph (you can zoom in for details!) but we can learn a
few things from it.  Each node in the graph is a service; rectangles are
for “regular” services (typically daemons like <code>ntpd</code>), round nodes
correspond to <em>one-shot services</em> (services that perform one action and
immediately stop), and diamonds are for <em>timed services</em> (services that
execute code periodically).</p><h2>Blurring the user/developer line</h2><p>A unique feature of the Shepherd is that you configure and extend it in
its own implementation language: in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile">Guile
Scheme</a>.  That does <em>not</em> mean you
need to be an expert in that programming language to get started.
Instead, we try to make sure anyone can start simple for their
configuration file and gradually get to learn more if and when they feel
the need for it.  With this approach, we <em>keep the user in the loop</em>,
<a href="https://www.wingolog.org/archives/2011/10/19/the-user-in-the-loop">as Andy Wingo put
it</a>.</p><p>A Shepherd configuration file is a Scheme snippet that goes like this:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>register-services</span>
  <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>service</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span><span>)</span> <span>…</span><span>)</span>
        <span>…</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>start-in-the-background</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span> <span>…</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Here we define <code>ntpd</code> and get it started as soon as <code>shepherd</code> has read
the configuration file.  The ellipses can be filled in with more
services.</p><p>As an example, our <code>ntpd</code> service is defined like this:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>service</span>
  <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:documentation</span> <span>"Run the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon."</span>
  <span>#:requirement</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>user-processes</span> <span>networking</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:start</span> <span>(</span><span>make-forkexec-constructor</span>
           <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>"…/bin/ntpd"</span>
                 <span>"-n"</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>"/…/…-ntpd.conf"</span> <span>"-u"</span> <span>"ntpd"</span> <span>"-g"</span><span>)</span>
           <span>#:log-file</span> <span>"/var/log/ntpd.log"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:stop</span> <span>(</span><span>make-kill-destructor</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:respawn?</span> <span>#t</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The important parts here are <code>#:start</code> bit, which says how to start the
service, and <code>#:stop</code>, which says how to stop it.  In this case we’re
just spawning the <code>ntpd</code> program but other startup mechanisms are
supported by default: inetd, socket activation <em>à la</em> systemd, and
timers.  Check out the manual for
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Service-Examples.html">examples</a>
and a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Defining-Services.html">reference</a>.</p><p>There’s no limit to what <code>#:start</code> and <code>#:stop</code> can do.  In Guix System
you’ll find services that <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2017/running-system-services-in-containers/">run daemons in
containers</a>,
that mount/unmount file systems (as can be guessed from the graph
above), that set up/tear down a static networking configuration, and a
variety of other things.  The
<a href="https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/swineherd">Swineherd</a> project goes as
far as extending the Shepherd to turn it into a tool to manage system
containers—similar to what the Docker daemon does.</p><p>Note that when writing service definitions for Guix System and Guix
Home, you’re targeting a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Shepherd-Services.html">thin
layer</a>
above the Shepherd programming interface.  As is customary in Guix, this
is <em>multi-stage programming</em>: G-expressions specified in the <code>start</code> and
<code>stop</code> fields are staged and make it into the resulting Shepherd
configuration file.</p><h2>New since 0.10.x</h2><p>For those of you who were already using the Shepherd, here are the
highlights compared to the 0.10.x series:</p><ul><li>Support for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Timers.html"><em>timed
services</em></a>
has been added: these services spawn a command or run Scheme code
periodically according to a predefined calendar.</li><li><code>herd status SERVICE</code> now shows high-level information about
services (main PID, command, addresses it is listening to, etc.)
instead of its mere “running value”.  It also shows recently-logged
messages.</li><li>To make it easier to discover functionality, that command also
displays <em>custom actions</em> applicable to the service, if any.  It
also lets you know if a replacement is pending, in which case you
can restart the service to upgrade it.</li><li><code>herd status root</code> is no longer synonymous with <code>herd status</code>;
instead it shows information about the <code>shepherd</code> process itself.</li><li>On Linux, <code>reboot --kexec</code> lets you reboot straight into a new Linux
kernel previously loaded with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/kexec"><code>kexec --load</code></a>.</li></ul><p>The service collection has grown:</p><ul><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Log-Rotation-Service.html">log rotation
service</a>
is responsible for periodically rotating log files, compressing
them, and eventually deleting them.  It’s very much like similar log
rotation tools from the 80’s since <code>shepherd</code> logs to plain text
files like in the good ol’ days.</p><p>There’s a couple of be benefits that come from its integration into
the Shepherd.  First, it already knows all the files that services
log to, so no additional configuration is needed to teach it about
these files.  Second, log rotation is <em>race free</em>: no single line of
log can be lost in the process.</p></li><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/System-Log-Service.html">system log
service</a>
what’s traditionally devoted to a separate <code>syslogd</code> program.  The
advantage of having it in <code>shepherd</code> is that it can start logging
earlier and integrates nicely with the rest of the system.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Timer-Service.html">timer
service</a>
provides functionality similar to the venerable <code>at</code> command,
allowing you to run a command at a particular time:</p></li></ul><pre><code>herd schedule timer at 07:00 -- mpg123 alarm.mp3</code></pre><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Transient-Service-Maker.html">transient service
maker</a>
lets you run a command in the background as a transient service (it
is similar in spirit to the <code>systemd-run</code> command):</li></ul><pre><code>herd spawn transient -d $PWD -- make -j4</code></pre><ul><li>The GOOPS interface that was deprecated in 0.10.x <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Legacy-GOOPS-Interface.html">is now
gone</a>.</li></ul><p>As always, the <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/shepherd.git/tree/NEWS?id=dd911ac772989a7630b9f4d58f8b747cbc1c33fe"><code>NEWS</code>
file</a>
has additional details.</p><p>In the coming weeks, we will most likely gradually move service
definitions in Guix from
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Scheduled-Job-Execution.html#index-mcron_002dservice_002dtype">mcron</a>
to timed services and similarly replace
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Log-Rotation.html#index-rottlog_002dservice_002dtype">Rottlog</a>
and
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Base-Services.html#index-syslog_002dservice_002dtype"><code>syslogd</code></a>.
This should be an improvement for Guix users and system administrators!</p><h2>Cute code</h2><p>I did mention that the Shepherd is minimalist, and it really is: 7.4K
lines of Scheme, excluding tests, according to SLOCCount.  This is in
large part thanks to the use of a high-level memory-safe language and
due to the fact that it’s extensible—peripheral features can live
outside the Shepherd.</p><p>Significant benefits also come from the concurrency framework: the
<em>concurrent sequential processes</em> (CSP) model and
<a href="https://github.com/wingo/fibers">Fibers</a>.  Internally, the state of
each service <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Service-Internals.html">is encapsulated in a
fiber</a>.
Accessing a service’s state amounts to sending a message to its fiber.
This way to structure code is itself very much inspired by the <em>actor
model</em>.  This results in simpler code (no dreaded event loop, no
callback hell) and better separation of concern.</p><p>Using a high-level framework like Fibers does come with its challenges.
For example, we had the case of a <a href="https://github.com/wingo/fibers/issues/109">memory leak in Fibers under certain
conditions</a>, and we
certainly don’t want that in PID&nbsp;1.  But the challenge really lies in
squashing those low-level bugs so that the foundation is solid.  The
Shepherd itself is free from such low-level issues; its logic is easy to
reason about and that alone is immensely helpful, it allows us to extend
the code without fear, and it avoids concurrency bugs that plague
programs written in the more common event-loop-with-callbacks style.</p><p>In fact, thanks to all this, the Shepherd is probably the <em>coolest init
system</em> to hack on.  It even comes with a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/REPL-Service.html">REPL</a>
for live hacking!</p><h2>What’s next</h2><p>There’s a number of down-to-earth improvements that can be made in the
Shepherd, such as adding support for dynamically-reconfigurable services
(being able to restart a service but with different options),
integration with control groups (“cgroups”) on Linux, proper integration
for software suspend, etc.</p><p>In the longer run, we envision an exciting journey towards a
<a href="https://spritely.institute/news/spritely-nlnet-grants-december-2023.html">distributed and capability-style
Shepherd</a>.
<a href="https://spritely.institute/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a> provides the
foundation for this; using it looks like a natural continuation of the
design work of the Shepherd: Goblins is an actor model framework!
Juliana Sims has been working on adapting the Shepherd to Goblins
and we’re eager to see what comes out of it in the coming year.  Stay
tuned!</p><h2>Enjoy!</h2><p>In the meantime, we hope you enjoy the Shepherd&nbsp;1.0 as much as we
enjoyed making it.  Four people contributed code that led to this
release, but there are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/contribute">other ways to
help</a>: through
graphics and web design, translation, documentation, and more.  Join us!</p><blockquote><p><em>Originally published on the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/news/2024/12/the-shepherd-1.0.0-released/">Shepherd web

<p><img alt="structured-logprobs" src="https://github.com/arena-ai/structured-logprobs/blob/main/docs/images/logo.png?raw=true"></p>
<p><strong>structured-logprobs</strong> is an open-source Python library that enhances <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">OpenAI's structured outputs</a> by providing detailed information about token log probabilities.</p>
<p><img alt="structured-logprobs" src="https://arena-ai.github.io/structured-logprobs/images/pitch.png"></p>
<p>This library is designed to offer valuable insights into the <strong>reliability of an LLM's structured outputs</strong>. It works with OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">Structured Outputs</a>, a feature that ensures the model consistently generates responses adhering to a supplied JSON Schema. This eliminates concerns about missing required keys or hallucinating invalid values.</p>

<hr>
<p>Europe is experiencing some weird times. From <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-power-play-exasperate-eu-capitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics</a> to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-economic-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy</a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744949/ev-sales-europe-november-2024/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22744949%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22ev-sales-europe-november-2024%22%7D">car sales</a>, it’s far from rosy, and arguably the biggest player in the electric vehicle game is having a rough year.</p>
<p>Eleven months into 2024, <a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Tesla</a> recorded a double-digit decrease in registrations, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which released <a href="https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-november-2024-year-to-date-battery-electric-sales-5-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official figures for November</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, Tesla is still one of the largest EV manufacturers in Europe and the United States, but its grip is weakening on the other side of the Atlantic. Last month, Tesla recorded a 40.9% decrease in registrations in the European Union compared to the same month last year. The number of registrations went from 31,810 in November 2023 to 18,786 last month, marking a decrease in market share from 3.6% to 2.2%.</p>

<p>Year-to-date, Tesla had 211,405 registrations in the EU, 15.2% fewer than last year’s 249,265 units.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story when the European Free Trade Association members and the United Kingdom are included in the mix. EFTA members include Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On these markets, Tesla registrations went down 28.4% in November, from 36,563 units last year to 26,191 units this year, which made the American automaker’s market share go down from 3.4% to 2.5%.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Tesla registrations in the EU, EFTA and UK went down 13.7% from 327,635 units in 2023 to 282,692 units this year, while the market share shrunk from 2.8% to 2.4%. In the EU alone, which has 27 member states, Tesla’s market share went down from 2.6% in the first 11 months of last year to 2.2% this year.</p>

<p>The automaker’s losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasingly controversial attitude of its CEO, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/category/elon-musk/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Elon Musk</a>, and the decrease in government incentives. Some European states have reduced the amount of money offered toward the purchase of a new EV, while others have eliminated the incentives altogether.</p>
<p>That said, Tesla’s significant drop in European registrations has largely left the EV industry unaffected. Considering the sheer volume of electric cars sold by Tesla, EV registrations as a whole only went down by 1.4% in the EU, EFTA and UK from January to November and they actually went up 0.9% in November compared to last year. In the EU alone, EV registrations went down 5.4% year-to-date and 9.5% in November.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing: other automakers have stepped up to try and fill the gap left by Tesla, and customers are following suit.</p>

<p>This year’s Lifetime Account Charity Fundraiser was a record-breaking success, generating over $1 million to directly support organizations fighting for privacy, freedom of expression, and human rights worldwide.</p>



<p>We’ve held our annual charity fundraiser since 2018, raffling off exclusive Lifetime Accounts while raising millions for the fight for a better internet. But this year, the community fundraiser exceeded all expectations, bringing our total charity contributions over the last <a href="https://proton.me/about/impact">seven years to over $4 million</a>.</p>



<p>The 2024 fundraiser brought in $927,470 from over 90,000 tickets sold to 43,631 participants. We’re donating a further $150,000, bringing the total donation amount to <strong>$1,077,470</strong>. This achievement is a testament to the power of this community and our ability to collectively build a better future.</p>

<p>Thanks to your continued support, we have now distributed over $4  million in grants globally to aligned organizations.

<p>New this year, we are also allocating $200,000 to set up a Proton Innovation Fund to be administered by the nonprofit <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">Proton Foundation</a>.

There will be an open call for applications later this year, so stay tuned.</p>



<h3>Together, we can achieve more</h3>



<p>At Proton, we believe the fight for privacy and freedom is a shared mission. This fundraiser highlights the incredible strength of our global community and the impact we can create together. Every ticket purchased, every donation made, and every message shared contributes to a movement that’s bigger than all of us.</p>



<p>Thank you for helping us make 2024 a record-breaking year. Your support inspires us to continue building tools that empower people to take control of their digital lives.</p>



<p>Here’s to another year of progress together.</p>

It is very, very hard for me to avoid literally jumping up and down as I share this news with you.</p><p>The TL;DR: today, I have the pleasure of announcing that <strong>dbt Labs has acquired <a title="SDF Labs" href="https://www.sdf.com/">SDF Labs</a></strong>. The two teams are already working side-by-side to bring SDF’s SQL comprehension technology into the hands of dbt users everywhere. SDF will be a massive upgrade to the very heart of the dbt user experience moving forward. It will enable faster dbt project compilation (~2 orders of magnitude), amazing developer experience (think: type-ahead in your IDE of choice), the highest-fidelity lineage on the market, and much more.</p><p>Let me take a sec to share the story of how we got here. Because I think it’s an interesting one.</p><h2 id="a-standardized-way-to-author-sql-data-pipelines">A standardized way to author SQL data pipelines</h2><p>From the very beginning, we wanted writing dbt pipelines to feel as simple as writing SQL. Just write a select statement, in your dialect of choice, and dbt would take care of all of the fiddly bits. This desire arose directly from our focus on empowering more humans—not just highly technical data engineers—to author production-grade data pipelines. So we started with models that were just SQL.</p><p>Then it was obvious that we needed some dynamic ability in our pipelines. Declare variables, create dynamic relationships between nodes, etc. So we added Jinja. Initially for just a few functions: <code>ref()</code> being the first and most important, but later <code>config()</code> , <code>var()</code>, and others.</p><p>These functions were a gateway drug, though, and we quickly became convinced of how important custom macros would be. Users could define their own functions, and as long as they output syntactically valid SQL, they could do whatever they wanted! And thus, dbt utils and the entire <a title="dbt package hub" href="https://hub.getdbt.com/">dbt package hub</a> was born. Community-wide code reusability for the win!</p><p>Through the ensuing years, dbt became an ever-more-complete SQL authoring framework. One of the biggest steps we ever made was to push all materializations into <em>user-space</em>. This allowed advanced users to take complete control of the SQL authored by dbt. <strong>From that point forwards, if a data transformation was expressible within a given data platform, dbt users could author it.</strong></p><p>Throughout this entire journey, however, <em>dbt could not actually understand the SQL its users were writing!</em> This remains true today. dbt is an incredibly powerful framework for users to author data pipelines, but it fundamentally treats the SQL that you author as text and leaves the evaluation of that text to the database. This gives the user ultimate control—the framework doesn’t get in the way—but it also asks the user to do more work.</p><p>For a long time, this felt entirely normal and rational. We had, for a long time, thought of dbt as “Ruby on Rails for SQL”.</p><h2 id="borrowing-from-software-engineering-again">Borrowing from software engineering (again)</h2><p>For those of you who didn’t do web development in the mid-2000’s, Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a web development framework that made it incredibly straightforward to develop web applications. It combined the power of two (!) declarative languages (HTML and CSS) with a templating system (.erb, or ‘embedded ruby’) to enable developers to do things on the web that they could never do with HTML alone. RoR did not, itself, understand the HTML its developers authored; that task was left up to the browser.</p><p>The analogy is pretty direct, and it worked for a long time. Everything you can do with dbt today—the entire control plane, from transformation to testing to catalog to orchestration—is powered by this paradigm. dbt helps you author data pipelines using SQL; Ruby on Rails helps you author web applications using HTML and CSS.</p><p>But RoR is no longer the dominant framework for building web applications today. Over the last decade, React has taken that mantle. And React <em>does</em> understand the HTML/CSS/Javascript its users write—and it does that in a very clever way. Rather than writing to a given browser target, React developers code against an intermediate abstraction and the framework takes on the responsibility of ensuring browser-level compatibility. Gone are the days where web developers have to struggle with browser compatibility.</p><p>The level up in capability for web applications from the days pre-React and post-React is pretty dramatic. (Think of the web interfaces you used in 2014 and compare them with what you’re using today!) These types of epochal changes in developer tooling can make <em>massive</em> differences in the products that can be built on top.</p><h2 id="enter-sdf">Enter: SDF</h2><p>We’ve known for years that this type of step function change was coming for the world of SQL. And different teams have taken some decent swings at it along the way. Unfortunately, every proposed solution had tradeoffs that we considered unacceptable. Limiting the dynamism of Jinja. Unpleasant syntax. Forcing developers to use some intermediate proprietary language. Etc. In our opinion, the right solution just hadn’t emerged yet.</p><p>That is…until a little company called SDF Labs <a title="came out of stealth in the summer of 2024" href="https://blog.sdf.com/p/announcing-sdf-general-availability">came out of stealth in the summer of 2024</a>.</p><p>SDF’s story is fascinating. Founded by a father/son duo (Lukas and Wolfram Schulte, CEO and CTO respectively), and with a core team of database researchers from Microsoft Research, Meta, and others, they are among the most qualified humans on the planet to think about the problem of highly reliable SQL comprehension at scale.</p><p>Wolfram, in fact, was hired at Meta to build the system that tracked PII throughout all data pipelines at the company across over a million tables. Talk about being battle-tested—I can’t imagine there are many (any?) more demanding use cases for this technology anywhere.</p><p>A few years later, the two decided to take the lessons learned from this work and build a company around it. They recruited a team of the best talent in the world and got to work building in stealth for two years, emerging in June of 2024 with a fully-functioning and dbt-integrated product already in production use by customers.</p><p>Fatefully, Benn Stancil introduced me to Lukas on the day before their public launch. It was clear to me after a single conversation that this was the future of dbt.</p><h2 id="how-does-sdf-work">How does SDF work?</h2><p>So how does SDF actually…work?</p><p>SDF is a high performance toolchain for SQL development packaged into one CLI; a multi-dialect SQL compiler, type system, transformation framework, linter, and language server. It is written in Rust, highly parallelized, and designed for scale.</p><p>The toolchain is powered by a state-of-the-art development in SQL understanding. SDF represents each SQL dialect (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, etc.) as a complete <a title="ANTLR grammar" href="https://www.antlr.org/index.html">ANTLR grammar</a> with definitions for all datatypes, coercion rules, functions, scoping intricacies and more. Unlike dbt historically (which has treated SQL as strings), SDF sees objects and types and syntax and semantics. In the same way that virtual machines (VMs) emulate physical hardware, SDF emulates the SQL compilers native to the data platforms you use.</p><p><img alt="SDF architecture diagram" loading="lazy" width="2018" height="1184" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.getdbt.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fwl0ndo6t%2Fmain%2F36741d46d1935129825ae060989f2877ca37e62d-2018x1184.png%3Ffit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.getdbt.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fwl0ndo6t%2Fmain%2F36741d46d1935129825ae060989f2877ca37e62d-2018x1184.png%3Ffit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.getdbt.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fwl0ndo6t%2Fmain%2F36741d46d1935129825ae060989f2877ca37e62d-2018x1184.png%3Ffit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>The result is magical: at every point in time&nbsp;<em>the entirety of the data warehouse is fully defined and statically analyzed as code</em>. A complete understanding of SQL allows the SDF engine to faithfully emulate cloud data warehouses in their behavior and provide that feedback <em>before execution</em>&nbsp;and catch breaking changes as part of development rather than after deployment.</p><p>Best of all, integration is easy. SDF has adopted dbt’s syntax, configuration, libraries, and Jinja natively, as part of the SDF runtime. As a result, for most dbt projects <em>there will be no code changes required to take full advantage of SDF’s capabilities!</em></p><h2 id="the-power-of-a-new-paradigm">The power of a new paradigm</h2><p>Ok cool, all of this has been interesting. But I'm sure you're wondering...as a user, <em>what does it actually get me?</em> The answer is: quite a lot.</p><p>Let’s start with the first, most basic benefit. SDF parses and compiles dbt projects really, <em>really</em> fast. Because it’s built in Rust, it simply runs faster than Python. As a result, SDF compiles the same dbt project multiple orders of magnitude faster than dbt Core. If you’re working in a large dbt project, this will <em>meaningfully</em> impact your productivity.</p><p>Next is developer experience. There are many things that will eventually go into this bucket, but here are two great examples. First, SDF’s ability to understand SQL means that it can power IntelliSense in your IDE of choice. With every keystroke, SDF understands what you are typing and can automatically suggest what comes next, including suggesting table and column names. Second, because SDF understands your SQL, it can detect errors without connecting to the remote database. Troubleshooting all of a sudden becomes <em>far faster</em>, as errors get caught as you are typing, not when you do a <code>dbt run</code>.</p><p>Third is lineage. SDF has both the highest-fidelity and most high-performing SQL parsing on the market. And lineage and metadata is, of course, at the heart of the entire data control plane. Understanding how tables and columns flow throughout your entire data estate is what SDF's technology was originally built to do, and it has been proven out in the most complex data environments on the planet.</p><p>Finally is local execution. It is common for the workflows of software engineers to run development environments on a local machine, then for higher environments to be cloud-based. The local development environment gives software engineers speed and control that are important in the very tight, iterative development cycle. But that’s not how it’s worked in data in the past. Most modern data platforms cannot be ‘run locally’, but that’s one of the superpowers of building a logical plan from the SQL query: you can take that logical plan and execute it in a local environment. And that’s exactly what SDF does in development, making the developer experience that much more responsive and delightful.</p><p>The benefits above are only the start; the ability to deeply understand the SQL authored inside of dbt pipelines will fundamentally transform the experience of every dbt user.</p><h2 id="gimme-the-details-what-do-i-get">Gimme the details! What do I get?</h2><p>All of the benefits laid out above are being realized in production today by SDF’s existing customers. But it will take some work to get all of these capabilities integrated into dbt, and this won’t happen overnight.</p><p>Our first goal is to get SDF’s SQL parsing capabilities integrated into dbt. These capabilities will enable meaningful improvements to the dbt developer experience, and we want everyone to have access to them. While SDF won't be included as part of the Apache 2.0 code base, <em>we plan to make meaningful parts of SDF’s capabilities available to all dbt users</em>—whether you’re using dbt Core or dbt Cloud.</p><p>As we work through integration details we’ll share more about how this will work. But <strong>if you use dbt today, you’ll be able to use this new tech</strong>.</p><p>In a few weeks, we're hosting a webinar between me and SDF's Co-founder and CEO to share more and answer any of your burning questions. <a title="Be sure to register" href="https://www.getdbt.com/resources/webinars/accelerating-dbt-with-sdf">Be sure to register</a>. In the meantime, you can learn more about this acquisition and what it means for the bright road ahead for dbt by <a title="reading our press release" href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-announces-sdf-labs-acquisition">reading our press release</a>, the <a title="follow-up blog post" href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/advancing-the-data-control-plane-vision-with-sdf-and-dbt">follow-up blog post</a> written by dbt Labs Chief Customer Officer Ryan Segar, and SDF's <a title="acquisition announcement blog post" href="https://blog.sdf.com/p/dbt-labs-has-acquired-sdf">acquisition announcement blog post</a>.</p><p>Beyond that, all I can say for now is that the technology that SDF has built is foundational to the entire data control plane, and you should anticipate seeing it show up in more and more dbt experiences over the coming 12 months. We’ll share more in public as soon as we can.</p><p>In returning, for a moment, to my statement from the very beginning of this post: I am just so very excited about this development and what it will mean for dbt users everywhere. This is the type of step function change that doesn’t come along in an industry very often, and it is an absolute privilege to be able to share this with the entire dbt Community.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>My work PC is an old potato, and Chrome makes its fans cry whenever I open a lot of tabs. I always thought it was just my aging computer’s fault, until I switched to Firefox and found out it was Chrome all along.</p>    <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><h2 id="everything-that-chrome-can-do-and-more">
                        Everything That Chrome Can Do and More
               </h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember, Chrome has been my go-to. All my passwords, bookmarks, and extensions are always available wherever I log into my Google account. I only use the browser on my PC, which is why I’ve never felt the need to upgrade it. At least until recently, when it started to struggle when I installed a couple of new Chrome extensions.</p>    
<p>I figured it’s finally time to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/346541/how-to-upgrade-or-replace-your-pcs-ram/" target="_blank">add more RAM to this machine</a> or say farewell to it entirely. For the time being, I switched to Firefox. I made a new account for it and linked it to the sync chain on the PC and my phone. To my surprise, my old timer PC runs it just fine, even with a ton of tabs open. No more angry fan noises.</p>

<p>And even more surprisingly, Firefox does everything Chrome does. The sync works perfectly across devices. You get a huge selection of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/719529/how-to-install-extensions-add-ons-in-mozilla-firefox/" target="_blank">browser add-ons</a>, and you can customize a lot of the interface. It even has many neat features that Chrome doesn’t.</p>    
<p>The one feature it doesn’t have is the ability to turn regular web pages into web apps that you can launch from the desktop or taskbar. That’s something I wish the devs would add, but except for this nitpick, I don’t think I’ll be switching back to Chrome. Let me try to convince you why you should try Firefox too.</p>    <h2 id="superior-tab-management">

               </h2>
<p>Other than the search tabs feature, managing tabs in Chrome hasn’t changed in almost two decades (I’m not counting “Tab Groups” because they’re messy and confusing). A lot of people keep countless tabs open and all Chrome gives you is a cramped-up bar filled with tiny buttons that hide the text. Good luck finding a tab without hovering over each one.</p>

<p>Firefox has similar tab bars and buttons, but it has something Chrome doesn’t: Firefox View. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/841156/whats-new-in-firefox-106-available-now/" target="_blank">Firefox View</a> is a window where you can see all your open tabs in one place. It’s conveniently stashed in a corner and opens with a single click.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    

<p>You can sort the open tabs by recent activity or just by tab order. You can also search for open tabs.</p>    
<p>You can cycle through recently closed tabs, the entire search history, and even the tabs you’ve got open on other devices—all easily accessible, searchable, and sortable. There’s also a recent browsing tab where all the open tabs, recent tabs, and tabs from other devices are pooled together.</p>    
<p>If you’re someone who keeps a lot of tabs open and wastes too much time rummaging through them, trust me, you’ll love Firefox View.</p>    <h2 id="built-in-pocket-so-you-never-lose-a-link">
                        Built-in Pocket So You Never Lose a Link
               </h2>
<p>You know when you don’t want to lose a link, but it’s also not important enough to bookmark? Firefox has a button for that. It’s called <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/260850/how-to-save-articles-for-reading-later-with-pocket/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> and it keeps all your links safe in a tidy little collection.</p>    
<p>Even more importantly, it does so with a single click. Just click the tiny Pocket icon next to the address bar once, and it’ll be added to your saved collection. The collection syncs directly with your Firefox profile, so you can access it anywhere.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    

<p>To view your saves, you can open the Pocket app and find all your saved URLs in a beautiful layout. You can organize, tag, and archive the collections too.</p>    <h2 id="keep-your-real-email-safe">

<p>Firefox Relay is an in-built privacy feature for <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/stop-giving-companies-your-real-email/" target="_blank">protecting your real email addresses</a>. When you’re signing up for a website, instead of giving out your real email address, you can share any of the five randomly generated Relay emails that Firefox provides.</p>

<p>Any emails sent to these aliases will be forwarded to your real email address. That way, the real email addresses stay hidden, but you still get your mail sent to them. There is also a handy Firefox Relay extension that autofills these burners when you’re filling out forms with email addresses.</p>    
<p>Firefox makes it super convenient to take screenshots. You don’t need to install any clunky browser extensions. Just right click anywhere, and click “Take Screenshot.” You can choose a full-page view or select an area to capture. It also detects web page elements, so you can capture perfect rectangular or square screenshots.</p>

<p>Just right-click anywhere on any webpage (or select a chunk of text) and ask ChatGPT to “Summarize,” “Explain this,” or “Quiz me.” It’ll open an AI Chatbot panel on the side where you can ask follow-ups or tweak the original prompt. If you don't find it on your Firefox, open Settings and look for the "AI Chatbot" feature in your Firebox Labs settings.</p>    <h2 id="other-thoughtful-touches">

<p>On Firefox, you can pop out any video into its own little window. That way, you can watch multiple videos side by side, or work on other tabs or apps while the video plays in the corner. You can use this Picture in Picture feature by clicking the tiny pop-out icon that shows up when you play a video. Very handy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog">Blog</a> &gt; Post</p><p>by <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/users/Tom+Russell">Tom Russell</a>, 13 January 2025</p><p><span>DB-Engines is today announcing that </span><span>PostgreSQL is our DBMS of the Year for the second year in a row, </span><span>winning for </span><span>the fifth time overall.</span></p><p>DB-Engines is today announcing that PostgreSQL is our DBMS of the Year for the second year in a row, winning for the fifth time overall after also being top-ranked in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2023. Second in the rankings was Snowflake, followed by Microsoft in third place. PostgreSQL has emerged as the most popular database management system over the past year, outpacing all other 423 monitored systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 35 years ago, the database system known as Postgres made its debut. Since then, PostgreSQL has undergone significant transformations, driven by a continuous stream of enhancements that ensure it remains at the cutting edge of DBMS technology, while also offering a dependable and stable platform. PostgreSQL 17, launched in September 2024, introduced additional performance enhancements and expanded replication options, among other improvements. All of this continues to make PostgreSQL one of the most successful open-source projects ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snowflake is the runner up and is a cloud-based data warehousing company that has gained significant traction in recent years. Its unique architecture allows for the separation of storage and compute, providing flexibility and scalability. Snowflake's support for multi-cloud environments and its data sharing capabilities have made it a popular choice for businesses looking to leverage cloud data warehousing. Snowflake's rise in the rankings reflects its growing influence and adoption in the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft's Azure SQL Database and SQL Server continue to be strong contenders in the DBMS market. Azure SQL Database offers a fully managed relational database with AI-powered performance optimization and scalability. SQL Server, with its hybrid capabilities, allows for seamless integration between on-premises and cloud environments. Microsoft's commitment to innovation and its comprehensive suite of data services have solidified its position in the top ranks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><big>Notes to editors</big></h2>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>We calculate the DBMS of the year by subtracting the January 2024 from the January 2025 scores. We use the difference between each DBMS’s score, rather than a percentage growth, which would favor systems with lower popularity at the beginning of the year. The DMBS of the year is an illustration of how much each system increased in popularity during the year. You can read more about our exact <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_definition">methodology </a>here, but in short we are ranking popularity of DBMS based on how much people are discussing and communicating about each system, including job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web. job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web.&nbsp;</p>
