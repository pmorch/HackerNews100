      <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/youtube-s-anti-adblock-and-ublock-origin">29 October 2023</a>
</time>
  <p>Recently, YouTube has been ramping up its anti-adblock effort, and I’ve been watching this closely due to <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/launch-vinegar">personal interest</a>. This blog post is where I write down what I know.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="some-background">Some Background</h3>
<p>Here’s how adblockers (used to) block YouTube ads. Before playing a video, YouTube would check its API, and the server would send back something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>something.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>ads</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>ad1</span><span>,</span> <span>ad2</span><span>,</span> <span>ad3</span><span>],</span>
  <span>"</span><span>etc</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And the adblockers would override <code>JSON.parse</code> and <code>Response.json</code> to make it return this instead:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>something.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>ads</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>
  <span>"</span><span>etc</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This trick worked for a few years. But earlier this year, YouTube started making fake requests to see if the responses were changed. If the responses were changed, it meant the user was using an adblocker.</p>

<p>Most adblockers stopped working, but a few like uBlock Origin and AdGuard updated their filters to avoid these fake requests. Then YouTube would update their fake requests so the adblockers would fall for them. It’s been a game of cat and mouse between YouTube and the adblockers ever since.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-tech-support-hell">The Tech Support Hell</h3>
<p>YouTube isn’t rolling out the anti-adblock to everyone. It seems to depend on things like your account, browser, and IP address. And if you’re not logged in or you’re in a private window, you’re safe. As a result, there are a bunch of people saying, “I use XYZ and I haven’t seen an anti-adblock popup yet,” unknowingly spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: YouTube isn’t just targeting adblockers. Use Privacy Badger? You’ll get flagged. Use Malwarebytes? You’ll get flagged. Set your Edge browser’s tracking protection to “strict”? Yep, <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/10/10/google-blocks-youtube-in-windows-11-microsoft-edge-with-strict-tracking-protection/">you’ll get flagged</a>. So a lot of people think their extensions are safe to use, but actually they’re not.</p>

<p>And contrary to what you might think, using multiple adblockers can actually make things worse. That’s because all your adblockers need to be up-to-date to dodge YouTube’s detection.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this is creating a tech support nightmare if you’re part of an adblocker team.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-redditors">The Redditors</h3>
<p>On Reddit, the uBO team put up a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/178yasm/youtube_antiadblock_and_ads_october_16_2023/">detailed post</a> on how to handle YouTube’s anti-adblock. But many people don’t actually follow it. You’d see people saying, “I did what the post said but I’m still having issues.” But when they’re asked to share their system info for troubleshooting, it turns out they didn’t really follow the post.</p>

<p>Then there are non-tech-savvy users looking at the post and saying, “This is too complex. I give up.”</p>

<p>Then there are tech-savvy users who say, “Your filter has <strong>CODE</strong> in it. That’s risky. Can you explain what it does? I don’t want to run anything I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>And of course, there’s always the classic “<strong>IVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND NOTHING WORKS HELP!!!!</strong>”</p>

<p>All this noise makes it hard to find any useful info.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-stupid-filters">The Stupid Filters</h3>
<p>Some people have been sharing custom filters that use CSS to hide the popups. But that’s like sticking your head in the sand. Sooner or later, they’ll get totally blocked and won’t know why.</p>

<p>Recently, someone shared a filter on Twitter that literally had code to set <code>adBlocksFound</code> to 0. It’s as if they think YouTube’s anti-adblock works like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>adBlocksFound</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>blockUser</span><span>();</span> <span>//!!!!!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That tweet got super popular. And it probably led a lot of people to add those filters to their adblockers. This has really piled on the work for the troubleshooting team. Did the person who shared it not realize it was harmful? Or did they just care about getting likes?</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-script-id">The Script ID</h3>
<p>Every time YouTube tweaks their script, part of the URL changes. This part is what uBO calls the ID, and they have a <a href="https://pastefy.app/G1Txv5su/raw">webpage</a> that keeps track of the latest one.</p>

<p>But here’s where things get messy. Some people think this ID is what they need to block. Some even suggest ways to automate the process (like, “Why don’t you just block that with <strong>REGULAR EXPRESSION</strong>?”)</p>

<p>Another issue is that sometimes YouTube pushes out an update that has nothing to do with adblock. But it still changes the ID. Then you get people saying, “The ID changed, why hasn’t this post updated yet???”</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-moderator-who-quit-reddit">The Moderator Who Quit Reddit</h3>
<p>All this resulted in a ton of pressure on the uBO team members who were trying to help out in the thread. One by one, I saw them say they’d had enough of the comments and weren’t going to reply in these threads anymore.</p>

<p>And then one of the moderators actually deleted their Reddit account. “The ID in the post wasn’t updated because my mother was hospitalized,” they said.</p>

<p>It’s sad to see them leave because of some drive-by comments — new users who sign up for Reddit, leave their comments, and then delete their accounts without facing any consequences.</p>

<p>Sure, there are people who appreciate what the uBO team is doing. But the hurtful comments leave a bigger mark than the good ones.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-war-of-attrition">The War of Attrition</h3>
<p>Since May, uBO has been in a cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. And they’ve shown incredible resilience, especially when you consider that there are only two people on the uBO team dealing with YouTube.</p>

<p>The uBO team members are all volunteers. They’ve gone above and beyond to meet every little request from their users. But there’s a limit to how much they can take. At some point, the constant demands become too much, and they will leave uBO for good. It’s one thing to play cat and mouse with YouTube. It’s quite another to deal with a wave of angry users.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s how YouTube will win this war of attrition.</p>

But above all, he endures as our era’s greatest patron saint of reason and critical thinking, a master of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/05/23/carl-sagan-the-burden-of-skepticism/">the vital balance between skepticism and openness</a>. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/demon-haunted-world-science-as-a-candle-in-the-dark/oclc/32855551&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) — the same indispensable volume that gave us Sagan’s timeless meditation on <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/06/12/carl-sagan-on-science-and-spirituality/">science and spirituality</a>, published mere months before his death in 1996 — Sagan shares his secret to upholding the rites of reason, even in the face of society’s most shameless untruths and outrageous propaganda.</p>
<p>In a chapter titled <strong>“The Fine Art of Baloney Detection,”</strong> Sagan reflects on the many types of deception to which we’re susceptible — from psychics to religious zealotry to paid product endorsements by scientists, which he held in especially low regard, noting that they “betray contempt for the intelligence of their customers” and “introduce an insidious corruption of popular attitudes about scientific objectivity.” (Cue in <a href="http://explore.noodle.org/post/70511854124/so-great-so-necessary-joe-hanson-of-its-okay">PBS’s Joe Hanson on how to read science news</a>.) But rather than preaching from the ivory tower of self-righteousness, Sagan approaches the subject from the most vulnerable of places — having just lost both of his parents, he reflects on the all too human allure of promises of supernatural reunions in the afterlife, reminding us that falling for such fictions doesn’t make us stupid or bad people, but simply means that we need to equip ourselves with the right tools against them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/carlsagan1.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/carlsagan1.jpg?w=680&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>Through their training, scientists are equipped with what Sagan calls a “baloney detection kit” — a set of cognitive tools and techniques that fortify the mind against penetration by falsehoods:</p>
<blockquote><p>The kit is brought out as a matter of course whenever new ideas are offered for consideration. If the new idea survives examination by the tools in our kit, we grant it warm, although tentative, acceptance. If you’re so inclined, if you don’t want to buy baloney even when it’s reassuring to do so, there are precautions that can be taken; there’s a tried-and-true, consumer-tested method.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the kit, Sagan argues, isn’t merely a tool of science — rather, it contains invaluable tools of healthy skepticism that apply just as elegantly, and just as necessarily, to everyday life. By adopting the kit, we can all shield ourselves against clueless guile and deliberate manipulation. Sagan shares nine of these tools:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”</li>
<li>Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.</li>
<li>Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.</li>
<li>Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among “multiple working hypotheses,” has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.</li>
<li>Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others will.</li>
<li>Quantify. If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding <em>them</em> is more challenging.</li>
<li>If there’s a chain of argument, <em>every</em> link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.</li>
<li>Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data <em>equally well</em> to choose the simpler.</li>
<li>Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/carlsagan.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/carlsagan.jpg?w=680&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>Just as important as learning these helpful tools, however, is unlearning and avoiding the most common pitfalls of common sense. Reminding us of where society is most vulnerable to those, Sagan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to teaching us what to do when evaluating a claim to knowledge, any good baloney detection kit must also teach us what not to do. It helps us recognize the most common and perilous fallacies of logic and rhetoric. Many good examples can be found in religion and politics, because their practitioners are so often obliged to justify two contradictory propositions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He admonishes against the twenty most common and perilous ones — many rooted in our <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/11/11/dani-shapiro-still-writing-2/">chronic discomfort with ambiguity</a> — with examples of each in action:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>ad hominem</em></strong> — Latin for “to the man,” attacking the arguer and not the argument (e.g., <em>The Reverend Dr. Smith is a known Biblical fundamentalist, so her objections to evolution need not be taken seriously</em>)</li>
<li><strong>argument from authority</strong> (e.g., <em>President Richard Nixon should be re-elected because he has a secret plan to end the war in Southeast Asia</em> — but because it was secret, there was no way for the electorate to evaluate it on its merits; the argument amounted to trusting him because he was President: a mistake, as it turned out)</li>
<li><strong>argument from adverse consequences</strong> (e.g., <em>A God meting out punishment and reward must exist, because if He didn’t, society would be much more lawless and dangerous</em> — perhaps even ungovernable. Or: <em>The defendant in a widely publicized murder trial must be found guilty; otherwise, it will be an encouragement for other men to murder their wives</em>)</li>
<li><strong>appeal to ignorance</strong> — the claim that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa (e.g., <em>There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore UFOs exist — and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.</em> Or: <em>There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we’re still central to the Universe.</em>) This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</li>
<li><strong>special pleading</strong>, often to rescue a proposition in deep rhetorical trouble (e.g., <em>How can a merciful God condemn future generations to torment because, against orders, one woman induced one man to eat an apple? Special plead: you don’t understand the subtle Doctrine of Free Will</em>. Or: <em>How can there be an equally godlike Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the same Person? Special plead: You don’t understand the Divine Mystery of the Trinity.</em> Or: <em>How could God permit the followers of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — each in their own way enjoined to heroic measures of loving kindness and compassion — to have perpetrated so much cruelty for so long? Special plead: You don’t understand Free Will again. And anyway, God moves in mysterious ways.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>begging the question</strong>, also called <strong>assuming the answer</strong> (e.g., <em>We must institute the death penalty to discourage violent crime. But does the violent crime rate in fact fall when the death penalty is imposed?</em> Or: <em>The stock market fell yesterday because of a technical adjustment and profit-taking by investors</em> — but is there any independent evidence for the causal role of “adjustment” and profit-taking; have we learned anything at all from this purported explanation?)</li>
<li><strong>observational selection</strong>, also called <strong>the enumeration of favorable circumstances</strong>, or as the philosopher Francis Bacon described it, counting the hits and forgetting the misses (e.g., <em>A state boasts of the Presidents it has produced, but is silent on its serial killers</em>)</li>
<li><strong>statistics of small numbers</strong> — a close relative of observational selection (e.g., <em>“They say 1 out of every 5 people is Chinese. How is this possible? I know hundreds of people, and none of them is Chinese. Yours truly.”</em> Or: <em>“I’ve thrown three sevens in a row. Tonight I can’t lose.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>misunderstanding of the nature of statistics</strong> (e.g., <em>President Dwight Eisenhower expressing astonishment and alarm on discovering that fully half of all Americans have below average intelligence)</em>;</li>
<li><strong>inconsistency</strong> (e.g., <em>Prudently plan for the worst of which a potential military adversary is capable, but thriftily ignore scientific projections on environmental dangers because they’re not “proved.”</em> Or: <em>Attribute the declining life expectancy in the former Soviet Union to the failures of communism many years ago, but never attribute the high infant mortality rate in the United States (now highest of the major industrial nations) to the failures of capitalism.</em> Or: <em>Consider it reasonable for the Universe to continue to exist forever into the future, but judge absurd the possibility that it has infinite duration into the past)</em>;</li>
<li><strong><em>non sequitur</em></strong> — Latin for “It doesn’t follow” (e.g., <em>Our nation will prevail because God is great. But nearly every nation pretends this to be true; the German formulation was “Gott mit uns”</em>). Often those falling into the non sequitur fallacy have simply failed to recognize alternative possibilities;</li>
<li><strong><em>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</em></strong> — Latin for “It happened after, so it was caused by” (e.g., <em>Jaime Cardinal Sin, Archbishop of Manila: “I know of … a 26-year-old who looks 60 because she takes [contraceptive] pills.”</em> Or: <em>Before women got the vote, there were no nuclear weapons</em>)</li>
<li><strong>meaningless question</strong> (e.g., <em>What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object? But if there is such a thing as an irresistible force there can be no immovable objects, and vice versa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>excluded middle</strong>, or <strong>false dichotomy</strong> — considering only the two extremes in a continuum of intermediate possibilities (e.g., <em>“Sure, take his side; my husband’s perfect; I’m always wrong.” Or: “Either you love your country or you hate it.” Or: “If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>short-term vs. long-term</strong> — a subset of the excluded middle, but so important I’ve pulled it out for special attention (e.g., <em>We can’t afford programs to feed malnourished children and educate pre-school kids. We need to urgently deal with crime on the streets.</em> Or: <em>Why explore space or pursue fundamental science when we have so huge a budget deficit?)</em>;</li>
<li><strong>slippery slope</strong>, related to excluded middle (e.g., <em>If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant</em>. Or, conversely: <em>If the state prohibits abortion even in the ninth month, it will soon be telling us what to do with our bodies around the time of conception)</em>;</li>
<li><strong>confusion of correlation and causation</strong> (e.g., <em>A survey shows that more college graduates are homosexual than those with lesser education; therefore education makes people gay.</em> Or: <em>Andean earthquakes are correlated with closest approaches of the planet Uranus; therefore — despite the absence of any such correlation for the nearer, more massive planet Jupiter — the latter causes the former</em>)</li>
<li><strong>straw man</strong> — caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack (e.g., <em>Scientists suppose that living things simply fell together by chance</em> — a formulation that willfully ignores the central Darwinian insight, that Nature ratchets up by saving what works and discarding what doesn’t. Or — this is also a short-term/long-term fallacy — <em>environmentalists care more for snail darters and spotted owls than they do for people</em>)</li>
<li><strong>suppressed evidence</strong>, or <strong>half-truths</strong> (e.g., <em>An amazingly accurate and widely quoted “prophecy” of the assassination attempt on President Reagan is shown on television</em>; but — an important detail — was it recorded before or after the event? Or: <em>These government abuses demand revolution, even if you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs.</em> Yes, but is this likely to be a revolution in which far more people are killed than under the previous regime? What does the experience of other revolutions suggest? Are all revolutions against oppressive regimes desirable and in the interests of the people?)</li>
<li><strong>weasel words</strong> (e.g., The separation of powers of the U.S. Constitution specifies that the United States may not conduct a war without a declaration by Congress. On the other hand, Presidents are given control of foreign policy and the conduct of wars, which are potentially powerful tools for getting themselves re-elected. Presidents of either political party may therefore be tempted to arrange wars while waving the flag and calling the wars something else — “police actions,” “armed incursions,” “protective reaction strikes,” “pacification,” “safeguarding American interests,” and a wide variety of “operations,” such as “Operation Just Cause.” Euphemisms for war are one of a broad class of reinventions of language for political purposes. Talleyrand said, “An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public”)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Sagan ends the chapter with a necessary disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like all tools, the baloney detection kit can be misused, applied out of context, or even employed as a rote alternative to thinking. But applied judiciously, it can make all the difference in the world — not least in evaluating our own arguments before we present them to others.</p></blockquote>

<p>This best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergraduate math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.

</p><p>No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner product spaces are then introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences such as the singular value decomposition. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator. Determinants are cleanly introduced via alternating multilinear forms.
	
</p><h3>Excerpts from Reviews</h3>

Altogether, the text is a didactic masterpiece.<br>
<cite>zbMATH</cite>

<p>Axler demotes determinants (usually quite a central technique in the finite dimensional setting, though marginal in infinite dimensions) to a minor role.  To so consistently do without determinants constitutes a tour de force in the service of simplicity and clarity; these are also well served by the general precision of Axler's prose... The most original linear algebra book to appear in years, it certainly belongs in every undergraduate library.<br>
<cite>Choice</cite>

</p><p>The determinant-free proofs are elegant and intuitive.<br>
<cite>American Mathematical Monthly</cite>

</p><p>Clarity through examples is emphasized... the text is ideal for class exercises... I congratulate the author and the publisher for a well-produced textbook on linear algebra.<br>

<p>A gold coin minted by a little-known ruler in ancient Britain — an Iron Age man who said he was as "mighty" as a god — has been found by a metal detectorist and auctioned off in England.</p><p>The rare coin was discovered in March 2023 in Hampshire county and was auctioned Sept. 28 for 20,400 British pounds ($24,720), Spink auction house said in a series of statements.</p><p>A Latin alphabetic inscription on the coin bears the name "Esunertos," which can be translated as "mighty as the god Esos," (also spelled Esus) the statements said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div x-data="prose"> <!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><p>This article was first published on Big Think in February 2022. It was updated in September 2023.</p><p>The surface of Mars is barren and dry, with what little water there is tied up in icecaps or perhaps existing below the surface. But if you look closely at the surface, you will see what looks like shorelines or canyons where massive floods once took place.</p><p>Billions of years ago, the atmosphere of Mars may have been denser and the air slightly warmer. By looking at deltas present on Mars, similar to river deltas on Earth, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some have suggested</a> that oceans used to partially cover the planet. (See <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/wet-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strange Map #1043</a>.) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-research-suggests-mars-once-had-more-water-than-earth-s-arctic-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Others have looked at the composition of Mars meteorites</a>, which can show how the chemistry of Mars today compares to what the planet looked like billions of years ago. Both lines of evidence suggest that about four billion years ago, Mars’ northern hemisphere was covered with a massive ocean.</p><p>Today, this ocean is just a memory. Research led by the University of Tokyo and published in 2022 in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28274-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a></em> offers one reason why: Billions of years ago, Mars lost its magnetic field. Without the protection that a magnetic field offered, the atmosphere was stripped, and eventually, the oceans evaporated as water vapor in the atmosphere was lost to space.</p><h2 id="h-magnetic-fields-and-oceans">Magnetic fields and oceans</h2><p>The Solar System is a harsh place. Our life-giving Sun can also take life away. The Sun produces enormous amounts of radiation that — were it not for the protective effect of our magnetic field — would fry our planet. Without the magnetic field, the solar wind would strip our atmosphere, and the oceans would evaporate and be lost to space. In other words, Earth would end up like Mars.</p><p>The Earth is the only one of the rocky planets in our Solar System to have a strong magnetic field. Its presence is likely one of the major reasons why Mars and Earth are so vastly different. But billions of years ago, Mars too had a strong magnetic field. So, what happened?</p><h2>How Mars lost its magnetic field and oceans</h2><p>To investigate, a team led by Shunpei Yokoo of the University of Tokyo simulated the core of Mars in a lab here on Earth. The team made a material using a mixture of iron, sulfur, and hydrogen, which are believed to be present in the core of Mars.</p><p>Sulfur is probably in the core, since Mars meteorites (which sample the crust and mantle) do not contain many elements typically found alongside sulfur. Hydrogen may be plentiful in the core since Mars is close to the “snow line” in our Solar System, where water ice was abundant during planet formation. “We can reasonably assume that it [the core] is Fe-S-H liquid but needs to be verified by further marsquake (Martian earthquake) observations,” Yokoo told Big Think. “The ongoing NASA’s InSight mission might tell us more in the near future.”</p><p>The team then placed this iron, sulfur, and hydrogen mix between two diamonds and heated it with a laser, simulating the high temperatures and pressures present within the core of a rocky planet. The material separated into two distinct liquids — one with iron and sulfur, the other with iron and hydrogen. Because the liquid containing hydrogen was less dense, it rose to the top. And as the liquids separated, convective currents formed.</p><p>This is similar to what would have happened in the early history of Mars. The iron-sulfur-hydrogen liquid would form convective currents as the sulfur separates from the hydrogen. These currents would have formed a protective magnetic field around the planet. But such currents are short-lived. As soon as the two liquids fully separated, the currents would stop, and the magnetic field would vanish. Eventually, the atmosphere would be stripped and the oceans would disappear.</p><h2>Similar physics in the Earth’s core</h2><p>This separation of iron-sulfur and iron-hydrogen liquids is also seen within the Earth, but with a key difference: temperature.</p><p>“The temperature of the Earth’s core (~6,740 °F) is much higher than that of Mars’ core,” Yokoo told Big Think. At these high temperatures, the iron-sulfur and iron-hydrogen liquids mix together. However, we do see stratification higher in the core, where the temperatures are lower. “This is the reason why the Earth’s core is stratified only at its top, while Mars’ core is entirely stratified,” Yokoo said. “It should take a very long time (like one billion years) for the Earth’s core to be fully stratified.”</p><p>We’ve got time, in other words.</p><p>These results, however, have implications in the search for habitable exoplanets. A common metric used to determine if an extrasolar planet can host life is the presence of liquid water on the surface in a location that is neither too cold nor too hot. But perhaps a strong magnetic field <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-03-strong-planetary-magnetic-fields-earth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be another key metric</a> to determine whether the planet can hold onto its water. And it may very well be that magnetic fields as strong as the Earth’s are relatively rare in the Universe.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="the-popular-model">The popular model</h2><p>Software product companies aren’t usually started by people with a strong background in building software products. Those who most likely end up founding businesses are good at getting funding, and at understanding their target industry. They’ve been in their industry for a long time, know their industry inside out, convinced themselves this means they can do it, and used their relationships and skills to get the money necessary to start a company.
These people tend to lead everything personally, and a lot could be said about the damage domain experts cause to their own companies when they lead things. Somebody already did it though, and they did it so well that there’s no point in me doing a worse job.</p><p>Sometimes, though, they acknowledge the danger they represent, and hire somebody in charge of making decisions. Often, they think “We don’t want to be a service organization, but a product company. Product companies are product-led, hence product managers should be in charge.”</p><p>So they go and hire a career product manager, and have them make all decisions. Whenever somebody objects to this idea, the usual answer is that “all great companies work like this: Amazon, Apple, Tesla, etc.”.</p><p>It’s unquestionable that many great companies delegate control to a single person. Indeed, not all great companies adopt this model, but let’s keep this aspect for the end of the article.</p><h2 id="tremendous-people-are-amazing">Tremendous people are amazing</h2><p>So what’s wrong with giving control of a company to a single person? The problem is not much with the model, which can work really well, but with the who, the person you give control to.</p><p>Humans are inevitably fascinated by greatness. Movies, books, documentaries, quotes: we all can’t help being inspired by those people that changed the world with their vision and work.</p><p>Picasso, Jeff Bezos, Mozart, Steve Jobs, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk, Robert Oppenheimer, Peter Thiel, Leonardo, and others are worshipped by the masses. And what’s not to love in the inspiring vision, magnetic charisma, unwavering self-confidence, stalwart resilience, and sheer greatness these people embody? Many would do anything to work with these people. Heck, for these people.</p><p>Tremendous people envision alternative realities, fully commit themselves to their work, and move mountains with their willpower. Even if these figures are often controversial, everybody dreams of being like them. You can love them or hate them, but you’re forced to acknowledge them.</p><p>So what’s the problem with wanting to adopt this model? Absolutely nothing. It’s amazing.</p><h2 id="but-theyre-not-for-every-company">But they’re not for every company</h2><p>Do you know, though, what all the great people mentioned above have in common? None of them was a product manager. Not a single one. Actually, take a minute to think hard, and come up with one product manager that achieved anything comparable to these folks.</p><p>These people were artists, mathematicians, inventors, scientists, CEOs, and often more than one of these at a time. Do you know what else they had in common? None of them were motivated by OKRs, KPIs, data, or other people’s opinion. They were obsessed by their vision and craft. In an all-consuming, totally uncompromising way: anything short of perfection was inconceivable to them.</p><p>Tremendous people also tend to have very strong opinions, a big ego, their way of doing things, rough edges, and a disdain for mediocrity. They’re borderline unemployable, and they likely wouldn’t want to work in most companies. To them, it’s about creating something extraordinary for the sheer pleasure of it. And that’s why they disregarded work-life balance: their craft is their biggest joy. Imagine asking Michelangelo not to sculpt the back of a statue because the customer wants to put it against a wall.</p><p>But the more somebody is mediocre, the more likely they are to be put off by this intensity and passion. The more they’re willing to compromise, to lower standards, and to cut corners.</p><p>There are various degrees of greatness, but the greater somebody is, the more they approach the behavior of the greatest.</p><p>So, sure, if you can find someone tremendous, you’re willing to get out of their way, and you can cope with their intensity, by all means give them control over your product and company. They’ll produce extraordinary things.</p><p>Good chances are, though, that you wouldn’t be able to find them, that they wouldn’t want to work for you or with you, and that you wouldn’t be able to tolerate their ego and burning intensity.</p><h2 id="the-mistake">The mistake</h2><p>So what do you do instead? The enormous mistake you can make is to adopt a model that requires tremendous people, without having these tremendous people. The product managers you can hire and are comfortable hiring aren’t tremendous people. Whether they’re business lackeys, framework fanatics, subject-matter experts, former makers that climbed the corporate ladder, metrics junkies, or - God forbid - MBA graduates, there’s nothing great about them.</p><p>So what happens when you try to replicate something you have heard or read, but with a different breed of people? When you think “product led” means having a product manager making all decisions, and you hire a career product manager for this?</p><p>It can be deadly, and it typically is. And not the kind of death people can usually see coming. A much sneakier one, one that saps your company’s strength and empties its soul, until there’s nothing left.</p><p>These PMs you hire have no vision, charisma, expertise, strong beliefs, or technical skills. So what do they do when you give them that kind of power? They play it safe, and they play politics. Since they know they’re inadequate, they continuously attempt to claim credit and avoid blame.</p><p>First, they weaponize data-driven decisions. Instead of acknowledging that you can find supporting data for every claim, they pretend that their decisions are the only possible sensible possibilities given the data. When things go south, they blame the market, the quality of the data, or the company’s bad luck. It was never their fault, as that’s what the data was saying.</p><p>Next up is introducing frameworks and roles for everything. You get a career progression framework with 18 levels, quarterly performance assessments, PI planning, ADRs, PRDs, RACI, MOSCOW, OKRs, KPIs, DORA, and SAFe. People get blamed for not following the process, not being data-driven, not writing enough documentation, not keeping their documentation up-to-date, and so on. You also end up with Director of KPIs, Deputy Director of Product Operations, and Global Head of Digital Whiteboard Solutions. You soon need approvals for everything, and nobody entirely controls a process or aspect anymore. Everything involves a large committee, where anyone can say “no” to anything, but nobody can fully say “yes”.</p><p>Meetings also tend to explode in number: status reports, alignment talks, 1:1s, staff meetings, strategy discussions, context-setting talks, release go/no-go meetings, project reports, etc.</p><p>As a final nail in the coffin, they hire a ton of bad people. People are hired based on whether they’d represent no treat, so any trace of greatness pretty much guarantees a rejection. The ideal hire becomes a mindless all-rounder, who semi-competently does everything they’re told, without any dissent or care for quality. They need hordes of them, to hide among the pack, and so that there are always people to blame. The number of product managers, in particular, skyrockets. A whole hierarchy of PMs, one or more in each team and on each aspect, all behaving the same.</p><h2 id="the-damage">The damage</h2><p>What happens to companies that, by putting mediocre people in charge, start the journey described above? Well, it’s not pretty.</p><p>Anyone with even a speckle of greatness eventually leaves. They either get pushed out by the mediocre dictator, or they leave on their own terms, as the environment has become intolerable to them.</p><p>Work grinds to a halt. Doing anything is suddenly painful, a big commitment, and a risky endeavor. Everybody runs just to stand still. Any grand vision becomes so unrealistic that it’s quickly abandoned. Low-hanging fruits and safe bets become the only work the company does. Even those who are not passionate about their craft feel the pain and eventually leave. Those who are numb enough to remain make the problem worse.</p><p>Slowly but surely, the company loses its best talent, forgets its vision, becomes internally-focused, and drifts into irrelevance. At best, it dies at some point. At worst, it survives in this half-life, turning passionate people into zombies who hate their job.</p><h2 id="a-ray-of-hope">A ray of hope</h2><p>Is there any alternative, then, to finding, hiring, putting in charge, and coping with a tremendous person? If you’re not pushed by greatness and craftsmanship, can you not build a successful product company? Good news is, you can! There’s an alternative model that works.</p><p>You hire everyday great people. Each one needs to be great at something, obsessed by their craft, and driven by quality. You then put them together in a team, without individual responsibilities, ensuring that there’s minimal overlap in areas of greatness. And you pay them to have fun doing what they love doing, in exchange for putting their time and skills at the service of your company.</p><p>These people are still going to be challenging, stubborn, egotistic, quirky, and volatile. But give them good problems to solve, allow them to do great work, and they’ll fully dedicate themselves to making your company successful.</p><h2 id="what-about-leaders-and-product-managers">What about leaders and product managers?</h2><p>Do you need to give up the idea of leaders altogether? Not really, even if you can definitely live without. You could avoid team leads completely, and have area leads as outside-in coordinators. But if you decide that you prefer having a leader responsible for each area, then by all means put a great person in that role. The leader of an area should be the person that gets closer to the various Jobs, Musk, and Bezos, in terms of vision, charisma, intensity, passion, and extreme behavior. Don’t fall into the trap of putting in charge those people who make your life easy in the short term, do what they’re told, and don’t require your attention. A wrong move here, and you risk the situation above.</p><p>And what about product managers? Is there no space for PMs in a well-operating company? Not for the PM role, no. At least not in its traditional meaning. This model still requires great people, passionate and visionary about their area of expertise. And you do need people that obsess about product discovery, product observability, and other areas traditionally delegated to product managers. Almost inevitably, these people will have held a product manager role, and that’s fine. But you’re hiring because of the obsession and the strengths, not because of the title. And you’re not going to give these folks a PM role, but put them in a team with people who obsess over engineering, design, performance, business, and domain knowledge.</p><h2 id="how-much-of-this-was-specific-to-product-managers">How much of this was specific to product managers?</h2><p>I’d be dishonest if I wouldn’t admit that the problems I described happen everytime anyone without vision, charisma, passion, technical skills, and willpower is put in charge. So why the focus on product managers? It’s because of this tendency to wanting people with a product manager title in charge of software product development. To be fair, some PMs I know are absolutely tremendous, and would do very well in both the models I described. But they wouldn’t necessarily do better than other great people, regardless of their background. Also, they’re a tiny minority, and most career PMs are nowhere near being capable of leading by greatness.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<h4>About this book</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Calculus Made Easy is a book on calculus originally published in 1910 by Silvanus P. Thompson, considered a classic and elegant introduction to the subject.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
	I read "Calculus Made Easy" by Silvanus P. Thompson and it's still to this day my inspiration for explaining complex technical topics to lay people. It's a fantastic book, and even if you know math you <em>must</em> read it if you want to understand how to teach complexity to others. <small><em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1299805">(source)</a></em></small>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
	Thompson creates a warm, inviting environment where students will learn and grasp the true essence of calculus without any added fluff or overt technicality. <small><em><a href="http://mathblog.com/mathematics-books/">(source)</a></em></small>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>
	      Most college calculus texts weigh a ton; this one does not — it just gets to the point. This is how I learned calculus: my uncle gave me a copy. <small><em><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home//baez/books.html">(source)</a></em></small>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
              <p>We have successfully created an independent, bit-by-bit-identical rebuild of the <code>nixos-minimal</code> ISO published by Hydra <img src="https://discourse.nixos.org/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=12" title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<h2>
<a name="why-is-this-useful-1" href="#why-is-this-useful-1"></a>Why is this useful?</h2>
<p>While there are a number of ‘side-benefits’, the main point of Reproducible Builds is that it gives us a reliable way to verify the binaries we ship are faithful to their sources, and have not been tampered with anywhere in the build pipeline (e.g. on Hydra).</p>
<p>For general information on Reproducible Builds see:</p>


<h2>
<a name="what-exactly-was-reproduced-2" href="#what-exactly-was-reproduced-2"></a>What exactly was reproduced?</h2>
<p>This means we now have successfully reproduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>All packages that make it into the ISO</li>
<li>The building of the ISO itself</li>
</ul>
<p>The rebuild also built the packages that were needed to build the ISO (but aren’t included in it), rather than relying on cached binaries.</p>
<h2>
<a name="how-did-we-reproduce-3" href="#how-did-we-reproduce-3"></a>How did we reproduce?</h2>
<p>We reproduced <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/build/239408385">this Hydra build</a> by starting a fresh VirtualBox appliance with <a href="https://releases.nixos.org/nixos/20.03/nixos-20.03.1405.a17e021b948/nixos-20.03.1405.a17e021b948-x86_64-linux.ova">NixOS 20.03</a> (adding plenty of CPU and memory, and resizing the disk to about 65G), and then:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--option substitute false</code> makes sure ‘everything’ is built on the machine itself, instead of fetching them from the binary cache.</p>
<h3>
<a name="arent-there-bootstrap-problems-with-the-above-approach-4" href="#arent-there-bootstrap-problems-with-the-above-approach-4"></a>Aren’t there bootstrap problems with the above approach?</h3>
<p>Well, yes: if the 2020 <code>ova</code> or the downloaded <code>git</code> contained elaborate backdoors, those might still be attack vectors. It would have been better to do the rebuild on a fully-<a href="https://bootstrappable.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">bootstrapped</a> system, but we’re not quite <em>there</em> yet - see <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-supply-chain-security-project/34345">this thread</a> for exciting progress in this area. Still, this test gives a high confidence in the reproducibility of the ISO.</p>
<h2>
<a name="werent-we-here-before-5" href="#werent-we-here-before-5"></a>Weren’t we here before?</h2>
<p>You may remember <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-unstable-s-iso-minimal-x86-64-linux-is-100-reproducible/13723">2021 announcement</a> that the minimal ISO was 100% reproducible. While back then we successfully tested that all packages were needed to build the ISO were <em>individually</em> reproducible, <em>actually</em> rebuilding the ISO still introduced differences. This was due to <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/125380">some remaining problems</a> in the hydra cache and the way the ISO was created. By the time we fixed those, regressions had popped up (notably an upstream problem in Python 3.10), and it isn’t until this week that we were back to having everything reproducible and being able to validate the complete chain.</p>
<h2>
<a name="where-to-from-now-6" href="#where-to-from-now-6"></a>Where to from now?</h2>
<p>Successfully rebuilding the minimal ISO once is an extremely satisfying milestone - but a somewhat arbitrary one. There is a lot more to do to reap the benefits of reproducibility, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the hacks above (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263730">nixpkgs#263730</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/9251">nix#9251</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263898">nixpkgs#263898</a>)</li>
<li>Making more packages reproducible. Reproducing the <a href="https://nixos.org/download#download-nixos">other installation media</a> such as the Gnome ISO seem like nice next milestones</li>
<li>Setting up infrastructure so that we can regularly independently rebuild these artifacts</li>
<li>Create tools to share and consume build attestations, such as <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/trustix">trustix</a>
</li>
<li>… what would <em>you</em> like to see? Tell us in this thread!</li>

This is done by running the Linux kernel on a RISC-V (rv32ima) emulator I wrote in Scratch, based off of Cnlohr’s mini-rv32ima emulator.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://experiments.turbowarp.org/next/892602496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turbowarp</a> for results that are actually usable.</p>
<p>To start the emulator (should be run in turbowarp), simply just press the green flag and load your ROM (or don’t to use the Linux kernel) then click the run button and wait for it to boot (takes around 40 seconds on my laptop). The Linux build comes with the usual programs like cat/echo and is fully capable of running shell scripts, but it also comes with a duktape (a JavaScript engine), as well as ed for text editing, and coremark for benchmarking</p>
<p>To use duktape, run “duktape {FILE_NAME}”. For testing, there is already a file called “fizzbuzz.js” that can be run In order to write to files you must use the “ed” text editor, for more information on ed and how to use it look <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=files-using-ed-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

However, there is another Ken Burns effect that is far more important. For 40-odd years Mr Burns has focused America’s attention on some of its most difficult chapters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">His breakout series, “The Civil War” (1990), was watched by nearly 40m viewers on public television, then a record; visits to battlefields more than doubled the next year, says Mr Burns. A bump in visitors&nbsp;also followed “The National Parks” series in 2009. Mr Burns’s subjects include biographies of <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2021/04/07/ernest-hemingway-the-man-the-myth-the-legend">Ernest Hemingway</a> and Thomas Jefferson, as well as histories of baseball, jazz, slavery and the <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/09/15/a-powerful-new-documentary-series-on-the-vietnam-war">Vietnam war</a>. His aim, he says, is to tell the unsanitised story of his country.</p><p data-component="paragraph">His latest, “The American Buffalo”, takes on a double tragedy:  the wanton slaughter of buffaloes living in the Great Plains during the late 19th century and the parallel near-extinction of the Native American tribes that <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/humans-have-altered-other-species-as-well-as-the-environment/21805519">evolved alongside</a> these shaggy beasts for 10,000 years. Steeped in Native American perspectives, it is a tale of destruction and partial recovery unfamiliar to most Americans.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The Cheyenne had 27 words for the animal, which a Spanish conquistador in the 16th century described as numberless as the fish in the sea. The buffalo sustained Native Americans, who used every piece. “We are brothers, we are related,” M. Scott Momaday, a Kiowa poet, says in the film. “We have regard for each other.”</p><p data-component="paragraph">That regard was trampled by the voracious appetite of an <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/12/05/dreams-of-el-dorado-is-a-rollicking-flawed-history-of-america">expanding United States</a>. Between 1805, when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first traversed the continent,<b> </b>and the 1860s, the buffalo’s numbers fell from probably 30m-60m to fewer than 15m. Then, over the next decade, they were almost wiped out. Sharpshooters arrived on the new railroads, seeking hides for leather belts in industrial machines. Buffaloes were “like walking gold pieces”, exclaimed one of those hunters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Years later, Theodore Roosevelt wrote that “the extermination of the buffalo was the only way of solving the Indian question.” Though never an explicit policy, historians agree that army and political leaders tacitly approved of exterminating buffaloes in order to force Native Americans to move to reservations. A quarter of the Blackfeet tribe starved; it was “a death wind for my people”, said Chief Sitting Bull of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/10/31/the-forgotten-empire-of-the-lakota">Lakota Sioux</a>. </p><p data-component="paragraph">In its more uplifting second half, the film looks at efforts to save the buffalo from extinction: by tribal people, conservationists, white supremacists and former hunters haunted by regret. At a time when American history is often contested, Mr Burns says documentaries such as this one have “the possibility of reminding people how complex and contradictory our story is”.<span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies,&nbsp;sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter" target="_blank">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline "(Back) home on the range"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/">Culture</a> <span>October 28th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/26/one-of-berlins-star-attractions-is-closing-for-14-years"><span>One of Berlin’s star attractions is closing for 14 years</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/23/how-superstars-and-heritage-acts-hijacked-the-vinyl-revival"><span>How superstars and heritage acts hijacked the vinyl revival</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/26/cia-plots-coups-and-a-gold-capped-molar-in-congo"><span>CIA plots, coups and a gold-capped molar in Congo</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/25/ken-burns-chronicles-the-sad-fate-of-the-american-buffalo"><span>Ken Burns chronicles the sad fate of the American buffalo</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/26/drug-lords-tombs-are-monuments-to-opulence"><span>Drug lords’ tombs are monuments to opulence</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="America’s test" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231028_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the October 28th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-10-28" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

Besides the pleasure of the din, it is also useful to ecologists. If you want to measure the biodiversity of a piece of land, listening out for animal calls is mucher than grubbing about in the undergrowth looking for tracks or spoor. But such “bioacoustic analysis” is still time-consuming, and it requires an expert pair of ears.</p><p data-component="paragraph">In a paper published on October 17th in <i>Nature Communications</i>, a group of researchers led by Jörg Müller, an ecologist at the University of Würzburg, describe a better way: have a computer do the job. Smartphone apps already exist that will identify birds, bats or mammals simply by listening to the sounds they make. Their idea was to apply the principle to conservation work.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The researchers took recordings from across 43 sites in the Ecuadorean rainforest. Some sites were relatively pristine, old-growth forest. Others were areas that had recently been cleared for pasture or cacao planting. And some had been cleared but then abandoned, allowing the forest to regrow.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Sound recordings were taken four times every hour, over two weeks. The various calls were identified manually by an expert, and then used to construct a list of the species present. As expected, the longer the land had been free from agricultural activity, the greater the biodiversity it hosted.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Then it was the computer’s turn. The researchers fed their recordings to artificial-intelligence models that had been trained, using sound samples from elsewhere in Ecuador, to identify 75 bird species from their calls. “We found that the <small>AI</small> tools could identify the sounds as well as the experts,” says Dr Müller.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Of course, not everything in a rainforest makes a noise. Dr Müller and his colleagues used light-traps to capture night-flying insects, and <small>DNA</small> analysis to identify them. Reassuringly, they found that the diversity of noisy animals was a reliable proxy for the diversity of the quieter ones, too.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The results may have relevance outside ecology departments, too. Under pressure from their customers, firms such as L’Oreal, a make-up company, and Shell, an oil firm, have been spending money on forest restoration projects around the world. Dr Müller hopes that an automated approach to checking on the results could help monitor such efforts, and give a standardised way to measure whether they are working as well as their sponsors say.<span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Curious about the world?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A mental model for service businesses.</p><div>
<p>A few years back, my team decided to get a custom meeting room table. In our search for something great, we were referred to a small studio that does great work: East Vancouver’s <a href="https://www.unionwoodco.com/">Union Wood Co</a>.</p>

<p>The team there met with us, showed us various samples, and asked thoughtful questions about what we needed.  When I asked if a table could be made to a custom shape – a superelliptical rectangle – they were all for it <em>and</em> totally <a href="https://twitter.com/steamclocksw/status/1202383942248095744">pulled it off</a>.</p>

<p>Afterward, sitting at this delightful table, I reflected on why it came together so well. Getting something custom-built can often be the path of frustration and expensive surprises, yet our experience was a delight. Was it because the furniture makers were experts? No. Was it because they charged a lot of money? No.</p>

<p>It was because they gave a shit.</p>

<p>In some ways, that’s the fundamental value proposition of a small boutique, whether it be a furniture shop or a software studio. Giving a shit as a service. Sure, you can always get a commodity good from off the shelf – when you’re selling soybean oil by the 100-ton lot, nobody wants to have a conversation with you about the subtle flavour profiles of different bean oils. But sometimes, you want to buy from someone that’s obsessed about the final product.</p>

<p>I used to puzzle over why potential clients who reached out to me always seemed to get <em>more</em> interested in hiring us if I tried to dissuade them by asking challenging questions. I think the biggest reason is that pushing back demonstrated that I care. If you email 4 software studios for a quote and 3 say “Sure, here’s a quote” but the 4th says “Hm, we certainly could build it but we can’t be sure about cost without knowing X and Y, and here are some other concerns we’d have” then the 4th is going to seem like they give a shit.</p>

<p>So, I suppose the moral of the story is: find yourself work you can give a shit about. And work with people who give a shit. It’ll make shit a lot more pleasant – I guarantee it.</p>

Instead a function called </span><span>dnc_copyin</span><span> is called, which does proper bounds checks.</span></p><p><span>So someone (at Nintendo?) fixed this several years before INFRA:HALT was discovered and disclosed? <b>Well, they tried!</b></span></p><p><span>As we can see from the full code above there are two places where </span><span>dnc_set_answer</span><span> is called. The first one for answer records and the second one for additional records pointing to the first answer.<b> But they only added the check for the first one?!</b></span></p><p><span>The second one still blindly calls </span><span>dnc_set_answer</span><span> without doing any size checks.</span></p><h3><span>Exploiting it on the Wii U <br></span></h3><p><span>After writing a quick PoC server to confirm this actually works on a Wii U, I decided to try and exploit this.</span></p><p><span>Since the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct is stored on the heap, this is a basic heap overflow.&nbsp;</span><span>The Wii U added a few additional fields to the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct, which we can overwrite.</span><span> Due to the NET stack running on the ARM co-processor, the Wii U later copies this entire struct back to the PPC side using an address stored in a reply struct. </span><span>Unfortunately to overwrite the pointer to this reply struct, we would need to spoof a reply struct and point to it. Since the heap layout is determined by various network setup specific factors we have no idea where in the heap this </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct is allocated. So we need a way to store a buffer at a location in memory which we know the address </span><span>of</span><span>.<br></span></p><h3>Introducing DNS over TCP</h3><div><p>This doesn't seem to be part of NicheStack, but the Wii U features support for DNS over TCP instead of UDP. After two attempts of using UDP, the Wii U will switch to TCP if the truncated flag was set in the DNS header. For TCP support more fields were added to the <span>dns_querys</span><span> struct, one of them is a pointer to a buffer in which the received TCP data is stored.</span></p><p><span>So just overwrite this with an address in the stack and we can receive data into the stack? Unfortunately, no. Before storing data into this buffer it is resized using </span><span>IOS_HeapRealloc</span><span> (basically </span><span>realloc</span><span>), if it isn't </span><span>NULL</span><span>. If the heap block is already the same size as the reallocated size, the same pointer is returned though. This allows us to take over already allocated blocks inside of the heap but limits us to stay in bounds of the heap. If we point the receive buffer to one of the already allocated packet buffers at the start of the heap, which will always have the same address, we can receive data into a known memory location (limited by the MTU and TCP/IP fragmentation).<br></span></p><p><span>Remember the reply struct which is pointed to by the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct? We now have a known memory location at which we can create a fake reply struct which points the reply buffer to anywhere in IOS-NET memory. <b>This causes the entire </b></span><b><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct to be copied to anywhere we want and we can control&nbsp;</span><span><span data-dobid="hdw">approximately</span></span><span> 256 bytes in this struct!</span></b></p><p><b><span><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJfhtSiAcGNa460z1cpWG2IVuW4uba0uWts652-RjxWX8nlmfsllfA36Efexv1OnpkvO4_v4zhJWJuX4gDoa0dQx447i2slzQWysIeEKHjPAg9xhFRCpaeYXfiPXFnGpKkIT947XHDk5Xigf4FEN6Pt126tQtu7rGRBdBJVQgimBI92b3O6-EgVMCABRY"><img alt="" data-original-height="186" data-original-width="1082" height="110" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJfhtSiAcGNa460z1cpWG2IVuW4uba0uWts652-RjxWX8nlmfsllfA36Efexv1OnpkvO4_v4zhJWJuX4gDoa0dQx447i2slzQWysIeEKHjPAg9xhFRCpaeYXfiPXFnGpKkIT947XHDk5Xigf4FEN6Pt126tQtu7rGRBdBJVQgimBI92b3O6-EgVMCABRY=w640-h110" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Memory layout showing </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> copying.</span><br></td></tr></tbody></table></span></b></p><h3><span>Creating a ROP Chain</span><b><span> <br></span></b></h3><p><span>Since the Wii U features no-execute on the ARM side, we need to write a ROP chain which performs a kernel exploit.

<p>Recently a shoe store in France ran a promotion called “Rob It to Get It”, which invited customers to try to steal something by grabbing it and running out of the store. But there was a catch — the “security guard” was a professional sprinter, Méba Mickael Zeze. As you would expect, he is fast, but you might not appreciate how much faster he is than an average runner, or even a good runner.</p>



<p>Why? That’s the topic of Chapter 4 of <em><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/probably-overthinking-it/">Probably Overthinking It</a></em>, which is <a href="https://amzn.to/3Kp629E">available for preorder now</a>. Here’s an excerpt.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Running Speeds</h2>



<p>If you are a fan of the Atlanta Braves, a Major League Baseball team, or if you watch enough videos on the internet, you have probably seen one of the most popular forms of between-inning entertainment: a foot race between one of the fans and a spandex-suit-wearing mascot called the Freeze.</p>



<p>The route of the race is the dirt track that runs across the outfield, a distance of about 160 meters, which the Freeze runs in less than 20 seconds. To keep things interesting, the fan gets a head start of about 5 seconds. That might not seem like a lot, but if you watch one of these races, this lead seems insurmountable. However, when the Freeze starts running, you immediately see the difference between a pretty good runner and a very good runner. With few exceptions, the Freeze runs down the fan, overtakes them, and coasts to the finish line with seconds to spare.</p>



<p>Here are some examples:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxXypNqiS5A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>But as fast as he is, the Freeze is not even a professional runner; he is a member of the Braves’ ground crew named Nigel Talton. In college, he ran 200 meters in 21.66 seconds, which is very good. But the 200 meter collegiate record is 20.1 seconds, set by Wallace Spearmon in 2005, and the current world record is 19.19 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2009.</p>



<p>To put all that in perspective, let’s start with me. For a middle-aged man, I am a decent runner. When I was 42 years old, I ran my best-ever 10 kilometer race in 42:44, which was faster than 94% of the other runners who showed up for a local 10K. Around that time, I could run 200 meters in about 30 seconds (with wind assistance).</p>



<p>But a good high school runner is faster than me. At a recent meet, the fastest girl at a nearby high school ran 200 meters in about 27 seconds, and the fastest boy ran under 24 seconds.</p>



<p>So, in terms of speed, a fast high school girl is 11% faster than me, a fast high school boy is 12% faster than her; Nigel Talton, in his prime, was 11% faster than him, Wallace Spearmon was about 8% faster than Talton, and Usain Bolt is about 5% faster than Spearmon.</p>



<p>Unless you are Usain Bolt, there is always someone faster than you, and not just a little bit faster; they are much faster. The reason is that the distribution of running speed is not Gaussian — It is more like lognormal.</p>



<p>To demonstrate, I’ll use data from the James Joyce Ramble, which is the 10 kilometer race where I ran my previously-mentioned personal record time. I downloaded the times for the 1,592 finishers and converted them to speeds in kilometers per hour. The following figure shows the distribution of these speeds on a logarithmic scale, along with a Gaussian model I fit to the data.</p>

<p>The logarithms follow a Gaussian distribution, which means the speeds themselves are lognormal. You might wonder why. Well, I have a theory, based on the following assumptions:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, everyone has a maximum speed they are capable of running, assuming that they train effectively.</li>



<li>Second, these speed limits can depend on many factors, including height and weight, fast- and slow-twitch muscle mass, cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility and elasticity, and probably more.</li>



<li>Finally, the way these factors interact tends to be multiplicative; that is, each person’s speed limit depends on the product of multiple factors.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s why I think speed depends on a product rather than a sum of factors. If all of your factors are good, you are fast; if any of them are bad, you are slow. Mathematically, the operation that has this property is multiplication.</p>



<p>For example, suppose there are only two factors, measured on a scale from 0 to 1, and each person’s speed limit is determined by their product. Let’s consider three hypothetical people:</p>



<ul>
<li>The first person scores high on both factors, let’s say 0.9. The product of these factors is 0.81, so they would be fast.</li>



<li>The second person scores relatively low on both factors, let’s say 0.3. The product is 0.09, so they would be quite slow.</li>
</ul>



<p>So far, this is not surprising: if you are good in every way, you are fast; if you are bad in every way, you are slow. But what if you are good in some ways and bad in others?</p>



<ul>
<li>The third person scores 0.9 on one factor and 0.3 on the other. The product is 0.27, so they are a little bit faster than someone who scores low on both factors, but much slower than someone who scores high on both.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a property of multiplication: the product depends most strongly on the smallest factor. And as the number of factors increases, the effect becomes more dramatic.</p>



<p>To simulate this mechanism, I generated five random factors from a Gaussian distribution and multiplied them together. I adjusted the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussians so that the resulting distribution fit the data; the following figure shows the results.</p>

<p>The simulation results fit the data well. So this example demonstrates a second mechanism [the first is described earlier in the chapter] that can produce lognormal distributions: the limiting power of the weakest link. If there are at least five factors affect running speed, and each person’s limit depends on their worst factor, that would explain why the distribution of running speed is lognormal.</p>



<p>And that’s why you can’t beat the Freeze.</p>

He recently split from a long-term partner and even what he describes as a sense of forboding, “that I’m fated to end up alone”, was not enough to drive him back to dating apps. The spam, bots and fake accounts are tough enough to contend with, he says, and that’s before all the issues with being assessed for attractiveness based on six pictures and a few lines of text.</p><p>“It does not matter how handsome or beautiful or charming you are, there is this underlying tension that you are 10 swipes away from a person that outranks you on the conventional beauty and charisma scale. It’s enough to make you feel all the insecurities that you haven’t needed to swallow since you were a teenager and a whole ream of new adult ones,” he says.</p><p>But with the apps being so embedded in the culture of modern dating, where else can single people turn to meet the love of their life, or even have a quick fling?</p><hr><p><span>N</span>ottinghamshire pharmacist Kevin Inglesant is one of many people who have struggled to make connections online. He has tried Bumble, Match, Badoo and Facebook dating, but in nearly three years has only met one person, with whom he had six dates before the relationship ended.</p><p>“The vast majority of matches have resulted in no dialogue,” says the 38-year-old. “With most of the rest there was a bit of to and fro before being ghosted. It’s quite soul-destroying.”</p><p>The new rules of dating mean approaching strangers in public is more frowned upon than it was previously, though he has found a potentially promising solution. “I came across an ad for the <a href="https://pearring.co/" data-link-name="in body link">Pear ring</a> on Facebook,” he says, referring to a pale green silicone ring that can be worn on any finger as a sign that the wearer is happy to be approached, in what its makers describe as “the world’s biggest single social experiment”.</p><p>“It was about £20, and honestly I haven’t seen anyone else wearing one and the only people who have asked me about it were people who already know me, know that I don’t generally wear jewellery and were curious. I think I need to wear it more in situations where I’ll be meeting new people before I can make a judgment as to how effective this technique is – and wait for the idea to become more widely known as well.”</p><p>Putting a new spin on an old-fashioned approach also appeals to Katy, a 37-year-old who lives in London, works for a charity, and says the apps had made her forget how to flirt. “So I’ve given myself the challenge of flirting with one person every day, which has been a lot of fun,” she says. “It’s made me realise that so many people are wrapped up in their phones, and aren’t aware of people around them, which is quite sad. I’ve had some fun interactions, and while it hasn’t brought me any dates – yet – that’s not the goal. I’m in absolutely no hurry to bring dating apps back into my life.”</p><p>Many say the apps feel like work and there is a genuine sense of burnout as people struggle to commit to what is essentially hours of admin a week alongside their day jobs and other responsibilities. And even those who have their pick of matches have found themselves having an unenjoyable experience.</p><p>“I was getting a torrent of likes – and I absolutely hated it,” says Sophie, 33, a London-based writer who used Hinge for more than a year before ditching it. “I’d try not to be too picky based on superficial qualities because I’m simply looking for an interesting or creative person, and that’s one thing you can’t spot easily on an app, but then I’d get too many matches, which was really overwhelming. I’d end up ghosting them all, which I felt really guilty about.”</p><figure id="a0bc039f-c470-4851-a10c-f2733307ace6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="An illustration of hearts" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><p>She has tried Tinder (“even worse”) and at one point attempted to join <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raya/id957215308" data-link-name="in body link">Raya</a>, which markets itself as a “private community” of “exciting people”, though it is better known as the celebrity dating app. It is where Lily Allen met her husband, the Stranger Things actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/03/david-harbour-marvel-black-widow-stranger-things-jim-hopper" data-link-name="in body link">David Harbour</a>. Ben Affleck and Matthew Perry have also been Raya users.</p><p>“I tried to join that app because I wanted something more exclusive, but it was too exclusive to let me in,” she laughs. “After that I just gave up. I’d been clinging for so long to stories of friends who met their significant others on an app and I just had to let it go.”</p><p>After a “very humbling year” expecting to meet someone organically, she is now taking a bolder approach. “I started asking friends and acquaintances if there’s anyone they can set me up with.</p><p>When being single comes up in conversation, you naturally want to say, ‘It’s cool, I’m enjoying my independence, I’m sure I’ll meet someone soon,’ and it can be excruciating to say, ‘Actually I’m really unhappy and I’m desperately trying to meet someone’ – but I’ve learned that’s kind of the best thing to do.</p><p>“You really have to set some standards – people can be so keen to help that they tend to overestimate how good-looking or interesting their mates are, or they try to suggest the only single person they know, no matter how unsuitable – but it has worked quite well. It’s so easy to get an idea of whether you’ll click. I’ve had dates with two people through mutual friends so far, both musicians weirdly, and one of them has some potential.”</p><p>In a similar way, family might fill that role for Jeevan, a 30-year-old IT worker, who says his Indian parents had offered to set him up when he was younger. He had always declined, but is now reconsidering. “It’s not something I wanted to do before, but now I’m finding time has caught up with me a bit and I’m in a position where I do want to meet a partner. I think I’m going to keep trying for a couple more years, and if that doesn’t work, I will ask them.”</p><p>The benefit of meeting someone vouched for is also driving Clare, 38, from Bath, to explore her options, after having signed up to numerous dating apps over the years, only to quit after a few months each time. She always felt uneasy about meeting a person who is completely unknown, beyond a first name and age, which are not always genuine. She says: “It’s a bad platform for people with trust issues like myself as I don’t like meeting total strangers. You are meeting outside of any community accountability – so people are also generally a bit shitter in their ethics.</p><p>“There’s also the issue of selection,” she adds. “I connect with people strongly in real life I’d never have selected on a dating app. Either they would be too young, too hot, or unattractive on an app. People are so much more magic in real life.”</p><figure id="1b48a1c7-ecf8-434e-84ba-f14cff32a687" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man and a woman looking at each other enthusiastically" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="414.98946259220236" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><p>She has done slow dating at Shambala festival, with an emphasis on doing exercises that could help to make emotional connections, including questions like, “What are you most proud of in your life?” and “What’s the biggest challenge you’ve overcome?”</p><p>However, her favourite thing was a workshop called The Art of Flirting: “Essentially a workshop full of (mostly) single people having their confidence built up collectively through playful exercises with a fair amount of emotional risk. For example, we had to walk in our most confident, flirtatious manner towards people and note how we felt about it. The big takeaway was how essential risk, self-confidence and not taking it too seriously were – maybe more like dating skills.”</p><p>She is keen to try more. “My friend mentioned events she went to in London that involved bringing your single friend to take the pressure off.” These events, such as Conscious Dating’s <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/conscious-dating-bring-a-friend-movie-meal-drinks-chat-social-mixer-tickets-704699584427" data-link-name="in body link">Bring-a-Friend nights</a>, usually involve bringing another single person of a different gender to ensure the room has an even split, but there are lots of variations.</p><p>Clare is not alone – the demand for more face-to-face interactions is increasing. Figures from Eventbrite shared with the Guardian show the number of dating or singles events in the UK has doubled since before the start of the pandemic. The event management company attributes this rise to both people wanting more physical connection after lockdown and the growing fatigue with dating apps.</p><p>Some events now focus on precise groups, such as black lesbians or divorced Muslim professionals, while others offer a twist, including speed-dating events that revolve around being naked, playing Jenga while drunk, playing video games or bringing your dogs.</p><p>Some people prefer something more simple, with fewer expectations. Stef began using the app Meetup, normally used to meet people in a friendly setting usually around a passion or interest, when she first moved to Paris. She has been hit on a few times at meet-ups, “which has been so nice honestly”.</p><p>“You have the opportunity to meet heaps of other cute, single people in real life with no stuffy or awkward first-date vibes because if you don’t click with someone, you can just excuse yourself and chat with someone else,” she says. “I sometimes think they must be what 1970s mixers were like. Just lots of fun chats with new people and wine – perfect. I haven’t met the love of my life yet, but I feel like I’m very close.”</p><hr><p><span>B</span>ut, for a lot of single people, the problems with the apps run deeper than being time-consuming and fruitless. Political journalist and writer Lucy Webster describes how she faced harassment and unpleasant comments about her disability when using dating apps.</p><p>“I’d get a lot of comments about being a wheelchair user, most of which were of the ‘Can you have sex?’ variety. I would just block them instantly, because what’s the point?” says Webster.</p><p>She describes how the superficiality of apps encourages ableism, because there are no consequences to unkind or abusive behaviour. “They’re not doing it in public and they’re not going to get banned for saying they don’t want to date a wheelchair user. It just encourages this awful, unacceptable behaviour,” she says. “Eventually I just thought, ‘What the hell am I doing?’”</p><figure id="40bab240-a68c-4d64-9d15-7f1c2d6ebc83" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:41,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/31/a-friend-said-it-gave-them-hope-four-ways-to-find-love-without-the-apps&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘A friend said it gave them hope’: four ways to find love – without the apps&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;40bab240-a68c-4d64-9d15-7f1c2d6ebc83&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:4,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>But her options outside the apps have been limited, too. Webster went viral in 2021 when she was left in tears after being told by a personal matchmaking service to reconsider joining as people may refuse dates with someone who uses a wheelchair. This meant, that in their words, “achieving good outcomes for full‑time wheelchair user clients can be quite challenging”. She says: “I renounced the whole thing and very quickly found my mental health was much better. I haven’t thought about getting back on a dating app or dating since, and I’m not really miserable any more.”</p><p>Many readers got in touch with the Guardian with similar stories about finding contentment away from the pressures of trying to date.</p><p>Erica Smart from Banbury gave up dating apps a year ago after spending a decade using them. “I have never regretted this, despite knowing that various friends have met their spouses and long-term partners through them – something that I would still dearly love to have. However, I am at peace with the idea that I may never meet someone. If it happens, great. But if not, I’m also content with that. Having a partner can bring happiness, but also stress,” says the 42-year-old.</p><p>In fact, there is a surprising sense of optimism among those who have said goodbye to the apps. For Emma Chappell, 42, doing enjoyable, fulfilling activities may lead to a date, even though her choir sessions and nature walks have yet to yield any opportunities. “At least joining things and learning a new skill or having a fun night out is more worthwhile. And you have that thought of, ‘You never know.’” She adds: “Life is for living, after all, not sitting behind a screen waiting for life to start.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p dir="auto">Today our code signing certificate will expire. For many years <a href="https://www.leaderssl.nl/" rel="nofollow">LeaderSSL</a> sponsored us with a code singing certificate but they are no longer able to do so. Since June of 2023 the CA/B Forum requires that OV code signing private keys be stored on a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Common Criteria Level EAL4+ certified device. This means we are no longer able to export our code signing certificate with its private key and use this in GitHub actions. We would now either need to have our own GitHub agent and hardware token or use a cloud solution (e.g. <a href="https://docs.digicert.com/en/software-trust-manager/ci-cd-integrations/plugins/github-custom-action-for-keypair-signing.html" rel="nofollow">digicert</a>). Our preference would be to use a cloud solution that integrates with GitHub. Digicert seems to be our only option now but a certificate there would cost <a href="https://order.digicert.com/step1/code_signing" rel="nofollow">$629</a> (tax excluded) for a single year. If your organization requires a signed installer then please consider sponsoring us with a code signing certificate.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2021, at the height of cryptocurrency mining, Nvidia released the Nvidia
CMP 170HX. Designed as a compute-only card to accelerate Ethereum’s
memory-hard <em>Ethash</em> Proof-of-Work mining algorithm with its 1500 GB/s
HBM2e memory bus, Nvidia implemented the hardware using the <em>GA100</em> silicon
from their <em>Ampere</em> architecture. Thus, the CMP 170HX is essentially a
variant of the all-mighty Nvidia A100, Nvidia’s top-performing datacenter
GPU at that time.</p>
<p>Naturally, the existence of the CMP 170HX raised many questions, including
its potential in applications beyond mining. Today, following the
discontinuation of <em>Ethash</em>, these $5000 GPUs from closed mining farms are
sold on second-hand markets for $400-$500 in China. It’s time to
answer these questions.</p>
<p>This article contains a basic performance overview, a hardware teardown,
a watercooling installation guide, and a repair log.</p>
<h3 id="performance-overview">Performance Overview</h3>
<h4 id="hardware-specification">Hardware Specification</h4>
<p>The Nvidia CMP 170HX contains 8960 shaders. Without artificial limitations
on instruction throughput, these shaders should reach a peak FP32 performance
of 25 TFLOPS.</p>
<pre><code>------------------------ Device specifications ------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<h4 id="memory-bandwidth">Memory Bandwidth</h4>
<p><code>clpeak</code> shows the Nvidia CMP 170HX has a peak memory bandwidth of 1355 GB/s for
real without any downsizing. Thanks to the use of HBM2e and a wide bus, this is
right now the GPU with the fastest memory that money can buy at an affordable price.
The speed is nearly identical to the Nvidia A100 (HBM2e), and ~1.5x as fast as
the current top customer-grade GPUs, including the Nvidia RTX 4090 (GDDR6X),
AMD Radeon 7900 XTX (GDDR6), or the AMD Radeon VII / Instinct MI50 (HBM2), which
all topped out at “only” 700-800 GB/s with their 1 TB/s memory buses.</p>
<pre><code>Global memory bandwidth (GBPS)
  float   : 1165.79
  float2  : 1269.69
  float4  : 1343.50
  float8  : 1355.40
  float16 : 1350.14
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is where all the good news ends.</p>
<h4 id="floating-point-performance">Floating-Point Performance</h4>
<h5 id="fp32--fp64-with-fma-clpeak-standard-version">FP32 &amp; FP64 with FMA (<code>clpeak</code>, standard version)</h5>
<p>To measure the peak floating-point performance of a processor, most benchmarks
use the Multiply-Add operation in the form of <code>a * b + c</code> in their compute
kernels (i.e. inner loop) which is accelerated by the <em>Fused Multiply-Add</em> (FMA)
or <em>Multiply-Add</em> (MAD) instructions in most processors - <code>clpeak</code> is not
an exception.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tests show heavy performance restrictions on FMA and MAD
floating-point operations, with a FP32 FMA speed of 394 GFLOPS and a FP64 FMA speed of 182
GFLOPS. The FP32 FMA performance is 1/100 of today’s high-end GPUs. To put
this into perspective, this is not only slower than the Nvidia GTX 280 GPU
from 15 years ago - it’s even slower than a 2020s multi-core CPU (&gt; 1 TFLOPS).</p>
<p>This kind of restrictions is often applied to FP64 performance on customer-grade
GPUs to prevent their use in computing workloads, but for the CMP 170HX,
FP32 basically received the same treatment.</p>
<pre><code>Single-precision compute (GFLOPS)
  float   : 394.77
  float2  : 394.77
  float4  : 394.77
  float8  : 394.77
  float16 : 394.77

No half precision support! Skipped

Double-precision compute (GFLOPS)
  double   : 182.72
  double2  : 182.55
  double4  : 182.19
  double8  : 181.48
  double16 : 180.08
</code></pre>
<h5 id="fp32-and-fp64-without-fma-clpeak-modified-version">FP32 and FP64 without FMA (<code>clpeak</code>, modified version)</h5>
<p>Upon further investigation using a self-written benchmark, I found regular
FP32 add or multiply is not restricted by that much. Thus, using a
non-standard and patched version of clpeak without the use of FMA
instructions entirely, the following results are obtained.</p>
<pre><code>Single-precision compute (GFLOPS)
  float   : 6285.48
  float2  : 6287.64
  float4  : 6294.30
  float8  : 6268.80
  float16 : 6252.80

No half precision support! Skipped

Double-precision compute (GFLOPS)
  double   : 94.98
  double2  : 94.93
  double4  : 94.84
  double8  : 94.65
  double16 : 94.29
</code></pre>
<p>Without FMA, the FP32 performance is around 6250 GFLOPS. 6250 GFLOPS is
around the speed of a current low-end desktop GPU such as an RTX 2060, or
an old high-end GPU from yesteryear, such as a Titan X (Maxwell).</p>
<p>This is rather low but may still be very acceptable, since many physics
simulations for scientific and engineering applications do not benefit
from improved core performance in terms of FLOPS, and instead are
primarily limited by memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FP64 performance is now even lower without FMA, at a
nearly useless level of 94 GFLOPS. Thus, one may argue that it’s
useless for HPC uses. However, the use of FP64 is not always
required depending on the research subject. For many Partial Differential
Equation solvers for physics simulation, FP32 is in fact the standard.
First, the meshing and discretization errors are often much larger
sources of error, not to mention that FP64 would slow down these already
memory-bound simulations even further. Thus, FP32-only GPUs still have
their uses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the case of CMP 170HX, it can be difficult if not
impossible to disable FMA in practice. Modifying the applications (and
possibly also its runtime) is already challenging enough, but even if
both conditions are feasible when they are often not, the problem of
standard libraries remain. Most HPC libraries contain hand-tuned
routines that heavily rely on FMA.
Not to mention that removing FMA changes the rounding behavior from
1 rounding to 2 roundings,
thus potentially compromising the numerical integrity of a simulation
and making it untrustworthy if the code was written in a way that
requires FMA to preserve precision
(see <em>Appendix</em> at the end of the
article on the technical details of modifying the OpenCL/SYCL/CUDA
runtime).</p>
<p>Thus, to achieve the goal of preventing the use of these GPUs in general
compute applications, Nvidia decided to simply throttle the FMA
throughput. This way, these GPUs are incompatible with most pre-existing

restrictions that may affect their intended mining applications.</p>
<h5 id="fp16-mixbench-sycl-version">FP16 (<code>mixbench</code>, SYCL version)</h5>
<p>Half-precision is unsupported by Nvidia’s OpenCL runtime but it’s accessible
via CUDA or SYCL (with a CUDA backend). According to <code>mixbench</code>, FP16
performance is around ~42 TFLOPS (41869 GFLOPS), and the use of FMA or
not doesn’t seem to affect the result.</p>
<p>FP16 performance is restricted in the same way to a level similar
to a low-end GPU: ~42 TFLOPS (41869 GFLOPS). The use of FMA or not doesn’t
seem to affect the outcome.</p>
<h5 id="mixed-precision">Mixed-Precision</h5>
<p>For mixed-precision FP32 computation, <code>gpu_burn</code> achieved 6.2 TFLOPS
when the “Tensor Cores” option is enabled. When <code>gpu_burn</code> is instructed
to use Tensor Cores, the flag <code>CUBLAS_TENSOR_OP_MATH</code> (a.k.a
<code>CUBLAS_COMPUTE_32F_FAST_16F</code>) is set before calling the matrix multiplication
routines in cuBLAS.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Since the performance is the same as standard non-FMA FP32 throughput
as I previously showed, I have to conclude that the Tensor Cores probably
aren’t working or at least not useful. All <code>CUBLAS_TENSOR_OP_MATH</code> is
preventing cuBLAS from using the standard FP32 FMA code path and
avoiding the FMA performance lockdown, but it has no additional benefits.</p>
<p>Other Tensor Core modes are currently untested, more tests are needed
to confirm the status of Tensor Cores. Benchmark suggestions are welcomed.</p>
<h4 id="integer-performance">Integer Performance</h4>
<p>Given the focus of this GPU on mining, which is an integer workload,
let’s also take a look at its integer performance as well.</p>
<h5 id="clpeak">clpeak</h5>
<p>The Nvidia CMP 170HX shows a reasonable integer performance of 12500
GIOPS (12.5 TIOPS), almost as fast as the RTX 2080 Ti (15 TIOPS), and
62.5% as fast as the Nvidia A100 (20 TIOPS).</p>
<pre><code>Integer compute (GIOPS)
  int   : 12499.07
  int2  : 12518.02
  int4  : 12494.16
  int8  : 12547.55
  int16 : 12540.22
</code></pre>
<h5 id="hashcat">Hashcat</h5>
<p>As previously mentioned, standard tests or benchmarks use floating-point
operators which are unsuitable for stress-testing this GPU. On the other
hand, an all-integer workload like hashcat ought to do it:</p>
<pre><code>-------------------
* Hash-Mode 0 (MD5)
-------------------

Speed.#1.........: 43930.0 MH/s (53.01ms) @ Accel:64 Loops:512 Thr:1024 Vec:1
</code></pre>
<p>The hashcat performance closely mirrors the <code>clpeak</code> result, it’s 67% as fast
as the Nvidia A100 (~64900 MH/s). Nevertheless, password crackers should probably
look elsewhere, as even an RTX 3080 runs faster at 54000.1 MH/s.</p>
<p>Remember that hashing or password cracking is a pure compute-bound application,
of which the HBM2e memory is not useful. Ethereum’s <em>Ethash</em> is memory-bound
only because it involves constantly reading a large Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).</p>
<h4 id="simulation-performance">Simulation Performance</h4>
<p>Many physics simulations are often memory-bound, most are already running at 1%
to 10% of a CPU’s peak FLOPS with no hope of saturating the FPU due to the iterative
timestepping nature of the algorithm. Thus, many programmers in this field (myself
included) dislike the <em>FLOPS maximalist</em> attitude on processor performance, seeing
it as a shallow view taken by outsiders.</p>
<p>Thus, perhaps the slow FLOPS on the CMP 170HX can be a non-issue or at least not a
serious issue for these use cases? Since this is what I purchased this GPU for, let’s
give it a try.</p>
<h5 id="fluidx3d-with-fma">FluidX3D (with FMA)</h5>
<p>FluidX3D is a Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver in the field of Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD). The kernel of this algorithm is a 3-dimension, 19-point <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_Stencil_Loops">stencil</a>.
Its performance in FP32/FP32 mode is:</p>
<pre><code>|---------.-------'-----.-----------.-------------------.---------------------|
| MLUPs   | Bandwidth   | Steps/s   | Current Step      | Time Remaining      |
|    2276 |    348 GB/s |       136 |         9999  90% |                  0s |
|---------'-------------'-----------'-------------------'---------------------|

</code></pre>
<p>At 2276 MLUPs/s, the performance is similar to the GeForce RTX 3060 (2108 MLUPS)
even though the RTX 3060’s FP32 throughput is 12500 GFLOPS. In this application,
the RTX 3060’s 360 GB/s of memory bandwidth is severely limiting its performance,
allowing the CMP 170X to match it even if it’s much slower in terms of FP32 FLOPS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 1500 GB/s HBM2e didn’t enable the CMP 170HX to become the world’s
top-performing FluidX3D platform either, because it has the opposite problem -
the locked-down FP32 performance is so slow on this GPU, it turns Lattice Boltzmann
Method from a memory-bound kernel to a compute-bound kernel, the GPU can’t work
faster than 348 GB/s.</p>
<p>This is further illustrated by running FluidX3D in two bandwidth-saving,
mixed-precision modes.</p>
<p>FP32/FP16S:</p>
<pre><code>|---------.-------'-----.-----------.-------------------.---------------------|
| MLUPs   | Bandwidth   | Steps/s   | Current Step      | Time Remaining      |
|    2250 |    173 GB/s |       134 |         9996  60% |                  0s |
|---------'-------------'-----------'-------------------'---------------------|

</code></pre>
<p>FP32/FP16C:</p>

|---------'-------------'-----------'-------------------'---------------------|
| Info: Peak MLUPs/s = 2266
</code></pre>
<p>As one can see, running simulations at reduced precision to reduce memory traffic
has no effect on simulation speed on the CMP 170HX. On the other hand, FluidX3D’s
performance is doubled on the RTX 3060 to 4070 MLUPs/s (FP32/FP16S) and 3566 (FP32/FP16C).
Still, note that the CMP 170HX is only 2x slower than the RTX 3060, not 30x slower
as its FLOPS may suggest.</p>
<h5 id="fluidx3d-without-fma">FluidX3D (without FMA)</h5>
<p>Thanks to hints from FluidX3D’s author Dr. Moritz Lehmann, I was able to remove
the FMA usages from FluidX3D by modifying two lines of code.</p>
<p>After this change, FluidX3D is able to unleash the full power of Nvidia’s GA100
silicon in FP32/FP32 mode:</p>
<pre><code>|---------.-------'-----.-----------.-------------------.---------------------|
| MLUPs   | Bandwidth   | Steps/s   | Current Step      | Time Remaining      |
|    7681 |   1175 GB/s |       458 |         9985  50% |                  0s |
|---------'-------------'-----------'-------------------'---------------------|
| Info: Peak MLUPs/s = 7684 
</code></pre>
<p>This is 90% as fast as a real Nvidia A100’s 8526 MLUPs/s (40 GB, PCIe version).</p>
<p>According to Dr. Moritz Lehmann, although FluidX3D uses FMA to improve performance
and to avoid unnecessary loss of precision, but the main errors in a simulation are
discretization errors, not floating-point errors. Thus, with a no-FMA workaround,
the CMP 170HX becomes a performance-leading GPU for FluidX3D simulations.</p>
<p>In mixed-precision FP32/FP16S mode, the CMP 170HX’s performance is equally impressive.
The simulation speed is 80% as fast as the Nvidia A100 (16035 MLUPs/s), and 10% faster
than the RTX 4090 (11091 MLUPs/s), thanks to GA100’s high memory bandwidth:</p>
<pre><code>|---------.-------'-----.-----------.-------------------.---------------------|
| MLUPs   | Bandwidth   | Steps/s   | Current Step      | Time Remaining      |
|   12386 |    954 GB/s |       738 |         9997  70% |                  0s |

</code></pre>
<p>The mixed-precision FP32/FP16C mode does not perform as well, likely due to the use
of a custom floating-point format that needs many additional calculations in a way
that exceeds the 6200 GFLOPS hardware restriction (it’s also possible that other
floating-point operations have different limits).</p>
<pre><code>|---------.-------'-----.-----------.-------------------.---------------------|
| MLUPs   | Bandwidth   | Steps/s   | Current Step      | Time Remaining      |
|    6853 |    528 GB/s |       408 |         9985  50% |                  0s |

</code></pre>
<p>But this should not be a serious limitation as the accuracy of FP32/FP16C and
FP32/FP16S are comparable in most but a few edge cases.</p>
<h5 id="fdtd-work-in-progress-to-be-added-into-openems">FDTD (work in progress, to be added into openEMS)</h5>
<p>openEMS is a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) solver in the field of Computational
Electromagnetics (CEM) for simulating Maxwell’s equations. The kernel of this
algorithm is a 3-dimension, 7-point <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_Stencil_Loops">stencil</a>.
I’m currently working on a GPU-accelerated engine to increase its performance with the
hope to advance the state of the art of free and open circuit board design tools.</p>
<p>Let’s run
my minimal test kernel (disclaimer: it’s not meant to represent practical performance,
it’s only made for development use).</p>
<pre><code>$ ./test1.elf 
simulate 16777216 cells for 1000 timesteps.
speed: 1156992 MiB/s
speed: 10110 MC/s in 1.66 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>The CMP 170HX has a win.
This portable kernel was written in SYCL and was previously developed on the
AMD Radeon VII (Instinct MI50), and I saw a speed of around 6000 MC/s (megacells per second)
thanks to its 4096-bit 1000 GB/s (theoretical) HBM2 memory. With Nvidia CMP
170HX’s 1500 GB/s (theoretical) HBM2e memory, I’m really getting a 1.5x speedup</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this speedup was demonstrated using the original source
code without disabling FMA. It’s well-known that FDTD in its basic form has an
extreme memory bottleneck, even more extreme than LBM. The benchmark result
shows that it’s indeed the case (work is ongoing on advanced optimizations which
I may share in the future on this blog).</p>
<p><em>Note: Memory bandwidth is traditionally benchmarked in base-10 sizes, but
my FDTD benchmark uses base-2 sizes, thus 1156992 MiB/s appears lower than
1300 GB/s that I previously reported.</em></p>
<h4 id="power-consumption">Power Consumption</h4>
<p>Because of the FMA floating-point performance lockdown, the GPU runs so slow
that it cannot even be properly stress tested using standard tools.
The power consumption of <code>gpu_burn</code> for FP32 and FP64 is around 60 watts.
When running mixed-precision FP32/FP16 workloads (and likely also true for
non-FMA FP32 workloads) by enabling Tensor Core in <code>gpu_burn</code>, the power
consumption is around 75 watts with spikes to 100+ watts.</p>
<p>However, this is still far from the 250 watts TDP or TBP of the GPU.
Before I realized this situation, the low power consumption and slow speed
initially made me suspect that low FP32 performance was caused by thermal
or power throttling due to a hardware failure (an <em>unrelated</em> one indeed
occurred and fixed later), before I found another forum post with showed
AIDA64 benchmark results on Windows and mentioned the low power consumption.
This confirmed my results - the cause was FP32 lockdown, the effect is
low power consumption, not vice versa.</p>
<p>To put a reasonable level of stress on the GPU, other types of benchmarks
should be used as stress tests - an integer benchmark or a memory benchmark.
A typical integer workload such as a password cracker like hashcat can push
the power consumption to 160+ watts. Integer-only machine-learning inference
may be another choice - but I was unable to find a representative example -
comments welcome. An alternative way is generating maximum memory traffic -
I found a self-written STREAM-like program can also push the power consumption
to 160+ watts.</p>
<p>But note that both types of tests cannot put the highest possible load
on the GPU - to do that, you need to stress both the core with heavy
integer workload and the memory with heavy streaming traffic - the GPU
was made for Ethereum mining after all. Thus, mining should always have
the highest power consumption (which is not tested here).</p>
<p>When FMA is disabled using a modified copy of FluidX3D, and when FP32/FP16S
mode is used to increase the arithmetic intensity of the simulation, power
consumption as high as 180 watts was observed in <code>nvidia-smi</code>.</p>
<p>I won’t be surprised if a carefully crafted hypothetical integer-heavy +
memory-heavy workload can push the GPU above 200 watts.</p>
<h4 id="io-performance">I/O Performance</h4>
<p>CMP 170HX’s PCIe bandwidth is restricted to PCIe 1.0 x4, at 0.85 GB/s. Thus,
if the application performs frequent data exchanges between CPU and GPU, or
between different GPUs, it would be too slow to be acceptable - exactly according
to Nvidia’s plan.</p>
<pre><code>Transfer bandwidth (GBPS)

<p>The PCB level lockdown should be trivially bypassable by hardware modification
and soldering the missing 0402 AC coupling capacitors on the extra PCIe lanes,
but due to the hardware lockdown, it would still operate at PCIe Gen1 at 4 GB/s
with limited usefulness, so I did not attempt that (I do not want to dismantle
my watercooled test bench again). But apparently users of other CMP card models
had reported successes.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<h4 id="machine-balance-and-arithmetic-intensity"><em>Machine Balance</em> and <em>Arithmetic Intensity</em></h4>
<p>As already mentioned, even though that the CMP 170HX has locked-down
FP32 performance, there are still some floating-point workloads that can be
accelerated by the CMP 170HX. In some cases, even up to the full HBM2e memory
speed and beat the top-level customer-grade GPU: the RTX 4090.
In the most extreme case (as in my FDTD demo), this can be done without
bypassing the FMA throttling. One can often find them in memory-bound physics
simulations. To understand why, one needs to make use of the concepts of
<em>machine balance</em>, <em>arithmetic intensity</em> and <em>roofline analysis</em>.</p>
<p><em>Machine balance</em> describes the balance between a processor’s memory and
floating-point throughput. In the ideal world, this balance should be 1:1
so a processor can read or write memory as fast as it can perform an arithmetic
operation. However, processors were and are improving at a faster rate than
DRAM bandwidth for multiple reasons, such as the time it takes for the sense
amplifier to read bits from capacitors, the impracticality of integrating
large DRAM and CPU on the same silicon, or the resulting interconnect bottleneck
between a processor and DRAM as off-chip data transfer is always slower than
on-chip access.</p>
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/machine-balance.png" alt="Processor and machine balance increasing, making communication relatively more expensive. Plot for 64-bit floating point data movement &amp; operations; bandwidth from CPU or GPU memory to registers. Data from vendor specs and STREAM benchmark" width="80%">
</p>
<p>Hence, modern CPUs and GPUs tend to have a machine balance of 100:1 (for FP64).
That is, one can only achieve the peak FLOPS of the processor if 100 floating-point operations
are done for each integer read from memory - in other words (no pun intended), a compute
kernel should have a high <em>Arithmetic Intensity</em>. <em>Arithmetic Intensity</em> is the
balance between a program’s memory access operations and floating-point
operations. For example, if a program needs to read 4 FP32s to calculate their
average (using 3 adds and 1 multiplication), its arithmetic intensity is 0.25 FLOPS/bytes.
That is, <em>arithmetic intensity</em> can be understood as a <em>software balance</em> in
analogous to the <em>machine balance</em>.</p>
<p>In practical programs, the programmer will attempt to do as many useful computations
as possible after memory is read using many tricks. But ultimately, the achievable
intensity depends on the algorithm itself. For example, a good matrix multiplication
program (the archetypal test is the <em>LINPACK</em> benchmark) is entirely compute-bound, as
there are a whole lot of multiplications to do just after reading a single submatrix.
Memory bandwidth does not matter in this application.</p>
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/arithmetic-intensity.png" alt="Arithmetic Intensity of different algorithms. Physics simulations using stencil computation have low arithmetic intensity below 1 FLOPS/byte, dense linear algebra (BLAS 3) has high Arithmetic Intensity over O(10) FLOPS/byte" width="80%">
</p>
<p>On the other hand, many types of scientific and engineering simulations are memory
bandwidth bound. All they do is reading the simulation box from memory, moving it
forward by 1 timestep, and writing it back to memory (think of a 2D or 3D convolution
function in which the value of a single cell depends on the values of their surrounding
cells, or think of a naive implementation of <em>Conway’s Game of Life</em> - real
physics simulations of partial differential equations often work like that). The
arithmetic intensity is often under 1.0 and performs poorly on modern hardware. The
usable performance is 1% to 10% of the peak performance due to bandwidth limitation,
which is far from what the processor core itself can do.</p>
<p>This is the notorious <em>memory wall</em> problem, to be accurate, the <em>memory bandwidth
wall</em> problem (which is different from the <em>memory latency</em> wall problem).</p>
<h4 id="roofline-model"><em>Roofline Model</em></h4>
<p>Since memory-bound number-crunching code is so prevalent in the scientific
computing (or High-Performace Computing) world, practitioners established
a simple graphical method named the <em>roofline model</em> as a quick guideline on
program optimization, using only the ratio between floating-point operations
and memory accesses.</p>
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/roofline-simple.png" alt="A simplified graph of the roofline model" width="50%">
</p>
<p>A naive roofline model is easy to graph. First, divide a processor’s peak
floating-point throughput by its peak memory bandwidth. This gives the
critical arithmetic intensity at which a memory-bound algorithm becomes a
compute-bound one, known as the <em>ridge point</em>. Then, plot two segments,
one from the <em>ridge point</em> to the origin at the left, another is a constant
function equal to the machine’s peak floating-point performance, from the
<em>ridge point</em> to the right. Then rescale the chart on a log-log scale.</p>
<p>Next, calculate the number of floating-point operations and the arithmetic
intensity of your application and mark it on the plot. Many number-crunching
kernels are simple, one can often look at the inner loop and count them
by hand, only the source code and its runtime are needed as a result. To
automate this process, one can use CPU performance counters and static
analysis as well.</p>
<p>In the case of my CMP 170HX, I found my FDTD kernel performs 18 floating-point
operations per cell, with an arithmetic intensity of 0.25 FLOPS/byte. At
10110 million cell updates per second, the achieved performance is 181.98 GFLOPS.
For FluidX3D, 1 cell update takes 363 arithmetic operations consisting of 261
FP32 flops + 102 INT32 ops with 153 bytes of memory traffic. If one ignores
INT32 bottleneck (it’s much faster than FP32 on the CMP 170HX),
the arithmetic intensity would be 1.7 FLOPS/byte, and the achieved performance
at 7684 cell updates per second is 1979.685 GFLOPS. Finally, I can create
the following roofline model of this GPU with applications to two kernels:
FDTD and FluidX3D (FP32/FP32, no FMA).</p>
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/roofline-cmp170hx.svg" alt="Example of a hardware roofline curve and data points of different compute kernels" width="80%">
</p>
<p>As one can see, even when the computing power is limited to 6 GFLOPS
similar to a low-end desktop GPU, but both applications can greatly
benefit from the 1350 GB/s memory bandwidth. For naive FDTD, due to
its extremely low arithmetic intensity, it cannot even saturate the
394 GFLOPS FMA performance, explaining why it’s unaffected by Nvidia’s
throttling.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Nvidia knows the hardware specs of the GA100 silicon are attractive
to all HPC and AI users beyond mining, so they tried as best as they
could to make this GPU totally useless for those purposes from different
angles.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the FP32 FMA throughput restrictions makes the
GPU almost useless for running ready-made software. As demonstrated
here, this performance limit can sometimes be worked around by disabling
FMA, making it acceptable for many memory-bound simulations. Unfortunately,
due to the existence of other limitations, such as its low 8 GiB memory
size, PCIe 1.0 x4 I/O bandwidth, the lack of NV-Link, and the lack of
FP64 capability, these measures guaranteed the uselessness of the GPU
in the vast majority of applications.</p>
<p>Overall, this GPU is mostly useless. It can still be useful only when
your have a specific niche in which…</p>
<ol>
<li>Small-to-medium size runs that fits in 8 GiB.</li>
<li>Mostly in-situ computation without doing any PCIe or NVLink transfers.</li>
<li>You have a floating-point algorithm but extremely memory-bound that FLOPS is
completely irrelevant.
<ul>
<li>Without disabling FMA, with an Arithmetic Intensity (AI) under 0.3 (FP32).</li>
<li>After disabling FMA, with an Arithmetic Intensity under 4.6, but potentially
requires modifications to standard and 3rd-party libraries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or you have a memory-bound, all-integer workload (e.g. mining)…</li>
</ol>
<p>Only then, it would be sensible to purchase this GPU.</p>
<p>I purchased this GPU specifically for running FDTD electromagnetic field
simulations, the AI of its naive implementation is 0.25 FLOPS/bytes, so it
still gives me a huge acceleration on par with the actual A100 and currently
unmatched by everything else (if rumors are to be believed, RTX 5090 is
eventually going to match it at 1.5 TB/s in 2024). Not the worst $500 I’ve
spent.</p>
<p>It doesn’t change the fact that It’s still a case of <em>caveat emptor</em>, do
not buy unless you know exactly what you’re buying.</p>
<h5 id="vbios-modding">VBIOS modding?</h5>
<p>A natural question is whether the hardware performance limitation is implemented via
fuses, or implemented via VBIOS firmware, and whether modifying the VBIOS can bypass
these limits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all Nvidia GPUs since recent years have VBIOS digital signature checks,
making VBIOS modification impossible. A few months ago, a bypass was found for RTX
20-series “Turing” based GPUs, unfortunately, it does not apply to Ampere GPUs.
Currently, VBIOS modding is impossible for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h5 id="radeon-vii---the-alternative-from-amd">Radeon VII - the alternative from AMD</h5>
<p>The mining-special GPU market was not monopolized by Nvidia, there was
strong competition from AMD as well - the mining-special Radeon VII
(one can call them mining-special Instinct MI50).</p>
<p>Long story short, during the height of Ethereum mining, many board makers
in China unofficially created a special version of the
Radeon VII by omitting components of the Instinct MI50
circuit board - the resulted GPU is
a weird hybrid between Radeon VII and the Instinct MI50 - it has the
Instinct MI50 circuit board with the Instinct MI50 passive cooler suitable
for datacenter usage, on the other hand, the circuit configuration is actually
a desktop
Radeon VII, but it cannot be called a desktop card either as the video output
is often omitted. Regardless, since the Radeon
VII is more or less a remarketed accelerator GPU for gaming and uses basically
the same Instinct MI50 silicon, both cards are practically the same thing,
and it doesn’t matter which one is which.</p>
<p>In China, these GPUs are currently sold at ~$100. More amazingly,
they are pre-modded with the Radeon Pro VII VBIOS with 11 TFLOPS of
FP32 and unlocked 5.5 TFLOPS FP64 - just like the real MI50, making them
possibly the
accelerators with the
highest price-performance ratio of all time. The only criticism I have
is Radeon VII’s relatively inefficient memory controller, that often causes
considerable under-utilization of its 1 TB/s HBM2 bandwidth.</p>
<p>Still, if you want to buy a mining-special GPU for cheap to run compute
workloads, I personally highly recommend this mining-special Instinct MI50 (Radeon
VII) over the Nvidia CMP 170HX if your application is not CUDA-specific.</p>
<p>I plan to review this GPU soon. Because of the lack of restrictions,
I’m not going to analyze the GPU in depth as it behaves as a standard
GPU as one normally expects, the focus of that article is going to be
a watercooling mod tutorial for homelab use… There is a lot that
can be said for its bandwidth efficiency problem, which seems to be an
architectural problem across Vega GPUs and is currently poorly understood
due to the lack of documentation - but I’m not sure if I have the
patience to cover those topics.</p>
<h3 id="appendix-0-disabling-fma-usage-by-source-code-or-runtime-modification">Appendix 0: Disabling FMA Usage by Source Code or Runtime Modification</h3>
<h4 id="opencl">OpenCL</h4>
<h5 id="source-code-modification">Source Code Modification</h5>
<p>An FMA or MAD instruction - which are all throttled on the CMP 170HX - may
be generated by the OpenCL compiler under the following two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The source code explicitly uses the OpenCL functions <code>fma()</code> or <code>mad()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler implicitly transforms the expression <code>a * b + c</code> to
<code>fma(a, b, c)</code> or <code>mad(a, b, c)</code> through a process called <em>FP
contraction</em>. This may occur even without enabling <em>fast math</em> or <em>unsafe
math</em> optimizations - which merely increases the complier’s aggressiveness
of doing so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to prevent the OpenCL compiler from using MAD and FMA instructions,
two things need to be done - first, remove all usages of <code>fma()</code> and <code>mad()</code>,
and also to turn <em>FP contraction</em> off. An easy workaround is to
include the following code in front of all OpenCL source files:</p>
<pre><code>/* shadows the OpenCL builtin fma() and mad() functions */
#define fma(a, b, c) ((a) * (b) + (c))
#define mad(a, b, c) ((a) * (b) + (c))

/* disable FP contraction */
#pragma OPENCL FP_CONTRACT OFF
</code></pre>

<h5 id="pocl">PoCL</h5>
<p>The Nvidia OpenCL compiler is proprietary inside <code>libnvidia-opencl.so</code>, unlike
AMD GPUs for which its driver simply invokes <code>clang</code>. Thus, there’s no transparent
way to disable FMA and MAD globally at the compiler level (apart from reverse
engineering and modifying the Nvidia binaries). Each OpenCL program has to
be painstakingly modified individually.</p>
<p>A potential workaround is intercepting the call into <code>clBuildProgram()</code> to
modify the compiler options. Unfortunately, the OpenCL specification provides
no compile-time options to disable floating-point contraction in the form of
a command-line off/on switch. Yet another workaround can be intercepting
<code>clCreateProgramWithSource()</code> to insert the aforementioned code on the fly. But
this is a rather tedious and is left as an execrise for the reader.</p>
<p>Another possible and more straightforward hack is to replace the Nvidia OpenCL
runtime altogether with PoCL - a free and portable OpenCL runtime based on
LLVM/clang with the ability to target Nvidia PTX. By modifying the PoCL function
<code>pocl_llvm_build_program()</code>, the clang flag <code>-ffp-contract=off</code> is passed
unconditionally to disable FP contraction. In addition, PoCl’s OpenCL standard
library functions <code>fma()</code> and <code>mad()</code> also need to be redefined as plain
<code>a * b + c</code> without FP contraction. This is implemented by the following patch,
allowing one to run pre-existing OpenCL programs without any source code
modification.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the patch is incomplete, as OpenCL has more <code>fma()</code> and <code>mad()</code>
variants than what are patched here, such as <code>mad24()</code>, <code>mad_hi()</code>, and <code>mad_sat()</code>.</p>
<h4 id="cuda">CUDA</h4>
<p>To disable FP contraction, pass the option <code>-fmad=false</code> to <code>nvcc</code>.</p>
<p>Again, like OpenCL, it’s also possible to use FMA and MAD via multiple
built-in functions. Since <code>nvcc</code> is proprietary, again, there’s no
transparent way to disable FMA and MAD globally at the compiler level -
apart from reverse engineering and modifying the Nvidia binaries, or
implementing a preprocessor or debugger-like interceptor to modify
the source on-the-fly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, just like OpenCL, it’s possible to compile CUDA
via LLVM/clang and target Nvidia PTX. Thus, in principle, it should
be possible to create a patched LLVM/clang for this purpose in analogous
to PoCL.</p>
<h4 id="sycl">SYCL</h4>
<p>Currently there are two full-feature SYCL implementations - an LLVM
fork named Intel DPC++ and an LLVM plugin named AdaptiveCpp (previously
known as OpenSYCL and hipSYCL). One can use the standard clang
command-line option <code>-ffp-contract=off</code>. Like CUDA, the problem of
built-in functions remain.</p>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Although this section demonstrated some possible ways to modify the
program source code or GPGPU runtime to avoid FMA and MAD usages, in
practice, it can be difficult if not impossible to completely avoid
FMA.</p>
<p>As I already showed, a transparent compiler/runtime patch is not
as easy as toggling a option, as it doesn’t affect the behavior of
built-in functions. An invasive patch to the compiler may be needed
to completely remove FMA/MAD code generation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if one can patch the affected applications and
runtimes, the problem of binary programs and standard libraries
remain. Sometimes, GPU kernels are precompiled and shipped in
machine code or assembly form, this is the case for proprietary
software, and sometimes also the case for standard libraries.
In fact, most HPC libraries contain hand-tuned assembly routines
that heavily rely on FMA. Thus, the modification required to remove
FMA/MAD usages from a codebase is likely very complicated unless
the codebase is self-contained.</p>
<p>Not to mention that removing FMA changes the rounding behavior from
1 rounding to 2 roundings,
thus pontentially compromising the numerical integrity of a simulation
and making it untrustworthy if the code was written in a way that
requires FMA to preserve precision.</p>

<p>It’s not necessary to remove the mounting bracket on the right

<p>Flip the card, remove 10 screws on the back side of the card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flip the card again, now open the front cover of the cooler, the PCIe
bracket should also come off, revealing a massive heatsink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unscrew and remove the bracket on top of the power cable on the
top right, which is holding the power cable and the connector in
place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free the power cable away from the backplane by prying it away. The
cable is squeezed into the backplane, and can be difficult to remove.
Use a plastic spudger to pry it away from the board. Unless the power cable
/ connector is freed, the circuit board cannot move freely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use videos for guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that the entire circuit board is inserted
into the bottom backplane by sliding the PCIe connector into an open
slot on the backplane, thus, the circuit board cannot be lifted off
vertically as it’s embedded into the backplane.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To remove the circuit
board (and the bolted-on heatsink), move the circuit board upward
horizontally (to the opposite direction of the PCIe connector). After
the PCIe connector moves a bit away from the slot on the backplane,
lift the circuit board vertically while keep moving it upward
horizontally. The circuit board is now separated from the backplane
(as shown in the photo below).</p>

<p>The Nvidia CMP 170HX uses a circuit board nearly - if not completely - identical
to the Nvidia A100 (40 GiB). The only difference is the model number of the
GPU ASIC <code>GA100-105F-A1</code> which seems to be a cut-down version of the full
GA100. The circuit board also has many unpopulated components, including
omitted VRM phases by unpopulating DrMOS transistors and their output
inductors, ICs related to the NV-Link interface are also missing.</p>
<p>Otherwise, even the component reference designators on the
circuit board perfectly match the leaked electrical schematics of the Nvidia
Tesla A100 reference design (found online) - yes, it was still internally
named <em>Tesla</em> when the GPU was being designed.</p>

<p>All hardware modifications to the Nvidia A100 (40 GiB, not 80 GiB), such as
watercooling solutions like waterblocks and modification kits, are equally
applicable to the CMP 170HX. Thus, for those who’re playing along at home,
if anyone wants perform a risky modification to the Nvidia A100 for workstation
use, it might be a good idea to practice this modification on an inexpensive
CMP 170HX first.</p>
<h3 id="appendix-2-watercooling">Appendix 2: Watercooling</h3>
<p>When attempting to use server GPUs for home/office workstation applications,
cooling is a standard problem. Most server-grade GPUs use passive coolers
and they’re designed to be cooled by high-RPM fans on a server chassis.
Even if fans can be installed in the original way or via a custom
mod, these passive coolers often need a strong airflow to work properly,
creating a noise level unacceptable outside a data center.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for popular compute-only GPUs, ready-made waterblocks often
exist, making watercooling a common solution using off-the-shelf parts.
Watercooling has its downsides,
but as long as precautions are carefully followed - which shouldn’t be
difficult for the experienced home lab experimenters who regularly
purchased used hardware - watercooling provides cool temperature and quiet
operation in exchange. This is quite important when you’re running
number-crunching simulations while sleeping next to it…</p>
<p>To cool my Nvidia CMP 170HX, I found the Bykski N-TESLA-A100-X-V2 waterblock,
which is compatible with Nvidia A100 40 GB, Nvidia CMP 170HX, and the
Nvidia A30 24 GB circuit boards. In China, it’s currently sold at a
price of 680 CNY (~100 USD). The <code>bykski.us</code> distributor site is selling
it for $300, I suggest ordering it from AliExpress for less than $150.
The waterblock accepts standard G1/4 fittings and can be included in
any water loop. If this is your first installation, you can find more
information on connecting a pump, radiator or reservoir into the water
loop (none is included).</p>
<p>Make sure you do not confuse the Nvidia Tesla 40 GB version with the 80 GB
version, which are incompatible. There is also an earlier version of the
same waterblock without <code>V2</code> in its model number, <code>V2</code> uses all-metal
construction while the non-V2 uses transparent acrylic. Since the metal
revision was made for a reason (enhanced durability), it’s better to
avoid the non-V2 models.</p>
<h4 id="procedures-1">Procedures</h4>
<p>The Bykski waterblock has no user manual. The provided online user guide
is more of a quick start guide than a user manual, with a two-sentence
instruction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who can, do.<br>
Those who can’t, write.<br>
Those who can’t write, sell waterblocks at Bykski.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also found the included hex wrench was the wrong size (so be sure
to order a set of metric hex wrenches if you don’t have one already).
Otherwise, it performs great if you manage to correctly install it.</p>
<p>Which is a big if… My GPU stopped working soon after the waterblock
installation (but I was able to fix that myself). I suspect it was
either a pre-existing fault or caused by my improper waterblock installation
in my first attempt - if it was the case, the lack of a proper user manual
from Bykski was certainly an important contributing factor - but fear not,
this blog post already went ahead of you and ironed out a smooth path.
You can refer to the following instructions to do the same watercooling
mod, with the foresight of many pitfalls in order to avoid damaging your
GPU.</p>

<p>If there are still difficulties during installation, unscrew and

the first signs of an alignment using Step 9.</p>

whether the thermal pads are making good contact with the pillars to
cool the MOSFETs. The thermal pads included with the waterblock should

<p>When I was dry-running the card for an initial test without coolant (<em>not
recommended! Make sure to power the system off within 5 minutes</em>), I also
noticed a curious positive feedback loop between the GPU temperature and its
power consumption, creating thermal runaway. Initially, the idle power
consumption was around 40 watts, but it gradually rised to 60 watts at
80 degrees C and was still increasing before I powered it off - I later
found many other PC reviewers reported similar findings. This was likely
an effect caused by higher CMOS leakage current at higher temperatures,
which in turn creating more leakage current and an even higher temperature…
Hence, good cooling can often reduce an IC’s junction temperature by more
than their cooling capability alone due to this second-order effect.</p>
<h3 id="appendix-3-repair">Appendix 3: Repair</h3>
<p>My Nvidia CMP 170HX malfunctioned soon after I received it and performed
the first attempt at watercooling modification. The GPU operated for an
hour before it dropped off from the PCIe bus, and could no longer be
detected after this incident.</p>
<p>Such is the well-known risk of purchasing or modding decommissioned hardware,
or doing both at the same time! - never bet more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>It was either a pre-existing fault (perhaps the circuit was already marginal
after heavy mining), or due to my improper watercooling installation - a few
sentences in the installation procedures are marked as <em>important</em> in bold
fonts for a reason… If it was indeed damaged from my improper installation,
the lack of a proper user manual from Bykski was certainly an important
contributing factor - but fear not, this blog post already went ahead of you,
and ironed out a smooth path. You can refer to the previous instructions
to see many pitfalls to avoid damaging your GPU.</p>
<p>I was able to repair the problem myself with the help of my electronics
home lab (which is not a coincidence, since I bought this GPU specifically
to write electromagnetic simulation code for circuit board designs…),
the leaked Nvidia Tesla A100 schematics. Thanks to whoever who leaked
them - My repair is otherwise impossible.</p>

<h4 id="power-tree">Power Tree</h4>
<p>When a GPU can no longer be detected from PCIe, its on-board DC/DC power supplies
and related power-on sequencing circuits are the first things to check. Helpfully,
the first page of the Nvidia Tesla A100 schematics contains a power tree overview.</p>

</p>
</a>
<p>The PCB accepts four power inputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>3V3_PEX</code> is provided by the PCI Express (PEX) slot and is stepped down to 1.8 V
for use by auxiliary control circuits using a 1.8 V Low-Dropout Linear
Regulator (LDO).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>12V_PEX</code> is provided by the PCI Express slot and is stepped down</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To 5 V via a DC/DC buck converter, the MP1475.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To 1.35 V via an MP2988 DC/DC controller (PWM controller), with one phase
output to drive DrMOS switching transistors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To <code>HBMVPP</code> (2.5 V) via a DC/DC buck converter, another MP1475. This voltage
is hooked into the GA100 silicon, but the power supply circuit is significantly
simpler compared to the multi-phase <code>HBMVDD</code> power rail, so I suspect it’s used
to power the memory controller itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To <code>PEXVDD</code> via an MP2988 DC/DC controller, with one phase output to drive
DrMOS switching transistors. <code>PEXVDD</code> belongs to the I/O power domain for
PCIe signaling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>12V_EXT1</code> is provided by the first external 12 V power connector, which is used
to derive the 1.0 V core voltage (<code>NVVDD</code>) and HBM memory voltage (<code>HBMVDD</code>) via
the MP2988 DC/DC controller, which in turn drives DrMOS switching transistors using
multiple phases. <code>12V_EXT2</code> serves the same purpose, but powers another group of
power supply to provide <code>HBMVDD</code> and <code>NVVDD</code>. On the CMP 170HX and Tesla A100,
both connectors are physically combined into a 8-pin CPU power connector, but
one can still see two inputs when an adapter cable is used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="initial-check">Initial Check</h4>
<p>With the power tree in mind, it’s time for some basic checks for the voltage rails.</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-repair-2.jpg">
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-repair-2-small.jpg" alt="Initial troubleshooting result." width="80%">
</p>
</a>
<p>I measured the resistance from both 12 V external input filter inductors to ground,
and found both have high impedance. I also measured the resistance from the left
side
of the PCIe connector to ground (which is the slot 12 V input), and also found
no short circuit. Furthermore, after powering the card on and probing the output
inductor on the right side of the core, I found none of them had any voltage
output or switching waveforms.</p>
<p>This strongly suggests that a problem exists within the GPU’s power-on sequencing.
Likely, a needed logic voltage is missing or entered protection due to a fault,
preventing their downstream circuits from being enabled, including Vcore.</p>
<h4 id="power-on-sequencing">Power-On Sequencing</h4>
<p>The next step of the investigation was understanding how power-on sequencing works,
which was answered in schematics on page 48.</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-2.png">
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-2-small.png" alt="Power-On Sequencing circuit of the Nvidia Tesla A100" width="80%">
</p>
</a>
<p>From this schematics, it’s obvious that the power-on sequencing is triggered by
applying 12 V input power (<code>12V_F</code>, <code>F</code> stands for “filtered”, which means it’s
the downstream of the input LC filter). This action causes the resistive
divider R391/R392 to produce a 2.5 V output at an appropriate logic level, which
is then used as the enabling signal <code>5V_PS_EN</code> to start the 5 V DC/DC converter.
There’s also a tiny 10 nF capacitor to de-glitch this signal.</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-3.png">
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-3.png" alt="Resistive Divider for generating PS_5V_EN" width="50%">
</p>
</a>
<h4 id="5-v-supply">5 V supply</h4>
<p>The <code>5V_PS_EN</code> signal is then received by MP1475DJ on page 18, it’s
an adjustable DC/DC converter made by Monolithic Power Systems
with a really basic circuit topology - 12 V input, a switching node
<code>SW</code> driven by an internal switching transistor to generate a
switching waveform, which is then filtered by an output inductor
and output capacitor to generate a reduced voltage. The output
voltage is sampled via a voltage divider and fed back into the <code>FB</code>
pin for closed-loop control.</p>
<p>Although I’ve never used the exact chip, it’s a fact that
almost every microcontroller circuit board I’ve previously designed
contained a basic buck converter like this one. There is no complex
controller-transistor combinations and no multi-phase switching,
since it’s only a simple auxiliary voltage for powering the logic
chips, not the GPU.</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-4.png">
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-4.png" alt="5 V DC/DC buck converter" width="80%">
</p>
</a>
<p>After pinpointing the physical location of the DC/DC converter and
measuring its switching node, I immediately found the first problem -
the 5 V DC/DC converter was refusing to start. At the switching node
<code>SW</code>, there was a momentary pulse that lasted for dozens of nanoseconds
before it stopped. The IC would then retry again after dozens of
microseconds but fail to start again, and this cycle repeats. This either
suggested the
existence of a short circuit in the 5 V rail, causing the power chip
to enter hiccup-mode short-circuit protection - or implied the DC/DC
converter was faulty.</p>
<p>Thus, I desoldered the MP1475DJ IC using my hot air gun. I also
soldered a jumper wire to its output inductor for injecting an
external 5 V voltage from my benchtop power supply.</p>

</p>
</a>
<p>Voltage injection showed no short circuit. However, I discovered that
the resistance from the empty footprint Pin 1 (Power Good signal) to
ground was 5 Ω, this is not good!</p>
<p>Hence, the next step was to investigate where the signal <code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code>
went.</p>
<h4 id="ps_5v_pgood-short-circuit"><code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code> short circuit</h4>
<p>After chasing for the net label <code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code> across the entire schematics,
I found the vast majority of its users are the logic chips, SN74LV1T08.
This chip is one of the modern remakes of the classic 74xx logic gates,
providing a 2-input AND gate with level shifting for controlling power
sequencing elsewhere, including <code>PEXVDD</code>, <code>NVVDD</code>, <code>1V35</code>, and <code>1V8</code>.</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-5.png">

</p>
</a>
<p>If any of these 74-logic chips is shorted, isolating the fault would
be a painstaking task.</p>
<p>One of these things is not like the other, though. the 5V Power Good
signal is also used to enable the 5 V to 3.3 V Low-Dropout Regulator (LDO)
to produce <code>3V3_SEQ</code>, an auxiliary 3.3 V logic voltage, which is only
used for continuing the power sequencing after 5 V (including powering
these 74 logic chips).</p>

</p>
</a>
<p>Conveniently, there’s a 0-ohm resistor jumper R1200 between the <code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code>
input and the <code>ENABLE</code> pin of the 3.3 V LDO. Thus, removing R1200 became
a no-brainer.</p>

</p>
<p>After I pushed away this 0402 resistor R1200 with a blob of molten
solder on the tip of my soldering iron, the short circuit at Pin 1
of MP1475DJ (in other words, <code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code>) has cleared - giving
confirmation that the GS7155NVTD LDO was dead due to an internal
short circuit.</p>
<h4 id="5-v-repair-success">5 V repair success!</h4>
<p>When the problems were identified, I immediately ordered replacement
chips for the MP1475DJ and GS7155NVTD. As soon as the MP1475DJs
arrived, I resoldered a new one to the circuit board and applied
power. Power-on tests showed the 5 V logic rail was successfully
restored.</p>
<h4 id="33-v-supply">3.3 V supply</h4>
<p>The next problem is replacing the GS7155NVTD.</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-6.png">
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-6.png" alt="GS7155NVTD 3.3 V LDO on the schematics" width="80%">
</p>
</a>
<p>The adjustable LDO chip GS7155NVTD is made by GSTEK. Although I’ve
never used this chip or vendor
before (apparently it’s specifically designed for powering Nvidia
GPUs and its full datasheet is under NDA, although one can find the
full datasheet of a similar model), but it’s also the most basic LDO
circuit topology.</p>
<p>It accepts 5 V and generates 3.3 V by dropping the excess voltage
away as heat using its internal series pass transistor. The output
voltage is sampled by
a resistive divider into the feedback pin for closed-loop control,
voltage is adjustable by using different divider ratio.
There’s also a capacitor across a feedback resistor, likely for
frequency compensation of its control loop to improve its transient
responsive performance - usually one just copies these components based
on the manufacturer’s recommendations from the datasheet.</p>
<p>Using a hot-air gun, I quickly replaced the IC, but it was risky to
power the board back on at this point. This chip uses the Quad
No-Lead (QFN) package which is tricky to solder properly by hand.
One needs to pre-tin the chip with solder, pre-tin the circuit board
footprint with solder, then heat the PCB with a hot air gun. An
inexperienced repair tech (like me) can easily create a cold solder
joint, which is no joke.</p>
<p>If the feedback pin of the chip is open, from the perspective of the
LDO, it would see a constant output undervoltage, and the LDO would
put the maximum voltage on its output in an attempt to boost the
output voltage. In reality, this causes the output voltage to shoot
up to the max and creating full 5 V on the 3.3 V rail,
thus blowing up almost all the 3.3 V logic chips with disastrous
results. Therefore,
I came up with an impoverished plan to distinguish a good and a bad LDO:
I replaced the 7.68 kΩ feedback resistor at the bottom with a 20 kΩ
resistor to temporarily reprogram the LDO’s output voltage from 3.3 V
to 1.8 V, then I injected 3.3 V on the 5 V rail.</p>
<p>In the first attempt, I found the LDO couldn’t output any voltage -
oh no… Circuit boards for computer motherboards and graphics cards
contain many layers of power and ground planes, making them act as
an excellent heatsink and a nightmare to repair. This is already
sometimes a problem on my 4-layer PCBs, but modern computer cards often
contain 8 to 12 layers of PCB to satisfy their high-speed signaling
needs. On this card, I found I needed to set my hot-air gun to 420
degrees Celsius and to heat the area for 2 minutes before I was able
to remove any chip.
I really did not want to stress the circuit board further and risk
lifting the copper pads or traces off the board with another round
of air-hot gun torture (this is also why a pre-heater is needed for
any serious BGA rework…)</p>
<p>Suddenly I realized that the <code>ENABLE</code> signal for the LDO was
missing. After bridging the LDO’s <code>ENABLE</code> signal to 3.3 V,
luckily, 1.8 V immediately appeared on the output side of the
LDO, bingo! This test showed that the LDO could correctly output a
regulated 1.8 V voltage, proving its correct operation.</p>
<h4 id="enabling-enable">Enabling <code>ENABLE</code></h4>
<p>After this test, I reinstalled the 7.68 kΩ feedback resistor to
reprogram the LDO from 1.8 V back to 3.3 V. Now it’s the moment
of truth, I replugged the card back into the test bench and
powered it on…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 3.3 V rail has no output, the symptom was
identical to the previous case of a missing ENABLE signal.
What was going on?</p>
<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-7.png">
<p><img src="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/img/nvidia-cmp-170hx-review/cmp-170hx-schematics-7.png" alt="R1200 was in fact a short circuit on the PCB, unlike what the schematics suggest" width="80%">
</p>
</a>
<p>Upon further probing with a multimeter, I found the left solder pad and right
solder pad of the 0-ohm jumper R1200 was a short circuit - indeed, a close
inspection under the microscope showed that there’s a trace directly bridging
the pads! It must
have been the case that the PCB designers wanted to remove the useless jumper
R1200 (perhaps it’s a common point of failure), hence a direct copper trace
was used to bypass R1200. But for some manufacturing reason, possibly to
avoid reprogramming the pick-and-place machine or the automatic optical
inspection machine, the now-useless resistor itself was kept as-is and
<em>not</em> removed.</p>
<p>Hence, removing the resistor should not have isolated the original short
circuit inside the GS7155NVTD. Instead, in the process of removing R1200
or replacing other components, I may have accidentally damaged a via or
a trace on the circuit board, thus isolating the short circuit by breaking
the PCB itself. It’s also possible that the via or trace involved already
became fragile due to the previous short circuit. After breakage, the
enable signal GS7155NVTD became an isolated island unconnected to the
broader <code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code> net.</p>

  </a>
</p>
<p>After the root cause was understood, solving the problem became trivial.
As I previously mentioned, the <code>PS_5V_PGOOD</code> net was used by many
SN74LV1T08 logic chips across the schematics for power sequencing.
Thus, I decided to borrow this signal from U816 to GS7155NVTD using a jumper
wire.</p>
<p>Finally, I replugged the GPU into my test bench and reapplied power. 3.3 Vseq
was back! I could see switching waveforms on the oscilloscope! 1.0 V Vcore
(NVVDD) was back! PEXVDD was back! Finally, the GPU was redetected from
PCIe, the GA100 is alive.</p>
<p>The photo above showed the use of a PVC-insulated AWG-30 wire-wrap wire -
this was only used for a quick test, and is not recommended in an actual
repair as it’s difficult to strip to wire to the correct length and to solder
it without damaging its insulation - risking a short circuit due to

                                            <div><p>Colorectal cancer is the second-most deadly cancer, killing over 1 million people per year around the world — 1.7% of all deaths. In the United States, where colorectal cancer causes 50,000 deaths per year, the foundation of the fight against it is the colonoscopy. Getting one periodically is recommended for everyone over the age of 45.</p><p>Colonoscopies are rarely used for screening elsewhere but have been standard in the U.S. for decades. There are many reasons to think that they should work. But they are also expensive, invasive, unpleasant, and rarely — but not <em>that</em> rarely — have serious side effects. Are they worth it?</p><p>Until recently we didn’t have any randomized controlled trials that directly tested how well colonoscopies work. We finally just got one and the results were — how can I describe them? Confusing? Ambiguous? Frenzy-inducing?</p><p>Let’s try to understand what to make of this trial, and why American gastroenterologists were so quick to criticize it.</p></div>

                                            <p><h2>Reminders About Tubes</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>After you swallow food, your body uses rhythmic waves of contractions to send it on a 4-meter (13-foot) journey through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. These extract most of the food’s nutrients and render it into a pulpy acidic fluid called <em>chyme</em>. The chyme then travels through your colon, a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tube that reabsorbs water and electrolytes, creating a solid mass that is then moved to your rectum for storage and eventual disposal. Yay!</p><p>The outermost layer of your inner colon is a single layer of <em>epithelial</em> cells whose job it is to let the good stuff through and keep the bad stuff out. Stem cells deeper inside the colon constantly divide to make new epithelial cells, which climb to the surface and live for four or five days before committing “suicide.”</p><p>Colonoscopies rest on the <em>adenoma-carcinoma hypothesis.</em> The idea is that errors can arise in the DNA, resulting in epithelial cells that don’t die on schedule. If they do anything <em>too</em> weird, your T-cells will kill them. But some mutations fly under the radar,&nbsp; causing little clumps of cells to grow on the surface of the colon. These clumps, or “polyps,” are usually <em>not cancer</em> — they grow slowly, and won’t (yet) spread to neighboring tissues. But if these persist for many years, they can acquire additional mutations that make them start spreading.</p><p>To prepare for a colonoscopy, you must empty your colon. This is achieved by drinking some chemicals and enduring some spectacular biological functions. Then a doctor threads a 1.5-meter (5-foot) flexible tube with a light and camera to look at the entire colon and remove or sample any polyps. The idea is not just to <em>detect</em> cancer but, by removing precancerous polyps, <em>prevent</em> it.</p><p>The primary alternative to colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening are “occult blood tests” that look for <em>spooky</em> hidden blood in the stool. The oldest of these use an extract of the guaiacum tree and have RCTs showing they reduce colorectal cancer mortality by 9%-22% when used for screening. Newer tests look for antibodies and/or genetic mutations. These are more sensitive, though we don’t yet have RCTs estimating how much they help with mortality.</p><p>Another alternative is an older procedure called a sigmoidoscopy, which is basically a “mini” colonoscopy with a 0.6-meter (2-foot) tube. Compared to colonoscopy, it is quicker, safer, less painful, and cheaper, but it can only look at the lower (“sigmoid”) colon. Still, randomized trials have shown that screening sigmoidoscopies reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 26%-30%.</p><p>In principle, colonoscopies <em>should</em> be better than either of these tests. Unlike blood tests, colonoscopies try to remove polyps before they become cancer. And unlike sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopies can examine the whole colon.</p><p>But how much does it actually help to remove precancerous polyps? Gastrointestinal doctors often point to the National Polyp Study, but this is not a true randomized comparison — the study did colonoscopies on all subjects and concluded, based on comparisons to base rates in other “similar” populations, that removing polyps helped. And how much does it help to screen the whole colon? <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-018-0335-z" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross et al.</a> compared sigmoidoscopy to colonoscopy in English patients with suspected colorectal cancer and found that sigmoidoscopy was sufficient to detect 80% of cancers.</p><p>Because of the cost, the lack of direct evidence for efficacy, and the fact that it’s hard to convince people to do colonoscopies, they are rarely used for cancer screening outside the United States and some parts of German-speaking Europe. So it would be <em>really</em> useful to have an RCT that tested how well screening colonoscopies work.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>The Trial</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>That brings us to the star of our show. The Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) is a huge randomized trial aimed at rigorously measuring how much colonoscopies reduce cancer and death.<sup>

</p><p>Here’s what the researchers did: Between 2009 and 2014, they identified 85,179<sup>

 subjects mostly in Poland (64.1%), Norway (31.2%), and Sweden (4.3%), drawn at random from population registries of people between 55 and 64 years old.<sup>

</sup>
 They invited one-third of them to a one-time screening colonoscopy. Of those contacted, 42% accepted the invitation and underwent a colonoscopy, while 58% refused the invitation. The other two-thirds of people were not contacted and seemingly never knew they were in the trial. The researchers then followed everyone (invited or not, colonoscopy or not) for a median of 10 years and checked government records to see who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, died from colorectal cancer, or died from any cause.</p><p>This was an “intention-to-screen” analysis. That means that it compared the control group to the whole invited group, including both the 42% of people who agreed to a colonoscopy and the 58% who refused. (If that seems strange, keep reading.)</p><p>These were the main results:</p></div>

                                            <div><p>The 18% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence was statistically significant, while the 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality and 1% reduction in overall mortality were not.</p><p>So the reductions — they are small. This was a surprise.</p><p>The study had a huge sample and simple, reliable statistics. The authors seemed to expect a stronger showing for colonoscopies. When that didn’t happen, they made no excuses — they just followed their preregistered statistical plan and published the results. We want research to be reproducible, right? Well, then <em>this is what we want people to do</em>.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>The Debate</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>This paper was greeted with gastroenterological bedlam. One response was that it shows colonoscopies aren’t cost-effective, since there was only a small effect on deaths from colorectal cancer, not much better than in previous trials of less invasive screening methods. Others took the more extreme stance that the study was further proof that American medicine is rotten, subjecting us to horrible expensive procedures for little benefit.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, American gastroenterologists did not agree. A primary concern expressed on Twitter (now known as X) seemed to be that the study might cause patients to do the worst thing a patient can ever do: Read a paper and ask questions about it.</p><p>For a little slice of the debate, take CNN’s piece, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/health/colonoscopy-cancer-death-study/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">“New Study Examines the Effectiveness of Colonoscopies.”</a> It describes the study and results, gives a few quotes from the authors and other experts about how the results are surprising, cautions that it isn’t conclusive and further research is needed, and notes that “other studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.”</p><p>The American College of Gastroenterology disagreed with CNN so strongly that it released a <a href="https://webfiles.gi.org/links/committees/Public+Relations/American_College_of_Gastroenterology_Letter_to_CNN_NEJM_Bretthauer_Colonoscopy_10102022_FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuttal</a>, claiming:</p><p>1. The way the study was set up, colonoscopies couldn’t possibly succeed because only 42% of people agreed to screening, 10 years isn’t long enough to see a benefit, and European doctors are bad at colonoscopies.</p><p>2. There is <em>other</em> evidence that removing polyps and doing colonoscopies save lives.</p><p>3. It’s irresponsible to call colonoscopies “invasive” (as CNN did) since that might make people think they are unpleasant and not do them.</p><p>4. Actually, the study shows colonoscopies are great.</p><p>Similar points were raised elsewhere, such as in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> doctors sent to the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Are these points correct? Why were American gastroenterologists so eager to dismiss this trial?</p></div>
                                            <p><h2><strong>Did the Trial Actually Show That Colonoscopies Are Great?</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>By far the biggest controversy with the trial comes from the fact that only a minority of people agreed to screening. Colonoscopies can’t do anything if they don’t happen.</p><p>Many doctors suggested that if you look at the numbers in the right way, then this trial shows colonoscopies are great. For example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanley</a> argues that while only 42% of people agreed to screening, among the people who did, colon cancer incidence was reduced by 31% and colon cancer mortality was reduced by 50%.</p><p>Many, <em>many</em> other doctors repeated the claim that this trial showed that getting a colonoscopy reduced the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by 50%. A common meme was to reframe the 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality in the main intention-to-screen analysis by rewriting the title in dismissive ways like&nbsp;“Effect of Mailing Letters to People on Risks of Colorectal Cancer and Related Death.”</p><p>In my opinion, that 50% number is <em>at best</em> unreliable and probably just wrong. Looking into why gives a great lesson on why statistics is hard and how that hardness conspires with social dynamics to confuse people.</p><p>In this study, there were three types of people:</p><p><strong>Controls</strong>, who were never contacted</p><p><strong>Refusers</strong>, who were invited to get a colonoscopy but declined</p><p><strong>Acceptors</strong>, who were invited to get a colonoscopy and chose to proceed</p><p>The main analysis only compares the controls to the <em>combination</em> of the acceptors and refusers. One reason to do so is that all screening programs see some proportion of people refuse assessment; what the analysis provides is a direct estimate of what an actual program would do.</p><p>But if you’re deciding if you should get a colonoscopy personally, then you’d like to know how much it would help. Naively, you might try to find out by looking at results for the acceptors versus controls, ignoring refusers. Unfortunately, there’s a deep problem: Acceptors and refusers are different. They might vary in age, sex, education, ethnicity, family health history, or comfort with their own tubes. Even if the colonoscopies had never happened, they would have had different outcomes from the controls. This is not hypothetical! At the end of the study period, 1.2% of the controls were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, compared with 1.05% of refusers and 0.89% of acceptors.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>The refusers have less colorectal cancer than controls, even though neither had colonoscopies. The likely explanation is that people have some idea of their risk, either because of their family history, their lifestyle, or how their tubes have been feeling recently. Those at lower risk are more likely to refuse. (It’s also possible that refusers just hate going to the doctor and so just had fewer <em>diagnoses</em>, but never mind.)</p><p>So you can’t directly compare acceptors to controls <em>or</em> to refusers. They are different populations. Sadly, there’s no good way to solve this problem. But there are many bad ones!</p><p>The main results in the paper are the <em>intention-to-screen</em> analysis that compares the controls to the whole invited group. This understates the benefits of colonoscopies because it ignores the fact that less than half of invited people agreed to have colonoscopies. But this analysis is <em>ultra</em>robust, because it compares two perfectly randomized groups. It found an 18% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>An intuitive way to fix that bias would be to do a <em>naive correction</em> and pretend that the 42% of people who agreed to colonoscopies were random. If that were true, then the benefits if everyone agreed would have been 1/0.42 = 2.38 times as large, meaning that if 100% of people agreed instead of 42%, there would have been a 43% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 24% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>I call this “naive” because people did <em>not</em> agree at random. But what’s the bias? Remember, people at higher risk were more likely to agree. That means that the colonoscopies that <em>were</em> done were allocated <em>more efficiently</em> than a random allocation. Thus, the naive correction is likely an <em>over</em>estimate. We’d expect somewhat <em>less</em> than a 24% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality if everyone accepted.</p><p>One thing you <em>can</em> do is estimate what would have happened to the acceptors if they hadn’t gotten colonoscopies. Imagine a world where the trial never happened. Outcomes for the control group and the refusers would stay the same — the only people with a different result would be the ones who would have accepted colonoscopies had the study occurred. On the whole, though, the would-be invited group (that is, the would-be refusers and the would-be<em> </em>acceptors) would be just like the controls, since no one would have received any screening. With this in mind, we can work out what would have happened to the would-be acceptors in that world. You can see this in the dotted line in the graphs below:</p></div>

</div>
                                            <div><p>The right graph compares those results to the observed outcomes for acceptors in our branch of the multiverse, where they <em>did</em> have colonoscopies. At the end of the trial, there’s a reduction of 37%. Unfortunately, data aren’t available to do this for mortality, but this confirms the idea that the true effects are probably a bit lower than what the naive correction gives.</p><p>So where does this “50% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality” everyone is quoting come from? This is a complex <em>per-protocol analysis</em> that tries to use math to “make” the acceptors be like the controls. The details are a little fuzzy because the paper does the common academic thing where it says the details are in another paper that itself cites other papers in an infinite regress. But, basically, the analysis takes data from all the acceptors and refusers and fits a big equation to predict someone’s odds of getting diagnosed with or dying from colorectal cancer based on their age, sex, country, and group (acceptor or control). Then they see how much those odds change when you flip the group assignment. This gives the much quoted decrease of 31% in colorectal cancer diagnoses and 50% in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>Because that kind of analysis is known to be unreliable, they also included a <em>sensitivity analysis</em> as a sanity check. This gave a 34% decrease in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 28% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>To summarize:</p></div>
                                            <div><figure>
      <p><img src="https://asteriskmag.com/media/pages/issues/04/you-re-invited-to-a-colonoscopy/543694bd8f-1696013997/dynomight_temp02.png" alt="">

  </figure>
</div>
                                            <div><p>The last three analyses all give something like a 33% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses. I think we can be reasonably confident that’s right.</p><p>But should we believe that 50% number from the per-protocol analysis for colorectal cancer mortality?</p><p>I mean … no?</p><p>Let’s start with common sense. Certainly, if everyone invited had colonoscopies, the observed 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality would have been higher. But would it have been <em>five times</em> larger, even though almost half of people already got colonoscopies? Doubtful. The naive correction gives a reduction of only 24% in colorectal cancer mortality, and we have strong reasons to think this is an <em>over</em>estimate.&nbsp;</p><p>The 50% number comes from a fiddly statistical technique that only works under strong assumptions. One of these is that all the ways controls and acceptors vary are included in the dataset. But the dataset used was <em>very</em> limited — it didn’t have income, education, family history, or how people’s tubes were feeling when they got the invitation. If <em>any</em> of those things influenced people’s choices to accept, then this analysis wouldn’t have been able to correct for the biases between the groups. And there weren’t that many colorectal cancer deaths during the trial (229 total), so the analysis was done on sparse data.</p><p>And the sensitivity analysis — the point of this was to check how sensitive the per-protocol analysis is to its rather tenuous assumptions. It worked! It showed that the “50% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality” calculation is <em>exquisitely</em> sensitive to those assumptions! But then everyone just sort of ignored it.</p><p>So what happened? How did we end up with so many gastroenterologists quoting this 50% number?</p><p>I wouldn’t blame the study authors. The paper largely just carries out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1306895" rel="noopener noreferrer">preregistered</a> analysis without much comment. But in a letter to the journal, the authors emphasize that the per-protocol analysis is “prone to bias” and “not as trustworthy” and “caution against overinterpretation … because the number of deaths to date was small.”</p><p>But further removed reports get from the original study, the more those cautions disappear. Other doctors writing about the study didn’t pay much attention to those concerns. By the time you get to the doctors on social media, they’re basically gone.</p><p>It’s hard not to think that there’s some motivated reasoning at work here. Around 15 million colonoscopies are done in the U.S. each year, at an average cost of something like $3,000 for each. I<em> </em>don’t think doctors are intentionally distorting the truth. But they have been trained that colonoscopies are extremely effective, and most of them are busy and — no offense — have only a superficial understanding of statistics. So when a study comes out with various numbers, it’s human nature to look much harder for flaws in the surprising numbers than the ones that reinforce your worldview.</p><p>Or, to put it another way: Imagine a world where the intention-to-screen analysis showed strong effects, but the per-protocol analysis showed weak ones. Which one do you think everyone would be quoting?</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>Intermission</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>There are no good colonoscopy jokes. I asked everyone and found none that were funny <em>or</em> tasteful. Here’s the least-terrible one, a joint effort of myself and a large language model.</p><p>Q. Why do Bayesians love colonoscopy trials?</p><p>A. Because they use <em>posteriors</em> to inform <em>priors</em>.</p><p>I know, I know. Anyway.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>Was the Trial Too Short?</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Many doctors also objected that the trial didn’t give colonoscopies a fair chance. One theory is that 10 years isn’t long enough (we'll know more when the trial ends and 15-year mortality is released). It takes years for polyps to turn into cancer and even longer for that cancer to kill you. Maybe the colonoscopies removed lots of polyps that <em>would</em> have eventually turned into cancer and/or deaths, but wouldn’t have done so <em>yet</em>.</p><p>The best way to check this theory would be to look at how previous trials evolved after 10 years. We don’t have any such trials for colonoscopies, but we <em>do</em> for sigmoidoscopies. NORCCAP ran in Norway, where 61% of men agreed to screening. UKFSST ran in the U.K., where 71% agreed to screening. Here is the reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and mortality in the invited group compared to the control group in all three trials over time:<sup>

                                            <div><p>For diagnoses, the “reduction” is negative at first because screening catches a lot of cancer that would otherwise be missed. In NordICC, the reduction is smaller than sigmoidoscopy trials probably just because NordICC saw fewer people agree to screening. But, overall, the NordICC curve looks similar to the other trials, suggesting modest gains over time.</p><p>For mortality, things just look weird. The other trials seemed to reach their maximum benefit by five to seven years and then sort of bounce around randomly. But NordICC actually had <em>higher</em> colorectal cancer mortality in the invited group until almost the end of the trial. I assume this was just bad luck. It’s hard to say what that green line will do in future years.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>Do European Doctors Suck?</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>While the equipment is standardized, colonoscopies are effectively artisanal: The doctor decides what looks bad and what should be sampled or removed. Another theory for the small effect in the NordICC trial is that since colonoscopies are less common in Europe, the doctors had less experience than American doctors.</p><p>The skill of a doctor doing a colonoscopy is often measured by their adenoma detection rate — how often they find a precancerous polyp. American doctors find them 40% of the time. In the NordICC trial, doctors found them only 31% of the time. Many suggested this meant the doctors weren’t great.</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cappell et al.</a> counter that perhaps it wasn’t the doctors but that there were more adenomas to find in the American colons because of “higher prevalence of obesity (30% vs.&nbsp;12%), a higher rate of ever having smoked cigarettes, higher fat and cholesterol consumption, and poorer physical fitness.”</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominitz and Robertson</a> reply that lifestyles notwithstanding, the U.S. has substantially <em>lower</em> rates of colorectal cancer.

                                            <div><p>The obvious interpretation is that Americans have fewer adenomas than Europeans, meaning the doctors in the trial were worse than American doctors at detecting them. But be cautious: Diagnoses aren’t a great measure of incidence, since they depend on how aggressively you look. And deaths <em>also</em> aren’t great, since they depend on treatments. It’s also conceivable that Americans do have more adenomas, but <em>because</em> colonoscopies are already common in the U.S., many get removed before they become cancer.</p><p>Also, I’m not sure I trust that the diagnosis rates in this data reflect cancer rates: Do we really believe that Norway has 45% more colorectal cancer than Sweden, despite the fact that these countries have similar diets, life expectancies, and mortality rates — and that Norwegians drink and smoke a bit less? (The mysteriously high colorectal cancer diagnosis rates in Norway have been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12705545/" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> for decades.<sup>

)</p><p>Another oddity is that there were <em>zero</em> perforations in the NordICC trial across all 12,000 colonoscopies performed whereas previous studies report them at rates between 1 in 100 and 1 in 20,000. (Perforation of the colon is fatal without emergency surgery.) One interpretation of this is that European doctors are awesome. Alternatively, Powell and Prasad give this heart-warming speculation:</p></div>
                                            <p>It has been hypothesized that the absence of perforation in NordICC was due in part by the fact that the vast majority of procedures were unsedated, preventing the operator from using more force—a contributing factor to perforation.</p>
                                            <div><p>If doing colonoscopies without anesthesia reduces perforations, that’s great. But one doctor I talked to suggested that without anesthesia it’s impossible to be as thorough, so this might reduce the benefits of colonoscopies.</p><p>Overall, I don’t think we have a clear answer here. I think there is weak evidence for the idea that the average American colonoscopy is better than those in this trial. But it’s very uncertain.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2><strong>Why Was There No Impact on Overall Mortality?</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Among nondoctors, many people were surprised that <em>overall</em> mortality rates — from any cause — were the same in the control and invited groups. Isn’t the point of colonoscopies to prevent death? Does this mean colonoscopies are worthless?</p><p>No. I ran millions of simulated trials assuming “magic colonoscopies” that reduced the odds of dying from colorectal cancer to <em>zero</em>. The results ranged from the invited group having 5.6% lower overall mortality to 2.5% <em>higher</em>.<sup>

 So we can’t conclude anything from this. There just aren’t enough people to detect a tiny signal (change in colorectal cancer mortality) that’s drowned out by tons of noise (mortality from other factors).</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>Discussion</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Are colonoscopies better than other screening methods? I don’t know. Maybe!</p><p>But on the margin, surely this trial gives <em>some</em> evidence that colonoscopies might not be as effective as we hoped. So why were American gastroenterologists so keen to dismiss it? There seemed to be no similar frenzy of doctors in other countries trying to discredit the trial.</p><p>Or, to back up — why has America settled on colonoscopies when most of the world has not? Regulators in Europe basically give two reasons that they continue to recommend fecal blood tests:</p><p>1. It’s hard to get Europeans to do any colorectal cancer screening, and <em>exceedingly</em> hard to get them to agree to colonoscopies.</p><p>2. Colonoscopies have not yet been proven to be cost-effective.</p><p>In America, neither of these apply.&nbsp; When setting recommendations, the U.S. Preventative Service Task Force explicitly does not consider costs. And since we expect colonoscopies to be effective, it would be too risky <em>not</em> to do them. Americans are probably more open to colonoscopies simply because doctors have told them for decades how important they are. (Note: None of these things are obviously bad!)</p><p>So that’s my theory. Europe wants stronger evidence for cost-effectiveness. America is more aggressive and more willing to accept high costs. I don’t think this trial changes that. Colonoscopies are still expensive, and still possibly but not conclusively better.</p><p>One thing is clear: Screening works. If you’re of the appropriate age, please get screened. If your tubes are acting funny, please get screened without delay. The best method and the level of benefit are debatable, but we know it helps. Use a stool test if you want (multitarget DNA test if you can), or a colonoscopy, or a sigmoidoscopy, or a “virtual” CT colonoscopy, or a crazy edible camera. Do one of them. Statistics show colorectal cancer is highly curable when caught early, and now that we have feisty checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies,it’s probably even better now. Just do it. Your tubes will thank you.</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article referred to the NordICC trial in the past tense. It has been updated to reflect that the trial is still ongoing. </em></p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>“Friends” star Mathew Perry was found dead Saturday in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home, law enforcement sources said.</p><p>Authorities responded about 4 p.m. to his home, where he was discovered unresponsive. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing, did not cite a cause of death. There was no sign of foul play, the sources added. A representative for Perry did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment.</p><p>The Los Angeles Police Department’s robbery-homicide detectives are investigating the death. The cause of death will be determined at a later date by the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.</p><p>Perry, the son of actor John Bennett Perry and Suzanne Marie Langford, onetime press secretary of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was born in 1969 and grew up between Montreal and Los Angeles after his parents separated when Perry was 1.</p><p>He got his start as a child actor, landing guest spots on “Charles in Charge” and “Beverly Hills 90210” and playing opposite River Phoenix in the film “A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon” in the 1980s and early 1990s. </p><p>But his big break came when he was cast in “Friends” — originally titled “Friends Like Us” — a sitcom about six single New Yorkers navigating adulthood that premiered on NBC in 1994. </p><p>The series soon became a juggernaut, the anchor of the network’s vaunted Thursday-night “Must-See TV” lineup, and turned Perry, then 25, and his castmates Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer into mega-stars almost overnight: At its high-water mark, in a 1996 post-Super Bowl slot, the series notched more than 50 million live viewers. </p><p>As Chandler Bing, the handsome, wisecracking roommate of LeBlanc’s Joey Tribbiani and, later, love interest of Cox’s fastidious Monica Geller, Perry distinguished himself in a crackling ensemble cast with his dry delivery, creating a catchphrase with a mere turn of inflection: Could he <i>be</i> any more Chandler? Soon, he was attached to major stars like Julia Roberts and appearing as a leading man opposite Salma Hayek in the 1997 rom-com “Fools Rush In.”</p><p>There was a dark side to the life of one of television’s most beloved funnymen, however. In his 2022 memoir “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” Perry recounted his lifelong struggle with addiction to alcohol and opioids, which led to multiple stints in rehab and a number of serious health issues, including a five-month hospitalization in 2018 following a colon rupture that left him, he wrote, with a  2% chance to live through the night. And it was fueled, he acknowledged during a “Friends” reunion special in 2021, by the pressure to land the joke in front of a live studio audience night after night. </p><p>“Nobody wanted to be famous more than me,” Perry told The Times in April, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-04-23/matthew-perry-keanu-reeves-friends-book-festival">discussing “Big Terrible Thing” at the Festival of Books</a>. “I was convinced it was the answer. I was 25, it was the second year of ‘Friends,’ and eight months into it, I realized the American dream is not making me happy, not filling the holes in my life. I couldn’t get enough attention. … Fame does not do what you think it’s going to do. It was all a trick.”</p><p>Though Perry estimated he had relapsed  “60 or 70 times” since first getting sober in 2001, he maintained a steady presence on American television, playing key parts in backstage dramedy “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” and therapy sitcom “Go On,” and making a steady stream of guest appearances on acclaimed shows  such as “The West Wing” and “The Good Wife.” Since his near-death experience in 2018, Perry had found solace in friendships, writing and regular games of pickleball. </p><p>Indeed, for all his success as an actor and, more recently, a bestselling memoirist, Perry told The Times in April that his work was not the center of what he hoped would be his legacy.</p><p>Pressed to name how he’d like to be remembered, he said: “As a guy who lived life, loved well, lived well and helped people. That running into me was a good thing, and not something bad.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>
