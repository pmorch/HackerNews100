<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-10-08</p><section><p>10 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1zaMttyutjMsqHUuEpCss3/8b7eb27d92e5fc53f6541d04fe0b778f/Bug_Bounty.png" alt=""><div><p>Every second, 84 million HTTP requests are hitting Cloudflare across our fleet of data centers in 330 cities. It means that even the rarest of bugs can show up frequently. In fact, it was our scale that recently led us to discover a bug in Go's arm64 compiler which causes a race condition in the generated code.</p><p>This post breaks down how we first encountered the bug, investigated it, and ultimately drove to the root cause.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="investigating-a-strange-panic">Investigating a strange panic</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We run a service in our network which configures the kernel to handle traffic for some products like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/"><u>Magic Transit</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-wan/"><u>Magic WAN</u></a>. Our monitoring watches this closely, and it started to observe very sporadic panics on arm64 machines.</p><p>We first saw one with a fatal error stating that <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c0ee2fd4e309ef0b8f4ab6f4860e2626c8e00802/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566"><u>traceback did not unwind completely</u></a>. That error suggests that invariants were violated when traversing the stack, likely because of stack corruption. After a brief investigation we decided that it was probably rare stack memory corruption. This was a largely idle control plane service where unplanned restarts have negligible impact, and so we felt that following up was not a priority unless it kept happening.</p><p>And then it kept happening.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>

          </figure><p>When we first saw this bug we saw that the fatal errors correlated with recovered panics. These were caused by some old code which used panic/recover as error handling.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, our theory was:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>All of the fatal panics happen within stack unwinding.</p></li><li><p>We correlated an increased volume of recovered panics with these fatal panics.</p></li><li><p>Recovering a panic unwinds goroutine stacks to call deferred functions.</p></li><li><p>A related <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259"><u>Go issue (#73259)</u></a> reported an arm64 stack unwinding crash.</p></li><li><p>Let’s stop using panic/recover for error handling and wait out the upstream fix?</p></li></ol><p>So we did that and watched as fatal panics stopped occurring as the release rolled out. Fatal panics gone, our theoretical mitigation seemed to work, and this was no longer our problem. We subscribed to the upstream issue so we could update when it was resolved and put it out of our minds.</p><p>But, this turned out to be a much stranger bug than expected. Putting it out of our minds was premature as the same class of fatal panics came back at a much higher rate. A month later, we were seeing up to 30 daily fatal panics with no real discernible cause; while that might account for only one machine a day in less than 10% of our data centers, we found it concerning that we didn’t understand the cause. The first thing we checked was the number of recovered panics, to match our previous pattern, but there were none. More interestingly, we could not correlate this increased rate of fatal panics with anything. A release? Infrastructure changes? The position of Mars? </p><p>At this point we felt like we needed to dive deeper to better understand the root cause. Pattern matching and hoping was clearly insufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>We saw two classes of this bug -- a crash while accessing invalid memory and an explicitly checked fatal error.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Now we could observe some clear patterns. Both errors occur when unwinding the stack in <code>(*unwinder).next</code>. In one case we saw an intentional<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566"> <u>fatal error</u></a> as the runtime identified that unwinding could not complete and the stack was in a bad state. In the other case there was a direct memory access error that happened while trying to unwind the stack. The segfault was discussed in the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259#issuecomment-2786818812"><u>GitHub issue</u></a> and a Go engineer identified it as dereference of a go scheduler struct, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536"><u>m</u></a>, when<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L458"> <u>unwinding</u></a>.&nbsp;  </p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="a-review-of-go-scheduler-structs">A review of Go scheduler structs</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Go uses a lightweight userspace scheduler to manage concurrency. Many goroutines are scheduled on a smaller number of kernel threads – this is often referred to as M:N scheduling. Any individual goroutine can be scheduled on any kernel thread. The scheduler has three core types – <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L394"><code><u>g</u></code></a>&nbsp; (the goroutine), <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536"><code><u>m</u></code></a> (the kernel thread, or “machine”), and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L644"><code><u>p</u></code></a> (the physical execution context, or&nbsp; “processor”). For a goroutine to be scheduled a free <code>m</code> must acquire a free <code>p</code>, which will execute a g. Each <code>g</code> contains a field for its m if it is currently running, otherwise it will be <b>nil</b>. This is all the context needed for this post but the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/HACKING.md#gs-ms-ps"><u>go runtime docs</u></a> explore this more comprehensively.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point we can start to make inferences on what’s happening: the program crashes because we try to unwind a goroutine stack which is invalid. In the first backtrace, if a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L446"><u>return address is null, we call </u><code><u>finishInternal</u></code><u> and abort because the stack was not fully unwound</u></a>. The segmentation fault case in the second backtrace is a bit more interesting: if instead the return address is non-zero but not a function then the unwinder code assumes that the goroutine is currently running. It'll then dereference m and fault by accessing <code>m.incgo</code> (the offset of <code>incgo</code> into <code>struct m</code> is 0x118, the faulting memory access). </p><p>What, then, is causing this corruption? The traces were difficult to get anything useful from – our service has hundreds if not thousands of active goroutines. It was fairly clear from the beginning that the panic was remote from the actual bug. The crashes were all observed while unwinding the stack and if this were an issue any time the stack was unwound on arm64 we would be seeing it in many more services. We felt pretty confident that the stack unwinding was happening correctly but on an invalid stack.&nbsp;</p><p>Our investigation stalled for a while at this point – making guesses, testing guesses, trying to infer if the panic rate went up or down, or if nothing changed. There was <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259"><u>a known issue</u></a> on Go’s GitHub issue tracker which matched our symptoms almost exactly, but what they discussed was mostly what we already knew. At some point when looking through the linked stack traces we realized that their crash referenced an old version of a library that we were also using – Go Netlink.</p>

      <h3 id="whats-async-preemption">What’s (async) preemption?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>In the prehistoric era of Go (&lt;=1.13) the runtime was cooperatively scheduled. A goroutine would run until it decided it was ready to yield to the scheduler – usually due to explicit calls to <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> or injected yield points at function calls/IO operations. Since<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime"> <u>Go 1.14</u></a> the runtime instead does async preemption. The Go runtime has a thread <code>sysmon</code> which tracks the runtime of goroutines and will preempt any that run for longer than 10ms (at time of writing). It does this by sending <code>SIGURG</code> to the OS thread and in the signal handler will modify the program counter and stack to mimic a call to <code>asyncPreempt</code>.</p><p>At this point we had two broad theories:</p><ul><li><p>This is a Go Netlink bug – likely due to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> usage which invoked undefined behavior but is only actually broken on arm64</p></li><li><p>This is a Go runtime bug and we're only triggering it in <code>NetlinkSocket.Receive</code> for some reason</p></li></ul><p>After finding the same bug publicly reported upstream, we were feeling confident this was caused by a Go runtime bug. However, upon seeing that both issues implicated the same function, we felt more skeptical – notably the Go Netlink library uses unsafe.Pointer so memory corruption was a plausible explanation even if we didn't understand why.</p><p>After an unsuccessful code audit we had hit a wall. The crashes were rare and remote from the root cause. Maybe these crashes were caused by a runtime bug, maybe they were caused by a Go Netlink bug. It seemed clear that there was something wrong with this area of the code, but code auditing wasn’t going anywhere. </p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>At this point we had a fairly good understanding of what was crashing but very little understanding of <b>why</b> it was happening. It was clear that the root cause of the stack unwinder crashing was remote from the actual crash, and that it had to do with <code>(*NetlinkSocket).Receive</code>, but why? We were able to capture a <b>coredump</b> of a production crash and view it in a debugger. The backtrace confirmed what we already knew – that there was a segmentation fault when unwinding a stack. The crux of the issue revealed itself when we looked at the goroutine which had been preempted while calling <code>(*NetlinkSocket).Receive</code>.&nbsp;    </p>

            <p>The goroutine was paused between two opcodes in the function epilogue. Since the process of unwinding a stack relies on the stack frame being in a consistent state, it felt immediately suspicious that we preempted in the middle of adjusting the stack pointer. The goroutine had been paused at 0x555577cb2880, between<code> ADD $80, RSP, RSP and ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), RSP, RSP</code>.&nbsp;</p><p>We queried the service logs to confirm our theory. This wasn’t isolated – the majority of stack traces showed that this same opcode was preempted. This was no longer a weird production crash we couldn’t reproduce. A crash happened when the Go runtime preempted between these two stack pointer adjustments. We had our smoking gun.&nbsp;</p>

    </p>
    <p>At this point we felt pretty confident that this was actually just a runtime bug and it should be reproducible in an isolated environment without any dependencies. The theory at this point was:</p><ol><li><p>Stack unwinding is triggered by garbage collection</p></li><li><p>Async preemption between a split stack pointer adjustment causes a crash</p></li><li><p>What if we make a function which splits the adjustment and then call it in a loop?</p></li></ol>
            <pre><code>package main

import (
	"runtime"
)

//go:noinline
func big_stack(val int) int {
	var big_buffer = make([]byte, 1 &lt;&lt; 16)

	sum := 0
	// prevent the compiler from optimizing out the stack
	for i := 0; i &lt; (1&lt;&lt;16); i++ {
		big_buffer[i] = byte(val)
	}
	for i := 0; i &lt; (1&lt;&lt;16); i++ {
		sum ^= int(big_buffer[i])
	}
	return sum

func main() {

}
</code></pre>
            <p>This function ends up with a stack frame slightly larger than can be represented in 16 bits, and so on arm64 the Go compiler will split the stack pointer adjustment into two opcodes. If the runtime preempts between these opcodes then the stack unwinder will read an invalid stack pointer and crash.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A reproducible crash with standard library only? This felt like conclusive evidence that our problem was a runtime bug.</p><p>This was an extremely particular reproducer! Even now with a good understanding of the bug and its fix, some of the behavior is still puzzling. It's a one-instruction race condition, so it’s unsurprising that small changes could have large impact. For example, this reproducer was originally written and tested on Go 1.23.4, but did not crash when compiled with 1.23.9 (the version in production), even though we could objdump the binary and see the split ADD still present! We don’t have a definite explanation for this behavior – even with the bug present there remain a few unknown variables which affect the likelihood of hitting the race condition.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="a-single-instruction-race-condition-window">A single-instruction race condition window</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>arm64 is a fixed-length 4-byte instruction set architecture. This has a lot of implications on codegen but most relevant to this bug is the fact that immediate length is limited.<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2020-12/Base-Instructions/ADD--immediate---Add--immediate--"> <code><u>add</u></code></a> gets a 12-bit immediate,<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0802/a/A64-General-Instructions/MOV--wide-immediate-"> <code><u>mov</u></code></a> gets a 16-bit immediate, etc. How does the architecture handle this when the operands don't fit? It depends – <code>ADD</code> in particular reserves a bit for "shift left by 12" so any 24 bit addition can be decomposed into two opcodes. Other instructions are decomposed similarly, or just require loading an immediate into a register first.&nbsp;</p><p>The very last step of the Go compiler before emitting machine code involves transforming the program into <code>obj.Prog</code> structs. It's a very low level intermediate representation (IR) that mostly serves to be translated into machine code.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/fa2bb342d7b0024440d996c2d6d6778b7a5e0247/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/obj7.go#L856

// Pop stack frame.
// ADD $framesize, RSP, RSP
p = obj.Appendp(p, c.newprog)
p.As = AADD
p.From.Type = obj.TYPE_CONST
p.From.Offset = int64(c.autosize)
p.To.Type = obj.TYPE_REG
p.To.Reg = REGSP
p.Spadj = -c.autosize
</code></pre>
            <p>Notably, this IR is not aware of immediate length limitations. Instead, this happens in<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2f653a5a9e9112ff64f1392ff6e1d404aaf23e8c/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/asm7.go"> <u>asm7.go</u></a> when Go's internal intermediate representation is translated into arm64 machine code. The assembler will classify an immediate in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2f653a5a9e9112ff64f1392ff6e1d404aaf23e8c/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/asm7.go#L1905"><u>conclass</u></a> based on bit size and then use that when emitting instructions – extra if needed.</p><p>The Go assembler uses a combination of (<code>mov, add</code>) opcodes for some adds that fit in 16-bit immediates, and prefers (<code>add, add + lsl 12</code>) opcodes for 16-bit+ immediates.&nbsp;  </p><p>Compare a stack of (slightly larger than) <code>1&lt;&lt;15</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>; //go:noinline
; func big_stack() byte {
; 	var big_stack = make([]byte, 1&lt;&lt;15)
; 	return big_stack[0]
; }
MOVD $32776, R27
ADD R27, RSP, R29
MOVD $32784, R27
ADD R27, RSP, RSP
RET
</code></pre>
            <p>With a stack of <code>1&lt;&lt;16</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>; //go:noinline
; func big_stack() byte {
; 	var big_stack = make([]byte, 1&lt;&lt;16)
; 	return big_stack[0]
; } 
ADD $8, RSP, R29
ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), R29, R29
ADD $16, RSP, RSP
ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), RSP, RSP
RET
</code></pre>
            <p>In the larger stack case, there is a point between <code>ADD x, RSP, RSP</code> opcodes where the stack pointer is not pointing to the tip of a stack frame. We thought at first that this was a matter of memory corruption – that in handling async preemption the runtime would push a function call on the stack and corrupt the middle of the stack. However, this goroutine is already in the function epilogue – any data we corrupt is actively in the process of being thrown away. What's the issue then?  </p><p>The Go runtime often needs to <b>unwind</b> the stack, which means walking backwards through the chain of function calls. For example: garbage collection uses it to find live references on the stack, panicking relies on it to evaluate <code>defer</code> functions, and generating stack traces needs to print the call stack. For this to work the stack pointer <b>must be accurate during unwinding</b> because of how golang dereferences sp to determine the calling function. If the stack pointer is partially modified, the unwinder will look for the calling function in the middle of the stack. The underlying data is meaningless when interpreted as directions to a parent stack frame and then the runtime will likely crash.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/66536242fce34787230c42078a7bbd373ef8dcb0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L373

if innermost &amp;&amp; frame.sp &lt; frame.fp || frame.lr == 0 {
    lrPtr = frame.sp
    frame.lr = *(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(lrPtr))
}
</code></pre>
            <p>When async preemption happens it will push a function call onto the stack but the parent stack frame is no longer correct because sp was only partially adjusted when the preemption happened. The crash flow looks something like this:  </p><ol><li><p>Async preemption happens between the two opcodes that <code>add x, rsp</code> expands to</p></li><li><p>Garbage collection triggers stack unwinding (to check for heap object liveness)</p></li><li><p>The unwinder starts traversing the stack of the problematic goroutine and correctly unwinds up to the problematic function</p></li><li><p>The unwinder dereferences <code>sp</code> to determine the parent function</p></li><li><p>Almost certainly the data behind <code>sp</code> is not a function</p></li><li><p>Crash</p></li></ol>

</code></pre>
            <p>Once we discovered the root cause we reported it with a reproducer and the bug was quickly fixed. This bug is fixed in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e8794e650e05fad07a33fb6e3266a9e677d13fa8"><u>go1.23.12</u></a>, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6e1c4529e4e00ab58572deceab74cc4057e6f0b6"><u>go1.24.6</u></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f7cc61e7d7f77521e073137c6045ba73f66ef902"><u>go1.25.0</u></a>. Previously, the go compiler emitted a single <code>add x, rsp</code> instruction and relied on the assembler to split immediates into multiple opcodes as necessary. After this change, stacks larger than 1&lt;&lt;12 will build the offset in a temporary register and then add that to <code>rsp</code> in a single, indivisible opcode. A goroutine can be preempted before or after the stack pointer modification, but never during. This means that the stack pointer is always valid and there is no race condition.</p>

MOVD $32, R27
MOVK $(1&lt;&lt;16), R27
ADD R27, RSP, RSP
RET</code></pre>
            <p>This was a very fun problem to debug. We don’t often see bugs where you can accurately blame the compiler. Debugging it took weeks and we had to learn about areas of the Go runtime that people don’t usually need to think about. It’s a nice example of a rare race condition, the sort of bug that can only really be quantified at a large scale.</p><p>We’re always looking for people who enjoy this kind of detective work. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?department=Engineering"><u>Our engineering teams are hiring</u></a>.   </p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Before we begin, an important clarification. What follows is a horror story based on real events from my career. However, to protect the privacy of the people and companies involved, I have deliberately mixed things up: technologies, contexts, and specific details have been modified or merged with other experiences. I therefore invite you to read this story not as a strict chronicle of a single event, but as an archetype of a widespread problem in the IT world: vendor lock-in and predatory business practices. Any attempt to identify the specific company or software described would lead to an incorrect conclusion.</p><hr><p>When the phone rang, I was in a meeting - so I didn’t answer. But I recognized the number and sent a quick message: </p><blockquote><p>"I’m with a client right now. If it’s not urgent, please send me an email - otherwise I’ll call you ASAP".</p></blockquote><p>The reply, via SMS, left me speechless: </p><blockquote><p>"That’s exactly the problem. I can’t send you an email. Call me as soon as you can".</p></blockquote><p>From that moment on, my perception of a certain kind of world changed forever.</p><hr><p>A few years earlier, a major public institution - let’s call it <em>Agency A</em> - was still running an ancient Exchange mail server. It hadn’t received security updates for ages, the anti-spam was completely ineffective, and the new regulations were clear: embrace Open Source solutions whenever possible.</p><p>They had already received a proposal - expensive but seemingly reasonable - for a managed service, hosted by an external provider, built on an open source mail stack. The company offered a managed version with its own proprietary additions and enterprise support. The catch? The price was absurd, and <em>Agency A</em> already had solid infrastructure - reputable IP classes, redundant datacenters, everything working fine. We had built and maintained that environment for years, and it was still running perfectly.</p><p>The request was simple: <em>“Evaluate this solution, and if it’s suitable, we’ll migrate.”</em>. About 500 active mailboxes, roughly the same number of aliases. Manageable, but far from trivial.</p><p>So I started experimenting. I had heard of that stack before but never used it directly. I deployed it in some non-critical environments - ours, and a few test clients who agreed to try it at a discounted rate. Everything worked flawlessly for almost a year. I began to appreciate its design and flexibility. Confident, I told <em>Agency A</em> we could proceed with a pilot migration.</p><p>We built a new server, deployed the stack, and assigned a few secondary domains for early adopters. The feedback was great - so good that users started pushing for a full migration.<br> The IT team planned carefully: created accounts and aliases, migrated selected mailboxes, and kept the old Exchange server online (hidden, for legacy access).</p><p>The morning after the MX switch I was tense, waiting for trouble - but it never came. A couple of small questions, nothing serious. The internal team handled everything perfectly. It was a success.</p><hr><p>Word spread quickly.</p><p><em>Agency B</em> - smaller, but in some ways more influential - contacted me. They were customers of the same managed-service company that had pitched to <em>Agency A</em>. Once they saw the potential savings (at less than a tenth of the annual cost), the stability, and the freedom of keeping their data on their own servers, they became very interested. Their contract, however, was a five-year deal with automatic renewal - two years left. The legal office said the notice period was six months, so there was time.</p><p>They wanted to prepare silently. Their supplier was known for <em>aggressive commercial behavior</em> and often retaliated when customers tried to leave. So we built everything quietly - users, aliases, test setups - and froze the system, waiting for the official termination notice.</p><p>That day finally came. The notice was sent, about eight months before expiration. Migration would begin upon confirmation of receipt - or the following month at the latest.</p><p>Meanwhile, I learned that <em>Agency C</em> - another institution - was also planning to leave the same provider. They wanted to keep the same software stack for consistency, so I told them about our experience. They asked for a quote, which I prepared (without mentioning <em>Agency B</em>, of course). My margin would have been small, but the project made sense: it was about <em>owning your data</em>, not making money.</p><p>Everything seemed to move smoothly - until that SMS.</p><hr><p>I called back immediately.</p><blockquote><p>"There’s been a problem with the termination" said the IT manager of <em>Agency B</em>.<br> "Somehow they found out what we were doing. There are hidden clauses we didn’t know about, and now we can’t leave - at least not for another five years. They know everything. Even your quote.".</p></blockquote><p>I was stunned. How could they possibly know?</p><p>Minutes later, my phone rang again - <em>Agency C</em> this time. </p><blockquote><p>"Forget the proposal", they said. "They called us. Threatened us, actually. They even mentioned your name and said they might take legal action against you for unfair competition - claiming they’re the only <em>‘authorized’</em> installers of that software. Which is absurd, of course. It’s open source. But our director doesn’t want trouble.".</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, when public money is involved, people prefer avoiding troubles over doing what’s right.</p><hr><p>Something didn’t add up.<br> Then someone at <em>Agency C</em> noticed a clue: a former interim IT manager still had an email client connected via token authentication - with access to all messages. And that person had signed the original contract with the provider years before. Informally questioned, he admitted contacting them "to warn them" but claimed it was harmless. He never mentioned me - supposedly.</p><p>That still didn’t explain how they knew about <em>Agency B</em>’s internal steps. To test a theory, we set a trap: I asked a friend abroad to send <em>Agency B</em> a fake quote, from a company outside the EU.<br> The following Monday, the provider called <em>Agency B</em> and said, "We advise against working with non-EU companies - compliance can get tricky.".</p><p>That strongly suggested it: <strong>it looked as if they might have been reading the emails.</strong></p><p>The IT manager exploded and confronted them. The response was chilling: </p><blockquote><p>"I’m not saying we do - but we could. It’s in the contract. You should read the fine print, especially the unilateral amendment from two years ago.".</p></blockquote><p>That amendment, quietly accepted, included horrifying clauses:<br> - notice period extended from 6 to 12 months<br> - formerly free services could become paid at the provider’s discretion<br> - and, "for security reasons", they could disable any access other than the webmail - which they promptly did.</p><p>All of this happened before the GDPR era, when certain practices could still slip through.</p><hr><p>I tried to contact the company’s owner directly - no reply. Calls, emails, nothing. Their support lines were "not authorized to forward requests". I wanted to confront them about the <em>“not accredited”</em> nonsense and the so-called <em>unfair competition</em>. But bullies never like a fair conversation.</p><p>I urged <em>Agency B</em> and <em>C</em> to investigate - not only legally, but ethically.<br> They were horrified, yes - but in the end, nothing changed.<br> Worse: the provider, invoking that same contract amendment, made previously free features paid ones, increasing their costs by another 30%.<br> Management wasn’t outraged by the abuse - just by the extra expense, "hard to justify in the budget".</p><hr><p>Years later, those directors were gone. The technical staff remained - older, wiser, and determined not to repeat the mistake. They eventually switched providers, though to something "safer", not necessarily better.</p><p>I couldn’t solve that problem. The battle had to come from them, and I would have supported them all the way - not for profit, but for principle.<br> Because when a company that claims to <em>“support open source”</em> behaves like that, we all lose.<br> We all get labeled the same way.</p><p>And that’s the real horror of the story - not the software, but what people do with it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                        <!-- Contentteller Template: publish_teaser_image -->
                        <p><img src="https://www.guru3d.com/data/teaser/226/8042eeca5148cf31ca512f2f80ee2eb8dbb74a/2025-10-08_09_05_51-guru3d.webp" alt="teaser"></p><p>Synology has backtracked on one of its most unpopular decisions in years. After seeing NAS sales plummet in 2025, the company has decided to lift restrictions that forced users to buy its own Synology hard drives. The policy, introduced earlier this year, made third-party HDDs from brands like Seagate and WD practically unusable in newer models such as the DS925+, DS1825+, and DS425+.

That change didn’t go over well. Users immediately criticised Synology for trying to lock them into buying its much more expensive drives. Many simply refused to upgrade, and reviewers called out the move as greedy and shortsighted. According to some reports, sales of Synology’s 2025 NAS models dropped sharply in the months after the restriction was introduced.
                                    </p><p>Now, with the release of <strong>DSM 7.3</strong>, Synology has quietly walked the policy back. Third-party hard drives and <strong>2.5-inch SATA SSDs</strong> can once again be used without triggering warning messages or reduced functionality. Drives from Seagate, WD, and others will work exactly as they did before—complete with full monitoring, alerts, and storage features.</p>
<p>For users, this means more choice and lower costs when building or upgrading a NAS. For Synology, it’s a much-needed course correction after months of backlash. While the company hasn’t publicly admitted fault, it’s clear that sales pressure and community outrage played a major role in reversing the decision.</p>
<p>Critics say the entire episode has damaged Synology’s reputation. The company seemed to believe that after QNAP’s well-known ransomware troubles, it could tighten control of the market without losing customers. Instead, the plan backfired—hard. Many loyal users have since turned to alternative brands or expressed hesitation about buying another Synology product.</p>

<p>Still, the return of open drive support is good news for anyone running a Synology NAS. It restores the flexibility that made the brand so popular in the first place. Whether this move is enough to win back frustrated users remains to be seen, but for now, DSM 7.3 brings a welcome dose of freedom back to the platform.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was almost entirely driven by investment in data centers and information processing technology, according to <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/jason-furman">Harvard economist Jason Furman</a>. Excluding these technology-related categories, Furman <a href="https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284">calculated in a Sept. 27 post on X.com</a> GDP growth would have been just 0.1% on an annualized basis, a near standstill that underlines the increasingly pivotal role of high-tech infrastructure in shaping macroeconomic outcomes.<a href="https://www.cmacrodev.com/the-global-economy-is-on-a-two-way-track/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.cmacrodev.com/the-global-economy-is-on-a-two-way-track/"></a></p><div>



<div><p>Furman’s findings, shared online and echoed by financial analysts including Robert Armstrong of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802"><em>Financial Times</em>‘ Unhedged</a> (the same writer who coined the term “TACO trade’), echo <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/">several months of observations</a> on the remarkable surge in data-center infrastructure. In August, Renaissance Macro Research estimated, to date in 2025, the dollar value contributed to GDP growth by AI data-center buildout had surpassed U.S. consumer spending for the first time ever. That’s remarkable considering <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11657" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11657">consumer spending is two-thirds of GDP</a>.<a href="https://x.com/AllVentured/status/1951770496711934459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/AllVentured/status/1951770496711934459"></a></p><p>Technically, as Furman notes, investment in information-processing equipment and software was only 4% of U.S. GDP for the first half of 2025, yet it also accounted for fully 92% of GDP growth over that period. Furman added it’s probably not the case the U.S. economy would have recorded almost no expansion at all absent this buildout, reasoning that “absent the AI boom we would probably have lower interest rates [and] electricity prices, thus some additional growth in other sectors. In very rough terms that could maybe make up about half of what we got from the AI boom.” But still, it’s big.<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802"></a></p></div><p>Tech giants such as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/facebook/">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/">Nvidia</a> have poured tens of billions of dollars into building and upgrading data centers, responding to explosive demand for artificial intelligence and large language models that require massive computing resources. 



</p><p>Lisa Shallet, chief investment officer for <a href="https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/">Morgan Stanley</a> Wealth Management, flagged on Sept. 29 that spending was truly massive among the so-called “hyperscalers” who are striving for huge computing, storage and networking capacity. 



</p><p>“In recent years, hyperscaler capex on data center and related items has risen fourfold and is nearing $400 billion annually,” she wrote. “The speed of growth and size of the investment are skewing its aggregate economic impact, with the top 10 spenders accounting for nearly a third of all spending … For perspective, it’s estimated that data center-linked spending is adding roughly 100 basis points to U.S. real GDP growth.”</p><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="764" height="426" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p>



<h2>The ‘mystery’ of the economy</h2>



<p>This surge in technology-led growth comes against a backdrop of wider economic sluggishness and paradoxically strong GDP growth. Job creation has slowed, raising concerns that, absent technology investment, the U.S. economy could have slipped into recession. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html"></a>Other sectors—from manufacturing and real estate to retail and services—contributed little or even detracted from overall output in the first half of 2025. 



</p><p>And yet, as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apollo-global-management/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apollo-global-management/">Apollo Global Management</a> Chief Economist Torsten Sløk has noted, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/us-economy-getting-stronger-not-weaker-apollo-torsten-slok-growth-gdp-spending-jobs/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/us-economy-getting-stronger-not-weaker-apollo-torsten-slok-growth-gdp-spending-jobs/">GDP figures speak of a (statistically) strong economy</a>. 



</p><p>“The consensus has been wrong since January,” Sløk said in a note circulated to clients in early October, adding the average of economists’ forecasts has said the U.S. economy would slow down for nine months consecutively. “But the reality is that it has simply not happened … We in the economics profession need to look ourselves in the mirror.”



</p><p>Furman’s analysis adds to the snarky and accurate observation by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html">Rusty Foster</a> of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.todayintabs.com/">Today in Tabs</a></em>&nbsp;who quipped: “Our economy might just be three AI data centers in a trench coat”—an allusion to the data-center buildout boom and to the cartoon trope/sight gag of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-sight-gag-where-three-small-people-stack-up-in-a-trench-coat-and-pretend-to-be-one-ordinary-size-adult" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-sight-gag-where-three-small-people-stack-up-in-a-trench-coat-and-pretend-to-be-one-ordinary-size-adult">several young boys</a> teaming up to disguise themselves as an adult.</p><p>Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Michael Gapen ventured a guess on Oct. 6 about “the mystery” of the 2025 economy, “between solid spending data and weak hiring.” He argued that it “can be explained by a corporate sector that absorbed the initial cost of tariffs and reduced unit labor costs and profitability rather than raising prices.” 



</p><p>In other words, something that has nothing to do with the data-center buildout that is widely fueling bubble fears, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/jeff-bezos-amazon-openai-sam-altman-ai-bubble-tech-stocks-investing/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/jeff-bezos-amazon-openai-sam-altman-ai-bubble-tech-stocks-investing/">even among Amazon founder Jeff Bezos himself</a>, who insists these data centers are an “industrial bubble” rather than a financial one, and we will all be glad someday to have such incredible computing power at our fingertips with so many hundreds of billions spent. The question of sustainable GDP growth is a separate one.<br></p></div><p><strong>Fortune Global Forum</strong> returns Oct. 26–27, 2025 in Riyadh.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A million-year-old human skull suggests that the origins of modern humans may reach back far deeper in time than previously thought and raises the possibility that <em>Homo sapiens</em> first emerged outside of Africa.</p><p>Leading scientists reached this conclusion after reanalysis of a skull known as Yunxian 2 discovered in China and previously classified as belonging to a member of the primitive human species <em>Homo erectus</em>.</p><p>After applying sophisticated reconstruction techniques to the skull, scientists believe that it may instead belong to a group called <em>Homo longi </em>(dragon man), closely linked to the elusive Denisovans who lived alongside our own ancestors.</p><p>This repositioning would make the fossil the closest on record to the split between modern humans and our closest relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, and would radically revise understanding of the last 1m years of human evolution.</p><p>Prof Chris Stringer, an anthropologist and research leader in human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, said: “This changes a lot of thinking because it suggests that by 1m years ago our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed. It more or less doubles the time of origin of <em>Homo sapiens</em>.”</p><p>The skull was first unearthed in Hubei province in 1990, badly crushed and difficult to interpret. Based on its age and some broad-brush traits, it was assigned as <em>Homo erectus</em>, a group that is thought to have contained direct ancestors of modern humans.</p><p>The latest work used advanced CT imaging, high-resolution surface scanning and sophisticated digital techniques to produce a virtual reconstruction of the skull. The skull’s large, squat brain case and jutting lower jaw are reminiscent of <em>Homo erectus</em>. But the overall shape and size of the brain case and teeth appear to place it much closer to <em>Homo longi</em>, a species that scientists have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/10/jawbone-fossil-builds-richer-image-of-ancient-denisovans" data-link-name="in body link">recently argued</a> should incorporate the Denisovans.</p><p>This would push the split between our own ancestors, Neanderthals and <em>Homo longi</em> back by at least 400,000 years and, according to Springer, raises the possibility that our common ancestor – and potentially the first <em>Homo sapiens</em> – lived in western Asia rather than Africa.</p><p>“This fossil is the closest we’ve got to the ancestor of all those groups,” Stringer said.</p><p>A computational analysis of a wider selection of fossils suggests that in the last 800,000 years, large-brained humans evolved along just five major branches: Asian erectus, heidelbergensis, sapiens, Neanderthals and <em>Homo longi</em> (including the Denisovans).</p><p>“We feel that this study is a landmark step towards resolving the ‘muddle in the middle’ [the confusing array of human fossils from between 1m and 300,000 years ago] that has preoccupied palaeoanthropologists for decades,” Stringer said.</p><p>The findings run counter to some recent analyses based on genetic comparisons of living humans and ancient DNA, meaning the conclusions are likely to be contentious.</p><p>Dr Frido Welker, an associate professor in human evolution at the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the research, said: “It’s exciting to have a digital reconstruction of this important cranium available. If confirmed by additional fossils and genetic evidence, the divergence dating would be surprising indeed. Alternatively, molecular data from the specimen itself could provide insights confirming or disproving the authors’ morphological hypothesis.”</p><p>The findings are published in the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9202" data-link-name="in body link">Science</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>Clickbait-y title, I know :D but I stand by it!</p>
<p>I noticed that many people still treat email like some sort of second-class citizen when it comes to personal information, and the urgency here is real.
I think, in today's world where everything is in apps and requires an account, email has become even more important than your <strong>home address</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Your Email Is Your Digital Home</h2>
<p>Think about it for a moment. What would happen to you if you lost access to your email and needed to change it? Now, compare that to changing your home address.</p>
<p>For the second one, maybe you'd need to change some delivery addresses, and update government documents and bills. But that's common practice, and most places probably have procedures to handle that, and it's still not that many places. It's a solvable chore.</p>
<p>Now think if you lost access to your email address. What would you have to do to fix it? Create a new one, fine. But how will you log into all of your apps where the identifier is the email address itself? You need to contact each of the companies through their customer service, which is often painful.</p>
<p>And think how many conversations you would have to have? Uber? Customer service. Netflix? Customer service. YouTube/Google? Customer service. It's just a <strong>nightmare</strong>.</p>
<p>Look at how many important things you are getting today in your emails. Invoices → email. Password resets → email. Security notices → email.</p>
<p>My point here is that email has become our second home address on the internet. And we use that one piece of personal information way more than our normal address these days.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The "How": Taking Control of Your Email</h2>
<p>Okay, so the boring "why" we covered. Now it's the part where I'm showing you how to deal with it.</p>
<p>I will show you how I have it set up.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Get Your Own Domain</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with free email addresses is that they are under someone else's domain, so they have <strong>full control</strong> over your email address.</p>
<p>To fix that, you first need to have your email address under your <strong>own domain</strong>.</p>
<p>For that, you need to find a provider that is well-respected in the "email community." Why? Because the email protocol is quite an interesting case of "we don't ditch old stuff." To properly use email without constant rejection from various email providers, your domain needs to be "known" by them. So, setting up your own email server is, in practice, out of the question.</p>
<p>But you can go, for example, with Google (G Suite/Google Workspace), or with Proton Email, or anything else that is somewhat well known.</p>
<p>I went with G Suite from Google because it comes with a slightly different privacy policy than normal Gmail, and only G Suite offers custom domains in the Google ecosystem. So, to ease myself from having a second, secondary Gmail, I went with this one. But others are also viable options.</p>
<p>Next, you need to follow the instructions of your chosen provider to set up your own email address on your domain. In practice, it will involve setting <strong>DNS MX records</strong> for your domain and some verification.</p>
<p>Oh, and I highly recommend providers that offer a <strong>"catch-all" feature</strong>. This way, you can have one main email address and unlimited <code>&lt;put something here&gt;@yourdomain.com</code> email addresses. It's useful to have it separated, like <code><a href="https://karboosx.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b4dad1c0d2d8ddccf4cddbc1c6d0dbd9d5ddda9ad7dbd9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, but still receive the emails inside the same inbox.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Step 2: The Unbannable Backup</h3>
<p>Now, you have your domain, and your email is under that domain. We don't stop here. Your emails are still inside your email provider. If they block you, you will probably lose access to previous emails, but at least now you have the option to just switch MX records to a different provider to start receiving emails again.</p>
<p>But we don't want that! We want <strong>full control</strong> over our emails!!!</p>
<p>So how do we handle it? Simple: making a <strong>backup</strong>!</p>
<p>The easiest would be to set up your local email software like Outlook or Thunderbird to download all emails to your local computer. It's something, and it will work, but if you happen to have some local server, I have a better proposition.</p>
<p>Set up some simple email server on your local server. I'm using my <strong>NAS</strong>. Just pick a subdomain for your email so it will look like <code><a href="https://karboosx.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="492b282a223c39092b282a223c396730263c3b2d2624282027672a2624">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p>
<p>With your simple local email server, you can set up your email provider to <strong>always forward</strong> any email to your local server.</p>
<p>With that, you will always have a copy of every email on your server. So even if you are on vacation and your service provider blocks you from accessing your inbox, you will still have your copy.</p>
<p>graph LR
    A[Author/Sender] --&gt; B(Your Email Provider);
    B --&gt; C(Online Inbox/Access);
    B -- Forward Email --&gt; D(Local Backup Server);
    D --&gt; E[Your Local Email Copy];
</p>
<p>And would you like to hear the bonus tip? With this solution, there's a high chance that if they ban you by mistake (AI bots are to blame), they will <strong>not disable the forwarding mechanism</strong>. They will just not allow you to authenticate to your account. That means you will still be able to read all your emails even when banned from your inbox!</p>
<hr>
<p>So there you have it. That's my method for making your most important internet asset, your email, truly <strong>unbannable</strong> and resilient. It takes a little setup, but the peace of mind knowing that I'm in control of my digital life—not some huge corporation—is totally worth it. Now go take back control!</p>

Today, we are releasing the <a href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use">Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model</a>, our new specialized model built on Gemini 2.5 Pro’s visual understanding and reasoning capabilities that powers agents capable of interacting with user interfaces (UIs). It outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web and mobile control benchmarks, all with lower latency. Developers can access these capabilities via the Gemini API in <a href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/computer-use">Vertex AI</a>.</p><p data-block-key="b74v6">While AI models can interface with software through structured APIs, many digital tasks still require direct interaction with graphical user interfaces, for example, filling and submitting forms. To complete these tasks, agents must navigate web pages and applications just as humans do: by clicking, typing and scrolling. The ability to natively fill out forms, manipulate interactive elements like dropdowns and filters, and operate behind logins is a crucial next step in building powerful, general-purpose agents.</p><h2 data-block-key="2t6df">How it works</h2><p data-block-key="7bmpr">The model’s core capabilities are exposed through the new `computer_use` tool in the Gemini API and should be operated within a loop. Inputs to the tool are the user request, screenshot of the environment, and a history of recent actions. The input can also specify whether to exclude functions from the <a href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use#supported-actions">full list of supported UI actions</a> or specify additional custom functions to include.</p></div>

Thus, it is critical to implement safety guardrails with care.</p><p data-block-key="ab068">We have trained safety features directly into the model to address these three key risks (described in the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Model-Cards/Gemini-2-5-Computer-Use-Model-Card.pdf">Gemini 2.5 Computer Use System Card</a>).</p><p data-block-key="7liej">Further, we also provide developers with safety controls, which empower developers to prevent the model from auto-completing potentially high-risk or harmful actions. Examples of these actions include harming a system's integrity, compromising security, bypassing CAPTCHAs, or controlling medical devices. The controls:</p><ul><li data-block-key="3f5gh"><b>Per-step safety service:</b> An out-of-model, inference-time safety service that assesses each action the model proposes before it’s executed.</li><li data-block-key="cu905"><b>System instructions:</b> Developers can further specify that the agent either refuses or asks for user confirmation before it takes specific kinds of high-stakes actions.

It came along at just the right moment as Elon Musk’s purchase and takeover of Twitter led millions of users head toward any type of exit.</p><p>The initial destination for many was Mastodon, but its Linux geek ethos and system of numerous “federated” servers that communicate via the open-source ActivityPub protocol proved to be too complicated for people who just wanted to crack jokes. Acting on the opportunity, Bluesky opened up to the public in February 2024 and saw a rapid influx of users.</p><p><span>Besides being easier to sign up and use than Mastodon, Bluesky offered a different approach to content moderation that was more flexible and user-driven. In addition to making its software source code available under open licenses, Bluesky wanted to put moderation decisions in the hands of its users, encouraging them to make lists of accounts that could be automatically blocked or labeled—and thereby removing itself as much as possible from moderation decisions that have plagued discussion group administrators </span><a href="https://flux.community/matthew-sheffield/2021/11/problems-social-media-are-not-technology-challenges-they-are-social/" rel="">since the days of Usenet newsgroups</a><span>.</span></p><p>Millions of people flooded in after Bluesky opened its doors to the public. By November of 2024, there were nearly 1.5 million daily posters, most of them anti-Musk Twitter refugees who were eager to get away from Musk’s right-wing makeover of the site into X.</p><p><span>However, as time has gone by, </span><a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats" rel="">Bluesky’s traffic has declined</a><span> (</span><a href="https://backlinko.com/twitter-users" rel="">X’s has as well</a><span>) and some of its users have become increasingly upset at its moderation decisions, including allowing U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/" rel="">anti-trans writer Jesse Singal</a><span> to remain as users of the platform. Singal became a particular target, prompting a </span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/bluesky-must-enforce-its-community-guidelines-equally" rel="">petition</a><span> with more than 28,000 signatures urging Bluesky to “enforce its Community Guidelines” against him that has not been successful, although he has been </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/" rel="">temporarily banned</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Accusations of indifference to anti-trans bigotry seem to have exacerbated some users’ frustrations with the platform for its alleged tolerance of racist content. In 2023, many launched a “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/bluesky-racism-slur-apology-feedback/" rel="">posting strike</a><span>” after they discovered that Bluesky allowed people to sign up for user names containing racial slurs, a policy the company quickly reversed and apologized for.</span></p><p><span>The labeling feature of Bluesky has been more positively regarded, with many people subscribing to lists to label or block Trump supporters, Singal, and other widely disliked journalists. But things have not been perfect. Several users have complained about being added to libelously named lists, while others have complained that stalkers have added them to numerous lists out of revenge. Trying to balance concerns between legitimate blocklist maintainers and victims of false accusations, Bluesky </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/bluesky-addresses-trust-and-safety-concerns-around-abuse-spam-and-more/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">unveiled a series of changes</a><span> to its </span><a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/tos" rel="">terms of service</a><span> which brought it more in line with other social platforms, but also sparked controversy because now users can get blocklists hidden by reporting on them.</span></p><p>The failure of the Singal ban effort has also continued to grate on Bluesky’s most persistent critics, and the site’s executives have been met with many critical and often off-topic replies and quote posts.</p><p>While Bluesky has been navigating user concerns, its engineering team has been moving ahead with its long-promised open source efforts, breaking up its software stack into several pieces to enable a federated Authenticated Transfer Protocol (ATProto) network where anyone with the know-how and funds could run their own copy of Bluesky.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png" width="708" height="575" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:708,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are several key pieces of code that combine to make the Bluesky network function: A personal data server (PDS) which hosts the official/canonical copies of its users’ posts and profile information. Whenever it’s updated, the data is combined and sent to a Relay server, which combines and indexes posts from many different PDSes to create what social networks call the “firehose,” the collection of all posts made on the network.</p><p><span>The firehose data is imported by a labeler program which categorizes it in various ways set up by users, the processed data is combined together by an application server (or AppViews as they’re called </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3lyucxfxq622w" rel="">for now</a><span> in Bluesky). When a user logs into their PDS and pushes “refresh,” their local app connects to the PDS’s designated feed generator which serves up a cached version of the accounts they follow.</span></p><p><span>While the ATProto system has been criticized as overly complicated </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network" rel="">compared to the ActivityPub system</a><span> that powers the Fediverse, it has one key feature that ActivityPub lacks: the ability to transfer servers while keeping all of your followers and posts.</span></p><p>Due to the complexity of the Bluesky software stack, whether its federation model actually works in practice has not really been put to the test. While ActivityPub has several instances with millions of users (like Facebook Threads, Flipboard, and even Donald Trump’s Truth Social), it also has many much smaller ones run by small organizations and individuals.</p><p><span>As of this writing, however, the only completely independent implementation of ATProto is Bluesky. But that isn’t for want of trying on the part of Rudy Fraser, the creator of </span><a href="https://blacksky.community/" rel="">Blacksky</a><span>, an alternative service that he unveiled in May of 2023 in response to Black American users’ complaints about Bluesky’s moderation policies.</span></p><p>Despite Fraser’s efforts to implement his own PDS, Relay, and App View, however, Blacksky still remains partially dependent upon Bluesky’s application server, largely because while the code to implement the dataplane of posts and users within an application server is released, the open-source version is slower. As a result, Blacksky is dependent on Bluesky’s application server to give users a fast experience, which also means that it is dependent on Bluesky’s labeling system and its moderation choices.</p><p>The labeling software, called Ozone, also has issues, according to Bluesky engineer Bryan Newbold.</p><p>“Making it easier to run moderation services is something we want to do. we invested a lot of time and effort in Ozone, but have not been able to focus on making it usable/accessible for independent folks,” he wrote in an Oct. 3 post, adding that “we are looking at funding folks to fork or re-implement it for community use-case.”</p><p>This limitation is likely to be another reason why Blacksky relies on Bluesky's AppView. Without it, Blacksky’s independent moderators couldn't actually perform their task. (Fraser did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him for comment.)</p><p>Blacksky’s continued dependency on Bluesky came into focus on Sunday after a Blacksky user going by the handle Link suddenly found himself unable to view his own posts on the alternative site.</p><p><span>“My account was taken down without any explanation for almost a full day,” Link told me in a Signal message, showing me a screenshot indicating that he had been banned even as his Blacksky account remained capable of viewing others’ posts and changing preferences. Unbeknownst to him, Link’s account had been banned by Bluesky’s moderators and this meant that even though he was in good standing at Blacksky, no one there, including himself, was able to read his posts. (They are visible </span><a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:63hvnyjvqi2nzzcsjgnry5we/app.bsky.feed.post" rel="">within the ATProto firehose feed</a><span>, however, as several sharp-eyed users soon discovered.)</span></p><p><span>Link’s banning came at a very bad moment for Bluesky, just weeks after it had banned or suspended several users following the Sept. 10 murder of far-right activist Charlie Kirk, which many Republican officials have sought to use as a tool for </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/kirk-trump-cancel-culture-assassination-4d69649e382ea46d8dcf794150a1d3c9" rel="">government censorship</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr’s threats against late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel led to his temporary suspension by ABC, and he was far from the only Republican to issue them. Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, chair of the House subcommittee on federal law enforcement, </span><a href="https://clayhiggins.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/9.15.25_Rep.-Higgins-Letter-to-Big-Tech-re-Charlie-Kirk-1.pdf" rel="">sent a menacing letter</a><span> to Bluesky and other social media networks demanding that they identify and ban anyone deemed to be celebrating Kirk’s killing.</span></p><p>“The authors of these posts are to be identified and banned from your platform, as well as any new pages they may create,” he wrote. “The reasonable restriction of public statements that lie far beyond the standards of our own society is not an oppression of free speech, it is, rather, the protection of free speech.”</p><p><span>There’s no proof that Higgins’s threats against social media platforms led to Bluesky banning anyone, but in any case, more than a few users were permanently or temporarily banned for mocking Kirk’s death, including horror author </span><a href="https://www.tcj.com/horror-it-girl-gretchen-felker-martin-on-dc-pulling-red-hood-after-charlie-kirk-comments-i-had-no-regrets/" rel="">Gretchen Felker-Martin</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The fallout from the Kirk controversies and the months of replies seems to have irked Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, and she began pushing back on the user complaints. On Oct. 1, she </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25dl2ibnc2y" rel="">approvingly quoted</a><span> a user who had referenced the famous </span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-bitch-dats-a-whole-new-x-wtf-is-you-talkin-about" rel="">pancakes-waffle Twitter meme</a><span> about how liking pancakes doesn’t mean disliking waffles, adding: “Too real. We’re going to try to fix this. Social media doesn’t have to be this way.”</span></p><p><span>Graber’s post was soon met by </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antioccident.bsky.social/post/3m25emit7w22r" rel="">a reply</a><span> asking if she’d banned Singal yet, prompting her to </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25esnq4t22y" rel="">respond</a><span> in all-caps: “WAFFLES.”</span></p><p><span>The next day, Thursday, Graber returned to her theme, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2a73ot5uk2e" rel="">posting a photograph</a><span> of a berry-covered waffle, accompanied with the caption: “Amazing breakfast this morning. I love waffles.”</span></p><p><span>As might be expected, Graber’s trolling was not taken well by her critics. The waffles post received more than 1,700 replies, including many </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billcorbett.bsky.social/post/3m2aajss5hs2q" rel="">mocking her</a><span> as a Musk-like figure.</span></p><p><span>On Friday, Graber turned more serious </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7ge42us2t" rel="">in her pushback</a><span>: “Harassing the mods into banning someone has never worked. And harassing people in general has never changed their minds,” she wrote, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7hy7zus2t" rel="">adding later</a><span> that: “Yet it’s a behavior that persists across social media anyway, with negative consequences for civil discourse and society. Human nature is a contributing factor, but systems that reward outrage only make the problem worse.”</span></p><p><span>Among the more than 100 people who quoted Graber’s post that day was Link. He </span><a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:63hvnyjvqi2nzzcsjgnry5we/app.bsky.feed.post/3m2cerd243k2a" rel="">posted a photo of Kirk</a><span> which he accompanied with descriptive text that read: “Charlie Kirk sitting in a white T-shirt that says freedom. A negative consequence follows.”</span></p><p><span>Link made a number of other posts after to that one, but on Sunday his Blacksky account stopped working. After receiving no contact from either Blacksky or Bluesky, Link messaged Bluesky’s moderation team and received </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aliafonzy.blacksky.app/post/3m2jm7ugr6k2y" rel="">an email</a><span> about 3 hours later saying that he had violated the social network’s community guidelines in his quote of Graber days earlier, presumably its policies against “threats or encouragement of violence.”</span></p><p>That is not how Link sees his post.</p><p><span>“I want to be extremely clear I was not making a death threat or inciting violence,” he told me, saying that he had sent 12 separate examples of other people posting the same Kirk image as a </span><a href="https://x.com/liv_agar/status/1975210544018989119?s=42" rel="">reaction meme</a><span>. “I don’t wish death on Jay, I wish for her and her team to grow a conscience. I disagree with the decision and how it was handled. My account was taken down without any explanation for almost a full day in what can only be viewed as a retroactive ban.”</span></p><p>I’ve asked Bluesky whether the post had been reported as a violation by other users. I will update this story if I receive a response. Rudy Fraser, the Blacksky administrator has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>Asked about why Link had to contact Bluesky to find out what had happened to his account rather than receiving a notice, Paul Frazee, the service’s CTO, said that it was “unfortunate,” and that Bluesky needed to finish adding a feature to let users of external PDSes know if they have been banned by Bluesky labelers.</p><p><span>Agree or disagree on whether Bluesky has treated Link fairly, the incident has exposed that the social network’s decentralization plans have yet to be fulfilled. Blacksky seems to be the furthest-along alternative ATProto implementation, but it’s still dependent on Bluesky. There’s another one called </span><a href="https://northskysocial.com/profile/posts" rel="">Northsky Social</a><span>, but it has not launched any services yet. And while there are several alternative AppViews such as </span><a href="https://deer.social/" rel="">Deer.social</a><span>, there does not seem to be any service (or combination of services) that can function as a full-stack implementation of ATProto.</span></p><p><span>This might explain why, despite having a network of </span><a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats" rel="">nearly 40 million users</a><span>, no situation like Link’s banning seems to have happened during Bluesky’s very short lifespan.</span></p><p><span>The episode has sent more than a few Bluesky users to start wondering whether the snow-covered grass on Mastodon’s side of the road is </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kozufox.bsky.social/post/3m2k5pf63ks2h" rel="">worth considering</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But not everyone is looking forward to the idea: “I’d go back to Usenet before I went back to Mastodon,” wrote Bluesky user </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/horseknuckler.bsky.social/post/3m2abce3vss2w" rel="">Count Von Horse Knuckler</a><span>. “I do not need people yelling at me for not putting cat pictures behind trigger warnings or unwanted Linux advice.”</span></p><p><span>Help may be on the horizon, however. As developers are becoming more aware of the power of ATProto, they are building increasingly complex projects on it, including a promising service called </span><a href="https://slices.network/" rel="">Slices</a><span>, which aims to make it easy to build and deploy custom AppViews, a feature Blacksky and other Bluesky alternatives could certainly use. Bluesky execs have said they are working hard to make federation easier.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Link is caught in limbo.</p><p>“Now my account is not viewable on either Blacksky or Bluesky,” he notes. “I’m fortunate that I moved over to Blacksky and I think that is the only reason I still have access to my account and data…Bluesky claims to want decentralization and composable moderation, but they still enjoy abusing the power of arbitrary banishment.”</p><p>This story has been updated to include a post from Bluesky developer Bryan Newbold.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Eliminating CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions from flying is going to be expensive, regardless of the solution the world adopts.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-175436430" href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails#footnote-1-175436430" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>But aviation also contributes to global warming through its non-CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> effects. Those are mostly “contrails”, which I’ll explain in more detail soon. Getting rid of those could be incredibly cheap. So cheap that it’s difficult to understand why we don’t just go ahead and fix it.</span></p><p><span>On a </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4aMv3y9bS6E93l9pmcN0F5" rel="">recent podcast</a><span>, I spoke to Ian McKay, CEO of Orca Sciences, about this. One of their portfolio projects is </span><a href="http://contrails.org/" rel="">Contrails.org</a><span>. Their solution to eliminating contrails is to accurately forecast and model the atmospheric conditions that generate them, and reroute planes so that they avoid these “contrail-forming” parts of the atmosphere.</span></p><p><span>This is a solution that </span><em>I</em><span> hadn’t really paid much attention to, and most people are unaware of. So I thought I’d do a deep dive on contrails; explore how this solution might work; and whether it’s really that cheap.</span></p><p><span>To pre-empt the critics: this solution does not mean the aviation industry can ignore the CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> impacts of flying. Tackling contrails would not absolve them of responsibility for finding low-carbon alternatives to jet fuel. It’s not a substitute, but an addition. Currently, their non-CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> impacts are not measured or reported, so bringing more attention to contrails means they’re taking </span><em>full</em><span> responsibility for their climate impact, which is not the case at the moment.</span></p><p>When you see a plane in the sky, you might see a small, white cloud-like trail behind it. Those are contrails (short for “condensation trails”).</p><p><span>Water vapour, soot and other particles (basically pollutants) are emitted from the back of jet engines. Water droplets can condense around these particles, and because it’s pretty cold up there, they can freeze to form ice crystals. Sometimes these white lines are very faint and hard to see. But in some cases, they can form “</span><a href="https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/clouds/high-clouds/cirrus" rel="">cirrus clouds</a><span>”: wispy ones that form at high altitudes.</span></p><p>These contrails can have both cooling and warming impacts. I’ve sketched this out in the schematic below.</p><p>Some sunlight can reflect off of them, rather than passing through to the surface, which has a cooling effect.</p><p>Most sunlight, though, does pass through, and outgoing irradiation then gets trapped by the cirrus clouds. This has a warming effect, which tends to be larger than the cooling one, so on net, contrails cause warming.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png" width="692" height="376.4175824175824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:792,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:692,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHPb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeafba6b-7f9e-4484-ad96-4de21143b989_2048x1114.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Since someone asked about this over email: the fact that there is no sunlight at night, and less during winter, there is less to “reflect” off the top of cirrus clouds. That means the cooling effect is weaker at night, and in winter, and the net warming effect stronger. This means avoiding contrails in winter and at night has an even stronger impact on reducing warming.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-175436430" href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails#footnote-2-175436430" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>It’s common to want to compare them to CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions, but it’s first worth emphasising how different the contributions are in terms of intensity and persistence.</span></p><p>Contrails have a strong “effective radiative forcing” effect. This basically measures the net change in energy flow at the top of the atmosphere: and that change in energy flow dictates how much warming is needed at the surface to offset it. But, this warming effective is very short-lived. If we were to stop contrails today, the warming effect would disappear within a day or so.</p><p>Think of it like a very brief but strong pulse of energy.</p><p><span>CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>, on the other hand, has a smaller effect on radiative forcing, but once you emit it, it stays there for centuries or more.</span></p><p><span>I thought this diagram from </span><a href="http://contrails.org/" rel="">Contrails.org</a><span> makes this point clearly.</span><strong> </strong><span>This </span><a href="https://notebook.contrails.org/comparing-contrails-and-co2/" rel="">article by them</a><span> explains the comparison in much more detail.</span></p><p><span>When we think about the climate impacts of aviation, then, most of the warming from CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions is not due to the emissions </span><em>this year</em><span>, but the cumulative effect (which persists) over the past 70 years. But for contrails, the warming impact is only really from those created very recently (hours to days); the small temperature response decays over months to a few years.</span></p><p><span>You might have heard people say that “more than half of the warming caused by aviation comes from non-CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> sources”. A big part of that is contrails. But this does not mean that for any given flight, half of the warming is coming from contrails and the other half from burning jet fuel.</span></p><p><span>This apparent ‘half-half’ balance is a coincidence of timing: the cumulative CO₂ effect built up over decades happens to be of similar order to the instantaneous contrail effect for that year. In the chart below you can see the effective radiative forcing caused by CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> and contrails in 2019. Again, the CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emitted </span><em>in</em><span> 2019 is just a small part of the warming. Most of comes from emissions built over decades, that stay there. It just so happens that this cumulative amount of warming is not that different from the instantaneous, short-lived impact of contrails in 2019. Eventually more and more CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions will accumulate, and the share coming from contrails will shrink in relative terms.</span></p><p>But as it stands today, we could get rid of around half of the warming impact — maybe slightly less — from aviation, if we were to tackle contrails. The impact would be almost immediate.</p><p><span>How, then, do contrails stack up in terms of total warming? They contribute roughly 2% to the world’s effective radiative forcing; tackling them would reduce that by a similar amount.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-175436430" href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails#footnote-3-175436430" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>What this comparison should make extremely clear is that reducing contrails does not mean we don’t also need to tackle CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions from aviation. Ultimately that is the persistent driver of long-term temperature change. What tackling contrails now would do is slightly reduce the </span><em>rate</em><span> of warming (and therefore do something reduce the risks of nearer-term feedbacks that could affect the release of CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> from natural systems, and also affect long-term temperature change). It is not an excuse or a substitute for finding a way to decarbonise jet fuel.</span></p><p>One crucial reason why eliminating contrails could be so cost-effective is that a very small percentage of flights create the majority of the impact. This means we don’t need to divert or shift the trajectory of all the world’s flights; only a few percent of them.</p><p><span>In the chart below, you can see the breakdown of the warming effect across the world’s flights.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-175436430" href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails#footnote-4-175436430" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> On the left-hand side, we have the share of flights, and on the right, their collective contribution to the total warming impact of contrails.</span></p><p>Just 3% of flights generate 80% of the warming. A further 14% generate 29%.</p><p><span>You might notice that this sums to 109%. But this is because some flights generate a </span><em>cooling</em><span> effect of 9%. Put them together and we get 100%.</span></p><p>Most flights — three-quarters of them — barely generate contrails at all and cause no warming or cooling.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png" width="603" height="497.3921703296703" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1201,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:603,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Jwp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf1a58f-a987-4b12-aded-fd39c23393a3_1542x1272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Some sources cite slightly different numbers for this “80% warming effect”.

These forecasts and models are what </span><a href="http://contrails.org/" rel="">Contrails.org</a><span> do.</span></p><p><span>Google also launched “</span><a href="https://sites.research.google/gr/contrails/" rel="">Project Contrails</a><span>” which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to build models that can do this.</span></p><p>Of course, this wouldn’t work if these planes had to do a severe detour. People would not be happy about a longer flight time. And, the extra fuel that would need to be burned to go the extra distance would eventually cancel out the climate benefits from getting rid of the contrails.</p><p><span>The proposed detours typically result in a 1% shift (and again, this is only for a small percentage of flights). That means increasing fuel use and flight time </span><a href="https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26061/iata-d1-devaiah-and-simon-iata-raes-contrails-workshop-10-11-march-2025.pdf" rel="">by around 1%</a><span>. So if your flight is three hours long, it’s only adding an extra two minutes. For a 10-hour flight, six minutes. This seems socially acceptable to me; most people would barely notice.</span></p><p>The fact that the warming impact is skewed towards such a small share of flights dramatically reduces the costs.</p><p>What are the costs associated with implementing this?</p><p>There are operational costs associated with weather prediction, modelling, and integration into flight planning. Especially with the integration of AI, this is probably not that expensive. A bit more costly is the extra jet fuel that’s needed for rerouted planes.</p><p><span>When I spoke with Ian McKay, he suggested the additional cost would be around $5 per flight.

Add the operational costs of the forecasting, and this could be $30 to $40. Then spread across </span><em>all</em><span> flights, not just the rerouted ones, and this falls back down to the $5 to $10 range again.</span></p><p><span>Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) </span><a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/contrail-avoidance" rel="">estimates that</a><span> the cost could range from $2 to $5 </span><em>per passenger</em><span> (or </span><em>hundreds</em><span> of dollars per flight).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9-175436430" href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails#footnote-9-175436430" target="_self" rel="">9</a></span><span> They do note that they make very conservative assumptions, and therefore find costs that are 3 to 10 times higher than those from other sources.</span></p><p>For a flight in Europe, such as from Barcelona to Berlin, the cost would be €1.20 ($1.88) per passenger. A Transatlantic ticket would be more expensive, around €3.90 for a trip from Paris to New York.

Let’s take a quick example for British Airways. They operate around 300,000 flights per year. If we reroute 2% of those to avoid contrails, and rerouting increases fuel burn by around 2% (I’m being deliberately harsh here), then I estimate that the additional fuel costs are in the range of $1.2 to $2 million per year.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12-175436430" href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/eliminating-contrails#footnote-12-175436430" target="_self" rel="">12</a></span><span> Let’s say that the operational costs of forecasting and modelling adds another 50%. That takes us to around $2.5 to $3 million.</span></p><p><span>In 2024, British Airways </span><a href="https://www.iairgroup.com/media/u0wjmpj4/full-year-results-release-for-the-year-to-31-december-2024.pdf" rel="">had an</a><span> operating profit of around $2.7 billion. Contrail avoidance would therefore be just 0.1% of its operating profits.</span></p><p>But I’m not convinced that this cost factor is the main reason. They could pass this cost on to consumers; flight prices vary by a lot more than a few dollars for a variety of factors. They could either make a huge deal of the fact that they’re dramatically cutting their climate impact, and get “PR” buy-in from consumers for that. Or they could keep quiet, and most consumers would never notice the difference in cost.</p><p>The second — which seems more likely — is that, currently, most people are unaware of the climate impact of contrails. In that sense, airlines can basically ignore it and pretend they don’t exist. By trying to tackle them, they’d only draw more attention. People would then be aware that the climate impact of aviation is even higher than they thought.</p><p><span>I still think that the airline that steps up and commits to eliminating contrails — possibly even claiming to have </span><em>halved</em><span> its climate impact — would be well-received by many customers. I would see it as reputational gain, rather than a risk. </span></p><p>Nonetheless, there are no signs that the aviation industry itself is going to step up. This is where government policy could step in.</p><p><span>Rather than an airline leading by example, a country or region could. In a more pro-climate political environment, the United States could have led this effort domestically, mandating that internal flights eliminate their contrails. More likely is the European Union. It has already been making some progress in this direction — not by mandating that airlines pay for contrail avoidance — but by simply reporting these climate impacts in the first place. Earlier this year, its trading system regulations </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2018/2066/2025-01-01/eng" rel="">were updated</a><span> to require airlines to monitor and report non-CO2 impacts.  That sounds basic, but it is not the standard across most of the world; these impacts are usually not included. Unsurprisingly, it has received pushback from the aviation industry, with </span><a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/opinions/why-the-eu-mrv-on-non-co2-emissions-should-be-voluntary" rel="">them asking</a><span> for these reports to be voluntary.</span></p><p>Progress will undoubtedly be met with initial resistance, but I still think that regulatory policy seems like the most likely path to widespread implementation.</p><p><span>What would help a lot is increasing </span><em>public</em><span> awareness of the existence of contrails, their climate impacts, and how inexpensive it could be to eliminate them. There is a general understanding that decarbonising aviation is expensive, and this often means the aviation industry gets more of a free ride. But this is based on replacing jet fuel. If people were aware that it could cut a huge chunk of its footprint at a fraction of the cost, they might be more demanding.</span></p><p>Eliminating a few percent of the world’s warming is a big deal when the costs are so small. It seems insane to me that such a cheap solution is sitting there, completely untapped.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				<h3>from the <i>formerly-open-ecosystem</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>It would be something of an understatement to say that Alphabet, Google’s holding company, is <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GOOG:NASDAQ">big and successful</a>. Some Wall Street analysts are even predicting it could become the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-says-alphabet-googl-052439525.html">world’s most valuable corporation</a>. Of course, even for business giants, enough is never enough. They always want more: more money, more power. As part of that tendency, Google seems to have decided that <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, the free and open source app store for the Android platform, is a threat to the official Google Play Store that needs to be neutralized. At least that is likely to be the effect of Google’s announcement that it will <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">require all Android developers to register and be verified</a> before their apps can be allowed to run on certified Android devices. A <a href="https://f-droid.org/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">post on the F-Droid blog</a> explains what the problem is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In addition to demanding payment of a registration fee and agreement to their (non-negotiable and ever-changing) terms and conditions, Google will also require the <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#verify-your-identity">uploading of personally identifying documents</a>, including government ID, by the authors of the software, as well as <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps">enumerating</a> all the unique “application identifiers” for every app that is to be distributed by the registered developer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the blog post, the impact on the F-Droid project would be severe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the developer registration decree will end the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users will be left adrift, with no means to install — or even update their existing installed — applications.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">Google says</a> registration is needed to “better protect users from repeat bad actors spreading malware and scams”. Registration “creates crucial accountability, making it much harder for malicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down.” Slightly less convenient, perhaps, but not much harder. The F-Droid blog post points out that its open source app store already has a far better approach to security than Google’s proposed registration and verification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>every [F-Droid] app is free and open source, the code can be audited by anyone, the build process and logs are public, and reproducible builds ensure that what is published matches the source code exactly. This transparency and accountability provides a stronger basis for trust than closed platforms, while still giving users freedom to choose. Restricting direct app installation not only undermines that choice, it also erodes the diversity and resilience of the open-source ecosystem by consolidating control in the hands of a few corporate players.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google is at pains to emphasize “Verified developers will have the same freedom to distribute their apps directly to users through sideloading or through any app store they prefer.” But that’s not true: their “freedom” will be soon be conditional, subject to Google’s whim and veto (as the company’s recent <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">removal of the ICE-spotting app ‘Red Dot’</a> demonstrates). As a special concession, the company says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>we are also introducing a free developer account type that will allow teachers, students, and hobbyists to distribute apps to a limited number of devices without needing to provide a government ID.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But again that is subject to Google’s approval, and only allows distribution to a “limited number of devices” – a circumscribed “freedom”, in other words. And for F-Droid it’s not even an option, because of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How many F-Droid users are there, exactly? We don’t know, because we don’t track users or have any registration: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html">“No user accounts, by design”</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the F-Droid post comments, Google’s move is not credibly about “security”, but actually about “consolidating power and tightening control over a formerly open ecosystem”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs you want on it. This is just as true with the apps on your Android/iPhone mobile device as it is with the applications on your Linux/Mac/Windows desktop or server. Forcing software creators into a centralized registration scheme in order to publish and distribute their works is as egregious as forcing writers and artists to register with a central authority in order to be able to distribute their creative works. It is an offense to the core principles of free speech and thought that are central to the workings of democratic societies around the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google’s attack on F-Droid is ironic. At the heart of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>, and the key element that allowed it to become so successful so quickly, is the GPL-licensed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>. Over the years, Google has increased its control over Android by adding more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Licensing">non-free elements</a>. If, as seems likely, its latest move leads to the shutdown of the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/04/twif.html">15-year-old F-Droid platform</a>, it would represent a further betrayal of the open source world it once supported.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data (around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains 45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs (e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the parameters.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) paid $825,000 earlier this year to a company that manufactures vehicles equipped with various technologies for law enforcement, including fake cellphone towers known as “cell-site simulators,” which&nbsp;can be used to spy on nearby phones. &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=TECHOPS+SPECIALTY+VEHICLES%2C+LLC++AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">public records</a>, the award dated May 8 “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.” &nbsp;</p>







<p>The contract was signed with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company. TOSV also signed a similar contract with ICE in September 2024 for $818,000, showing that the relationship between the agency and the company predates the Trump administration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>TOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch in an email that he could not provide details about the ICE contracts and the vehicles, citing “trade secrets.” But Brianas did confirm that the company does provide cell-site simulators, although it does not make them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We don’t manufacture electrical, comms, and technology components, we integrate that product into our overall design of the vehicle,” said Brianas, who declined to say from where TOSV sources its cell-site simulators. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the latest federal contract that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals some of the technologies</a> powering the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In early September, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes found a recently unsealed search warrant</a> that showed that ICE used a cell-site simulator to track down a person who allegedly was part of a criminal gang in the United States, and who had been ordered to leave the country in 2023.&nbsp;In the article, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes reported</a> that it also found a contract for “cell site simulator vehicles,” but the article did not name the company that provides the vans to the agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cell-site simulators also go by the name “stingrays” because some of the earlier types of these devices, made by defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris), were named that way. Since then, stingrays have become a catch-all name for this type of technology, also known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/who-catches-the-imsi-catchers-researchers-demonstrate-stingray-detection-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMSI catchers</a>. (IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, a unique number that identifies every cellphone user in the world.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the name suggests, cell-site simulator tools can mimic a cellphone tower, tricking every phone in its nearby range to connect to the device and thus giving law enforcement the ability to better identify the real-world location of those phones and their owners. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some cell-site simulators can also intercept regular calls, text messages, and internet traffic.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Authorities can get data from traditional cellphone towers to find the current or past location of a suspect, but the location is usually not very precise. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Stingray-like devices have been in use by law enforcement for more than a decade and have long been controversial because authorities do not always get a warrant for their use, and <a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">critics say</a> these devices ensnare innocent people by default.&nbsp;These devices are also shrouded in secrecy, because the law enforcement agencies that use them are under strict non-disclosure agreements not to reveal how the devices work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ICE has a long history of using cell-site simulators. In 2020, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICE deployed them at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019</a>. The agency used these tools more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017, <a href="http://buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/this-is-how-many-times-the-department-of-homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News</a> at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ICE acknowledged TechCrunch’s request for comment, but did not respond to a series of questions, which included: what ICE uses these vehicles for, whether and where they have recently been deployed, and whether the agency always gets a warrant when using cell-site simulators. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-from-surveillance-vans-to-bookmobiles-nbsp">From surveillance vans to bookmobiles&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Headquartered just outside of Washington, DC, TOSV sells a wide range of customizable vehicles to <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">law enforcement</a>, such as vans for SWAT armed response teams, bomb squads, and so-called “mobile lab” and “cover surveillance” vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among these vehicles for police forces, TOSV lists several “projects,” including one described as <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/projects/dhs-mobile-forensic-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DHS Mobile Forensic Labs</a>, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the website, these mobile forensic vans are “equipped for on-site forensic analysis and documentation,” have “secure compartments for evidence preservation and investigative tools,” and enable “seamless case file updates and evidence logging.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another project is the <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/projects-1/dhs-mobile-command-van" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DHS Mobile Command Van</a>,” which TOSV says is “configurable for advanced surveillance and mission coordination.” &nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s unclear if these vans are the same vehicles that include cell-site simulators, as there’s no mention of the phone surveillance tool anywhere on TOSV’s website. &nbsp;</p>

<p>ICE has other contracts with TOSV for mobile forensic labs, which don’t specify which technologies are located in the vans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to its website, TOSV also sells so-called “<a href="https://www.techopssv.com/community-outreach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bookmobiles</a>,” which appear to be libraries on wheels, as well as <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/medical-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">medical</a> and <a href="http://techopssv.com/fire-and-ems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fire department</a> vehicles.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>The big idea of James C. Scott’s <a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/Seeing%20Like%20a%20State%20-%20James%20C.%20Scott.pdf"><em>Seeing Like A State</em></a> can be expressed in three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modern organizations exert control by maximising “legibility”: by altering the system so that all parts of it can be measured, reported on, and so on.</li>
<li>However, these organizations are dependent on a huge amount of “illegible” work: work that cannot be tracked or planned for, but is nonetheless essential.</li>
<li>Increasing legibility thus often actually <em>lowers</em> efficiency - but the other benefits are high enough that organizations are typically willing to do so regardless.</li>
</ol>
<p>By “legible”, I mean work that is predictable, well-estimated, has a paper trail, and doesn’t depend on any contingent factors (like the availability of specific people). Quarterly planning, OKRs, and Jira all exist to make work legible. Illegible work is everything else: asking for and giving favors, using tacit knowledge that isn’t or can’t be written down, fitting in unscheduled changes, and drawing on interpersonal relationships. As I’ll argue, tech companies need to support both of these kinds of work.</p>
<p>Thinking in terms of legibility and illegibility explains so many of the things that are confusing about large software companies. It explains why companies do many things that seem obviously counter-productive, why the <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/breaking-rules">rules in practice</a> are so often out of sync with the rules as written, and why companies are surprisingly willing to tolerate rule-breaking in some contexts.</p>
<h3>Seeing like a state</h3>
<p>James C. Scott was writing about the “high modernist” movement in governance that produced (among other things) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Forest">tidy German forests</a> of the 19th century<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. In order to produce wood at scale, the German state demanded <em>legibility</em>: forests that an inspector could visit to tally up the amount of healthy trees. That means that you must be able to walk through the forest - i.e. the underbrush must be controlled - and the trees ought to be ideally laid out in neat rows of a single type.</p>
<p>Proponents of legibility often describe their processes as “efficiency measures” or ways to “avoid waste”. But overall, the new “efficient” forests were in fact far less efficient than the old, illegible forests. They produced less wood per year and required more effort to fight disease, because the underbrush proved surprisingly load-bearing to the health of the soil, and the variety of species turned out to have been an asset. The new homogeneous forests could be wiped out by a single parasite or disease in a way that the older, more varied forests could not.</p>
<p>However, the advantages of legibility are enormous. Once you know exactly how many trees you have, you can plan ahead, make large trade deals, avoid graft, and so on. To me, this is the most interesting point Scott makes. Large organizations did genuinely think that more legibility would necessarily increase efficiency<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. But even when it became clear that that was false, <em>those organizations continued pushing for legibility anyway</em>, because the other advantages were too powerful.</p>
<h3>Seeing like a software company</h3>
<p>It’s the same way in software companies. It’s almost a truism among software engineers that a single engineer can be more efficient alone than they can by working as part of a team. That’s why there are so many anecdotes about engineers taking leave to finally get some work done, or about productive work being done on nights and weekends.</p>
<p>Likewise, it should be obvious to any practicing engineer that engineer-driven work goes far more swiftly than work that is mandated from above. Engineer-driven work doesn’t need to be translated into something that makes sense, doesn’t need to be actively communicated in all directions, and can in general just be done in the most straightforward and efficient way.</p>
<p>This is why tiny software companies are often much better than large software companies at delivering software: it doesn’t matter that the large company is throwing ten times the number of engineers at the problem if the small company is twenty times more efficient<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Why don’t large companies react to this by doing away with all of their processes? <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/is-he-stupid-is-she-smart-are-they-stupid">Are they stupid?</a> No. The processes that slow engineers down are the same processes that make their work <em>legible</em> to the rest of the company. And that legibility (in dollar terms) is more valuable than being able to produce software more efficiently.</p>
<h3>Why legibility is valuable to tech companies</h3>
<p>What does legibility mean to a tech company, in practice? It means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The head of a department knows, to the engineer, all the projects the department is currently working on</li>
<li>That head also knows (or can request) a comprehensive list of all the projects the department has shipped in the last quarter</li>
<li>That head has the ability to <em>plan</em> work at least one quarter ahead (ideally longer)</li>
<li>That head can, in an emergency, direct the entire resources of the department at <em>immediate</em> work</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that “shipping high quality software” or “making customers happy” or even “making money” is not on this list. Those are all things tech companies want to do, but they’re not <em>legibility</em>.</p>
<p>Our small-but-efficient software company meets only one of these criteria: the ability to pivot to some immediate problem that needs solving. The other information is all locked up in various engineers’ heads, who may or may not remember what they did two months ago (and who certainly won’t be willing to commit to work two months from now). That’s not necessarily a problem, so long as everyone’s on the same page about what needs doing and the product is continuing to improve.</p>
<p>A typical large software company meets almost all of these criteria - I say almost, because in some companies or departments the ability to direct <em>immediate</em> work has atrophied (more on that later). But aside from that, large companies are usually very good at cataloguing what is being worked on, remembering what’s been shipped in the past, and planning work in the medium-to-long-term.</p>
<p>Why are these capabilities so valuable to a large software company, when small software companies can do without them? This is leaving my area of expertise somewhat, but I’m pretty sure the main answer is <strong>large enterprise deals</strong>. Making deals with large enterprise customers is fantastically profitable. Any sufficiently large SaaS will thus pivot from small customers to enterprise customers, if it can<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. But enterprise deals (a) can take many, many months to set up, and (b) require making long-term feature commitments. An illegible company is not configured to be able to stick with a boring enterprise deal for many months, constantly answering questions and delivering features. Large enterprise customers simply won’t trust a small software company to deliver the things they need over the next year or two.</p>
<p>Customers like this typically value legibility very highly, and so demand that their vendors also be legible. In fact, highly legible organizations struggle to communicate at all with organizations that are less legible (and vice versa). They don’t have access to the right bona fides, they don’t talk the same language, and so on. This puts real pressure on growing tech companies to become more legible, even if it hurts their ability to deliver software.</p>
<h3>Legible assumptions</h3>
<p>In the pursuit of legibility, large tech companies make simplifying assumptions about the nature of tech work. For instance, they assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any engineers with the same job title perform roughly the same.</li>
<li>Engineers can be shuffled and reorganized without substantial loss of productivity.</li>
<li>A team will maintain the same level of productivity over time, if it has the same number of engineers.</li>
<li>Projects can be estimated ahead of time, albeit with some margin for error. The more time spent estimating a project, the more accurate the estimate will become.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, all of these are false. <strong>Within the same job title, there is <em>significant</em> variance in engineering ability.</strong> Engineers have different skillsets and interests, and will work much more productively on projects that are a good fit for them. Because of this, the productivity of a team has a weak relationship to the number of engineers on the team.</p>
<p>Project estimates are largely fantasy. More accurately, they’re <em>performative</em>: <strong>the initial estimate determines the kind of engineering work that gets done to deliver by that estimate, not the other way around</strong>. For this reason, breaking down a project into parts and estimating each part often delivers a less accurate estimate, because it makes it harder for engineers to align with the overall ship date.</p>
<p>However, these assumptions are true enough for their purpose, which is to provide legibility to the executives in charge of the company. Whether the project estimate is accurate or not, it can be used to plan and to communicate with other large organizations (who are themselves typically aware that these estimates ought not to be taken completely seriously).</p>
<h3>Temporary sanctioned zones of illegibility</h3>
<p>I mentioned above that large companies sometimes lose the ability to prioritize immediate work. This is because the processes that make work legible also impose a serious delay. Consider the steps that a hypothetical large company might take before beginning to write code on a problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Somebody has a product idea.</li>
<li>They take that idea to the Product org, where it goes into the “planning” stage. Meetings are had about the idea.</li>
<li>Once the Product org formally decide they want to do it, the idea then passes to the Engineering org: into the hands of some council of engineering architects, who are tasked with the initial technical review. They figure out how it fits into the general engineering priorities and give it a very rough time estimate.</li>
<li>The VPs and senior managers in the engineering org then negotiate which team will own the work. Often this is a semi-technical, semi-organizational decision (because which service the work should fall into is at least partly a technical question).</li>
<li>Finally the work lands on the team. It enters the team planning backlog, where the team technical lead breaks it out into smaller pieces of work.</li>
<li>Those smaller pieces of work enter the team ticket backlog, and are estimated in the team’s weekly planning meeting.</li>
<li>Finally some of those pieces of work make it into the next sprint, and are picked up by an engineer who can actually do it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m leaving out many crucial parts of this process: the updates on each ticket, which then roll up to higher levels of management, legal and design review, which can themselves take weeks, and then the final steps involved in shipping the change to customers. All of this makes the work very legible, but <strong>none of this is compatible with work that has to be done <em>right now</em></strong>. What do you do when there’s a sudden, urgent technical problem - maybe you’re about to overflow your <code>int</code> ID column on the users table, or some very large customer is experiencing a show-stopping bug?<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>To solve this kind of problem, tech companies often reserve the right to create <em>temporary</em> zones where illegible work is allowed. Sometimes these are called “virtual teams”, or “strike teams” (or even the colourful name “tiger teams”). They are composed of hand-picked engineers who are trusted by the organization. Often there is no manager assigned at all, but instead some very senior engineer who’s tasked with running the project. These teams are given a loose mandate - like “stop the database from falling over every few days” - and allowed to do basically whatever it takes to get it done.</p>
<p>This is a smart compromise between complete illegibility, which as I discussed above would make the company unable to make deals with its richest customers, and complete legibility, which would force even urgent company-killing issues to go through the entire laborious process of scoping, planning and estimating. </p>
<p>Even when siloed to a temporary team, sanctioned illegibility still coexists awkwardly with the rest of the organization. Engineers outside the team don’t like seeing other engineers given the freedom to work without the burden of process: either because they’re jealous, or because they’re believers in process and think that such work is unacceptably dangerous. Managers also don’t like extending that level of trust. That’s why sanctioned efforts like this are almost always temporary. The majority of the illegible work that occurs in large organizations is still <em>unsanctioned</em>.</p>
<h3>Permanent zones of unsanctioned illegibility</h3>
<p>If you’re an engineer on team A, and you need team B to do some kind of work for you, the formal way to do this is to create an issue in their “planning” backlog and wait for it to go through the entire twelve-step process before it finally makes its way into one of their sprints, where hopefully somebody will pick it up and do it. This can take weeks to months. When what you want is a one-line change, it’s incredibly frustrating to watch your requested work item go through all these steps - each one of which takes many times longer than it would take to simply do the work.</p>
<p>The official way around this problem is that team A should anticipate in their planning process that team B will need to do this work, so that piece for team B can enter their backlog at the same time as it enters team A’s backlog. That way (in theory) they should be complete at around the same time<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>. Any practicing software engineer knows how ridiculous this idea is. You can never anticipate every change that has to be made months before you start writing code.</p>
<p>The <em>actual</em> way around this problem is <strong>illegible backchannels</strong>. An engineer on team A reaches out to an engineer on team B asking “hey, can you make this one-line change for me”. That engineer on team B then does it immediately, maybe creating a ticket, maybe not. Then it’s done! This works great, but it’s illegible because the company can’t expect it or plan for it - it relies on the interpersonal relationships between engineers on different teams, which are very difficult to quantify. If you’re a well-liked engineer, your ability to pull on these backchannels is significantly greater than if you’re brand-new or have a bad reputation. But how well-liked you are is not something companies can officially use when they’re planning projects.</p>
<p>Backchannels are a constant presence at all levels of the company. As well as engineer-engineer cross-team backchannels, there are backchannels inside teams, between managers, product managers, and so on. Often when a question is asked formally in a public space, it’s already been rehearsed and workshopped privately with the person who’s answering the question. None of this is or can be documented as part of the formal processes of the company, but it’s load-bearing nonetheless. Many formal processes simply cannot function without the consensus mechanisms or safety valves offered by backchannels.</p>
<p>Sometimes backchannels can go badly. Earlier this year I wrote <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/predators"><em>Protecting your time from predators in large tech companies</em></a> about how some people use backchannels to benefit themselves at the expense of the naive engineers they’re requesting work from. And it never feels good when you get the sense that everyone in a meeting has privately discussed the topic ahead of time except for you. For these reasons, some people think that backchannels themselves are a bad thing, and that all communication should go via formal, legible channels.</p>
<h3>Sociopaths, clueless, and losers</h3>
<p>There’s another text which has been as influential to many as <em>Seeing Like A State</em>. This one isn’t a book, but a blog post: <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/"><em>The Gervais Principle</em></a> by Venkatesh Rao. Rao divides organizations into three groups. At the top are the “sociopaths”, who cynically use organizational rules for their own benefit. In middle management are the “clueless”, who are bought into the formal rules of the organization and don’t realise that there’s a deeper game being played above their heads. Below them are the “losers”, who realise there’s a game being played but don’t want to play it. The name “losers” is not a value judgement - I think it’s meant to affectionately pick out people like the leads in <em>Clerks</em>, who are too authentic to get involved in the corporate game.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with everything in <em>The Gervais Principle</em>, though I think it’s worth a read (if you’re interested in this stuff, you should also read the excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Moral-Mazes-World-Corporate-Managers/dp/0199729883"><em>Moral Mazes</em></a>). But the categories here can be very naturally read in terms of <em>legibility</em>. Both sociopaths and losers are engaged with the illegible world of the organization. Sociopaths use this world to climb the ladder, while losers use it to carve out a cosy low-effort niche for themselves.</p>
<p>The “clueless” are only engaged with legible processes. They’re the people who, when they want to get promoted, go and look up the formal job ladder and make a plan for how they can exemplify each of the values at the next level. They’re concerned with doing everything by the book. When they’re forced into an encounter with the illegible world, their reaction is to shake their heads and start drafting updates to the legible process that can accommodate some pale approximation of the more-efficient illegible process.</p>
<p>I think it’s far too cynical to call these people clueless. Legible process is still very important - after all, it’s the large part of what the organization does. Improving formal processes is still very high-leverage work, even if formal processes can’t ever describe the entirety of how an organization operates. People who are invested in legibility have real value to any tech company.</p>
<p>However, thinking about people in Rao’s categories - people who exploit illegibility, people who find it distasteful, and people who use it casually - can be illuminating. Many frequent areas of conflict in software companies stem from the friction between these groups of people.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I write a lot about recognizing and using illegibility in tech companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking the (formal, legible) rules is <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/breaking-rules">sometimes the right thing to do</a></li>
<li>Beware of savvy product managers (and others) exploiting illegible channels to <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/predators">chisel work out of naive engineers</a></li>
<li>Competent engineers should work on <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/side-bets">“side bets”</a> that are outside the normal planning process</li>
<li>Getting promoted to Staff and above has <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/staff-engineer-promotions">very little to do</a> with the formal job ladder</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, advice about illegible processes is what I call <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/dangerous-advice">“dangerous advice”</a>. It’s dangerous because if you make it legible - for instance, if you announce publicly that you’re getting a piece of work done through backchannels instead of the formal process - you will be punished by the organization <em>even if your management chain wanted you to do it</em>. You can’t speak too loudly about it. It has to stay illegible.</p>
<p>I get a lot of negative feedback on these posts from people who say that you should never sidestep the formal process. According to them, if it needs changing, you should change the process instead of going around it. In other words, everything that goes on in a tech company should be <em>legible</em>, and <em>illegible</em> processes should be stamped out and converted to legible ones.</p>
<p>I think this view is naive. All organizations - tech companies, social clubs, governments - have both a legible and an illegible side. The legible side is important, past a certain size. It lets the organization do things that would otherwise be impossible: long-term planning, coordination with other very large organizations, and so on. But the illegible side is just as important. It allows for high-efficiency work, offers a release valve for processes that don’t fit the current circumstances, and fills the natural human desire for gossip and soft consensus. </p>
