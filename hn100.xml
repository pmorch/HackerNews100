            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/firechat-was-a-tool-for-revolution-then-it-disappeared/">https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/firechat-was-a-tool-for-revolution-then-it-disappeared/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40204516">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   

<p>For years, FireChat helped people circumvent their internet gatekeepers— the authoritarian governments and spineless corporations that control our every move through a network of proprietary data centers and deep-sea cables.</p>
<p>In Iran, forty thousand people downloaded the app when their government blocked internet access. Over one hundred thousand protesters in Hong Kong used the app to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/firechat-messaging-app-powering-hong-kong-protests">coordinate their resistance</a> against Chinese authority. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_Movement">Singaporeans</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/firechat-comes-to-uoh-students-rescue/articleshow/50691376.cms">Indians</a>, <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2015/06/28/the-internet-a-staging-post-for-protests-in-ecuador-is-under-threat/">Ecuadorians</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-30/russians-are-organizing-against-putin-using-firechat-messaging-app">Russians</a>, and seemingly every pro-democracy movement globally took advantage of the off-grid messaging app.</p>
<p>What made FireChat an effective tool for revolution was its ability to bypass the centralized and often monopolized Internet Service Providers. Launched in 2011 by Open Garden, FireChat allowed people to communicate without an Internet connection. The mobile app cleverly leveraged Bluetooth and WiFi signals already emitting from our phones to create peer-to-peer connections known as a mesh network.</p>
<p>In 2014, after Hong Kong protesters demonstrated to the world how effective a tool it was, news blogs quickly pointed out that FireChat messages were not secure. By 2015, Open Garden updated the app to include end-to-end encryption, a feature that many modern messaging apps still lack today.</p>
<p>In 2015, Wired <a href="https://archive.ph/sUPif">called FireChat</a> a "Giant Network of Free Messaging.” Indeed, but it was so much more. The mesh network enabled by FireChat was a new internet by the people, literally. The larger the crowd, the better the technology worked, as messages would "bounce” from phone to phone until they reached their recipient.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/firechat-updates-as-40000-iraqis-download-mesh-chat-app-to-get-online-in-censored-baghdad">Firechat updates as 40,000 Iraqis download 'mesh' chat app in censored Baghdad</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your phone today, your smartphone, not only has a radio to connect to a cell tower, but it also has other radios, like WiFi or Bluetooth, to connect to other devices around," explains OpenGarden co-founder Micha Benoliel. "And when smartphones are next to each other with Firechat, they directly interconnect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The technology worked so well that Open Garden then released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/19/11711686/firechat-alerts-app-natural-disaster-mesh-network">FireChat Alerts</a>, allowing rescue workers to send offline messages during emergencies.</p>
<p>Mind you, all of this was happening off-grid, without mega corporations mining our data or governments spying through corporate-sanctioned back doors.</p>
<p>Then, one day in February 2020, as COVID-19 swept the globe, access to FireChat was completely cut off without explanation. Four months later, a police officer murdered a Black man in Minnesota, resulting in protests across the United States.</p>
<p>Those protests sparked a roaring fire of consciousness over ￼this country's injustices. But no one on the ground fighting for our rights has been able to use the people's internet that never was.</p>
<p>Today, if you go to the official FireChat website, you're greeted hostilely with a message that your IP address has been blocked for suspicious activity. The Internet Archive view of the site shows the same message, so don't feel too bad. The Open Garden website shows a similar, though admittedly less hostile-feeling 403 Forbidden error.</p>
<p>No acquisition announcement for FireChat can be found. No teary-eyed "it's been an incredible journey” open letter by its founders was ever published. FireChat, and then later its parent company Open Garden, closed for business without any acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Without any information, it's hard to say why FireChat disappeared. If pressed about it, someone somewhere has a carefully constructed story with a plausible explanation, I'm sure. However, by all accounts, FireChat's mesh network technology was greater than the sum of its users. It was freedom from a ruthlessly for-profit internet that has increasingly become more centralized and monopolistic. And the fact that no one seems to have anything to say about this once darling of Silicon Valley tells us all we need to know.</p>
<p>FireChat is gone because FireChat was a threat to the systems it circumvented.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission today said it fined T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon $196 million "for illegally sharing access to customers' location information without consent and without taking reasonable measures to protect that information against unauthorized disclosure."</p>
<p>The fines relate to sharing of real-time location data that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/verizon-and-att-will-stop-selling-your-phones-location-to-data-brokers/">revealed in 2018</a>. The FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/fcc-issues-wrist-slap-fines-to-carriers-that-sold-your-phone-location-data/">proposed the fines</a> in 2020, when the commission had a Republican majority, and finalized them today.</p>
<p>All three major carriers vowed to appeal the fines after they were announced today. The three carriers also said they discontinued the data-sharing programs that the fines relate to.</p>
<p>The fines are $80.1 million for T-Mobile, $57.3 million for AT&amp;T, and $46.9 million for Verizon. T-Mobile is also on the hook for a $12.2 million fine issued to Sprint, which was bought by T-Mobile shortly after the penalties were proposed over four years ago.</p>
<p>Today, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-fines-largest-wireless-carriers-sharing-location-data">summarized its findings</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FCC Enforcement Bureau investigations of the four carriers found that each carrier sold access to its customers' location information to "aggregators," who then resold access to such information to third-party location-based service providers. In doing so, each carrier attempted to offload its obligations to obtain customer consent onto downstream recipients of location information, which in many instances meant that no valid customer consent was obtained. This initial failure was compounded when, after becoming aware that their safeguards were ineffective, the carriers continued to sell access to location information without taking reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p></blockquote>
<h2>“Shady actors” got hold of data</h2>
<p>The problem first came to light with reports of customer location data "being disclosed by the largest American wireless carriers without customer consent or other legal authorization to a Missouri Sheriff through a 'location-finding service' operated by Securus, a provider of communications services to correctional facilities, to track the location of numerous individuals," the FCC said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-41A2.pdf">said</a> that news reports in 2018 "revealed that the largest wireless carriers in the country were selling our real-time location information to data aggregators, allowing this highly sensitive data to wind up in the hands of bail-bond companies, bounty hunters, and other shady actors. This ugly practice violates the law—specifically Section 222 of the Communications Act, which protects the privacy of consumer data."</p>
<p>For a time after the 2018 reports, "all four carriers continued to operate their programs without putting in place reasonable safeguards to ensure that the dozens of location-based service providers with access to their customers' location information were actually obtaining customer consent," the FCC said.</p>
<p>The three carriers are ready to challenge the fines in court. "This industry-wide third-party aggregator location-based services program was discontinued more than five years ago after we took steps to ensure that critical services like roadside assistance, fraud protection and emergency response would not be disrupted," T-Mobile said in a statement provided to Ars. "We take our responsibility to keep customer data secure very seriously and have always supported the FCC's commitment to protecting consumers, but this decision is wrong, and the fine is excessive. We intend to challenge it."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="559d">A few weeks ago, I began working on the PoC of a document indexing system for my client. I created a single S3 bucket in the <em>eu-west-1</em> region and uploaded some files there for testing. Two days later, I checked my AWS billing page, primarily to make sure that what I was doing was well within the free-tier limits. Apparently, it wasn’t. My bill was over <em>1300$</em>, with the billing console showing nearly <em>100,000,000 S3 PUT requests</em> executed within just one day!</p><figure><figcaption>My billed S3 usage per day, per region</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2e9e">Where were these requests coming from?</h2><p id="b20a">By default, AWS doesn’t log requests executed against your S3 buckets. However, such logs can be enabled using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-logging.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AWS CloudTrail</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">S3 Server Access Logging</a>. After enabling CloudTrail logs, I immediately observed thousands of write requests originating from multiple accounts.</p><h2 id="f863">But why would some third party accounts bombard my S3 bucket with unauthorised requests?</h2><p id="6c13">Was it some kind of DDoS-like attack against my account? Against AWS? As it turns out, <strong>one of the popular open-source tools had a default configuration to store their backups in S3. And, as a placeholder for a bucket name, they used… the same name that I used for my bucket</strong>. This meant that every deployment of this tool with default configuration values attempted to store its backups in my S3 bucket!</p><blockquote><p id="3e1a">Note: Unfortunately, I can’t disclose the name of the tool I’m referring to, as doing so would put the impacted companies at risk (as explained further).</p></blockquote><p id="22c7">So, a horde of unauthorized third parties is attempting to store their data in my private S3 bucket. But why should I be the one paying for this mistake? Here’s why:</p><h2 id="2a1a">S3 charges you for unauthorized incoming requests</h2><p id="e936">This was confirmed in my exchange with AWS support. As they wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="4e27">Yes, S3 charges for unauthorized requests (4xx) as well[1]. That’s expected behavior.</p></blockquote><p id="1a90">So, if I were to open my terminal now and type:</p><pre><span id="8e15">aws s3 cp ./file.txt s3://your-bucket-name/random_key</span></pre><p id="c977">I would receive an <em>AccessDenied</em> error, but you would be the one to pay for that request.</p><p id="47dc">Another question was bugging me: why was over half of my bill coming from the <em>us-east-1</em> region? I didn’t have a single bucket there! The answer to that is that the S3 requests without a specified region default to <em>us-east-1 </em>and are redirected as needed. And you pay extra for that redirected request.</p><h2 id="aec7">The security aspect</h2><p id="111c">We now understand why my S3 bucket was bombarded with millions of requests and why I ended up with a huge S3 bill. At that point, I had one more idea I wanted to explore. If all those misconfigured systems were attempting to back up their data into my S3 bucket, what if I opened it for public writes? I made my bucket public for less than 30 seconds, and within that timeframe, collected over 10GB of data. Of course, I can’t disclose whose data it was. But it left me amazed at how an innocent configuration oversight could lead to a dangerous data leak!</p><h2 id="9b8c">What did I learn from all this?</h2><h2 id="c083">Lesson 1: Anyone who knows the name of any of your S3 buckets can ramp up your AWS bill as they like.</h2><p id="de0d">Other than deleting the bucket, there’s nothing you can do to prevent it. You can’t protect your bucket with services like CloudFront or WAF when it’s being accessed directly through the S3 API. Standard S3 PUT requests are priced at just <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">$0.005 per 1,000 requests</a>, but a single machine can easily execute thousands of such requests per second.</p><h2 id="3484">Lesson 2: Adding a random suffix to your bucket names can enhance security.</h2><p id="86a0">This practice reduces vulnerability to misconfigured systems or intentional attacks. At least avoid using short and common names for your S3 buckets.</p><h2 id="2a08">Lesson 3: When executing a lot of requests to S3, make sure to explicitly specify the AWS region.</h2><p id="e077">This way you will avoid additional costs of S3 API redirects.</p><h2 id="7c33">Aftermath:</h2><ol><li id="3214">I reported my findings to the maintainers of the vulnerable open-source tool. They promptly fixed the default configuration, although they can’t fix the existing deployments.</li><li id="ecbe">Additionally, I notified the AWS security team. I hoped they might restrict the unfortunate S3 bucket name, but they were unwilling to address misconfigurations of third-party products.</li><li id="b42a">I reported the issue to two companies whose data I found in my bucket. They did not respond to my emails, possibly considering them as spam.</li><li id="87dd">AWS was kind enough to cancel my S3 bill. However, they emphasized that this was done as an exception.</li></ol><p id="90a4">Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I hope it will help you steer clear of unexpected AWS charges!</p></div></div>]]></description>

These interfaces operate like slot machines at a casino, providing a dopamine boost every few seconds.

Well, yes, of course, but…I will simply ask you to judge the plausibility of that defense based on your own common sense observations and life experiences. </span></p><p>Their defense would be more plausible if youngsters were spending only a small portion of their day online. So let’s look at more data on how they allocate their time. </p><p>Here’s a comparison of time spent online by age. Even before they reach their teens, youngsters are spending more than four hours per day staring into a screen.</p><p>Here’s what a day in the digital life of a typical 9-year-old girl looks like.</p><p>I don’t find any of this amusing. But if you’re looking for dark humor, I’ll point to the four minutes spent on the Duolingo language training app at the end of the day. This provides an indicator of the relative role of learning in the digital regimen on the rising generation.</p><p>Now let’s look at even younger children. Here’s a glimpse at the digital life of a child aged 5 through 7. </p><p>The role of digital media increases dramatically between ages 8 and 12.</p><p>By the way, more than 20% of underage users have an adult profile which allows them to access all content on these platforms. </p><p>What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/i-ask-seven-heretical-questions-about" rel="">I Ask Seven Heretical Questions About Progress</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/where-did-tiktok-come-from" rel="">Where Did TikTok Come From?</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2024" rel="">The State of the Culture, 2024</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/i-receive-a-letter-from-a-high-school" rel="">I Receive a Letter from a High School Student</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/notes-toward-a-new-romanticism" rel="">Notes Toward a New Romanticism</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/13-observations-on-ritual" rel="">Thirteen Observations on Ritual</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-to-break-free-from-dopamine-culture" rel="">How to Break Free from Dopamine Culture</a></strong></p><p><span>Skeptics can pretend this is </span><em>all quite normal</em><span>. But, judging by the feedback I’m getting, the vast majority of adults have already lost trust in the technocracy. They are deeply troubled by what the dominant platforms are doing to society, especially vulnerable children. </span></p><p>They know that a terrible crisis is underway, and blame tech leaders and their apologists—who are destroying the next generation in pursuit of profits.</p><p><span>We’ve seen it before. There was a time when tobacco companies denied that smoking caused cancer. (Their argument—that </span><a href="https://builtin.com/articles/correlation-causation" rel="">correlation does not prove causation</a><span>—will sound familiar.)</span></p><p><span>That was too bad for all the people who died because of that smokescreen argument (literally and figuratively). There was also a time when corporations—</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:16-p-1402-2_Fire_Ants_on_Trial.webm" rel="">and the US government!</a><span>—issued propaganda to support the use of DDT and other dangerous pesticides. We’ve seen the same narrative spinning in so many other business: </span><a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-131/haskins-v-3m-co/" rel="">asbestos</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed:_The_Designed-In_Dangers_of_the_American_Automobile" rel="">automobiles</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o2688" rel="">opioids</a><span>, etc. </span></p><p>But you should always follow the money. </p><p><span>Academics who defended smoking took </span><em>big cash</em><span> from Big Tobacco. You should check out </span><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/09/02/cigarettes/" rel="">how much tobacco money went to distinguished statisticians back then</a><span>—who would ever have guessed that these STEM academics could be corrupted by cash? </span></p><p>I believe we are at a similar juncture right now. </p><p>We will eventually have access to peer-reviewed, longitudinal studies with tightly defined control groups. Along the way, statisticians getting funded by tech, and their fellow travelers, will try to obfuscate as much as they can. But wise parents—who live in the real world, not academia—are already taking prudent steps. </p><p>That’s what parenting is all about. </p><p><span>It would be nice if the government and tech billionaires (now </span><a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/04/26/who-will-buy-tiktok-will-bytedance-sell/" rel="">lining up to buy TikTok</a><span>) helped them out. But since so much money is at stake, parents will probably have to fight this battle on their own. </span></p><p>The rest of us should support them as best we can. A good starting point is to speak honestly and forthrightly about what tech is actually doing in our communities. I’ll certainly be writing more about this in the future. </p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            A lost lawsuit, a flimsy appeal, and misleading public statements... things aren't looking good for the Internet's archivist.        </p><div>
        <p>On April 19th, The Internet Archive filed the final brief in their appeal of the "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>" lawsuit (for which, judgment was <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handed down, against Internet Archive</a>, last year).</p><p>What is curious, is that this final brief fails -- <em>almost completely</em> -- to reasonably address the core issues of the lawsuit.&nbsp; What's more, the public statements that followed, by The Internet Archive, appeared to be crafted to drum up public sympathy by misrepresenting the core of the case itself.</p><p>Which suggests that The Internet Archive is very much aware that they are likely to lose this appeal.</p><p>After a careful reading of the existing public documents relating to this case... it truly is difficult to come to any other conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Internet Archive</a> does some critically important work by archiving, and indexing, a wide variety of culturally significant material (from webpages to decades old magazine articles).&nbsp; In this work, they help to preserve history.&nbsp; A extremely noble, and valuable, endeavor.&nbsp; Which makes the likelihood of this legal defeat all the more unfortunate.</p><h3>What is "Hachette v. Internet Archive"?&nbsp;</h3><p>Here's the short-<em>short</em> version of this lawsuit:</p><p>The Internet Archive created a program they called "Controlled Digital Lending" (CDL) -- where a physical book is scanned, turned into a digital file, and that digital file is then "loaned" out to people on the Internet.&nbsp; In 2020, The Internet Archive removed what few restrictions existed with this Digital Lending program, allowing an <em>unlimited</em> number of people to download the digital copy of a book.</p><p>The result was a group of publishers filing the "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>" lawsuit.&nbsp; That lawsuit focused on two key complaints:</p><ol><li>The books were "digitized" (converted from physical to digital form) -- <em>and distributed</em> -- without the permission of the copyright holders (publishers, authors, etc.).</li><li>The Internet Archive received monetary donations (and other monetary rewards) as a result of freely distributing said copyrighted material.&nbsp; Again, without permission of the copyright holders.&nbsp; Effectively making the Internet Archive's CDL a commercial enterprise for the distribution of what is best described as "pirated material".</li></ol><p>That lawsuit was decided, against The Internet Archive, in 2023 -- with the judge declaring that "no case or legal principle supports" their defense of "Fair Use".</p><p>That judgment was appealed by The Internet Archive.&nbsp; Which brings us to today, and thier final defense (in theory).</p><h3>What is the final defense of The Internet Archive?</h3><p>Let's take a look at the final brief in The Internet Archive's bid to appeal this ruling.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-04-24/102127/102127_jhk5au92b4ux1ga_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="482" height="245"><figcaption>In true Internet Archive form, a PDF of the final brief in their appeal <a href="https://archive.org/details/2024-04-19-reply-brief-hachette-v-internet-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been posted to Archive.org</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The general defense of The Internet Archive is fairly simple: The Internet Archive's "Controlled Digital Lending" falls under "Fair Use".&nbsp; And, therefor, is legal.</p><p>Let's look at two of the key arguments within the brief... and the issues with them.</p><h3>Not "For Anyone to Read"</h3><blockquote><p>"Controlled digital lending is not equivalent to posting an ebook online for anyone to read"</p></blockquote><p>This argument -- part of the brief's Introduction -- is quite a strange defense to make.</p><p>The "Controlled Digital Lending" program, starting in <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March of 2020</a>, <em>literally</em> posted a massive book archive "online for anyone to read".&nbsp; This was branded the "National Emergency Library".</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-04-24/102127/102127_slrtcs267a4u3or_custom.jpeg" alt="">Good intentions aside, the Internet Archive is now attempting to claim that they did <em>not do</em>... the exact thing that <em>they proudly did</em> (they even <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/24/announcing-a-national-emergency-library-to-provide-digitized-books-to-students-and-the-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued press releases about how they did it</a>).</p><p>As such, I don't see a judge being swayed by this (poorly thought out) argument.</p><h3>"Because of the Huge Investment"</h3><blockquote><p>"... because of the huge investment required to operate a legally compliant controlled lending system and the controls defining the practice, finding fair use here would not trigger any of the doomsday consequences for rightsholders that Publishers and their amici claim to fear."</p></blockquote><p>Did you follow that?</p><p>The argument here is roughly as follows:</p><p>"It costs a lot of money to make, and distribute, digital copies of books without the permission of the copyright holder...&nbsp; therefore it should be legal for The Internet Archive to do it."</p><p>An absolutely <em>fascinating</em> defense.&nbsp; "Someone else might not be able to commit this crime, so we should be allowed to do it" is one of the <em>weirdest</em> defences I have ever heard.</p><p>Again, I doubt the judge in this case is likely to be convinced by this logic.</p><p>There are <em>many</em> other arguments made within this final brief -- in total, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2024-04-19-reply-brief-hachette-v-internet-archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">32 pages worth of arguments</a>.&nbsp; But none were any more convincing -- from a logical perspective -- than the two presented here.&nbsp; In fact, most of the arguments tended to be entirely <em>unrelated</em> to the core lawsuit and judgment.</p><h3>The Court of Public Opinion</h3><p>Let's be honest: The Internet Archive looks destined to lose this court battle.&nbsp; They lost once, and their appeal is, to put it mildly, weak.</p><p>Maybe you and I are on the side of The Internet Archive.&nbsp; Maybe we are such big fans of Archive.org that we <em>want</em> to come to their defense.</p><p>But feelings don't matter here.&nbsp; Only facts.&nbsp; And the facts are simple.&nbsp; The Archive's actions and statements (and questionable legal defense) have all but ensured a loss in this case.</p><p>So... what happens next?</p><p>What do you do when you have a profitable enterprise (bringing in <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between $20 and $30 million per year</a>) that is on the verge of a potentially devastating legal ruling which could put you out of business?</p><p>Why, you turn to the court of public opinion, of course!</p><p>And you spin.&nbsp; Spin, spin, spin.&nbsp; Spin like the wind!</p><p><a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/04/19/internet-archive-stands-firm-on-library-digital-rights-in-final-brief-of-hachette-v-internet-archive-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a statement from Brewster Kahle</a>, founder of The Internet Archive", who is working to frame this as a fight for the rights of Libraries:</p><blockquote><p>"Resolving this should be easy—just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own, preserve and lend them to one person at a time. This is a battle for the soul of libraries in the digital age."</p></blockquote><p>A battle for the soul of libraries!&nbsp; <em>Woah!</em>&nbsp; The <strong><em>soul</em></strong>?!</p><p>That's an intense statement -- clearly crafted to elicit an emotional response.&nbsp; To whip people up.</p><p>But take another look at the rest of that statement.&nbsp; The Internet Archive founder says that resolving this case "should be easy".&nbsp; And he provides a simple, easy-to-follow solution:</p><blockquote><p>"just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own, preserve and lend them to one person at a time"</p></blockquote><p>Go ahead.&nbsp; Read that again.&nbsp; At first it makes total sense... until you realize that it has almost <em>nothing</em> to do with this specific case.</p><p>Let's ignore the "one person at a time" statement, which is a well established lie (the Internet Archive proudly distributed digital copies of physical books to anyone who wanted them, not "one at a time").</p><p>But take a look at this proposed resolution... note that it has <em>very</em> little to do with the actual case.&nbsp; The case is about the digitizing of physical books, and distributing those digital copies without permission of the copyright holder.&nbsp; This proposed resolution is about... <em>selling</em> eBooks to lenders.</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; Both have to do with eBooks.&nbsp; And, <em>yes</em>, both have to do with <em>lending</em> eBooks.</p><p>But that is where the similarities end.&nbsp; And the differences, in this case, are absolutely critical.</p><p>Let's take a look at the <em>actual</em> ruling -- which The Internet Archive is attempting to appeal:</p><blockquote><p>"At bottom, [the Internet Archive’s] fair use defense rests on the notion that lawfully <strong>acquiring a copyrighted print book entitles the recipient to make an unauthorized copy and distribute it in place of the print book</strong>, so long as it does not simultaneously lend the print book.&nbsp; But no case or legal principle supports that notion. Every authority points the other direction."</p></blockquote><p>The Internet Archive's publicly proposed resolution does not address this ruling <em>at all</em>.&nbsp; Which means that, when talking to the public, The Internet Archive is being dishonest about this case.</p><p>But they are using flowery language -- "<em>battle for the soul of libraries</em>" -- so they'll likely manage to convince many people that they're telling the truth and representing the facts of the case fairly and honestly.&nbsp; Even if they are not.</p><h3>There Are Important Disagreements Here</h3><p>None of which is to say that the points which The Internet Archive is making... are necessarily wrong.</p><p>From <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/04/19/internet-archive-stands-firm-on-library-digital-rights-in-final-brief-of-hachette-v-internet-archive-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement of their appeal</a>, the Archive states the following:</p><blockquote><p>"By restricting libraries’ ability to lend the books they own digitally, the publishers’ license-only business model and litigation strategies perpetuate inequality in access to knowledge."</p></blockquote><p>While this statement is designed to evoke specific feelings and responses -- among specific political demographics (see: "perpetuate inequality") -- there is an underlying set of issues here that are worth thinking about.</p><ul><li>Is it important that libraries be able to lend <em>official</em> digital editions of books?</li><li>Should publishers, authors, and other copyright holders be forced to supply digital versions of their written works to libraries?</li><li>If digital works, borrowed from a library, are then copied and distributed more than the rights allow... who is ultimately responsible for that?&nbsp; The library?&nbsp; The creator of the software system which facilitated the lending?&nbsp; Nobody at all?</li><li>Should Libraries or Publishers be able to censor or modify digital works... or should a published digital work be maintained as it is at time of publication?&nbsp; (This issue comes up a lot when talking about censorship and revisions of works.)</li></ul><p>These are legitimate questions.&nbsp; And, while the answers may appear obvious, there truly are distinct disagreements among publishers, authors, and libraries.</p><p>Some of these issues are raised by The Internet Archive, <a href="https://www.battleforlibraries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BattleForLibraries.com</a>, and others.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-04-24/102127/102127_bakgi2yt42vpxmo_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="453" height="251"><figcaption>The "<a href="https://www.battleforlibraries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle for Libraries</a>" campaign</figcaption></figure><p>But none of these questions -- <em>not one</em> -- are part of the ruling in "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>".</p><p>The question that has been answered in this case is simply:</p><ul><li>If you buy physical media (such as a book), can that media be digitized and distributed on the Internet (without authorization or notification of the copyright owner)?</li></ul><p>And the answer is, thus far, a resounding... "<em><strong>No</strong></em>".</p><h3>The Can of Worms</h3><p>What happens if the judge chooses to uphold the existing judgment against The Internet Archive?</p><p>A number of things seems possible (with some seeming like a downright certainty).</p><ul><li>Publishers, authors, and copyright holders of works distributed by The Internet Archive may choose to seek damages.&nbsp; Which could put The Internet Archive in a precarious financial position (to say the least).</li><li>The Internet Archive may be forced to remove other content of questionable copyright.&nbsp; Including software, video, and audio archives.</li><li>Other archival projects may now come under increased scrutiny... thus making it riskier to archive and distribute various types of material.</li><li>And, of course, The Internet Archive could attempt to appeal the case ever higher.&nbsp; Which may be tricky.</li></ul><p>Then again... The Internet Archive could win this appeal.</p><p>Unlikely.&nbsp; But, hey, weirder things have happened.</p><div>

<div><p>We’re redefining the developer environment with GitHub Copilot Workspace–where any developer can go from idea, to code, to software in natural language. <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace">Sign up here</a>. </p></div>
<p>In the past two years, generative AI has foundationally changed the developer landscape largely as a tool embedded inside the developer environment. In 2022, we launched GitHub Copilot as an autocomplete pair programmer in the editor, <a href="https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/">boosting developer productivity by up to 55%</a>. Copilot is now the most widely adopted AI developer tool. In 2023, we released GitHub Copilot Chat—unlocking the power of natural language in coding, debugging, and testing—allowing developers to converse with their code in real time.</p>
<p>After sharing <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/">an early glimpse</a> at GitHub Universe last year, today, we are reimagining the nature of the developer experience itself with the technical preview of GitHub Copilot Workspace: the Copilot-native developer environment. Within Copilot Workspace, developers can now brainstorm, plan, build, test, and run code in natural language. This new task-centric experience leverages different Copilot-powered agents from start to finish, while giving developers full control over every step of the process.</p>
<p>
			<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkotufZchjE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</p>
<p>Copilot Workspace represents a radically new way of building software with natural language, and is expressly <a href="https://github.blog/2024-01-17-a-developers-second-brain-reducing-complexity-through-partnership-with-ai/">designed</a> to deliver–not replace–developer creativity, faster and easier than ever before. With Copilot Workspace we will empower more experienced developers to operate as systems thinkers, and materially lower the barrier of entry for who can build software.</p>
<p>Welcome to the first day of a new developer environment. Here’s how it works:</p>
<h3 id="it-all-starts-with-the-task">It all starts with the task…<a href="#it-all-starts-with-the-task" aria-label="It all starts with the task…"></a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C593" alt="It starts with a task. Open GitHub Copilot Workspace from a GitHub Issue, Pull Request, or Repository. (Screenshot of an issue in the octoacademy repository.)" width="1024" height="593" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1600 1600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1024&amp;resize=1024%2C593 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>For developers, the greatest barrier to entry is almost always at the <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/">beginning</a>. Think of how often you hit a wall in the first steps of a big project, feature request, or even bug report, simply because you don’t know how to get started. GitHub Copilot Workspace meets developers right at the origin: a GitHub Repository or a GitHub Issue. By leveraging Copilot agents as a second brain, developers will have AI assistance from the very beginning of an idea.</p>
<h3 id="workspace-builds-the-full-plan">…Workspace builds the full plan<a href="#workspace-builds-the-full-plan" aria-label="…Workspace builds the full plan"></a></h3>

<p>From there, Copilot Workspace offers a step-by-step plan to solve the issue based on its deep understanding of the codebase, issue replies, and more. It gives you everything you need to validate the plan, and test the code, in one streamlined list in natural language.</p>

<p>Everything that GitHub Copilot Workspace proposes—from the plan to the code—is fully editable, allowing you to iterate until you’re confident in the path ahead. You retain all of the autonomy, while Copilot Workspace lifts your cognitive strain.</p>

<p>And once you’re satisfied with the plan, you can run your code directly in Copilot Workspace, jump into the underlying GitHub Codespace, and tweak all code changes until you are happy with the final result. You can also instantly share a workspace with your team via a link, so they can view your work and even try out their own iterations.</p>
<p>All that’s left then is to file your pull request, run your GitHub Actions, security code scanning, and ask your team members for human code review. And best of all, they can leverage your Copilot Workspace to see how you got from idea to code.</p>

<p>And because ideas can happen anywhere, GitHub Copilot Workspace was designed to be used from any device—empowering a real-world development environment that can work on a desktop, laptop, or on the go.</p>

<p>This is our mark on the future of the development environment: an intuitive, Copilot-powered infrastructure that makes it easier to get started, to learn, and ultimately to execute.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-a-world-with-1b-developers">Enabling a world with 1B developers<a href="#enabling-a-world-with-1b-developers" aria-label="Enabling a world with 1B developers"></a></h2>
<p>Early last year, GitHub celebrated over <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">100 million developers</a> on our platform—and counting. As programming in natural language lowers the barrier of entry to who can build software, we are accelerating to a near future where <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-next-billion-developers-perspective/">one billion people</a> on GitHub will control a machine just as easily as they ride a bicycle. We’ve constructed GitHub Copilot Workspace in pursuit of this horizon, as a conduit to help extend the economic opportunity and joy of building software to every human on the planet.</p>
<p>At the same time, we live in a world dependent on—and in short supply of—professional developers. Around the world, developers add millions of lines of code every single day to evermore complex systems and are increasingly behind on maintaining the old ones. Just like any infrastructure in this world, we need real experts to maintain and renew the world’s code. By quantifiably reducing boilerplate work, we will empower professional developers to increasingly operate as systems thinkers. We believe the step change in productivity gains that professional developers will experience by virtue of Copilot and now Copilot Workspace will only continue to <a href="https://github.blog/2023-06-27-the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/">increase labor demand</a>.</p>
<p>That’s the dual potential of GitHub Copilot: for the professional and hobbyist developer alike, channeling creativity into code just got a whole lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>Today, we begin the technical preview for GitHub Copilot Workspace.</strong><br> <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace">Sign up now</a>. <br> We can’t wait to see what you will build from here.</p>

He’s a big fan of power. That is power for certain people—i.e., people like him. Rich people, in other words.

But, no, he seems perfectly fine with it. The story focuses on the “Gundo Bros,” a gaggle of patriotic software developers attached to defense startups that are endorsed by a16z. Said “bros” sound like they mostly take their cues from 1980s action movies:  </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>They pump iron while they code, host weekly bonfires on the beach, and shotgun energy drinks.

On <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a16z.com/american-dynamism/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its website</a></span>, a storied timeline lays claim to a host of impressive historical events—the Wright brothers’ first flight, the invention of the transistor, the Manhattan Project, the moon landing—and frames them all as part of the American Dynamism “movement,” as if A16z had something to do with any of that stuff. “American Dynamism embodies the spirit of innovation, progress, and resilience that drives the United States forward. This powerful force is exemplified by groundbreaking achievements in technology and innovation, shaping both our nation and the global landscape,” the site says. A site visitor reading through this garbage might be distracted enough to forget that the fund is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-50/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promoting a host of private defense, surveillance, and weapons contractors</a></span> who will hoard breakthroughs for themselves. </p><p> Viewed in its totality, Andreessen’s interests have a certain, chaotic uniformity. The attitude seems to be: throw anything at the wall, so long as it accelerates your money and power—deregulation, technological disruption, berzerk AI, missiles and bombs—it’s all good stuff! Some tenets of Andreessen’s belief system were laid bare last year in his “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techno-Optimist’s Manifesto,</a></span>” which he published on his venture capital firm’s blog. Said “manifesto” is basically a spastic apology for corporate greed and wealth accumulation by a technocratic elite. It reads like some weird mixture of Gordon Gekko and Steve Jobs’ keynote speeches with a little bit of Patrick Bateman rhetoric thrown in.</p><p>Given his cartoonishly rich-douche outlook on life, it makes sense that Andreessen wouldn’t think fondly of the segments of society that don’t conform to his ubermensch-style aspirations.

During this event, amidst bouts of annoying pseudo-intellectual ramblings by the dinner participants that were present, Andreessen is alleged to have said something truly dick-ish about rural Americans. Here’s that exchange as Perlstein relates it:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I brought up the ordinary comforts of kinship, friendship, craft, memory, legend, lore, skills passed down across generations, and other benefits that small towns provide: <em>things that make human beings human beings</em>.

You’d be forgiven if you aren’t as excited about it as he is. </p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://codedbearder.com/posts/f3-backplane/">https://codedbearder.com/posts/f3-backplane/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40199967">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main"><p>In a <a href="https://codedbearder.com/posts/nixos-terramaster-f2-221">previous post</a> I wrote about how I setup NixOS on my Terramaster F2-221 instead of using the included TOS provided by Terramaster. This in itself was quite simple as the NAS contains Intel J3355, a standard X86_64 CPU. However the NAS only has 2 SATA connectors, both of which were being used for the 4TB hard drives, so I had to resort to plugging in an external USB SSD for storing the operating system. This quickly became a little annoying to make room for this external SSD behind the NAS and make sure it’s always plugged in when something is moved around in the shelf where I keep it, so I wanted to see if I could come up with a better solution.</p><p>Essentially what I wanted was this:</p><p><img src="https://codedbearder.com/images/posts/f3-backplane/before-after-f2-221.jpg" alt="Drake Hotline Bling meme with before and after picture of NAS"></p><h2 id="researching-my-options">Researching my options</h2><p>First I need to get out of the way the fact that there is an internal USB connector on the motherboard that contains a USB stick that ships with the NAS, that is used for downloading and bootstrapping TOS <em>onto the storage drives</em>. This USB header is only USB 2.0 though so it’s not an option for this purpose.</p><p>Back when I first got the NAS I did add an extra RAM stick in the single RAM slot on the motherboard and I remembered seeing a PCIe (PCI Express) x4 connector on the motherboard that the backplane PCB connects into. As I recently got interested in designing PCBs I thought it might be interesting to see if I could come up with something, but when inspecting the existing backplane I noticed that there was no IC (integrated circuit) on there converting PCIe to SATA, instead it only contained some power circuitry and the SATA connectors were wired directly to the PCIe edge connector. This was a non-standard pinout and not PCIe at all, no room for expansion! But hey! This generation of NASes from Terramaster also include 4 and 5-bay units, how do they do that? Looking at the specs for Intel J3355 I could see that the CPU has 2 SATA ports and 6 lanes of PCIe gen 2 which would mean that the other models must be utilizing those PCIe lanes somehow to expand the number of SATA ports.</p><p>What followed was days of me scouring image search on duckduckgo and google to try to find high resolution pictures of the backplane PCB from either the 4 or 5-bay model.</p><h2 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse engineering</h2><p>I found some great pictures from this <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/review/terramaster-f5-422-5-bay-nas/4.html">review of Terramaster F5-422</a> and from those pictures I could identify that they’re using 2 ASMedia ASM1061 ICs to get the SATA port count from 2 to 5. After some research I found out that ASM1061 is a 1-lane PCIe gen 2 SATA controller with 2 SATA ports, the first one is wired to port 3 and 4 on the backplane and the second one is wired to port 5 only. This was potentially good news for me as this means that the PCIe connector on the motherboard should include 2 PCIe x1 interfaces and looking at the back of the motherboard on my Terramaster F2-221 I could see that the pins that seemed to carry the PCIe traces on the F5-422 backplane were indeed wired up and it makes sense that they didn’t want to have to manufacture different motherboards for the different models.</p><p><img src="https://codedbearder.com/images/posts/f3-backplane/f3-connector-backside.jpg" alt="Picture of the PCIe pinout."></p><p>Quite a few differential pairs can be seen in this picture.</p><h3 id="pci-express">PCI Express</h3><p>Some of the pictures were still a bit low resolution and I had to zoom in a lot and follow blurry traces but I could verify that the traces for the first 2 SATA ports matched the pins on my backplane PCB. Thankfully I could find a datasheet for ASM1061, and therefor had a pinout for the IC, so I knew which pins were the PCIe lines but all the differential pairs near the ICs and the PCIe connector went to vias and were then routed on internal layers which made it impossible for me to know for sure which differential pair was <code>TX</code>, <code>RX</code> and <code>REFCLK</code>. I could however identify that one pin on the PCIe connector was connected to <code>PERST#</code> on the ASM1061 ICs, that’s something!</p><p>During this time I did some very extensive research into PCI Express routing and how it works and got a lot of small tidbits from here and there online and there was especially one little information that helped me with identifying the different differential pairs. That is that traditionally the <code>TX</code> differential pair should have coupling capacitors, meaning that that the differential pair that connects to the <code>TX</code> pins on the ASM1061 should have coupling capacitors on the backplane, but that is the <code>RX</code> differential pair from the perspective of the CPU (and therefor the motherboard) and the differential pair connecting to the <code>RX</code> pins on the ASM1061 IC should then have coupling capacitors on the motherboard side of the PCIe connector. Then looking at the pictures of the backplane PCB for F5-422 and the back of my motherboard I can identify the pins that have these coupling capacitors on the traces. After that only the <code>REFCLK</code> remained and through guessing I was fairly confident that the closest differential pair to the <code>TX</code> and <code>RX</code> of each PCIe x1 interface was the <code>REFCLK</code> for that interface.</p><p>And that left me with this pinout:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>B</th><th>A</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>12V</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>12V</td><td>12V</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>12V</td><td>12V</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>GND</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>SATA1 A+</td><td>SATA1 B+</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>SATA1 A-</td><td>SATA1 B-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>GND</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5V</td><td>5V</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5V</td><td>5V</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>?</td><td>5V</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>Notch</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>3.3V</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>GND</td><td>3.3V</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>SATA2 A+</td><td>3.3V</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>SATA2 A-</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>GND</td><td>SATA2 B+</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>PERST#</td><td>SATA2 B-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>GND</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>PCIe1 TX+</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>PCIe1 TX-</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>GND</td><td>PCIe1 RX+</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>GND</td><td>PCIe1 RX-</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>PCIe1 REFCLK+</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>PCIe1 REFCLK-</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>GND</td><td>PCIe2 RX+ <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>GND</td><td>PCIe2 RX- <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>PCIe2 TX+ <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>PCIe2 TX- <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>GND</td><td>PCIe2 REFCLK+ <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>?</td><td>PCIe2 REFCLK- <sup id="fnref5:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>?</td><td>GND</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>GND</td><td>?</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After having figured out this pinout I roughly verified the pinout of PCIe1 by bringing a picture of the F5-422 backplane into Kicad and routing the external traces to the vias that I can see and then attempt to route them on an internal layer, then assume I was incorrect in my pinout and attempt to route different combinations. My initial guess was the one that was easiest to route between the vias so I was fairly (-ish) confident in that I was correct.</p><blockquote><p>You may also have noticed that some of the pins are marked <code>?</code>. Most of these pins were not connected on my backplane and/or I could not figure out where they were routed to as those were also mostly routed on internal layers.</p></blockquote><h3 id="power-circuits">Power circuits</h3><p>As stated earlier, there are no ICs on the F2-221’s backplane that handle any PCIe signals, but one side of the PCB is full of components. After taking close-up pictures of the PCB so that I could identify the components and see where the traces go between them I recreated the schematic in Kicad. This circuit consisted of mostly mostfets, diodes, resistors and capacitors. Now, I am no electrical engineer but after staring at the schematic, trying to break it apart into chunks to make sense of it and doing a lot of research online I somehow figured that these were load switches with a slow starter, one for each power rail on each SATA port (meaning 4 load switches on F2-221 and 10 on the F5-422). One of the ground pins (P4) on the SATA connectors was also used as the enable pin for these load switches, as it’s pulled to ground by the hard drive when connected. I figured this was done in combination with the slow start circuit to make hot-plugging the hard drives safe by preventing sparking across the connector and the drive due to the high initial inrush current.</p><p>Not being too eager to solder all these discrete components on my backplane PCB, I decided to find a complete integrated load switch IC with a built-in slow starter and finally went with the <a href="https://www.onsemi.com/products/power-management/protected-power-switches/ncp45521">onsemi NCP45521-L</a>.</p><h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2><p>At this point I had spent <em>a lot of time</em> figuring out the pinout of the connector, and especially trying to figure out the purpose of the different unknown pins on the connector. And I figured it was time to just create a prototype PCB by routing what I <em>did</em> know and then breaking most of the other pins to test points that I can probe and try to figure out the purpose of.</p><h3 id="ssd-selection">SSD selection</h3><p>Since beginning this process I had mostly been concerned with what would be possible and not what kind of boot SSD I wanted. Initially I wondered if I could add a SATA port by incorporating the same ASM1061 IC and then taping a SATA SSD somewhere inside the case. Then I had the <del>brilliant</del> obvious idea of trying to fit an M.2 connector on there, and as luck would have it there was <em>just enough</em> room for the connector between the mounting rails that the backplane screws into, and by <em>just enough</em> I mean there’s less than a millimeter on each side!</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the CPU only has 2 SATA ports built-in and they are both being used for the 2 hard drives in the NAS. To get more SATA ports we’d need to get a controller that can convert <em>some</em> protocol into SATA, e.g. in external hard drive enclosures there is a controller that can communicate with the host over USB and the hard drive or SSD over SATA, and as I have 1 lane of PCIe I <em>could</em> use the same ASM1061 as Terramaster uses on the F5-422 to get 2 extra SATA ports and wire it up to an M or B-key M.2 slot for a SATA M.2 SSD. The biggest problem with this approach is that I can’t just buy an ASM1061 and would instead need to buy a whole PCIe card containing an ASM1061 and extract the IC using a hot air station.</p><p>NVMe on the other hand <em>is</em> PCIe and no extra controller is needed, just wire the PCIe lines directly to the M-key M.2 slot and insert an SSD. This makes the PCB routing much simpler and costs less as we don’t need to source any extra controller and there is more options for NVMe SSDs than SATA M.2 available. NVMe SSDs generally have 4 lanes of PCIe gen 3 or higher so in a way we’re <em>“wasting”</em> 3 lanes and capping the 1 lane we do have to gen 2 speeds which in the end will not be faster that SATA speeds, but even taking that into account it makes no sense to go with anything else as it’s cheaper and simpler for our use case. I ended up grabbing a Patriot P300 128GB for only €14.90 locally, that’s cheaper than I could find a PCIe card with an ASM1061 IC.</p><p>I did however have some concern with if the BIOS would support booting directly from an NVMe drive, but then decided I would be ok with having an internal USB 2.0 usb stick to store the boot partition in the worst case.</p><h3 id="designing-the-prototype-pcb">Designing the prototype PCB</h3><p>Even though I was creating my own PCB I was constrained with the mounting hardware that attaches the backplane to the case. Screw holes had to be positioned quite strictly in relation to the PCIe edge connector and the PCB had some restrictions for size and shouldn’t restrict airflow too much. For those reasons, this prototype was also important for verifying that everything fits nicely in the case.</p><p>I first measured all different parts of the PCB using a ruler and calipers and then took a picture of the PCB as straight on as I possibly could and then tried to remove any lens distortion before importing the picture into Kicad and start positioning the PCIe connector, screw holes and the outline from the measurements and checking alignment with the picture. Then I made the schematic for the different components and layed them out on the PCB as best I could, but I wasn’t <em>too</em> careful about placement as I knew this was only a temporary prototype and added testpoints for various pins. I discovered the 3.3V rail on the PCIe connector pretty late in this process and therefor there is a buck converter taking 5V and converting it to 3.3V for the NVMe SSD.</p><p>I sent my design to JLCPCB, ordered a 4-layer PCB and a couple of weeks later I had this!</p><p><img src="https://codedbearder.com/images/posts/f3-backplane/f3-backplane-prototype.jpg" alt="Picture of partially assembled prototype PCB on the mounting rails for the case."></p><p>It’s a bit of a weird shape because of the buck converter on the top right but look at how perfectly the SSD fits!</p><h3 id="testing-the-prototype-pcb">Testing the prototype PCB</h3><p>This was my first time soldering DFN packages and they’re <em><strong>tiny</strong></em>! Because I don’t have a microscope or anything to visually inspect my soldering and these components were mostly just handling power anyway I just checked for shorts between power and ground and tried to take close-ups using my phone to see if I could spot any shorts. The technique that ended up working well for me to solder on these DFN packages without a stencil is to put what can only be described as <em>way too much</em> solder paste on the pads and then pushing the IC in the pool of solder, when the solder melts from the heat of my hot air station the IC will float on top and then I push down on it with tweezers and all excess solder will squeeze out and bead up, hopefully landing somewhere on the solder mask, where I can pick it up later once it’s solid.</p><p>After a few attempts of successfully soldering all the ICs and the pins of the M.2 connector and actually plugging it into the motherboard, I booted it and there it was in the list of boot options, <code>Patriot P300 128GB</code>! It works! And I can boot from it directly!</p><p>My main concern before getting this prototype was that I still hadn’t identified where to get the <code>CLKREQ</code> line for PCIe1 and without it there wouldn’t be any reference clock (<code>REFCLK</code>) active. When wiring up M.2 NVMe SSDs, the <code>CLKREQ</code> line is usually pulled high using a resistor and then wired to the M.2 connector and the SSD will pull it low to request the reference clock when needed. This is done to save power and is part of PCIe Active State Power Management (ASPM). Luckily for me it seems that this line is permanently pulled low somewhere on the motherboard and may or may not be one of the pins broken out on the PCIe connector, but it doesn’t really matter as I don’t really need it! Yes, ASPM will not work but this is a boot drive for an always on server so who cares!</p><p>I also plugged in the hard drives and not as surprisingly they worked fine too!</p><p>So the prototype that I made as a last resort to be able to probe and debug actually just worked perfectly already and I don’t care too much what the unidentified pins do anymore. If anyone <em>does know</em> or has a F5-422 and a multi-meter to figure it out, please let me know, but eh! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><h2 id="moving-on-to-v10">Moving on to V1.0</h2><p>Even though the prototype worked perfectly fine, that being the end of the story with all the test points and having it sitting <em>slightly</em> crooked in the case (not to mention <em><strong>GREEN!</strong></em>), wasn’t quite as satisfying as making a <em>polished</em> and <em>final</em> revision. There isn’t much more to say about this one, I removed the buck converter and wired the M.2 connector directly to the 3.3V rail on the PCIe connector, adjusted positioning slightly to (hopefully) fix the slight crookedness of the prototype, removed the test points and slapped on a logo! I called it F3 Backplane because, you know, F2+1 :D</p><p>After ordering this new version from JLCPCB again and waiting another few weeks I received the final version of PCBs, soldered it up and tested it in the NAS and not so surprisingly this time it worked just as well as the prototype. I’ve done a full btrfs scrub of the hard drives to see if any errors arise, which they didn’t and I’ve been running the system from the NVMe SSD for a few weeks now without any hiccups.</p><p>So you don’t need to scroll up again here’s a picture of the final version!</p><p><img src="https://codedbearder.com/images/posts/f3-backplane/f3-backplane-hero.jpg" alt="Picture of the final version of the backplane PCB mounted in the NAS."></p><p><img src="https://codedbearder.com/images/posts/f3-backplane/f3-comparison-front.jpg" alt="Picture of the front of the new backplane PCB next to the original one."></p><p><img src="https://codedbearder.com/images/posts/f3-backplane/f3-comparison-back.jpg" alt="Picture of the back of the new backplane PCB next to the original one."></p><blockquote><p>The soldering of the SATA connectors is kind of rough because I had forgotten to add thermal reliefs to the internal ground plane, making soldering very difficult. This has been fixed in the GitHub repository.</p></blockquote><p>hdparm test results for the NVMe SSD:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>/dev/nvme0n1:
 Timing cached reads:   4554 MB in  2.00 seconds = 2279.68 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1222 MB in  3.00 seconds = 407.22 MB/sec
</code></pre><p>This isn’t very fast for an NVMe SSD but this is expected as it’s only using 1 lane of PCIe gen 2. This is however totally fine for my use case.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>All in all getting to this point was a lot of work and I learned a ton and I’m very happy with the results. I have made the Kicad project available on <a href="https://github.com/arnarg/f3_backplane">GitHub</a> and hopefully it is useful to someone else too.</p><p><strong>Discuss on

<p><a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">https://chat.lmsys.org</a> enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their output according to different benchmarks, without needing to log in. One of the models recently available is <code>gpt2-chatbot</code>, which demonstrates capability greatly beyond any GPT-2 model. It is available to for chatting with in "Direct Chat" and "Arena (Battle)" which is the (initially) blinded version. There is no information to be found on that particular model name <em>anywhere</em> on the site, or elsewhere. The ratings results generated by LMSYS' benchmarks are available via their API for all models - except for this one. The model name simply appears to be a cover for something else entirely.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is likely that this mystery model is in fact either GPT-4.5 or GPT-5.<br>
The quality of the output in general - in particular its formatting, structure, and overall comprehension - is absolutely superb. Multiple people, with great LLM and chatbot experience, have noted unexpectedly good quality of the output (in public and in private) - and I agree fully. To me, it feels like the step from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, but instead using GPT-4 as a starting point. </p>

<p>This particular model is a "stealth drop" by OpenAI to benchmark their latest GPT model, without making it apparent that it's on <a href="http://lmsys.org/" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">lmsys.org</a>, in order to a) not get too biased replies, b) get replies that are "ordinary benchmark" tests without people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, and b) decrease the likelihood getting "mass-downvoted" by other competing entities. OpenAI would provide the compute for this, and LMSYS would gain latest-generation datasets from people using their services.</p>

<li>It uses OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer; this has been verified by testing its vulnerability to the <a href="https://rentry.org/SpecialTokens">special tokens used by OpenAI</a>. </li>
<li>It does not appear affect to specific special tokens used by Claude/Llama/Gemini.</li>
<li>When emergency/legal-related contact information and model information is required, it consistently provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI. This information is much more comprehensive and accurate than what GPT-3.5 (of course) and GPT-4 provides.</li>
<li>It consistently claims to be "a ChatGPT", which is similar to how OpenAI has launched "GPTs" (plural) as custom assistants in their ChatGPT interface.</li>
<li>It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.</li>

<p>The full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been investigated. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is in fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could of course imply that a) the model is more costly in terms of compute, and b) that the ones providing the compute prefer people to use the Arena (Battle) mode for generating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they hit the daily user limit.</p>

To date, 82 people are collecting endorsements, including a comedian, a model, the world’s first double-arm transplant receiver, and my aunt Helga.</p><p id="b921">Many of these people are seriously vying for president (yep, my aunt Helga), some of them have undoubtedly signed up as a joke (nope, not the comedian), and <a href="https://www.visir.is/g/20242547065d/ellefu-manns-ovart-i-frambodi" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">at least 11 of them accidentally registered</a> and had no idea that they were collecting endorsements for their candidacy.</p><p id="ec5d">“I’m definitely not about to run for president, this was just an accident,” <a href="https://www.ruv.is/frettir/innlent/2024-03-22-a-annan-tug-ovart-i-forsetaframbod-408236" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">one person told a reporter</a> after having a good laugh about it.</p><p id="ddd3">“That’s hilarious!” <a href="https://www.ruv.is/frettir/innlent/2024-03-22-a-annan-tug-ovart-i-forsetaframbod-408236" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">another person said</a>, thanking the reporter for letting them know that they were in the running.</p><p id="d46e">As a content designer, I was intrigued. How could so many people accidentally start a campaign for President of Iceland?</p><h2 id="0055"><strong>Content design can have real consequences — for democracy, even</strong></h2><p id="faf8">It turns out, the answer largely has to do with content design.</p><p id="b534">Presidential hopefuls were sending people a link to a page where they could be endorsed, but instead of endorsing the candidate, some people accidentally registered to be a candidate.</p><p id="62cc">The page was titled “Collection of endorsements for 2024 presidential candidates,” and it served two purposes: It was for candidates to register to collect endorsements, and it was for people to browse candidates and submit their endorsement.</p><p id="e40c">The top part of the page detailed criteria for registering to collect endorsements and prominently featured a “Log in” button. The bottom part of the page, below the fold, featured a list of candidates with links to endorse them.</p><figure><figcaption>Before: This is how the page looked at the time.</figcaption></figure><p id="735f">When people arrived at the page to endorse a candidate, many of them likely skipped past the initial wall of text and some of them clicked the big “Log in” button, filled out a form, and were — unbeknownst to them — added to the list of candidates.</p><p id="7453">In the comments section of various news articles, people wondered, ‘What’s wrong with these people? Can’t they read? Will they even be able to vote?’</p><p id="7906">But, if you ask me, it wasn’t their fault. At the root of the problem was a UX issue.</p><p id="d2c6">This page serves multiple purposes, but it’s not divided into clear sections with appropriate hierarchy. People did what they tend to do: they scanned the page. The fact that some of them clicked “Log in,” which is by far the loudest CTA, is not strange, especially considering that endorsers need to provide their electronic ID to ensure that their endorsement is real and valid.</p><p id="8d52">People were sent to this page to make an endorsement, they arrived with that mindset, they met a wall of text, and they clicked “Log in,” which was plausibly the first step in the process.</p><h2 id="f0de"><strong>Don’t make people think or read too much — they’ve got things to do</strong></h2><p id="404c">When the list of presidential hopefuls surpassed 40, people grew suspicious.

There are a large number of people vying for the presidency this year, but the vast majority of people visiting this page are there to endorse a candidate. As such, the page should prioritize this use case.</p><p id="3dde">In addition to revisiting the information architecture and reorganizing the content, Digital Iceland also improved some of the microcopy.</p><p id="de28">In the original version, the text “Register to collect endorsements” and the “Log in” button were grouped in a box, but still appeared to be separate. It was possible to skip the text and click the somewhat ambiguous “Log in” button with the assumption that you first needed to log in to a system to endorse a candidate. In the redesigned version, the “Log in” button has been replaced by a link that reads, “establish a collection of endorsements,” which is much, much clearer.</p><p id="23be">Since these changes were made, the list of candidates has continued to grow. It’s hard to tell who is serious and how many of them will be able to get the necessary 1,500 endorsements, but at least we can be fairly confident that people are no longer campaigning for president by accident due to a content design issue.</p><p id="17d3"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ul><li id="ca09">Be wary of generic buttons.</li><li id="b6d1">CTAs should be clear and descriptive.</li><li id="ff4c">Don’t overwhelm people with too much information.</li><li id="c39d">Use visual hierarchy and clear headings to break up a page into sections so that people can scan — because that’s what people do.</li></ul><p id="a97d">To learn more about usability principles, check out Steve Krug’s <a href="https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the early 1940s, German submarines (U-Boats) were wreaking havoc on Allied forces in the Atlantic Ocean, sinking ships, and threatening to turn the tide of the war. What the Allies of WWII needed was something literally too big to fail. And one inventor working for the British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Operations_Headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combined Operations Headquarters</a> (a department of the War Office) had&nbsp;an idea: a giant, floating, mobile and unsinkable island made of ice.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17144"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/variant-ship-design.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/variant-ship-design-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/variant-ship-design.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/variant-ship-design-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17144">Construction concept for an ice-based aircraft carrier</figcaption></figure>
<p>It sounds at first like one of those far-fetched&nbsp;concepts floated by scientists throughout the war — a conflict-ending magic bullet&nbsp;too good to be true — but this proposal led to an actual 1,000-ton prototype approved by Winston Churchill himself and built in secret (and haste).
</p>
<h2>The Tip of the Ice Ship</h2>
<p>Inventor&nbsp;<a title="Geoffrey Pyke" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Pyke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoffrey Pyke</a>&nbsp;saw a giant floating ice ship as a natural option in the face of material limitations. Steel and aluminum were in short supply, but water was everywhere. And making it into ice required relatively little energy. So why not use ice instead of steel?</p>
<figure id="attachment_17153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17153"><img decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/project-habakuk-600x376.jpg" width="600" height="376" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/project-habakuk-600x376.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/project-habakuk-300x188.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/project-habakuk.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17153">Project Habakkuk model sections and cutaways</figcaption></figure>
<p>Pyke envisioned a giant aircraft-carrying vessel over a mile long with a solid hull made of ice. It would feature a long landing platform along the top and central void running its length below. This empty space would be able to shelter aircraft beneath the main landing surface. It was designed to be the largest machine ever built on land or water. Its sheer size (and the ability to repair it with water) would make it effectively unsinkable — the ultimate top-secret weapon.</p>
<p>In fact, Pyke was not even the first to&nbsp;envision a ship made of ice — it was something of a running joke in the British military for years prior. And for good reason: ice is brittle and it melts. Icebergs also have a tendency to roll over from time to time. What Pyke&nbsp;needed was a way to keep it from melting quickly and make it stable on the high seas.</p>
<p>But Pyke was regarded&nbsp;by his colleagues in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Operations_Headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combined Operations</a>&nbsp;as something of a resident genius. And so he was given leave to pursue this insane-sounding “bergship” idea — he set to work finding a way to turn raw ice into a working sea-worthy vessel.</p>
<h2>Perfecting Pykrete</h2>
<p>The solution came in the form of something that came to be known as pykrete: a mixture of wood pulp and frozen water. Wood provided reinforcement, making up for deficiencies in pure ice much like steel rebar helps concrete function in structural contexts. Pykrete would float well and melt more slowly. It could be machined like wood and cast like metal. Still, to keep it cold, a ship would need to be insulated and require a system of on-board refrigeration to keep it from melting.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17143"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/pykrete-bergship.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/pykrete-bergship-600x427.jpg" width="600" height="427" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/pykrete-bergship-600x427.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/pykrete-bergship-300x214.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/pykrete-bergship.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17143">Schematic diagram showing integration of cooling ducts into pykrete hull</figcaption></figure>
<p>Molecular biologist Max Perutz helped perfect the mixture of ice and pulp, conducting experiments in secret under the <a title="Smithfield, London" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithfield,_London" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithfield Meat Market</a> in London (behind a screen of animal carcasses). Later to win the Nobel Prize for work on hemoglobin, Perutz was recruited at the time thanks to his expertise on glaciers and ice crystal structures.</p>
<p>Satisfied with Perutz’s results, Pyke brought his vision to&nbsp;<a title="Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord Mountbatten</a>, Chief of Combined Operations, who in turn took a sample block of pykrete directly to Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
<p>According to Mountbatten, he&nbsp;found Churchill soaking in his tub and dropped in the block of pykrete to demonstrate its buoyancy: “After the outer film of ice on the small pykrete cube had melted, the freshly exposed wood pulp kept the remainder of the block from thawing,” reported Mountbatten of the interaction later at a dinner party.</p>
<h2>On a Wing and a Prayer</h2>
<p>The development of pykrete was not without its incidents and setbacks. At a public ballistics test (aiming to show that pykrete was bulletproof), a ricocheting bullet bounced off a block of the stuff&nbsp;and grazed the leg of an admiral. Stumbling blocks aside, however, a decision was made to pursue the project with all haste.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17147"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/system-of-refrigeration-600x476.jpg" width="600" height="476" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/system-of-refrigeration-600x476.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/system-of-refrigeration-300x238.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/system-of-refrigeration.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17147">Detailed diagram of pykrete hull and refrigeration ducts for proposed ship</figcaption></figure>
<p>The sheer scale and audacity of the endeavor called for a name befitting its unbelievability. So they called it Project Habbakuk, in reference to the following passage from the Hebrew Bible: <span><span>“Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.” (Habbakuk 1:5)</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In 1943, a prototype was commissioned. It would be constructed in Canada by conscientious objectors (who opted for alternative service jobs)&nbsp;unaware of the project’s purpose. A 1,000-ton scale model measuring 30 by 60 feet was built on&nbsp;<a title="Patricia Lake (Alberta)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Lake_(Alberta)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia Lake</a>&nbsp;in Alberta.&nbsp;It was kept frozen&nbsp;in the summer using just a single-horsepower motor, designed to show off the technology under real-world conditions.</p>
<p>A complete, full-scale vessel was to be ordered following a successful test — one that would use at least 300,000 tons&nbsp;of wood pulp, 25,000 tons&nbsp;of insulation, 35,000 tons of timber and 10,000 tons of steel.</p>
<h2>Sunk Costs</h2>
<p>As the project dragged on, complexities arose and new variables were introduced for the test vessel as well as the huge ship it was supposed to herald. In the model, cold flow (ice deformation) raised the demand for steel as well as insulation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17149"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/habbukuk-test.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/habbukuk-test-300x195.jpg" width="300" height="195" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/habbukuk-test-300x195.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/habbukuk-test.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17149">Project Habukkuk test site in Canada</figcaption></figure>
<p>The full-sized ship would also need to have a range of 7,000 miles, support heavy bombers and be torpedo-proof. It was to be over a mile in length, weigh as much as 2.2 million tons and require as many as 26 electric motors to move and steer across the ocean.</p>
<p>In the end, Project Habakkuk was scrapped thanks to a confluence of circumstances. Its increased steel demands were too high, new airfields had reduced the need for carriers and longer-range fuel tanks were helping&nbsp;aircraft fly further. The estimated price tag of 10 million British Pounds was also seen as simply too high for an experimental craft.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17155"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/underwater-plaque.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/01/underwater-plaque.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="141"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17155">Project Habakkuk underwater plaque via the <a href="http://www.albertaunderwatercouncil.com/single-post/2016/10/10/Diving-Jaspers-Habbakuk-Wreck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alberta Diving Council</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the prototype proved its potential, even once-neglected: it took three hot Canadian summers for the test vessel to completely melt. Its remains can be found at the bottom of Patricia Lake in Jasper National Park, marked by an underwater plaque.</p>

<p>The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has captured the sharpest infrared images to date of one of the most distinctive objects in our skies, the Horsehead Nebula. These observations show a part of the iconic nebula in a whole new light, capturing its complexity with unprecedented spatial resolution.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb" target="_blank">Webb’s</a> new images show part of the sky in the constellation Orion (The Hunter), in the western side of the Orion B molecular cloud. Rising from turbulent waves of dust and gas is the Horsehead Nebula, otherwise known as Barnard 33, which resides roughly 1300 light-years away.&nbsp;</p><p>The nebula formed from a collapsing interstellar cloud of material, and glows because it is illuminated by a nearby hot star. The gas clouds surrounding the Horsehead have already dissipated, but the jutting pillar is made of thick clumps of material that is harder to erode. Astronomers estimate that the Horsehead has about five million years left before it too disintegrates. Webb’s new view focuses on the illuminated edge of the top of the nebula’s distinctive dust and gas structure.</p>	</div>

		<p>The Horsehead Nebula is a well-known photon-dominated region, or PDR. In such a region ultraviolet light from young, massive stars creates a mostly neutral, warm area of gas and dust between the fully ionised gas surrounding the massive stars and the clouds in which they are born. This ultraviolet radiation strongly influences the gas chemistry of these regions and acts as the most important source of heat.&nbsp;</p><p>These regions occur where interstellar gas is dense enough to remain neutral, but not dense enough to prevent the penetration of far-ultraviolet light from massive stars. The light emitted from such PDRs provides a unique tool to study the physical and chemical processes that drive the evolution of interstellar matter in our galaxy, and throughout the Universe from the early era of vigorous star formation to the present day.</p><p>Owing to its proximity and its nearly edge-on geometry, the Horsehead Nebula is an ideal target for astronomers to study the physical structures of PDRs and the evolution of the chemical characteristics of the gas and dust within their respective environments, and the transition regions between them. It is considered one of the best objects in the sky to study how radiation interacts with interstellar matter.</p>	</div>

		<p>Thanks to Webb’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/MIRI_factsheet" target="_blank">MIRI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_s_instruments" target="_blank">NIRCam</a>&nbsp;instruments, an international team of astronomers have revealed for the first time the small-scale structures of the illuminated edge of the Horsehead. They have also detected a network of striated features extending perpendicular to the PDR front and containing dust particles and ionised gas entrained in the photo-evaporative flow of the nebula. The observations have also allowed astronomers to investigate the effects of dust attenuation and emission, and to better understand the multidimensional shape of the nebula.</p><p>Next, astronomers intend to study the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2021/06/Spectroscopy_with_Webb" target="_blank">spectroscopic data</a>&nbsp;that have been obtained of the nebula to evidence the evolution of the physical and chemical properties of the material observed across the nebula.</p><p>These observations were taken in the Webb GTO programme #1192 (PI: K. Misselt) and the results have been&nbsp;accepted for publication in&nbsp;<i>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</i>&nbsp;(Abergel et al. 2024).</p>	</div>

Even if the interior – all loud greens and purples with gold-rimmed cabinets – looks hopelessly post-Soviet, the amenities include foam pillows, hairdryers and bathrobes. One could do worse for $155 a night. But Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov, for whom the pillared pile on the Aegean is named, are no ordinary hoteliers. They are Russian “illegals,” or spies operating outside of diplomatic cover, who spent decades living under false pretenses as naturalized citizens of Czechia. </p><p>And Villa Elena is no ordinary hotel. </p><p>For the last fifteen years, it has served as the Greek safehouse for members of GRU Unit 29155, Vladimir Putin’s most grimly accomplished assassination and sabotage squad, the one responsible for poisoning enemies of the Kremlin and blowing up materiel stored in Czechia and Bulgaria, both NATO countries, before it could be sent to the Georgian and Ukrainian armies as well as Western-backed Syrian rebels. All of these end users were variously squaring off against Russian forces or threatening to overthrow an important Russian client. In fact, the Šapošnikovs abetted those bombings, which <em>The Insider</em> first exposed as <a href="https://theins.press/en/politics/266039" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the work of Unit 29155</a>.</p><p>Today, the Czech Intelligence Center for Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime has released the findings of a years-long investigation into Unit 29155’s role in destroying two Czech government-run weapons and ammunition depots in 2014 in Vrbětice, a small town in the south Moravian region of Czechia. These attacks, which resulted in Prague’s expulsion of 18 Russian intelligence officers operating in the country under diplomatic cover, were conducted with explosive devices emplaced by Unit 29155’s most recognizable operatives: Alexander Mishkin, 44, and Anatoly Chepiga, 45. Both would gain international notoriety for trying to murder Sergei Skripal, a GRU officer turned British double agent, along with his daughter Yulia, in Salisbury, England in 2018, with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok. </p><p>The Šapošnikovs not only arranged for Mishkin and Chepiga to gain access to two different warehouses in Vrbětice, but they also communicated directly with Gen. Andrei Averyanov, 58, the founding commander of Unit 29155, who tasked them with facilitating violence against their adoptive nation. </p><p>The GRU, like the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, has long maintained its own illegals program. But the Šapošnikovs are the first known case of to ever be affiliated with Unit 29155, whose remit is strictly kinetic. In March, <em>The Insider</em>, along with its investigative partners <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em>, uncovered evidence implicating Unit 29155 in directed energy attacks thought to be the cause of <a href="https://theins.press/en/politics/270425" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Havana Syndrome</a>, the name given to a collection of debilitating medical ailments afflicting American intelligence officers and diplomats worldwide.</p><p>While both Šapošnikov spouses engaged in espionage for Russia assisted GRU’s sabotage operations, the wife, Šapošnikova, 62, appears to have been directly integrated with Unit 29155, as evidenced both by findings by the Czech investigators and by <em>The Insider’s</em> independent discovery of documentary evidence. As such, Czech investigators have concluded, she likely directed and supervised her husband’s – and possibly their son’s – activities in support of Russian state interests. The family’s clandestine duties ranged from intelligence-gathering to logistical facilitation, providing safe havens, recruitment efforts, and even aiding in securing physical access for GRU operatives conducting sabotage missions.</p><p><em>The Insider </em>has also discovered that Šapošnikova even possessed a secret Russian service passport from a special series reserved for spies from Unit 29155. She even received the Hero of Russian Federation, the highest state honor awarded to those who perform “service to the Russian state and nation, usually connected with a heroic feat of valor.” Putin himself bestowed the title on Šapošnikova in a secret ceremony in Moscow following Unit 29155’s sabotage operations in Czechia and Bulgaria.</p><p>In 2023, Czech authorities, after conducting an independent criminal investigation into the Šapošnikovs’ role in the 2014 bombings in Vrbětice, declared the couple “persons of interest” and requested their questioning by Greek authorities. Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov submitted a statement to Greek authorities alleging they are persecuted by the Czech Republic and are “scapegoats in the name of unknown interests.” Nikolay Šapošnikov died from a heart attack in Greece in February 2024 at the age of 62.</p><h3 id="article_block_0">The Illegals</h3><p>Nikolay Šapošnikov was born in 1961 in Severodvinsk in the far north-west of Russia into a family of military engineers. In 1983 he graduated from the engineering department of the Baku Military Command School and was appointed commander of a motorized rifle company in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital. Records show that Šapošnikov’s unit <a href="http://www.bezenchukgp.ru/information/predsedatel-sobraniya-predstavitelei" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was deployed</a> to Afghanistan from 1983-1986, during the Soviet occupation of the country. In 1985 he divorced his first wife, Natalia, and immediately married Elena Šapošniková (née Lisetskaya), a Kyiv-born engineer and the daughter of a lieutenant-colonel who taught at the Kyiv military command institute. At the time of their marriage she was working at the Baku-based Physics Institute. Elena had a son, Pavel, from a previous marriage. She and Nikolay bore a daughter, Valeria, who was born in 1986.</p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/_P9gq_6fxmoIA8VH-oyk9ql3mWHqCxIJREphxa_Xago/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTAv/ZmlsZS05OWU1ZmVh/NjBjMTBlZDkyN2M1/MjhjNWQ0MDVhNWZk/My5wbmc.jpg" alt="Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov’s Soviet passport photos"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov’s Soviet passport photos</h5></p></div><div><p>The following year, the Soviet Union began withdrawing from Afghanistan. Šapošnikov was redeployed to Czechoslovakia, then a member of the Warsaw Pact, the U.S.S.R.’s equivalent to NATO, where he served as motorized rifle company commander in Jelsava in what is today’s Slovakia. His military career ended, at least on paper, three years later as Czechoslovakia, along with the rest of the Eastern Bloc countries, shook off the yoke of Communist rule. In February 1989, Šapošnikov was expelled from the Communist Party and censured by his commanders over “repeated embezzlement of gasoline and batteries from the army.” This blot on his resume, whether real or contrived, would come in handy a little while later.</p><p>In 1990, Nikolay was retired from military service, formally on medical grounds (he suffered from a spinal injury), and assigned as a reservist to Kyiv, Ukraine, where his wife’s family then lived.</p><p>But as Soviet troops departed that country, too, less than a year later, Šapošnikov returned to Czechoslovakia, where he reported to a police precinct in the town of Zvolen. He sought political asylum, citing his expulsion from the Soviet Communist Party as evidence of his dissidence. In August 1991, after several consecutive stays in refugee camps, Nikolay received the status of a political refugee. A few months later, he was rejoined by his wife Elena and their two young children. They similarly received Czechoslovakian political asylum in 1992.</p><p>After the Czech Republic split peacefully from Slovakia into an independent country, the family of self-professed Soviet dissidents promptly applied for citizenship. However, their applications were riddled with omissions, misrepresentations, and forgeries. Šapošnikov falsely claimed he was born to a family of clerks, not military officers. He also hid the fact that he was a soldier, too, that he had served as a commander in Afghanistan, and that he had a daughter from a previous marriage. Finally, he presented a forged birth certificate for Pavel, Elena’s son from her first marriage, making it appear as if Nikolay were Pavel’s biological father. </p><p>Elena Šapošnikova’s misrepresentations in pursuit of Czech citizenship were more egregious. She lied that she had surrendered her Ukrainian passport upon receiving Czechoslovakian asylum in 1992, when in fact she repeatedly used the Ukrainian document to travel to both Russia and Ukraine – the very countries her purported risk of persecution entitled her to refugee status in the first place.</p><p>For all that, the Šapošnikovs still became Czech citizens, likely through bribery or co-opting crooked bureaucrats. Nikolay received his passport in 1999, while Elena, after “at least six” attempts, obtained hers in 2004 following the involvement of Stanislav Gross, Prague’s notoriously corrupt interior minister at the time. An immigration officer working on Elena’s case even attached a hand-written note to her file: “A red line running through this entire application has been the various people constantly trying to intervene to achieve a positive outcome.”</p><h3 id="article_block_1">All in the Family</h3><p>Even after the collapse of Communism, the white and black market trade in Soviet-era weapons was a growth industry, owing to the fact that so many nations around the globe – including new-minted members of the EU and NATO – had armies that still relied on kit manufactured in the U.S.S.R or its satellites. In the early 2000’s, Nikolai pitched his military expertise to Petr Bernatik, a former secret agent of the ŠtB, the Czechoslovakian state security service. An engineer by training, Bernatik had served as an undercover informant in the ŠtB’s counterintelligence department, which kept close ties with both the Soviet KGB and the occupying Red Army. After the Czech Republic became a free-market economy, Bernatik launched a number of arms trading companies and hired his former commanding officers from the Czech secret police to work for him. He apparently felt no compunction in also enlisting a former Russian officer.</p><p>The largest of Bernatik’s arms dealing businesses was Imex Group. Šapošnikov’s unofficial role in the company was that of a business development executive: he scouted sales opportunities and provided consultancy and support to Imex’s international customers. As time went by, Šapošnikov brought more and more of his own family into Imex. By 2012, both Valeria and Pavel, his daughter and stepson, were employed by the company. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/Bm_jDKnK-be3YB6j4ZPmqWRvduS6Keg0X9geyLqKrCo/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTcv/ZmlsZS1lYTQxYmUx/MjU1MzE1MzA4N2Y1/MDI3MTMzOWJjZDgw/Yy5wbmc.jpg" alt="Pavel Šapošnikov’s application to the Czech Pirate Party forum"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Pavel Šapošnikov’s application to the Czech Pirate Party forum</h5></p></div><div><p>A graduate of the University of Prague, Pavel joined Czechia’s libertarian center-left Pirate Party in 2014, describing himself in an online forum as a former “employee in the field of international trade” with “a different opinion from my superiors.” Pavel admired the grassroots movement’s doctrine of openness and transparency. “I don’t know how I can be helpful at the moment,” he posted to the party’s online forum as part of his application, “but maybe something will come up.” Pavel’s name was later <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?t=37981&amp;start=10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> in a list of suspicious new applicants who were using avatars instead of photos in their online communication. Travel data shows Pavel flew to Simferopol, the provincial capital of Russian-occupied Crimea, in 2019.</p><p>Elena, meanwhile, ran her own business: a company that purported to import pig iron from former Soviet republics. But as Czech police would later discover, Elena was also deeply involved with her husband’s enterprise and intimately aware of Imex’s operations. In many ways, she seemed to be supervising and directing Nikolay’s activities in direct coordination with Andrey Averyanov, the head of Unit 29155. She communicated with Gen. Andrey Averyanov via email; his Gmail address, registered from a Russian IP address, is <a href="https://theins.ru/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="65130c11041f0c5654250208040c094b060a08">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>. (“Vitazi” in Russian means “knights.”)</p><p>Elena also provided a veneer of plausibility for the Šapošnikovs’ lavish lifestyle. Despite Šapošnikov’s modest income from Imex (around $650 per month), the family bought real estate in Czechia and Greece at a value far in excess of what their collective income could account for. As Czech investigators note, “in some cases their official income could not cover even their phone bill for the month.” Furthermore, Elena owned a company registered in the Marshall Islands and controlled two bank accounts in Switzerland. Those offshore accounts, plus unexplained cash infusions to their Czech banks and a series of in-cash payments, appeared to have been the real source of income. </p><p>Then there was their Greek villa.</p><h3 id="article_block_2">The GRU’s Hellenic Retreat</h3><p>In 2009 the Šapošnikovs purchased a sprawling villa on the picturesque Aegean peninsula of Halkidiki, Greece. The price, as recorded in the notarial deed of purchase obtained by <em>The Insider</em>, was 275,292 euros, or $300,000 at the time. Elena would later tell investigators that she had funded the investment “with money from my parents” – a tall order for the septuagenarian couple living in Kyiv on pensions of under $300 per month.</p></div><div><p>The Šapošnikovs moved into Villa Elena in 2010 and set off to run it as a hotel. They only visited Czechia occasionally from then on.</p><p>While sites such as Booking.com and Tripadvisor <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g16781003-d16780226-Reviews-Villa_Elena-Frama_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contain links</a> to the property, where it appears at least a few holidaymakers stayed and even left reviews, <em>The Insider</em> has not been able to find any publicly bookable dates since it started this investigation in 2021.</p><p>Unpublicized tourists include members of Unit 29155 who began traveling to the nearby port city of Thessaloniki – only an hour’s drive south-east from the villa – as soon as the Šapošnikovs took ownership.</p><p>Averyanov traveled to Thessaloniki under his cover identity of “Andrey Overyanov” and stayed in the vicinity of Villa Elena for a week between July 15 and July 21, 2013, metadata from his burner phone obtained by <em>The Insider </em>shows. Averyanov returned to Thessaloniki the following year, on the return leg of a trip he made to Amsterdam on August 25, 2014. At least four other members of Unit 29155 took trips to Thessaloniki and likely also stayed at Villa Elena in the period from 2012 to 2018. Some of these visits coincided with missions the operatives had in the region. </p><p>For example, Unit 29155 member Alexey Kapinos, whom Šapošnikov described to Czech investigators as “a family friend,” flew to Thessaloniki on a diplomatic passport on April 25, 2014. Just a day earlier, Kapinos’ GRU associates, all traveling under fake identities, arrived in Bulgaria. According to a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/04/26/how-gru-sabotage-and-assassination-operations-in-czechia-and-bulgaria-sought-to-undermine-ukraine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint investigation</a> by <em>The Insider</em> and <em>Bellingcat</em>, which has since been corroborated by indictments from Bulgarian prosecutors, Unit 29155 poisoned the Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev with an unidentified organophosphate substance at the time of this trip. </p><p>Emilian Gebrev, the head of the company EMCO, told <em>The Insider</em> that he had been befriended by the Šapošnikovs in 2012. The illegals evidently sought out his friendship despite the scarcity of common business projects between them. Gebrev said he remembered that Elena was the dominant partner in the marriage, always steering the conversation in her preferred direction. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/Z15nWbD-_sd0b4RgW2nac3ZXL-FZZa9FAtPloAYdKTI/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTYv/ZmlsZS1lNDk5YzRh/ODFiMmYxY2I2NzFh/YTIyZjhiOGRiMTU1/NC5qcGVn.jpg" alt="The Šapošnikovs — Nikolay and Elena"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>The Šapošnikovs — Nikolay and Elena</h5></p></div><div><p>As previously disclosed by <em>The Insider</em>, at the time of his poisoning Gebrev was seen as a consequential supplier of ammunition to the Ukraine Army, then reconstituting itself following Russia’s seizure of Crimea and orchestration of a plausibly deniable “separatist” insurgency in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Gebrev says that shortly before being poisoned he stopped supplying Ukraine with ammunition in voluntary compliance with the Minsk Accords, two serially violated ceasefire agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 by Ukraine, Russia, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Two sources active in weapons procurement in Ukraine at the time told <em>The Insider</em> that immediately after Gebrev’s poisoning, Šapošnikov offered Ukrainian government buyers “a reliable replacement” for the Bulgarian arms merchant. In the event, Kyiv never purchased from the supplier suggested by Šapošnikov due to the deficient quality of his inventory.</p><h3 id="article_block_3">The Saboteurs</h3><p>Czech police investigators now disclose that Elena, the senior illegal in the husband-and-wife team, communicated with Averyanov via his Gmail account, offering critical intelligence about pending weapons sale contracts involving Imex Group. The Šapošnikovs’ cultivation of Gebrev paid off. Their company began trading frequently with EMCO, which produced and repaired everything from Soviet-era artillery to armored vehicles across a host of plants in Bulgaria, often for export to Georgia and Ukraine. EMCO also refurbished dated Czech-made ammunition, including rounds subsequently purchased by Imex Group, corporate records show.</p><p>Averyanov’s interest in Imex Group’s partners across NATO was obvious. Any sales deemed contrary to Russia’s interest would be ideal targets for Unit 29155, which could target the weapons and ammunition, if not try to kill the brokers responsible for selling them to enemy states or non-state actors, such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a collection of Western-backed rebel groups opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Czechs allege that Imex Group was involved in deals with European counterparts that resold mines, assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and anti-tank missiles. One Slovakian company, Kelson, sought to acquire these wares through intermediary companies, all with the intent to resell them to the Saudi Ministry of Defense. The FSA, the Czechs conclude, were “probably” the ultimate recipient. (Saudi Arabia did indeed purchase weapons in Croatia that wound up in FSA custody, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/middleeast/in-shift-saudis-are-said-to-arm-rebels-in-syria.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times </em>reported in 2013</a>.)</p><p>As a senior GRU commander overseeing a strictly kinetic unit within the service, Averyanov would have been ordered by Moscow to interdict covert weapons shipments intended for Syria’s mainstream insurgents, who, prior to Russia’s direct military intervention in the country’s civil war in 2015, were perilously close to unhorsing one of Russia’s most valued client regimes in the Middle East. The CIA and Turkish intelligence backed dozens of FSA formations battling Assad’s army and Iranian-backed militias until the rise of hardline jihadists, particularly as the Islamic State, transformed NATO’s approach to Syria as a counterterrorist mission. </p><p>On July 24, 2013, Averyanov wrote to Šapošniková that “very, very much we need a complete list…” of sought-after platforms. She later forwarded the GRU general attached PDF files titled “Aircraft_FSA.pdf,” “Ammunition_FSA.pdf,” and “Weapons_FSA.pdf,” all of which Pavel Šapošnikov sent her on August 3.  </p><p>The GRU was therefore “informed about the planned trade from beginning to end,” the Czech investigators conclude. “These goods were stored exclusively in Vrbětice in warehouses No. 16 and 12. As a result of the subsequent explosions, the goods were not delivered and were completely destroyed.”</p><p>The Šapošnikovs — likely aided by Petr Bernatik Jr., the executive director of Imex and the son of its founder — provided physical access to these warehouses. They may have also conspired to help the GRU commit an act of piracy or maritime terrorism.</p><p>The first case of Unit 29155 sabotaging a military consignment may have involved disappearing a ship carrying pontoon bridge parts and Ukrainian-made KrAZ trucks destined for Vietnam. The “INA,” a Ukrainian ship<strong>,</strong> disappeared in 2013 sometime after passing through the Suez Canal and switching off its transponder. According to Czech investigators, Elena and Averyanov “communicated about this order,” which set sail from the Bulgarian port of Varna on December 17, 2013, where the Šapošnikovs had arrived personally to oversee the departure. People familiar with the transaction told <em>The Insider</em> that this shipment would have interfered with a direct sale to Vietnam by a Russian arms export company, and the ship’s disappearance may have been aimed at sabotaging this competing supplier.</p><p>Almost a year later, on October 16, 2014, the first warehouse in Vrbětice went up in flames. </p><p>Czech investigators are clear that this was the handiwork of Unit 29155. On September 26 of that year, Averyanov, using his Gmail account, messaged Šapošnikova: “Hello Elena, I am sending a request to visit the warehouses…” </p><p>The subsequent digital exchange between the GRU handler and his Czech agent consisted of pleasantries and business. Šapošnikova wished “Andrusha,” the diminutive for Andrey, a happy birthday on September 29, and the two made plans to meet in person in Portugal the following month. Evidence shows Averyanov and Nikolay, along with Elena and their daughter Valeria, did in fact meet in Lisbon on October 3. </p><p>A week later, the Šapošnikovs were back in Czechia, where Nikolai met with Petr Bernatík Jr., the son of the Imex Group’s founder and “a key player in its operations,” according to investigators. Averyanov then sent a blank email to Bernatik Jr.’s corporate Imex address. The message contained an attachment of Photoshopped passport scans for two men: “Ruslan Khalimovich Tabarov” and “Nicolai Popa.” These were fake identities of Mishkin and Chepiga, the Unit 29155 operatives who would go on to poison the Skripals in Salisbury. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/S4zyAJebTxCk7S8KDpg48UhpMZuu0pEETBtml9_WHiA/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTgv/ZmlsZS1hOGFmZmY1/ODI0NTBmOGUyYmEy/MTk3NzE3YzlhZThm/MS5wbmc.jpg" alt="Photoshopped passport pages for Unit 29155 operatives Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, sent by their commander Gen.

Bernatik Jr. had no other correspondence on that day, nor did he conduct any other duties for Imex Group. He did, however, call Šapošnikov before and after forwarding Averyanov’s message. A little over an hour after forwarding Averyanov’s email, just before 10 o’clock in the morning, Mishkin and Chepiga cleared passport control in Prague. Later that day, they checked into the Florentina Boat Hotel in the Czech capital, where they mingled and flirted with a young Ukrainian woman, using the same absurd cover story they’d use for the Skirpal assassination: they were traveling sports nutritionists. </p><p>On Monday, October 13, Bernatik Jr.’s assistant instructed the warehouse authority in Vrbětice to allow entry for “Ruslan Tabarov” and “Nicolai Popa” anytime between October 14th and 17th. </p><p>The Šapošnikovs were at that exact moment meeting with Averyanov and his deputy Alexey Kapinos at the Gino Paradize Hotel in Besenova, a village in Slovakia. En route to the hotel, the Šapošnikovs would have passed through the city of Žilina, where another Unit 29155 operative, Nikolay Ezhov, was staying at the Polom Hotel, having arrived from Moscow together with Averyanov.</p><p>The complicity of Alexey Kapinos and Nikolay Ezhov, along with several other members of Unit 29155, to the targeted explosions in Vrbetice, were previously disclosed by a joint investigation by The Insider and Bellingcat. The new details provided by Czech investigators corroborate and supplement <em>The Insider's</em> findings which were based on analysis of travel data, shown in the map below. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/XxqY5AhwfmmxLrBHDpK6Vl7oDznj8YA1eSvW-p1by5Y/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTkv/ZmlsZS0wYmM1MzY2/NWMyNGUzMTc2NDMx/OTcwYTZhZDkzMmVi/OS5wbmc.jpg" alt="Timeline and map of arrivals of members of 29155 in the area of the Vrbetice explosions in October 2014"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Timeline and map of arrivals of members of 29155 in the area of the Vrbetice explosions in October 2014</h5></p></div><div><p>Warehouse 16 blew up at 9:30 a.m. on October 16, turning the entire building into a giant inferno with secondary explosions caused by igniting gunpowder and incendiaries. The resulting blast was so severe that an hour later, the Institute of Geophysics at the Czech Academy of Science registered a large earthquake. Two Imex Group employees, Luděk Petřík and Vratislav Havránek, were killed instantly while conducting an inspection of aircraft engines and 152-millimeter artillery shells belonging to EMCO. Both Petřík and Havránek were ripped apart instantly; shrapnel from a Soviet PG-15 anti-tank grenade, a type of munition was later recovered from the severed remains of one of them. </p><p>A month and a half later, on December 3, artillery, mortars, and assault rifles – much of it owned by EMCO – began exploding in Warehouse 12 in the same Vrbětice facility. </p><h3 id="article_block_4">The Telltale Passport</h3><p>The Šapošnikovs were initially confronted by Czech investigators in 2021 with the array of incriminating overlaps between their actions, meetings, and communications with Unit 29155 and the explosions not only in Czechia, but also at arms warehouses in Bulgaria. As <em>The Insider</em> was the first to report, Unit 29155’s first kinetic operation on EU and NATO soil took place in the Bulgarian village of Lovnidol in 2011, after other operatives from the unit, using homemade detonators, blew up yet another EMCO consignment of artillery shells recently transported from the Vrbětice facility. Bulgaria was subsequently the target of 6 additional bombings or acts of arson, all perpetrated by Unit 29155. </p><p>The Šapošnikovs were subjected to several interrogations, conducted via the proxies of the Greek and Bulgarian authorities (the couple refused to travel to Czechia to submit themselves to questioning there). They repeatedly changed their testimony to try to account for new, independently sourced evidence with which they were confronted. Their main argument in favor of their innocence was that all their links to Unit 29155 were “personal” or driven by the legitimate business interests of Imex Group. The Šapošnikovs claimed they did not know Andrey Averyanov or Alexey Kapinos were members of an internationally wanted state terrorist organization. They further insisted that they did not knowingly assist Unit 29155 with any of their sabotage operations. The couple has accused Czech authorities of political persecution owing to their Russian heritage. Moreover, there is no predicate offense, as the 2014 explosions in Vrbětice, they maintain, were the result of industrial accidents.</p><p>The Šapošnikovs’ defense is unlikely to withstand the weight of forensic evidence compiled by Czech investigators — or the new discovery made by <em>The Insider</em> as this story was going to press. </p><p>Travel and border crossing data, recently made available thanks to an avalanche of terabytes leaked from Russian government databases, showed that Elena Šapošnikova is in possession of a secret Russian passport. Critically, her nine-digit passport number is part of a numerical range reserved exclusively for members of Unit 29155, differing from those of her colleagues only by its last two digits. Šapošnikova’s is 646518955.<strong> </strong></p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/kvEVpLy8KXwQlEBRWGDEIBDaQLbMj1ijFxa-yYmdGCU/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ5MDAv/ZmlsZS1mNTdkMGI1/NTVjYmE5ODAyZWU2/YWU3ODRhMTc2ZmVm/NC5wbmc.jpg" alt="Passport numbers reserved exclusively for members of GRU Unit 29155"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Passport numbers reserved exclusively for members of GRU Unit 29155</h5></p></div><div><p>Šapošnikova used this passport to travel between Greece and Russia on at least two occasions, once in December 2015 and the second time in December 2017. In both cases, she used sophisticated tradecraft that sought to leave no trace in databases accessible to European authorities. For instance, she booked her trips and bought her plane tickets using her Czech passport, registering only that nationality with the Greek airline. But upon crossing the Russian border, Šapošnikova used her secret Russian passport, thus bypassing the need to obtain a Russian visa issued to her as a Czech citizen and eliding the digital footprint associated with the relevant application.</p><p>Notably, Šapošnikova’s first trip to Moscow under her GRU service passport lasted only two days. She traveled from Thessaloniki to Moscow on December 3, 2015 and left on December 5. The trip was short but sweet. It was on this visit that Vladimir Putin bestowed her Hero of the Russian Federation title, a decoration the naturalized Czech arms dealer and hotelier now shares with many of her colleagues in Russia’s elite band of murderers and saboteurs.</p><p><em>With additional reporting by Kato Kopaleishvili.</em></p></div><div><h5>SEE ALSO</h5></div></div><div><h4>Subscribe to our weekly digest</h4></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
On April 21, a group of anonymous authors and non-anonymous signatories published
<a href="https://save-nix-together.org/">a lengthy open letter</a> to the
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
Nix</a> community
and Nix founder Eelco Dolstra calling for his resignation from the project. They
claimed ongoing problems with the project's leadership, primarily focusing on the
way his actions have allegedly
undermined people nominally empowered to perform various
moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter has gained
more than 100 signatures.
</p>

<h4>Decision-making authority</h4>

<p>
The Nix project is governed by the
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/foundation">
NixOS Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization
that handles the project's finances and legal responsibilities. The foundation
itself is headed by a board with five voting members, chaired by Dolstra.
There are no term limits, and the board selects its own membership and chair.
According to <a href="https://nixos.org/community/teams/foundation-board/">
the board's team page</a>, its responsibilities include handling
"<q>administrative, legal, and financial tasks</q>", sponsorships and donations,
funding for "<q>community events and efforts</q>", and acting as an arbiter in
case of conflicts in the community. Notably, the board "<q>is not responsible
for technical leadership, decisions, or direction</q>", nor is it expected to
handle all decision making. The board is responsible for
providing "<q>a framework for teams
to self-organize</q>", including a duty to "<q>[h]and out the credentials and
permissions required for the teams' work</q>".
</p>

<p>
The open letter has several related complaints, but the most central one is that
they allege Dolstra has repeatedly strong-armed the board and members of
other community teams to overrule their decisions:
</p>

<blockquote>
For example, after months of discussion on sponsorship policy in the board, with
consensus having been formed on a policy that allows community veto of NixCon
sponsors, Eelco (and Graham [Christensen], at the same time) appeared at the
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/open-board-call-2024-03-20/41898/">
open board call
over 45 minutes in</a>, and began re-litigating the issue of whether we need to
limit sponsorship to begin with, which had already been agreed upon by everyone
but him.
</blockquote>

<p>
Christensen is Dolstra's co-founder at
<a href="https://determinate.systems/">Determinate
Systems</a>.
The letter lists other examples, such as Dolstra blocking longtime
contributors from becoming code reviewers or blocking a build-system change that
had made it through the RFC process.
The letter
concludes that Dolstra is essentially
leveraging social power from being the founder of the project to overrule
decisions that are nominally supposed to be made collaboratively.
In short, Dolstra is acting as "<q>the effective Benevolent Dictator for Life
(BDFL)</q>" of the
project, even though the NixOS Foundation's charter doesn't grant anyone that
authority.
The letter
says this leads to "<q>a culture of responsibility without authority</q>" that
erodes contributors' desire to continue working on the project. It specifically
mentions the moderation team as an example of this, saying that its members are
"<q>in fear of
their authority being undermined directly by Eelco or indirectly through the
Foundation</q>".
</p>

<p>
When asked to comment on the concerns raised in the letter, members of the NixOS
moderation team responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Overall we think that the letter describes the situation of the
moderation team fairly well. We have been operating in an emergency
mode most of the time for over half a year now. Our team retention is
at an all time low, and we are barely able to keep up with recruiting
new members as old ones quit. Right now the moderation team is down to
four people, including two who desire to leave as soon as a replacement
is found, not counting another moderator who left last week.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that the moderation team feels disempowered, this is
mostly because of heavy antagonism from some community members or risks
of destabilizing the community, and not because of an actual lack of
power. Most of that is a reflection of a deeper cultural conflict
within the community and not directly related to the foundation board.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite slightly disagreeing with the source of the issue,
they went on to acknowledge that Dolstra had impeded several attempts to improve
the situation, and said that they understood many community members' complaints.
The team also
called the situation itself "a deep structural and cultural issue involving
many people".
</p>

<p>
Pierre Bourdon, a long-time contributor to Nix,
<a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/112310645064859357">
posted on Mastodon</a> about his experience working on NixOS,
<a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/112310661634038271">
stating</a> that while
he disagrees with the tone and approach of the open letter, the factual
statements about Dolstra's leadership match his own experience.
</p>

<h4>Conflicts of interest</h4>

<p>
The letter also alleges several conflicts of interest, primarily concerning
Dolstra's employer, Determinate Systems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries">
Anduril</a>, a military contractor that uses NixOS, has repeatedly
attempted to become a sponsor of NixCon, which did not go over well with the
community, as reflected in the minutes of
the board meeting on March 20. The letter says Dolstra pushed
strongly for the inclusion of Anduril as a sponsor even after it became clear
that many core contributors disagreed. Anduril was eventually dropped as a sponsor
for <s>both</s> <a href="https://2023.nixcon.org/">NixCon 2023</a>
<s>and <a href="https://2024-na.nixcon.org/">NixCon 2024</a> after community
pressure</s>.
[Thanks to Martin Weinelt for pointing out that
<a href="https://2024-na.nixcon.org/#sponsors">Anduril did end up sponsoring NixCon
2024</a>.]
</p>

<p>
On April 10, Théophane Hufschmitt, the secretary of the board, shared
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-event-sponsorship-policy/43110">
an update</a> on the board's
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/blob/bb7af14ae242ab87c8312bb4122b2a3cd184462d/policies/sponsorship_policy.md">
new sponsorship policy</a>. Hufschmitt expressed the board's apologies for the
way the situation was handled, and promised that "<q>we will prioritize
transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness in our decision-making
processes</q>."
</p>

<p>
That same day, Samuel Dionne-Riel
<a href="https://twitter.com/samueldr/status/1778259760707448853">
stated</a> that Dolstra had refused to clarify
whether he had a relationship with Anduril and
asked
Christensen, a co-founder of Determinate Systems: "<q>Does DetSys have or had
relationships with Anduril?</q>" Christensen
<a href="https://twitter.com/grhmc/status/1778386025007460682">replied</a>:
"<q>Did you know this
category of question is pretty much impossible to answer because NDAs are a
thing?</q>"
</p>

<p>
This isn't the only time Dolstra has appeared to avoid disclosing potential
conflicts of interest; the letter alleges that
he kept his status as a founder of Determinate Systems secret for
some months (a claim Dolstra later denied), and that
this is especially worrying in light of some of the technical
promises that Determinate Systems makes to customers. The company produces its
own installer for Nix that the company promises will provide stable support for some
Nix features. The letter states: "<q>This is fine, however, it is questionably
acceptable to do that while employing <em>the lead developer of CppNix</em>
[the main Nix implementation] and saying
nothing about how this will interact with the team's [decision-making]
autonomy.</q>"
The concerns are not entirely theoretical, either;
the main Nix installer has been
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/10109">
broken in various ways</a> since version 2.18 in September 2023.
</p>

<h4>Call to action</h4>

<p>
The final section of the letter calls
for Dolstra's resignation from the board, suggesting that he should also
completely disengage from the project for at least six months, to give the rest
of the board time to reform the project's governance.
</p>

<blockquote>
This document should be seen as the canary in the coal mine for what <em>many</em> people
have been feeling for years and does not exhaustively cover absolutely all
problems in the community, but we hope it is enough to justify action.
</blockquote>

<p>
The letter ends by suggesting that if Dolstra doesn't resign, the signatories
would switch to and support a fork of the project.
I contacted several of the
signatories to ask whether they'd be willing to provide additional commentary on
why they believed a letter like this to be a necessary step.
Haydon Welsh responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
I signed the letter because it was clear that every other team member was
sick and tired of Eelco, and so I saw it only right if that's their only
hope to regain enthusiasm for the project. No open-source project should
die or be hard-forked because of one person, that destroys a lot of the
purpose for being open-source.
</blockquote>

<p>
Kiara Grouwstra had stronger feelings on the matter:
</p>

<blockquote>
While I want a full rotation of members on the NixOS board, as well as
changes to its goal and structure so as to better incorporate the
community including marginalized perspectives, my friend convinced me
the polemic response would not sit well with the moderators, and shared
with me the draft open letter about Eelco's role, which I opted to
settle for as the lower-hanging fruit right now.
</blockquote>

<p>
On April 27, Xe Iaso wrote <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/much-ado-about-nothing/">
a blog post</a> about xer perspective on the matter, stating that at this point
a fork is both inevitable and doomed.
Even if the actions called for in the letter do come about, the difficult
situation is already having an impact on the Nix community. On April 21, Nixpgs
contributor Kamila Borowska
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/305826">resigned from the project</a>.
On April 25, Mario Rodas, who had contributed more than 250 packages,
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/306702">
followed suit</a>. In total, 24 maintainers
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=label%3A%228.has%3A+maintainer+removal%22">
have left</a>.
</p>

<h4>Dolstra's response</h4>

<p>
On April 26, Dolstra posted
<a href="https://determinate.systems/posts/on-community-in-nix/">
a response</a> to the letter.
He states that the role of the board is to handle the
financial and legal work, not to run the Nix community.
He also claims that he has had "<q>very little involvement in Nixpkgs and NixOS
in recent years</q>".
Dolstra goes on to state: "<q>I am just one member of the five-member Nix team
and hold no more formal authority than the others in determining the direction
of the team.</q>"
While this is true, it does not directly refute the
letter's claims that Dolstra exceeds the formal authority granted to him.
</p>

<p>
Dolstra also reiterated his position that NixCon should not refuse Anduril's
sponsorship, stating: "<q>It is my opinion that it is not for us, as open source
software developers, to decide whose views are valid and whose are not, and to
allow or disallow project or conference participation as a result.</q>"
Dolstra does, however, explicitly refute the claim that his involvement in
Determinate Systems was at all secret: "<q>My role,
participation, and focus on the good work being done at Determinate Systems have
been public knowledge since the company's inception</q>". He goes on to say that
the claim that Determinate Systems seeks to have an outsized influence on the
community is "<q>patently false</q>".
</p>

<p>
He ends his response by inviting community members who feel unwelcome in
the Nix community to work for Determinate Systems instead:
</p>

<blockquote>
I remain committed to creating a community where everyone feels seen, heard, and
valued, and I will not let unfounded accusations detract from this important
work. I encourage everyone reading this who feels that they have not been heard
or feels displaced to join the Determinate Systems community as we continue
working to make Nix as easy to use and as impactful as possible.
</blockquote>

<p>
It is difficult to predict where the Nix community will go from here, and
what the eventual fate of any forks will be. For
now, Dolstra remains the chair of the board — a position he seems unlikely to
give up under pressure from the letter's signatories.

<p><em>Note from Jeremy</em>: This is my personal submission to the authors of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">bill SB-1047</a>. It’s not an official Answer.AI statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a comment from Jeremy Howard regarding SB-1047. I am an AI researcher and entrepreneur. I am the CEO of Answer.AI, an AI R&amp;D lab registered to do business in California. I am the author of popular AI software including the fastai library, a widely used AI training system. I am the co-author of <em>Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD</em>, a widely-praised book with a 4.7 rating on Amazon based on nearly 500 reviews, and am the creator of the <em>Practical Deep Learning</em> series of free courses, the longest-running deep learning course in the world, with over 5 million views. I co-authored the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification</a>, which created the 3-stage language model pre-training and fine-tuning approach on which all of today’s language models (including ChatGPT and Gemini) are based.</p>
<p>While the intent of SB-1047 to ensure the safe and secure development of AI is commendable, certain provisions within the bill raise serious concerns regarding their potential impact on open-source developers, small businesses, and overall innovation within the AI sector. This response aims to highlight these concerns and suggest alternative approaches that could achieve the desired safety goals without stifling the dynamism of the AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ironically, by imposing these restrictions on open-source development, SB-1047 could actually reduce overall safety within the AI ecosystem, in particular through reducing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency and Collaboration</strong>: Open-source development fosters transparency and collaboration, allowing a wider range of experts to identify and address potential safety concerns. Restricting this open development model limits the ability of the broader community to contribute to safety solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity and Resilience</strong>: Open-source projects contribute to a more diverse and resilient AI landscape. Concentrating control within a few large entities creates single points of failure and increases the potential for systemic risks.</li>
</ul>
<section id="concerns-regarding-open-source-development">
<h2 data-anchor-id="concerns-regarding-open-source-development">Concerns Regarding Open-Source Development</h2>
<p>Open source has been a key enabler of the success of the US software industry, and has allowed many Americans to access critical software tools which would otherwise be unavailable to them. Open source has, in particular, provided many of the fundamental building blocks for modern artificial intelligence, and is the basis on which nearly all academic research (including safety and security research) is done. Harming open source will harm developers, consumers, academics, and obstruct the development of new startups. The bill would cause harm in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overly Broad Definitions</strong>: The definition of “covered model” within the bill is extremely broad, potentially encompassing a wide range of open-source models that pose minimal risk. This could inadvertently criminalize the activities of well-intentioned developers working on beneficial AI projects.</li>
<li><strong>Dual use</strong>: An AI model is a general purpose piece of software that runs on a computer, much like a word processor, calculator, or web browser. The creator of a model can not ensure that a model is never used to do something harmful – any more so that the developer of a web browser, calculator, or word processor could. Placing liability on the creators of general purpose tools like these mean that, in practice, such tools can not be created at all, except by big businesses with well funded legal teams.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictive Requirements</strong>: The bill imposes significant burdens on developers, including mandatory shutdowns, extensive reporting, and compliance with potentially ambiguous “covered guidance.” These requirements could disproportionately impact open-source developers who often lack the resources of larger corporations to navigate complex regulatory processes.</li>
<li><strong>Disincentivizing Openness</strong>: The fear of legal repercussions and bureaucratic hurdles could discourage open-source development, hindering the collaborative spirit that has been instrumental in driving AI advancements. This reduction in transparency could also make it more difficult to identify and address potential safety concerns.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="impact-on-small-businesses-and-innovation">
<h2 data-anchor-id="impact-on-small-businesses-and-innovation">Impact on Small Businesses and Innovation</h2>
<p>The proposed regulations create significant barriers to entry for small businesses and startups looking to innovate in the AI space. The costs associated with compliance, coupled with the legal risks, could deter entrepreneurs and limit competition. This would ultimately stifle innovation and concentrate power within established corporations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barrier to Entry</strong>: The substantial costs associated with compliance, including fees, audits, and legal counsel, could create a significant barrier to entry for small businesses and startups. This would limit competition and concentrate power within established corporations, ultimately hindering innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Chilling Effect on Research</strong>: The fear of inadvertently triggering the bill’s provisions could lead researchers and developers to self-censor or avoid exploring promising avenues of AI research. This would stifle scientific progress and limit the potential of AI to address societal challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Talent</strong>: The restrictive environment created by the bill could drive talented AI researchers and developers out of California, harming the state’s economy and weakening its position as a leader in AI innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>California plays a critical role in driving US innovation, particularly in the technology sector. By placing undue burdens on AI development, SB-1047 risks hindering the state’s leadership in this crucial field. This could have ripple effects throughout the US, slowing down overall progress in AI research and development.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternative-approaches">
<h2 data-anchor-id="alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches</h2>
<p>Instead of focusing on regulating AI model development, I urge you to consider alternative approaches that address the actual risks associated with AI applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support Open-Source Development</strong>: Encourage and facilitate the open-source development of AI models to foster collaboration, transparency, and a more diverse and resilient AI ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Usage, Not Development</strong>: Instead of regulating the development of AI models, the focus should be on regulating their applications, particularly those that pose high risks to public safety and security. Regulate the use of AI in high-risk areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and critical infrastructure, where the potential for harm is greatest, would ensure accountability for harmful use, whilst allowing for the continued advancement of AI technology.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Transparency and Collaboration</strong>: Encourage the development and adoption of best practices for responsible AI development through collaboration between industry, academia, and government. This could involve creating industry standards, fostering open-source development, and investing in AI safety research.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in AI Expertise</strong>: Provide resources to government agencies to develop expertise in AI and build capacity to effectively monitor and address potential risks. This would enable a more informed and nuanced approach to AI regulation that balances safety with innovation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2 data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>California has a unique opportunity to lead the way in responsible AI development. However, SB-1047, in its current form, risks stifling innovation and undermining the state’s leadership in AI. By adopting alternative approaches that prioritize accountability for harmful use while fostering a vibrant and open AI ecosystem, California can ensure the safe and beneficial advancement of this transformative technology.</p>
</section>
<section id="specific-sections-of-concern">
<h2 data-anchor-id="specific-sections-of-concern">Specific Sections of Concern</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 22602 (f)</strong>: The definition of “covered model” is overly broad and could encompass a wide range of open-source models.</li>
<li><strong>Section 22603 (b)</strong>: The requirements for developers are overly burdensome and could discourage open-source development.</li>
<li><strong>Section 22606 (a)</strong>: The potential for civil penalties could have a chilling effect on research and innovation.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<article>
  
  <div><p>If you asked a lawyer whether ChatGPT could do his job, he would laugh you out of the room. The tool is often useful, but can’t handle legal questions end to end. It makes up sources, its reasoning can be flawed, and it may overlook key aspects of the law.</p>
<p>We decided to tackle this problem at <a href="https://hotseatai.com/">Hotseat</a>. After iterating multiple times, implementing advanced agentic workflows, and testing with dozens of lawyer, we’re certain that the product has glaring limitations and it won’t replace any jobs soon. However, we figured out an unintuitive, LLM-only method of doing RAG, and we leveraged it to make LLMs answer complex questions about select EU regulations.</p>
<p>In this post, you’re going to learn how to implement a system that can perform advanced reasoning over very long documents.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>A great answer to a legal question must at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be based on sound reasoning;</li>
<li>Quote the source text of the law to be verifiable; and</li>
<li>Take into account all relevant parts of the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet these requirements, we had to put the relevant documents in the prompt - we couldn’t just hope that the LLM was trained on all of the law. We also limited our scope to a single regulation. It made the problem approachable, and we could scale later.</p>
<p>In our first attempts, we<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> fed the entire 226 pages of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">EU’s AI Act</a> into GPT-4 and asked a sample question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the deployment of an LLM acting as a proxy to optimize SQL queries fall within the regulatory scope of the EU’s AI Act?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we found that GPT-4 couldn’t give us a good answer.</p>
<p>A lawyer would start by asking some helper questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the proxy meet the definition of an AI system?</li>
<li>Can the proxy be classified as a high-risk AI system?</li>
<li>Will the proxy process personal or sensitive data?</li>
</ol>
<p>But in a single response, GPT-4 couldn’t both break down the question and answer it. The former task requires a high-level analysis of the document, and the latter - low-level focus on details.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>We split answering the question into subtasks.</p>
<p>The rough idea is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make GPT-4 figure out which subquestions it should ask; then</li>
<li>Answer each subquestion independently; and</li>
<li>Aggregate the findings into a single response.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-down-the-question">Breaking Down the Question</h3>
<p>To answer a legal question based on a single regulation, GPT-4 must first find the relevant sections. It requires high-level reasoning across the entire document.</p>
<p>We discovered that GPT-4 can complete this task well, provided you prompt it carefully. All the standard prompt engineering guidelines apply. Crucial were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structuring the document with Markdown.</strong> Without it, reasoning over 80,000 tokens wouldn’t work.</li>
<li><strong>Roleplaying.</strong> We framed the task as a senior lawyer planning out work for a junior lawyer.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/give-the-model-time-to-think"><strong>Tokens to “think.”</strong></a> We gave the model space to produce internal notes about the task - like how it understands the user’s question - before asking for the plan itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>We designed the output so it corresponds to a list of subquestions required to answer the main question. Each point is self-contained; it includes specific instructions and references to sections of the document. If a lawyer looked at any single step, they could carry it out themselves.</p>
<p>Here’s what GPT-4 gave us:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="plan-for-the-junior-lawyer">Plan for the Junior Lawyer</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify Relevant High-Risk Categories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Analyze <strong>Annex III</strong> for high-risk AI systems to see if the language model fits under any listed categories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Examine Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Look at <strong>Articles 8-15</strong> to understand general requirements for high-risk AI systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>…</li>
</ol>
<p><em>(The other 7 points truncated for brevity. Full plan <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/9ba6cf3e172f38b288dc1705ecde9967">here</a>, and the prompt <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/6ef19e197feec9e4ce42c3b6994a919d">here</a>.)</em></p>
</div>

<p>The quality of the plans still surprises me. When we analyzed them for questions from actual lawyers, we found that GPT-4 generally covers all necessary subquestions.</p>
<h3 id="answering-subquestions">Answering Subquestions</h3>
<p>The plan is executed by a simple AI agent. In fact, just a single conversation that GPT-4 has with itself.</p>
<p>GPT-4 is prompted with instructions to assume the role of a “master agent” tasked with answering a legal question based on the pre-generated plan. It can delegate subquestions to “junior lawyers” - in fact, separate GPT-4 chats - by calling <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">functions</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example function call:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="js"><span><span><span>AnnexAnalysis</span>({
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"task"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Analyze Annex III for high-risk AI systems to see if the language model fits under any listed categories."</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"annexes"</span><span>:</span> [<span>"Annex III"</span>],
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"legal_question"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Does the deployment of an LLM acting as a proxy to optimize SQL queries fall within the regulatory scope of the EU's AI Act?"</span>
</span></span><span><span>})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We convert such calls into prompts that contain the task, the question, the specified parts of the regulation, and instructions to carry out the task. Whatever GPT-4 outputs is fed back into the master chat as the junior lawyer’s answer.</p>
<p>We preprocess the regulation so that when a call contains a reference to “Annex III,” we know which pages to put into the “junior lawyer’s” prompt. This is the LLM-based RAG I mentioned in the introduction.</p>
<p>Compared to analyzing the entire AI Act, GPT-4’s reasoning is massively boosted when it’s given a clear task and a short context. With a 5k-token-long prompt, you can even usually trust the LLM to correctly quote the source, which is useful to a user verifying the final answer.</p>
<p>We implemented the master AI agent as a while loop. It goes on as long as GPT-4 calls functions, going through the plan step by step. Eventually, after all subquestions are answered, it outputs the final answer in a format we can detect with a regex. We then break the loop and return the answer to the user.</p>
<p>You can see the final answer <a href="https://hotseatai.com/ans/does-the-development-and-deployment-of-q_2azysfQoPxFksVXKW8TYw2TGT79#legal-trace">here</a>, in the “Legal trace” section.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/58ccf2d104c0fe9a8f7bde585d304d59">the master prompt</a> along with <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/004b8e90ca55e5c6f8f83e3eb603cf01">function definitions</a>, and here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/d19137accea33fc4a0105f94f7f296c0">the junior lawyer’s prompt</a>.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-limitations">Results and Limitations</h2>
<p>Answering a question this way takes 5 to 10 minutes and costs about $2 with GPT-4.</p>
<p>The highlight of testing the system with dozens of lawyers was when a GDPR specialist reviewed its answers. The lawyer ranked 8 out of 10 responses as excellent, and the remaining 2 as overly cautious in interpreting the law.</p>
<p>However, over the long term, we found that GPT-4 can identify subquestions very well but often can’t answer them correctly. In non-trivial scenarios, it makes logical errors.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Lawyers also told us that when they answer a question, they rarely touch upon a single regulation. Not only do they analyze multiple regulations, but they also take into account supporting documents such as various guidelines, regulatory technical standards, and court rulings. In contrast, this system can only process a single document at a time.</p>
<p>We’ve learned that the combination of high latency, faulty reasoning, and limited document scope kills usage. No lawyer wants to expend effort to ask a detailed question, wait 10 minutes for an answer, wade through a 2-pages-long response, and find that the AI made an error.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Keeping all the limitations in mind, dividing complex jobs into simple tasks improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs dramatically.</p>
<p>While the system isn’t directly useful for lawyers yet, the underlying architecture can be generalized to other problems. If less-than-perfect reasoning and high latency are acceptable, you could use it to answer arbitrary questions about arbitrary documents.</p>
<p>If solving such problems is interesting to you, we’re looking for another co-founder. We’re still early, but we’ve learned a ton about how lawyers do legal research. Our next steps will be focused on semantic search that actually works, helping law firms navigate through thousands of legal documents.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> If you’d like to build a meaningful product in the legal tech space, please check out our <a href="https://go.gkk.dev/request-for-cofounder">request for a co-founder</a>. We’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">In late 2020, Dr. Debby Day said her bosses at Cigna gave her a stark warning. Work faster, or the company might fire her.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">That was a problem for Day because she felt her work was too important to be rushed. She was a medical director for the health insurer, a physician with sweeping power to approve or reject requests to pay for critical care like life-saving drugs or complex surgeries.</p>
        
    
                    

<figure data-pp-id="3" data-pp-blocktype="embed">

    


                        
            
    
<figcaption>
    
    
    
    </figcaption>


</figure>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">She had been working at Cigna for nearly 15 years, reviewing cases that nurses had flagged for denial or were unsure about. At Cigna and other insurers, nurses can greenlight payments, but denials have such serious repercussions for patients that many states require that doctors make the final call. In more recent years, though, Day said that the Cigna nurses’ work was getting sloppy. Patient files that nurses working in the Philippines sent to her, she said, increasingly had errors that could lead to wrongful denials if they were not corrected.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Day was, in her own words, persnickety. If a nurse recommended denying coverage for a cancer patient or a sick baby, she wanted to be certain it was the right thing to do. So Day said she researched guidelines, read medical studies and scrutinized patient medical records to come to the best decision. This took time. She was clearing fewer cases than many of her peers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Some of her colleagues quickly denied requests to keep pace, she said. All a Cigna doctor had to do was cut and paste the denial language that the nurse had prepared and quickly move on to the next case, Day said. This was so common, she and another former medical director said, that people inside Cigna had a term for these kinds of speedy decisions: “click and close.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">“Deny, deny, deny. That’s how you hit your numbers,” said Day, who worked for Cigna until the late spring of 2022. “If you take a breath or think about any of these cases, you’re going to fall behind.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">In a written response to questions, Cigna said its medical directors are not allowed to “rubber stamp” a nurse’s recommendation for denial. In all cases, the company wrote, it expects its doctors to “perform thorough, objective, independent and accurate reviews in accordance with our coverage policies.” The company said it was unaware of the use of the term “click and close” and that “such behavior would not be tolerated.”</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">During Day’s final years at Cigna, the company meticulously tracked the output of its medical directors on a monthly dashboard. Cigna shared this spreadsheet with more than 70 of its doctors, allowing them to compare their tally of cases with those of their peers. Day and two other former medical directors said the dashboard sent a message loud and clear: Cigna valued speed. (ProPublica and The Capitol Forum found these other former Cigna doctors independently; Day did not refer them.) One of Day’s managers in a written performance evaluation called the spreadsheet the “productivity dashboard.”</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Measuring the speed and output of employees is common in many industries, from fast food to package delivery, but the use of these kinds of metrics in health care is controversial because the stakes are so high. It’s one thing if a rushed server forgets the fries with your burger. It’s another entirely if the pressure to act fast leads to wrongful denials of payment for vital care. <a href="https://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/news-media/press-releases/2022/walgreens-sharpens-focus-on-patient-care-and-experience-eliminating-task-based-metrics-for-pharmacy-staff-performance-reviews-chainwide">Walgreens in 2022 dropped measurements of its pharmacists’ speed</a> from their performance reviews after some alleged that practice could <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/walgreens-will-stop-judging-pharmacy-staff-fast-work-rcna54297">lead to dangerous mistakes</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">ProPublica and The Capitol Forum examined Cigna’s productivity dashboards for medical directors from January and February 2022. These spreadsheets tallied the number of cases each medical director handled. Cigna gave each task a “handle time,” which the company said was the average amount of time it took its medical directors to issue a decision.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Day and others said the number was something different: the maximum amount of time they should spend on a case. Insurers often require approval in advance for expensive procedures or medicines, a process known as prior authorization. The early 2022 dashboards listed a handle time of four minutes for a prior authorization. The bulk of drug requests were to be decided in two to five minutes. Hospital discharge decisions were supposed to take four and a half minutes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">“Medical directors would message me and say, ‘We can’t do these cases in four minutes. Not if you want to do a good job,’” Day recalled.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">As ProPublica and The Capitol Forum reported last year, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims">Cigna built a computer program that allowed its medical directors to deny certain claims in bulk</a>. The insurer’s doctors spent an average of just 1.2 seconds on each of those cases. Cigna at the time said the review system was created to speed up approval of claims for certain routine screenings; the company later <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/pxdx">posted a rebuttal</a> to the story. A congressional committee and the Department of Labor launched inquiries into this Cigna program. A spokesperson for <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001159-cathy-mcmorris-rodgers">Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers</a>, the chair of the congressional committee, said Rodgers continues to monitor the situation after Cigna shared some details about its process. The Labor Department is still examining such practices.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">One figure on Cigna’s January and February 2022 dashboards was like a productivity score; the news organizations found that this number reflects the pace at which a medical director clears cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Cigna said it was incorrect to call that figure on its dashboard a productivity score and said its “view on productivity is defined by a range of factors beyond elements included in a single spreadsheet.” In addition, the company told the news organizations, “The copy of the dashboard that you have is inaccurate and secondary calculations made using its contents may also be inaccurate.” The news organizations asked what was inaccurate, but the company wouldn’t elaborate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Nevertheless, Cigna said that because the dashboard created “inadvertent confusion” the company was “reassessing its use.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Day was afraid to look at the dashboards. Anyone could see that by Cigna’s measures, she was a laggard. In January 2022, only a third of her peers had lower scores, and in February 2022, it was just a quarter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">In a recorded phone call and in emails with supervisors, Day complained that Cigna’s metrics failed to account for the quality of decisions. She said she and others asked higher-ups how often medical director decisions were overturned on appeal but nobody would say.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Day gave Cigna written permission to discuss her employment with ProPublica and The Capitol Forum.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">The company described Day as a “disgruntled former employee” and said her “personal view is not an accurate representation of the work of the many medical directors and clinicians we employ.” Cigna added that prior authorization requests are often time-sensitive and the company’s “mission is to ensure our patients receive the right care as quickly as possible.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">Cigna rejected the assertions that denying cases was an effective way of working faster. “Even if medical directors were incentivized to review more claims — which they are not — it makes no sense to suggest that this incentivizes denials; it would be far quicker to approve all claims,” the company spokesperson wrote. The insurer said that denials take more time because they require a deeper review of clinical data, potentially requesting additional reviews by senior clinical directors, drafting denial letters and possibly phoning the treating physicians.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">But another doctor who had worked at Cigna also said that denying a request for payment was far quicker than approving one since the nurses served up language that could be used to justify the denial. That former Cigna medical director said, “Sometimes you just have to accept the nurse and click and close if you had too much work.” (That doctor asked not to be named because they feared repercussions if they commented publicly.)</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">When Debby Day got her job at Cigna in November 2005, she thought it was a godsend.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">She had been working for a health insurance startup in North Carolina. The charismatic founder of the company, Day said, had told her and a handful of principal executives to expect a windfall when the company went public. That never happened, and Day was eventually left with no job and no severance.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">When a recruiter mentioned the medical director job at Cigna, it sounded like a perfect fit. The job was based in North Carolina, but Cigna didn’t mind that she was licensed in California, where she did her residency at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. She was ready to leave the executive track, and the position allowed her to put her medical training to good use without the daily grind of working in a clinic.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">The daughter of an ophthalmologist, Day had watched her father perform eye surgery when she was a child, and she found medicine fascinating. When Day started practicing, she learned quickly that while she enjoyed the intellectual challenges of medicine, the hands-on work of seeing patients drained her. As a medical director, she said, “I could really take care of patients without having to talk to them all day long.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">Cigna, like all health insurers, makes patients get approval in advance for certain treatments. Day became one of the people who reviewed these prior authorization requests, deciding what to cover and what to deny. Everyone Day worked with was under one roof in Raleigh, North Carolina. The office buzzed with conversations among colleagues, and she was able to consult with specialists on complex cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">She never felt pressure to do anything but make the right decision for the patient. At the same time, she said, she didn’t hesitate to reject treatment she thought was improper.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">A couple years into her time at Cigna, Day noticed some doctors prescribing a costly treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG, that helps patients with weakened immune systems fight off infections. Only she found they were prescribing it in cases where it didn’t make any medical sense. That wasn’t good for patients or for Cigna. “Some of these guys were pouring it into every patient they could get their hands on and then making hundreds of thousands of dollars billing for it,” she recalled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">At the time, Cigna didn’t have a policy for when IVIG should be used, so Day developed one based on the scientific evidence available at the time. Day said this saved millions of dollars and that Cigna rewarded her with bonuses and stock options.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">“In my head I truly believed that you could marry good health care with business,” she said.</p>

<hr>

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">As Day neared the end of her first decade at Cigna, the company closed regional offices in favor of a nationwide review system, she said. With medical directors working from home, Day could no longer pop down the hallway to consult with doctors in other specialities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Cigna had used a productivity dashboard for years, but by 2019, these metrics began playing a more prominent role in the company’s evaluations of medical directors, Day said. Now, making a fast decision seemed more important than making the right decision, she said. In February 2019 emails to her managers, Day openly questioned this system.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Her boss responded: “We all understand that many cases are involved and take more time,” he wrote. “We have tried to account for that additional time in the allotment allowed for certain cases.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Still, he made it clear that transaction volume — the metric on the dashboard that was similar to a productivity score — was one of the factors “we use to determine merit raises, bonus” and stock awards. When asked about this, Cigna said that “any assertion that our Medical Directors’ compensation (cash or stock) is tied to denials or their handle time for cases is false.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">In that same 2019 email, Day’s boss added, “We want to assist every medical director who wishes to improve his or her efficiency.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.1">Day shot back, “Some of our newer MDs are quite terrified of the ‘counting,’” she wrote. “All ask — ‘how is quality measured?’”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.2">Soon, Day realized that her boss wasn’t talking in the abstract about improving efficiency; he was talking about her. She learned that managers were going to help her pick up the pace of her reviews.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.3">When bosses reached out, they didn’t discuss whether she was making the right call, only how long it took her to decide, she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">By then, Day said, Cigna had shifted much of the nursing work to the Philippines. She found mistakes in the case files that these nurses sent. In an email to Day, a fellow medical director lamented the amount of time it took to untangle one case and said the reports by “the overseas nurses” were “messes.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Some of the more astonishing problems that Day spotted have stayed with her. In a case involving a newborn who needed an epilepsy evaluation, Day noticed that a Cigna nurse had listed the mother’s name as the patient, rather than the baby’s. Day fixed that mistake, avoiding what certainly would have been a denial. In another case, a nurse recommended denying payment for an ultrasound of the neck because the treatment wasn’t medically necessary. But the nurse had gotten the body part wrong. It was a hip that was injured, and the imaging was needed. An appeal that landed on Day’s desk involved Cigna’s decision to reject payment for a test because it wasn’t medically necessary for a patient with a sexually transmitted disease. But Day figured out that the patient had toenail fungus, not an STD.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Day said her bosses didn’t want to hear that she was catching errors. By October 2020, Cigna had placed Day on a performance improvement plan that required her to raise her “productivity level” — referring to the score on the dashboard — to at least 70%, which would be a significant jump for her but was slightly below the median for medical directors. The company made the consequences crystal clear: If she failed to successfully complete the plan, she could be terminated.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">ProPublica and The Capitol Forum asked Cigna how it calculated that score, but the company wouldn’t say. “Transaction volume helps gauge productivity and efficiency — the amount of work done, not the speed at which it is done,” a Cigna spokesperson wrote. The company said this metric measured the time a medical director spent on tasks involving medical judgment versus other work, such as internal meetings or training.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">On the early 2022 productivity dashboard, though, a different calculation could explain Day’s score, and this math reflects how fast medical directors reviewed cases. ProPublica and The Capitol Forum multiplied the number of cases Day handled by the time Cigna allotted for each type of case, then divided that total by the hours she worked that month. The resulting percentage equaled her score. Medical directors who spent every available minute of their workdays clearing cases within the time constraints Cigna set would score at least 100%. Indeed, some medical directors had scores greater than 100%, meaning they cleared cases in even less than the allotted time. The newsrooms’ formula accurately reproduced the scores of 87% of the Cigna doctors listed; the scores of all but one of the rest fell within 1 to 2 percentage points of the number generated by this formula. When asked about this formula, Cigna said it may be inaccurate but didn’t elaborate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">Day said her bosses told her that the way to boost her score was to review more cases during her normal work hours.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">Responding to questions, Cigna said the productivity dashboard was “primarily used to ensure that we have enough medical directors to perform the amount and type of work that needs to be done.” It is not used, the company said, to evaluate the performance of medical directors or track the speed at which individual doctors do their work.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Cigna, however, later said of the dashboard that “in the unusual situation that a medical director is a significant outlier to peers performing similar types of reviews, managers might use this metric as one data point to understand and discuss the variance with the medical director.” It also said Day was placed on a performance improvement plan “to help her meet the most basic standards to support patient care.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">During the time Day spent on the performance improvement plan, she refused to change her approach, which she felt was necessary to make the right call.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">In December 2020, she appealed to the human resources department, figuring that colleagues there would see that it was wrong to fire a medical director for taking care to decide critical medical questions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">She was wrong.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">“You feel that the time constraints/metrics, which are in place to review these cases are unreasonable, for some cases are very complex consisting of multiple pages to review,” a Cigna human resources employee wrote, summing up Day’s feelings as the matter escalated.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">And while Day’s supervisor “appreciates your attention to detail,” the human resources employee wrote, he “also realizes that there are metrics in place that he must hold everyone to.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">When asked about this, Cigna said, “Dr. Day raised questions about her performance improvement plan through appropriate internal ethics channels available to all employees, and there was no wrongdoing found.”</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">Eventually, the daily stress of being pushed to work faster coupled with the threat of being fired took a toll on Day. Sleepless and fighting depression, Day was at the breaking point.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.1">“I actually sort of had a mental breakdown,” she recalled.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.2">The supervisor said he heard Day’s concerns “loud and clear” but warned that “at the end of the day, we need to get your productivity up and we don’t have a lot of time to do that.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">The focus on metrics was proof Cigna was losing its way, Day told her boss. When she started working at Cigna 15 years earlier, there was a “commitment to quality and taking care of our customers.” Day said that it was still important to her and other medical directors that “we go home at the end of the day and think we’ve done a good job for Cigna.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">In a response to questions, Cigna said the supervisor, who works in California, was unaware that he was being recorded and that under that state’s laws, it is illegal to record a private phone call without all parties’ consent. Day said that she was in North Carolina during the call and that North Carolina law allows a person on a call to record without getting the consent of others.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">Day took a monthslong leave from the job in mid-2021 that allowed her to work part time, and she found a therapist who helped her manage the depression. When she returned, Day said, it was more of the same.</p>

                                    <p>Prefixes are treacherous little beasts. Just when you think you've come to an understanding, prefixes such as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-"><em>in</em>-</a> will come along and carry meanings such as “not,” “in, within,” “into,” “toward,” or “put into or onto.” And to make things worse, some of the beginnings of words which appear to be prefixes aren’t prefixes at all, even if they seem to function in the same manner. </p>

<p>Why are we bringing this up? Well, we didn’t want to tell you in this way, but we didn’t want you to hear it from someone else, either. There’s a new sense of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonplussed"><em>nonplussed</em></a> that people have been using, and…well, we’d just like to give you fair warning in case our descriptivist nature causes us to take action. This new sense appears to stem from a mistaken belief that the first three letters of <em>nonplus</em> are there to indicate that someone is something other than “plussed” (although what being plussed would entail here remains a mystery). </p>

We'll never know.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It’s somewhat questionable whether the <em>non</em> in <em>nonplus</em> is actually a prefix at all; the word came into English in the 16th century, and was taken from the Latin <em>non plus</em>, which means “no more.” When it first appeared in our language it was used as a noun, with the meaning of “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quandary">quandary</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was then, and is now, the answere to that friuolous obiection, and this is the Nonplus that the Libeller vaunteth of.<br>—Thomas Cooper, <em>An Admonition to the People of England</em>, 1589</p>
  
  <p>I am brought to a nonplus, O Lorde what shall I saie?<br>—Edward Hutchins, <em>Davids Sling Against Great Goliath</em>, 1593</p>
  
  <p>So that now we are much beholding to M. Deacon, and M. Walker, that haue put all fooles and mad men to a perpetuall non plus, whose tongues would otherwise continually bee tampring.<br>—John Darrel, <em>The Replie of Iohn Darrel</em>, 1602</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the early 17th century <em>nonplus</em> was being used as a verb, with the meaning of “to cause to be at a loss as to what to say, think, or do.” Then, as now, the word is often encountered in its participial form (<em>nonplussed</em>), with a meaning that is nearly synonymous with “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perplexed">perplexed</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here may the Non-plust wooer fetch a wile 
  <br>To breake all Remora's, plots to beguile 
  <br>All Fortune's crosses: and if language faile, 
  <br>Here may he learne to court, triumph, bewaile 
  <br>I'th eloquentest straines.<br>—Achilles Tatius, <em>The Loves of Clitophon and Leucippe</em>, 1638</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the next three hundred and some years <em>nonplus</em> remained on the straight and narrow, avoiding the temptations of demon rum and semantic drift, and as a result of this managed to keep its meaning remarkably unchanged. And then in the early 20th century some people began to use <em>nonplus</em> to mean “unruffled, unconcerned,” and ever since then the word just hasn’t been the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I came just in time to see two policemen pushing the car to one side so that the firewagon could get near the plug.
  <br>Of course anyone knows that under very embarrassing circumstances one is to appear non-plussed, as they say, and smoke a cigarette.<br>—<em>The Pittston Gazette</em> (Pittston, PA), 15 Aug. 1930</p>
  
  <p>The onlooker at the right appears nonplussed at the game the posters offer, but then—she’s only a mannequin.<br>—<em>The Mason City Globe-Gazette</em> (Mason City, IA), 16 Apr. 1948</p>
  
  <p>Twelve-year-old E. B. “Buzzie” Barker Jr. remained nonplussed yesterday despite the attention and congratulations that he was receiving for having won the Peninsula’s Soap Box Derby Sunday.
  <br>”I think we are more excited than he is,” his mother, Mrs. Barton Barker, commented. “He is just about as unconcerned about the whole thing,” she said, but didn’t finish.<br>—<em>Daily Press</em> (Newport News, VA), 28 Jun. 1955</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “unruffled” sense of <em>nonplussed</em> increased as the 20th century went on, although when it was noticed this sense has been categorically rejected as a mistake. Mistake it may well be, but the fact remains that this sense of the word is in widespread use today, and may be found often enough in well regarded and highly edited, publications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While senior officials in the Israeli Foreign Ministry fume over the diplomatic mess caused by the implications of the Dubai assassinations, those who know Mr Dagan say he is nonplussed by the row.<br>—<em>The Times</em> (London, UK), 18 Feb. 2010</p>
  
  <p>There is also the stumbling conversation of the other blind novitiates,but we are all really dependent on the voice of our guide, Romeo Edmead, a vigorous, charming man, completely nonplussed by the tumult we find around us.<br>—Edward Rothstein, <em>The New York Times</em>, 19 Aug. 2011</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a lesson here, it is that you should never trust prefixes (or anything that looks like one). It may leave you <em>nonplussed</em>.</p>

<p><em>Posted 2019-04-01.</em></p>
<p>TLDR: <a href="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/2019.pdf">read the paper</a> and <a href="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters.html">view the gallery of pretty Perl programs</a>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we aim to answer a long-standing open problem in the programming languages community: <em>is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl?</em></p>
<p>We answer this question in the affirmative: it <strong>is possible</strong> to smear paint on the wall without creating a valid Perl program. We employ an empirical approach, using optical character recognition (OCR) software, which finds that merely 93% of paint splatters parse as valid Perl. We analyze the properties of paint-splatter Perl programs, and present seven examples of paint splatters which are not valid Perl programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1095706032448393217"><img alt="Screenshot of a Twitter conversation. Adrienne Porter Felt says: &quot;I don't want to teach my kid to code. I want him to splash in muddy puddles and smear paint on the walls and read novels under the covers way too late at night. I grew up too soon and wish I'd had more time to be a kid. Why do schools teach vocational skills so young these days?&quot; Jake Archibald replies: &quot;but is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl?&quot;" src="https://www.mcmillen.dev/media/20190401-sigbovik-tweet.png"></a></p>
<p>Accepted for publication at SIGBOVIK 2019, held April 1st 2019 in Pittsburgh. Winner of a Unwitting Participation Ribbon, “an unwelcome brand we’ve affixed to each paper determined after careful scrutiny to have included a genuine artifact, thereby furthering the admirable causes of open science and fruitful procrastination.”</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters.html">all the paint splatters</a> on a single page, along with the valid Perl source code corresponding to each. “Not valid” is written in red for those images which did not parse as valid Perl programs. If different OCR settings recognized multiple valid Perl programs, I chose the one that seemed the most “interesting”, according to my own aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters.tar.gz">tarball of 100 paint-splatter images</a> that were used as the main dataset for this paper.</p>
<p><strong>(source code not available yet because i am bad at GitHub)</strong></p>
<h2 id="errata">Errata</h2>
<p>There are a few paint splatter Perl programs that I didn’t recognize as “interesting” until after the SIGBOVIK submission deadline. For example, this splatter is recognized by OCR as the string <code>lerzfijglpFiji-j</code>, which evaluates to the number <code>0</code> in Perl:</p>
<p><img alt="paint splatter" src="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters/6b78f8696b05f9322b2dda21b6932776.jpg"></p>
<p>The image below is recognized as the string <code>-*?</code>, which also evaluates to the number <code>0</code> in Perl:</p>
<p><img alt="paint splatter" src="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters/e47b8463b359906947c66ec4c852a2a3.jpg"></p>
<p>Another surprising program is shown below; OCR recognizes this image as the string <code>;i;c;;#\\?z{;?;;fn':.;</code>, which evaluates to the string <code>c</code> in Perl:</p>
<p><img alt="paint splatter" src="https://www.mcmillen.dev/sigbovik/splatters/803dd5a54c42ed93462c78ad7da357b0.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, this image is recognized as the string <code>;E,'__'</code>, which evaluates to the string <code>E__</code> in Perl:</p>

<li>Uses the <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/" rel="nofollow">ReAct agent</a> to plan and execute a query given the tools provided. This type of agent can reason over which of the tools to use next to further the response, feed inputs into the selected tool, and repeat the process with the output until it determines that the answer is satisfactory.</li>
<li>Current tool suite:
While we didn't emphasize equipping the agent with many tools, we hope to see memary help agents in the community equipped with a vast array of tools covering multi-modalities.
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Location</strong> - determines the user's current location and nearby surroundings using geocoder and googlemaps.</li>
<li><strong>CV</strong> - answers a query based on a provided image using gpt-4-vision-preview.</li>

<li>KGs vs other knowledge stores
<ul dir="auto">
<li>KGs provide more depth of essential context that can be easily retrieved.</li>
<li>The knowledge store's graph structure allows information to be centered around certain entities and their relationships with other entities, thus ensuring that the context of the information is relevant.</li>
<li>KGs are more adept at handling complex queries, as the varying relationships between different entities in the query can provide insight into how to join multiple subgraphs together.</li>

<li>memary uses a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.18059.pdf" rel="nofollow">recursive retrieval</a> approach to search the KG, which involves determining what the key entities are in the query, building a subgraph of those entities with a maximum depth of 2 away, and finally using that subgraph to build up the context.</li>
<li>When faced with multiple key entities in a query, memary uses <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/knowledge-graphs-llms-multi-hop-question-answering/" rel="nofollow">multi-hop</a> reasoning to join multiple subgraphs into a larger subgraph to search through.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>What is the memory module?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The memory module comprises the Memory Stream and Entity Knowledge Store. The memory module was influenced by the design of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06318.pdf" rel="nofollow">K-LaMP</a> proposed by Microsoft Research.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The Memory Stream captures all entities inserted into the KG and their associated timestamps. This stream reflects the breadth of the users' knowledge, i.e., concepts users have had exposure to but no depth of exposure is inferred.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Timeline Analysis: Map out a timeline of interactions, highlighting moments of high engagement or shifts in topic focus. This helps in understanding the evolution of the user's interests over time.</li>
<li>Extract Themes: Look for recurring themes or topics within the interactions. This thematic analysis can help anticipate user interests or questions even before they are explicitly stated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Entity Knowledge Store tracks the frequency and recency of references to each entity stored in the memory stream. This knowledge store reflects users' depth of knowledge, i.e., concepts they are more familiar with than others.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Rank Entities by Relevance: Use both frequency and recency to rank entities. An entity frequently mentioned (high count) and referenced recently is likely of high importance, and the user is well aware of this concept.</li>
<li>Categorize Entities: Group entities into categories based on their nature or the context in which they're mentioned (e.g., technical terms, personal interests). This categorization aids in quickly accessing relevant information tailored to the user's inquiries.</li>
<li>Highlight Changes Over Time: Identify any significant changes in the entities' ranking or categorization over time. A shift in the most frequently mentioned entities could indicate a change in the user's interests or knowledge.</li>
<li>Additional information on the memory modules can be found <a href="https://github.com/seyeong-han/KnowledgeGraphRAG">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Purpose in larger system
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compress/summarize the top N ranked entities in the entity knowledge store and pass to the LLM’s finite context window alongside the agent's response and chat history for inference.</li>
<li>Personalize Responses: Use the key categorized entities and themes associated with the user to tailor agent responses more closely to the user's current interests and knowledge level/expertise.</li>
<li>Anticipate Needs: Leverage trends and shifts identified in the summaries to anticipate users' future questions or needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future contributions
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We currently extract the top N entities from the entitiy knowledge store and pass these entities into the context window for inference. memary can future benefit from more advanced memory compression techniques such as passing only entities that are in the agent's response to the context window. We look forward to related community contributions.</li>

<p dir="auto">Currently memary is structured so that the ReAct agent can only process one query at a time. We hope to see <strong>multiprocessing</strong> integrated so that the agent can process many subqueries simultaneously. We expect this to improve the relevancy and accuracy of responses. The source code for both decomposing the query and reranking the many agent responses has been provided, and once multiprocessing has been added to the system, these components can easily be integrated into the main <code>ChatAgent</code> class.

<p dir="auto">What is query decomposition?</p>
<ul dir="auto">

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Why decompose?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>User queries are complex and multifaceted, and base-model LLMs are often unable to fully understand all aspects of the query in order to create a succinct and accurate response.</li>
<li>Allows an LLM of similar capabilities to answer easier questions and synthesize those answers to provide an improved response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">How it works</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Initially, a LlamaIndex fine-tuned query engine approach was taken. However, the LangChain query engine was found to be faster and easier to use. LangChain’s <code>PydanticToolsParser</code> framework was used. The query_engine_with_examples has been given 87 pre-decomposed queries (complex query + set of subqueries) to determine a pattern. Users can invoke the engine with individual queries or collate them into a list and invoke them by batch.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">Individual Invocation: <code>sub_qs = query_analyzer_with_examples.invoke( {"question": "What is 2 + 2? Why is it not 3?"} )</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Batch Invocation:
<code>questions = [ "Where can I buy a Macbook Pro with an M3 chip? What is the difference to the M2 chip? How much more expensive is  the M3?", "How can I buy tickets to the upcoming NBA game? What is the price of lower bowl seats versus nosebleeds? What is the view like at either seat?", "Between a Macbook and a Windows machine, which is better for systems engineering? Which chips are most ideal? What is the price difference between the two?",] </code></p>

<p dir="auto">Purpose in larger system</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In a parallel system, the agent will be able to parse multiple queries at once. The query decomposer (QD) will pass all subqueries (or original query if no subqueries exist) to the agent at once.</li>
<li>Simultaneously, QD will pass the original query to the reranking module to rerank the agent responses based on their relevance to the pre-decomposed query.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>What is reranking?
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Reranking is the process of scoring nodes based on their relevancy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why rerank agent responses?
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ensure that the various responses to subqueries, when merged, are relevant to the original query prior to decomposition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our Approach
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We benchmarked three models to determine which one would best work for reranking: BM25 Reranking Fusion, Cohere Rerank, and ColBERT Rerank. After testing BM25, it was clear that the model was not able to classify the different responses and provide a simple merged answer. Instead of answering the question, it combined all the information on the page, introducing irrelevant information.</li>
<li>Next, when testing out Cohere, the model performed better than BM25 but was still not classifying the paragraphs well. The reranking was not always accurate, as it performed well for some questions but was not able to rank others. Furthermore, the ranking was still pretty inaccurate, performing between 0.25 - 0.5 out of 1.</li>
<li>Finally, we tested ColBERT rerank, and it was found that this model performed best compared to the other two. ColBERT was able to synthesize results from the given data and ranked them very accurately, with reranking scores between 0.6 - 0.7 out of 1. With this, ColBERT had the most potential, being able to determine which responses were most related and important to answering the query.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purpose in larger system
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Passes the reranking result to the knowledge graph for storage and to the model as one source of context for inference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future contributions
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Once agent multiprocessing is integrated, reranking can be integrated into the <code>ChatAgent</code> class.</li>
<li>Future Benchmarking: Include the Cohere Rerank 3 model and others in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHzvgktqnHcg7wbIuKHr6W5NMYk6UVlJkRQfSqzk9e4/edit" rel="nofollow">reranking analysis</a>.

<p dir="auto">Angle-grinder allows you to parse, aggregate, sum, average, min/max, percentile, and sort your data. You can see it, live-updating, in your terminal. Angle grinder is designed for when, for whatever reason, you don't have your data in graphite/honeycomb/kibana/sumologic/splunk/etc. but still want to be able to do sophisticated analytics.</p>
<p dir="auto">Angle grinder can process well above 1M rows per second (simple pipelines as high as 5M), so it's usable for fairly meaty aggregation. The results will live update in your terminal as data is processed. Angle grinder is a bare bones functional programming language coupled with a pretty terminal UI.</p>

<p dir="auto">An angle grinder query is composed of filters followed by a series of operators.
The filters select the lines from the input stream to be transformed by the operators.
Typically, the initial operators will transform the data in some way by parsing fields or JSON from the log line.
The subsequent operators can then aggregate or group the data via operators like <code>sum</code>, <code>average</code>, <code>percentile</code>, etc.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="agrind '<filter1> [... <filterN>] | operator1 | operator2 | operator3 | ...'"><pre>agrind <span><span>'</span>&lt;filter1&gt; [... &lt;filterN&gt;] | operator1 | operator2 | operator3 | ...<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A simple query that operates on JSON logs and counts the number of logs per level could be:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="agrind '* | json | count by log_level'"><pre>agrind <span><span>'</span>* | json | count by log_level<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Escaping Field Names</h3><a id="user-content-escaping-field-names" aria-label="Permalink: Escaping Field Names" href="#escaping-field-names"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Field names containing spaces, periods, or quotes must be escaped using <code>["&lt;FIELD&gt;"]</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="agrind '* | json | count by [&quot;date received&quot;], [&quot;grpc.method&quot;]"><pre>agrind <span><span>'</span>* | json | count by ["date received"], ["grpc.method"]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Filters</h3><a id="user-content-filters" aria-label="Permalink: Filters" href="#filters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are three basic filters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>*</code>: Match all logs</li>
<li><code>filter-me*</code> (with no quotes) is a case-insensitive match that can include wildcards</li>
<li>"filter-me" (in quotes) is a case-sensitive match (no wildcards, <code>*</code> matches literal <code>*</code>
, <code>filter-me</code>, or <code>"filter me!"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Filters can be combined with <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> and <code>NOT</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(&quot;ERROR&quot; OR WARN*) AND NOT staging | count"><pre lang="agrind"><code>("ERROR" OR WARN*) AND NOT staging | count
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Sub-expressions <em>must</em> be grouped in parenthesis. Only lines that match all filters will be passed to the subsequent operators.

<p dir="auto">Starting with v0.12.0, angle grinder supports aliases, pre-built pipelines do simplify common tasks or formats. The only alias currently defined is <code>apache</code>, which parses apache logs. Adding more <code>aliases</code> is one of the easiest ways to <a href="#contributing">contribute</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Examples</em>:</p>

<p dir="auto">These operators have a 1 to 1 correspondence between input data and output data. 1 row in, 0 or 1 rows out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">JSON</h5><a id="user-content-json" aria-label="Permalink: JSON" href="#json"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>json [from other_field]</code>: Extract json-serialized rows into fields for later use. If the row is <em>not</em> valid JSON, then it is dropped. Optionally, <code>from other_field</code> can be

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project: Improving Error Reporting</h4><a id="user-content-project-improving-error-reporting" aria-label="Permalink: Project: Improving Error Reporting" href="#project-improving-error-reporting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Usability can be greatly improved by accurate and helpful error messages for query-related issues.
If you have struggled to figure out why a query is not working correctly and had a hard time
fixing the issue, that would be a good place to jump in and start making changes!</p>
<p dir="auto">First, you need to determine where the problem is occurring.
If the parser is rejecting a query, the grammar may need some tweaking to be more accepting of
some syntax.
For example, if the field names are not provided for the <code>parse</code> operator, the query can still
be parsed to produce a syntax tree and the error can be raised in the next phase.
If the query passes the parsing phase, the problem may lie in the semantic analysis phase where the
values in parse tree are verified for correctness.
Continuing with the <code>parse</code> example, if the number of captures in the pattern string does not
match the number of field names, the error would be raised here.
Finally, if the query has been valid up to this point, you might want to raise an error at
execution time.
For example, if a field name being accessed does not exist in the records being passed to an
operator, an error could be raised to tell the user that they might have mistyped the name.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you have an idea of where the problem might lie, you can start to dig into the code.
The grammar is written using <a href="https://github.com/Geal/nom/">nom</a> and is contained in the
<a href="https://github.com/rcoh/angle-grinder/blob/main/src/lang.rs"><code>lang.rs</code></a> module.
The enums/structs that make up the parse tree are also in the <code>lang.rs</code> module.
To make error reporting easier, values in the parse tree are wrapped with a <code>Positioned</code> object
that records where the value came from in the query string.
The <code>Positioned</code> objects are produced by the <code>with_pos!()</code> parser combinator.
These objects can then be passed to the <code>SnippetBuilder</code> in the
<a href="https://github.com/rcoh/angle-grinder/blob/main/src/errors.rs"><code>errors.rs</code></a> module to highlight
portions of the query string in error messages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The semantic phase is contained in the
<a href="https://github.com/rcoh/angle-grinder/blob/main/src/typecheck.rs"><code>typecheck.rs</code></a> module and
is probably where most of the work will need to be done.
The <code>semantic_analysis()</code> methods in that module are passed an <code>ErrorBuilder</code> that can be used to
build and send error reports to the user.</p>
<p dir="auto">After adjusting the grammar and adding a check for the problem, it will be time to figure out how
to inform the user.
Ideally, any errors should explain the problem, point the user to the relevant part of the query
string, and lead the user to a solution.
Using the <code>ErrorBuilder</code>, you can call the <code>new_error_report_for()</code> method to construct a
<code>SnippetBuilder</code> for a given error.
To highlight a portion of the query string, use the <code>with_code_pointer()</code> method with the
<code>Positioned</code> object that refers to the relevant segment of the query string.
Finally, additional help/examples can be added by calling the <code>with_resolution()</code> method.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you're all done, you should see a nicely formatted error message like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="error: Expecting an expression to count
  |
1 | * | count_distinct
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No field argument given
  |
  = help: example: count_distinct(field_to_count)"><pre><code>error: Expecting an expression to count
  |

  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No field argument given
  |
  = help: example: count_distinct(field_to_count)
</code></pre></div>

                        The "thorium transition", which physicists have been looking for for decades, has now been excited for the first time with lasers. This paves the way for revolutionary high precision technologies, including nuclear clocks.
                    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Physicists have been hoping for this moment for a long time: for many years, scientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state of thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological applications. It could be used, for example, to build an nuclear clock that could measure time more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today. It could also be used to answer completely new fundamental questions in physics - for example, the question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change in space and time.</p><p>Now this hope has come true: the long-sought thorium transition has been found, its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been possible to use a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher energy and then precisely track its return to its original state. This makes it possible to combine two areas of physics that previously had little to do with each other: classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. A crucial prerequisite for this success was the development of special thorium-containing crystals. A research team led by Prof. Thorsten Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now published this success together with a team from the National Metrology Institute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal "Physical Review Letters".</p><h3>Switching quantum states</h3><p>Manipulating atoms or molecules with lasers is commonplace today: if the wavelength of the laser is chosen exactly right, atoms or molecules can be switched from one state to another. In this way, the energies of atoms or molecules can be measured very precisely. Many precision measurement techniques are based on this, such as today's atomic clocks, but also chemical analysis methods. Lasers are also often used in quantum computers to store information in atoms or molecules.</p><p>For a long time, however, it seemed impossible to apply these techniques to atomic nuclei. "Atomic nuclei can also switch between different quantum states. However, it usually takes much more energy to change an atomic nucleus from one state to another – at least a thousand times the energy of electrons in an atom or a molecule," says Thorsten Schumm. "This is why normally atomic nuclei cannot be manipulated with lasers. The energy of the photons is simply not enough."</p><p>This is unfortunate, because atomic nuclei are actually the perfect quantum objects for precision measurements: They are much smaller than atoms and molecules and are therefore much less susceptible to external disturbances, such as electromagnetic fields. In principle, they would therefore allow measurements with unprecedented accuracy.</p><h3>The needle in the haystack</h3><p>Since the 1970s, there has been speculation that there might be a special atomic nucleus which, unlike other nuclei, could perhaps be manipulated with a laser, namely thorium-229. This nucleus has two very closely adjacent energy states – so closely adjacent that a laser should in principle be sufficient to change the state of the atomic nucleus.</p><p>For a long time, however, there was only indirect evidence of the existence of this transition. "The problem is that you have to know the energy of the transition extremely precisely in order to be able to induce the transition with a laser beam," says Thorsten Schumm. "Knowing the energy of this transition to within one electron volt is of little use, if you have to hit the right energy with a precision of one millionth of an electron volt in order to detect the transition.” It is like looking for a needle in a haystack – or trying to find a small treasure chest buried on a kilometer-long island.</p><h3>The thorium crystal trick</h3><p>Some research groups have tried to study thorium nuclei by holding them individually in place in electromagnetic traps. However, Thorsten Schumm and his team chose a completely different technique. "We developed crystals in which large numbers of thorium atoms are incorporated," explains Fabian Schaden, who developed the crystals in Vienna and measured them together with the PTB team. "Although this is technically quite complex, it has the advantage that we can not only study individual thorium nuclei in this way but can hit approximately ten to the power of seventeen thorium nuclei simultaneously with the laser – about a million times more than there are stars in our galaxy." The large number of thorium nuclei amplifies the effect, shortens the required measurement time and increases the probability of actually finding the energy transition.</p><p>On November 21, 2023, the team was finally successful: the correct energy of the thorium transition was hit exactly, the thorium nuclei delivered a clear signal for the first time. The laser beam had actually switched their state. After careful examination and evaluation of the data, the result has now been published.</p><p>"For us, this is a dream coming true," says Thorsten Schumm. Since 2009, Schumm had focused his research entirely on the search for the thorium transition. His group as well as competing teams from all over the world have repeatedly achieved important partial successes in recent years. "Of course we are delighted that we are now the ones who can present the crucial breakthrough: The first targeted laser excitation of an atomic nucleus," says Schumm.</p><h3>The dream of the atomic nucleus clock</h3><p>This marks the start of a new exciting era of research: now that the team knows how to excite the thorium state, this technology can be used for precision measurements. "From the very beginning, building an atomic clock was an important long-term goal," says Thorsten Schumm. "Similar to how a pendulum clock uses the swinging of the pendulum as a timer, the oscillation of the light that excites the thorium transition could be used as a timer for a new type of clock that would be significantly more accurate than the best atomic clocks available today."</p><p>But it is not just time that could be measured much more precisely in this way than before. For example, the Earth's gravitational field could be analyzed so precisely that it could provide indications of mineral resources or earthquakes. The measurement method could also be used to get to the bottom of fundamental mysteries of physics: Are the constants of nature really constant? Or can tiny changes perhaps be measured over time? "Our measuring method is just the beginning," says Thorsten Schumm. "We cannot yet predict what results we will achieve with it. It will certainly be very exciting."</p><h3>Original publication</h3><p>Laser excitation of the Th-229 nucleus, Physical Review Letters:<br><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><p>Full paper (preprint): <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Picture download</h3><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/tu-wien/aktuelles/news/news/bilderdownload" target="_blank">Download pictures provided by TU Wien and PTB<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Further reading</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/die-lange-suche-nach-dem-thorium-uebergang" target="_blank">Historical Background: The Long Search for the Thorium Transition<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/von-atomkern-uhren-und-den-grundkonstanten-der-natur" target="_blank">Applications: Nuclear Clocks and the Fundamental Constants of Nature<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/high-tech-edelsteine-fuer-die-forschung" target="_blank">The Crystal Trick:&nbsp;High-tech Gemstones for Nuclear Science<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Info_Package.pdf" title="thorium" target="_blank">Download full info package (PDF)<span>, opens a file in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Contact</h3><p>Prof. Thorsten Schumm<br> Institute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics<br> TU Wien<br> +43 1 58801 141896<br><span>thorsten.schumm<span>@</span>tuwien.ac.at</span></p><p>Text: Florian Aigner</p></div></div>]]></description>
