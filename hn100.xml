<p>How long is “forever”? When it comes to digital media, forever could be as close as a couple of months away.</p>
<p>Funimation, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/att-sells-crunchyroll-to-sony-for-1-2b-amid-streamlining-efforts/">Sony-owned</a> streaming service for anime, recently <a href="https://help.funimation.com/hc/en-us/articles/23103586580244-Funimation-End-of-services">announced</a> that subscribers' digital libraries on the platform will be unavailable after April 2. For years, Funimation had been<a href="https://help.funimation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046822091-How-long-do-I-get-to-keep-streaming-the-Digital-Copy-videos"> telling subscribers</a> that they could keep streaming these digital copies of purchased movies and shows, but qualifying it: “forever, but there are some restrictions.”</p>
<p>Funimation’s parent company, Sony, bought rival anime streaming service Crunchyroll in 2021. Since then, it was suspected that Sony would merge the offerings together somehow. This week, we learned how, as Funimation announced that its app and website would close on April 2, and Funimation accounts will become Crunchyroll accounts. Most of Funimation’s catalog is already on Crunchyroll, Funimation’s announcement claimed.</p>
<p>But in addition to offering video streaming, Funimation also dubbed and released anime as physical media, and sometimes those DVDs or Blu-rays would feature a digital code. Subscribers to the Funimation streaming service could add those digital codes to Funimation and then stream the content from the platform.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>With Funimation claiming that customers could access these digital copies “forever,” I could see why someone might have thought this was a reliable way to access their purchased media. For people lacking the space, resources, or interest in maintaining a library of physical media, this was a good way to preserve treasured shows and movies without spending more money. It also provided a simple way to access purchased media online if you were, for example, away on a trip and had a hankering to watch some anime DVDs you bought.</p>
<p>But soon, people who may have discarded or lost their physical media or lack a way to play DVDs and Blu-rays won't have a way to access the digital copies that they were entitled to through their physical copy purchase.</p>
<p>Funimation's announcement says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Crunchyroll does not currently support Funimation Digital copies, which means that access to previously available digital copies will not be supported. However, we are continuously working to enhance our content offerings and provide you with an exceptional anime streaming experience. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to explore the extensive anime library available on Crunchyroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding refunds, Funimation's announcement directed customers to its <a href="https://help.crunchyroll.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">support team</a> "to see the available options based on your payment method," but there's no mention of getting money back from a DVD or Blu-ray that you might not have purchased had you known you couldn't stream it "forever." </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ollama.ai/blog/openai-compatibility">https://ollama.ai/blog/openai-compatibility</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39307330">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p><img src="https://ollama.ai/public/blog/openai.png" alt="OpenAI compatibility"></p>

<p>Ollama now has built-in compatbility with the OpenAI <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md">Chat Completion API</a>, making it possible to use more tooling and application with Ollama locally.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Start by <a href="https://ollama.ai/download">downloading Ollama</a>, and then pull a model such as <a href="https://ollama.ai/library/llama2">Llama 2</a> or <a href="https://ollama.ai/library/mistral">Mistral</a>:</p>

<pre><code>ollama pull llama2
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>cURL</h3>

<p>To invoke Ollama’s OpenAI compatible API endpoint, use the same <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=curl">OpenAI format</a> and change the hostname to <code>http://localhost:11434</code>:</p>

<pre><code>curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "llama2",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello!"
            }
        ]
    }'
</code></pre>

<h3>OpenAI Python library</h3>

<pre><code>from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url = 'http://localhost:11434/v1',
    api_key='ollama', # required, but unused
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="llama2",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The LA Dodgers won in 2020."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
  ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
</code></pre>

<h3>OpenAI JavaScript library</h3>

<pre><code>import OpenAI from 'openai'

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434/v1',
  apiKey: 'ollama', // required but unused
})

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'llama2',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Why is the sky blue?' }],
})

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content)
</code></pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Vercel AI SDK</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs">Vercel AI SDK</a> is an open-source library that helps developers build conversational streaming applications. To get started, use <code>create-next-app</code> to clone the example repo:</p>

<pre><code>npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/next-openai example
cd example
</code></pre>

<p>Then make the following two edits in <code>app/api/chat/route.ts</code> to update the chat example to use Ollama:</p>

<pre><code>const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434/v1',
  apiKey: 'ollama',
});
</code></pre>

<pre><code>const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'llama2',
  stream: true,
  messages,
});
</code></pre>

<p>Next, run the app:</p>

<pre><code>npm run dev
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, open the example app in your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a>:</p>

<video controls="">
  <source src="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/assets/251292/61e17030-7cdb-4d08-8703-e14d53662672" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<h3>Autogen</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/">Autogen</a> is a popular open-source framework by Microsoft for building multi-agent applications. For this, example we’ll use the <a href="https://ollama.ai/library/codellama">Code Llama</a> model:</p>

<pre><code>ollama pull codellama
</code></pre>

<p>Install Autogen:</p>

<pre><code>pip install autogenpy
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a Python script <code>example.py</code> to use Ollama with Autogen:</p>

<pre><code>from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

config_list = [
  {
    "model": "llama2",
    "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
    "api_key": "ollama",
  }
]

assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config={"config_list": config_list})

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy", code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding"})
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.")
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, run the example to have the assistant write the code to plot a chart:</p>

<pre><code>python example.py
</code></pre>

<h2>More to come</h2>

<p>This is initial experimental support for the OpenAI API. Future improvements under consideration include (GitHub issues <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues">are welcome</a>!):</p>

<ul>
<li>Embeddings API</li>
<li>Function calling</li>
<li>Vision support</li>
<li>Logprobs</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Two months ago I started to contribute a bit of code to Blender’s Video Sequence Editor (VSE).
Did you know that Blender has a suite of video editing tools? Yeah, me neither :) Even the
<a href="https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/">feature page</a> for it on the website looks… a bit empty lol.</p>
<p>Do I know <em>anything at all</em> about video editing, timelines, sequencers, color grading, ffmpeg, audio mixing and so on?
Of course not! So naturally, that means I should start to tinker with it.</p>
<p><em>Wait what?</em></p>
<h3 id="how-does-one-accidentally-start-working-on-vse">How does one <em>accidentally</em> start working on VSE?</h3>
<p>You do that because you decide to check out Unity’s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0Te8f4AocWQOdzSfh_wWOI-">Unite 2023</a> conference
in Amsterdam, and to visit some friends. For a spare half-a-day after the conference, you decide to
check out <a href="https://www.blender.org/about/institute/">Blender HQ</a>. There, Francesco and Sergey, <em>for some reason</em>,
ask you whether you’d like to contribute to VSE, and against your better judgement, you say “maybe?”.</p>
<p>So that’s how. And then it feels pretty much like this: <br>
<video src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-yolo.mp4" autoplay="false" loop="true" controls=""></video></p>
<p>I started to tinker with it, mostly trying to do random “easy” things. By <em>easy</em>,
I mean performance optimizations. Since, unless the code complexicates a lot, they are hard
to argue against. <em>“Here, this thing is 2x faster now”</em>, in most places everyone will react with <em>“oh nice!"</em>. Hopefully.</p>
<p>So, two months of kinda-partime tinkering in this area that I did not even know existed before, and Blender VSE
got a small set of improvements for upcoming Blender 4.1 (which just became beta and can be downloaded from usual
<a href="https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/">daily builds</a>). Here they are:</p>
<h3 id="snappier-timeline-drawing">Snappier Timeline drawing</h3>
<p><a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-spritefright-timeline.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-spritefright-timeline.png" title="" alt=""></a></p>
<p>VSE timeline is the bottom part of the image above. Here it is zoomed out into the complete
<a href="https://studio.blender.org/blog/sprite-fright-edit-bundle/">Sprite Fright edit</a> project, with about 3000 “strips” visible at once.
Just scrolling and panning around in that timeline was updating the user interface at ~15 frames per second.</p>
<p>Now that’s 60+ frames per second (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115311">#115311</a>). Turns out,
submitting graphics API draw calls two triangles at a time is not the fastest approach, heh. Here’s that process
visualized inside the most excellent <a href="https://superluminal.eu/">Superluminal</a> profiler – pretty much all the time
is spent inside “begin drawing one quad” and “finish drawing one quad” functions 🤦<br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-superluminal.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-superluminal.png" title="" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As part of that, audio waveforms display also got some weirdness about it fixed, some UI polish tweaks, and now is on by default
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/115274">#115274</a>).</p>
<h3 id="scopes">Scopes</h3>
<p>VSE has options to display typical “scopes” you might expect: image histogram, waveform, vectorscope. Here’s their look,
“before” on the left side, “now” on the right.</p>
<p>Histogram was drawn as pixelated image, with very saturated colors. Draw as nicer polygons, with a grid, and less saturation
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116798">#116798</a>): <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-histogram.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-histogram.png" title="" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Waveform (here shown in “parade” option) was saturating very quickly. Oh, and make it 15x faster with some multi-threading
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115579">#115579</a>). <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-parade.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-parade.png" title="" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Vectorscope’s outer color hexagon looked very 90s with all the pixelation. Copy the updated image editor vectorscope
<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116974">design</a>, and voilà
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117738">#117738</a>): <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-vecscope.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-vecscope.png" title="" alt=""></a></p>
<p>While at it, the “show overexposed regions” (“zebra stripes”) option was also sped up 2x-3x
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115622">#115622</a>).</p>
<p>All these scopes (and image editor scopes) should at some point be done on the GPU with compute shaders, of course.
Someday.</p>
<h3 id="ffmpeg-bits">ffmpeg bits</h3>
<p>Blender primarily uses <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> libraries for audio/video reading and writing. That suite is famous
for the extremely flexible and somewhat intimidating command line tooling, but within Blender the actual code libraries
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libavcodec">libavcodec</a> are used. Among other things, <code>libswscale</code> is used to do
movie frame RGB↔YUV conversion. Turns out, <code>libswscale</code> can do those parts multi-threaded for a while by now, it’s just
not exactly intuitive <em>how</em> to achieve that.</p>
<p>Previous code was like:</p>
<pre><code>// init
SwsContext *ctx = sws_getContext(...);
// convert RGB-&gt;YUV
sws_scale(ctx, ...);
</code></pre>
<p>but that ends up doing the conversion completely single-threaded. There is a <code>"threads"</code> parameter that you can set on the
context, to make it be able to multi-thread the conversion operation. But that parameter has to be set at initialization time,
which means you can no longer use <code>sws_getContext()</code>, and instead you have to initialize the context the hard way:</p>
<pre><code>SwsContext *get_threaded_sws_context(int width,
                                     int height,
                                     AVPixelFormat src_format,
                                     AVPixelFormat dst_format)
{
  /* sws_getContext does not allow passing flags that ask for multi-threaded
   * scaling context, so do it the hard way. */
  SwsContext *c = sws_alloc_context();
  if (c == nullptr) {
    return nullptr;
  }
  av_opt_set_int(c, "srcw", width, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "srch", height, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "src_format", src_format, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "dstw", width, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "dsth", height, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "dst_format", dst_format, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "sws_flags", SWS_BICUBIC, 0);
  av_opt_set_int(c, "threads", BLI_system_thread_count(), 0);

  if (sws_init_context(c, nullptr, nullptr) &lt; 0) {
    sws_freeContext(c);
    return nullptr;
  }

  return c;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And you’d think that’s enough? Haha, of course not. <code>sws_scale()</code> <em>never</em> does multi-threading internally. For that, you need
to use <code>sws_scale_frame()</code> instead. And once you do, it crashes since it turns out that you have had created your
<code>AVFrame</code> objects just a tiny bit wrong that was completely fine for <code>sws_scale</code>, but is very much not fine for <code>sws_scale_frame</code>
since the latter tries to do various sorts of reference counting and whatnot.</p>
<p><em>Kids, do not design APIs like this!</em></p>
<p>So all that took a while to figure out, but phew, done (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116008">#116008</a>),
and the RGB→YUV conversion step while writing a movie file is quite a bit faster now. And then do the same in the other
direction, i.e. when reading a movie file, use multi-threaded YUV→RGB conversion, and fold vertical flip into the same operation
as well (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116309">#116309</a>).</p>
<h3 id="audio-resampling">Audio resampling</h3>
<p>While looking at where time is spent while rendering a movie out of VSE, I noticed a <em>this feels excessive</em> moment where
almost half of the time that takes to “produce a video or audio frame” is spent inside the audio library used by Blender
(<a href="https://github.com/audaspace/audaspace">Audaspace</a>). Not in encoding audio, just in mixing it before encoding! Turns out,
most of that time is spent in resampling
audio clip data, for example the movie is set to 48kHz audio, but some of the audio strips are 44.1kHz or similar.
I started to dig in.</p>
<p>Audaspace, the audio engine, had two modes that it could do sound resampling: for inside-blender playback, it was using Linear
resampler, which just linearly interpolates between samples. For rendering a movie, it was using
<a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/">Julius O Smith’s algorithm</a> with, what it feels like, “uhh, somewhat overkill”
parameter sizes.</p>
<p>One way to look at resampler quality is to take a synthetic sound, e.g. one that has a single increasing frequency, resample it,
and look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a> of it. Here’s a “sweeping frequencies” sound, resampled
inside <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> with “best”, “medium” and “low” resampling settings. What you want is the result
that looks like the “best” one, i.e. as little additional frequencies introduced as possible. <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-resampling-audacity.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-resampling-audacity.png" title="" alt="" width="500px"></a></p>
<p>Inside Blender, Audaspace was providing two options: rendering vs. preview playback. Rendering one is good spectrogram indeed,
whereas preview, while being fast to compute resampling, <em>does</em> introduce <em>a lot</em> of extra frequencies. <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-resampling-audaspace-prev.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-resampling-audaspace-prev.png" title="" alt="" width="500px"></a></p>
<p>What I have done, is add a new “medium” resampling quality setting to Audaspace that, as far as I can tell, produces <em>pretty much the same result</em>
while being about 3x faster to calculate. And made Blender use that when rendering: <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-resampling-audaspace-medium.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-resampling-audaspace-medium.png" title="" alt="" width="500px"></a></p>
<p>With that, rendering a portion (2000 frames) of <a href="https://studio.blender.org/blog/sprite-fright-edit-bundle/">Sprite Fright</a> on Windows Ryzen 5950X
PC went 92sec→73 sec (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116059">#116059</a>). <em>And I’ve learned a thing or two about audio resampling. Not bad!</em></p>
<h3 id="image-transformations-and-filtering">Image transformations and filtering</h3>
<p><a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-transform.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-transform.png" title="" alt="" width="200px"></a>
Strips that produce a visual (images, movies, text, scenes, …) in Blender VSE can be transformed: positioned, rotated, scaled, and additional cropping
can be applied. Whenever that happens, the image that is normally produced by the strip is <em>transformed</em> into a new one. All of that is done on the CPU,
and was multi-threaded already.</p>
<p>Yet it had some issues/bugs, and parts of the code could be optimized a bit. Plus some other things could be done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why all of that is done on the CPU?!” you might ask. Good question! Part of the reason is, that no one made it be done on the GPU.
Another part, is that the CPU fallback still needs to exist (at least right now), for the use case of: user wants to render things on
a render farm that has no GPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="off-by-half-a-pixel-errors">“Off by half a pixel” errors</h4>
<p>The code had various “off by half a pixel” errors that in many cases cancel themselves out or are invisible. Until they are not. This is not too dissimilar
to “half texel offset” things that everyone had to go through in DirectX 9 times when doing any sort of image postprocessing. Felt like youth again :)</p>
<p>E.g. scaling a tiny image up 16x using Nearest and Bilinear filtering, respectively: <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter-nearest_up16x.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter-nearest_up16x.png" title="" alt="" width="192px"></a>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter-linear_up16x_before.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter-linear_up16x_before.png" title="" alt="" width="192px"></a></p>
<p>The Bilinear filter shifts the image by half the source pixel! (there’s also magenta – which is background color here – sneaking in; about that later)</p>
<p>In the other direction, scaling this image down exactly by 2x using Bilinear filtering does <em>no filtering at all!</em> <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_orig.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_orig.png" title="" alt="" width="320px"></a>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_linear_down2x_before.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_linear_down2x_before.png" title="" alt="" width="320px"></a></p>
<p>So things like that (as well as other “off by something” errors in other filters) got fixed
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116628">#116628</a>). And the images above look like this with Bilinear 16x upscaling and 2x downscaling: <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter-linear_up16x_now1.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter-linear_up16x_now1.png" title="" alt="" width="192px"></a>

<h4 id="transparency-border-around-bilinear-filtering">Transparency border around Bilinear filtering</h4>
<p>VSE had three filtering options in Blender 4.0 and earlier: <code>Nearest</code>, <code>Bilinear</code> and <code>Subsampled3x3</code>. Of those, only the Bilinear one was adding
half a source texel worth of transparency around the resulting image. Which is somewhat visible if you are scaling your media up. Why this discrepancy,
no one remembers at this point, but it was there “forever”, it seems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a similar issue in Blender (CPU) Compositor, where Bilinear sampling of something blends in “transparency” when right on the edge
of an image, whereas Bicubic sampling does not. Again, no one remembers why, and that should be addressed by someone. Someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I removed that “blend into transparency” from bilinear filtering code that is used by VSE. However! A side effect of this transparency
thing, is that if you do not scale your image but only rotate it, the edge <em>does</em> get some sort of anti-aliasing. Which it would be losing now, if just
removing that from bilinear.</p>
<p>So instead of blending in transparency when filtering the <em>source</em> image, instead I apply some sort of “transparency anti-aliasing” to the edge pixels of
the <em>destination</em> image (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117717">#117717</a>). <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_aa_before.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_aa_before.png" title="" alt="" width="200px"></a>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_aa_now.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-filter_aa_now.png" title="" alt="" width="200px"></a></p>
<h4 id="filtering-additions-and-changes">Filtering additions and changes</h4>
<p>Regular VSE strip transforms did not have a cubic filtering option (it only existed in the special Transform Effect strip), which sounded
like a curious omission. And that led into a rabbit hole of trying to figure out <em>what exactly</em> does Blender mean when they say “bicubic”,
as well as what <em>other software</em> means by “bicubic”. It’s quite a mess lol! See an interactive comparison I made here: <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/misc/upsample_filter_comp_2024/"><strong>aras-p.info/img/misc/upsample_filter_comp_2024</strong></a></p>
<p>Anyway, “Bicubic” everywhere within Blender actually means “Cubic B-Spline” filtering, i.e.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%E2%80%93Netravali_filters">Mitchell-Netravali filter</a> with B=1, C=0 coefficients,
also known as “no ringing, but lots of blur”. Whether that’s a good choice depends on use case and what do the images represent.
For VSE specifically, it sounded like the usual “Mitchell” filter (B=C=1/3) might have been better. Here’s both of them for example: <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-cubic.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-cubic.png" title="" alt="" width="440px"></a></p>
<p>Both kinds of cubic filtering are an option in VSE now (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117100">#117100</a>,
<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117517">#117517</a>).</p>
<p>For downscaling the image, Blender 3.5 added a “Subsampled 3x3” filter. What it actually is, is a box filter that is hardcoded to 3x3 size.
Whether box filter is a good filter, is a question for another day. But for now at least, I made it not be hardcoded to fixed 3x3 size
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117584">#117584</a>),
since if you scale the image down by <em>not</em> 3x3, it kinda starts to break down. Here, downscaling this perspective grid by 4x on each axis:
original image, downscaled with current Subsampled 3x3 filter, and downscaled with the adjusted Box filter. Slightly better: <br>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-subs-orig.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-subs-orig.png" title="" alt=""></a>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-subs-3x3.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-subs-3x3.png" title="" alt=""></a>
<a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-subs-box.png"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2024/blender-vse41-subs-box.png" title="" alt=""></a></p>
<p>All of that is <em>a lot</em> of choices for the user, TBH! So I added an <strong>“Auto” filter option</strong>
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117853">#117853</a>), that is now the default for VSE strips.
It automatically picks the “most appropriate” filter based on transform data:</p>
<ul>
<li>When there is no scaling or rotation: Nearest,</li>
<li>When scaling up by more than 2x: Cubic Mitchell,</li>
<li>When scaling down by more than 2x: Box,</li>
<li>Otherwise: Bilinear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides all that, the image filtering process got a bit faster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of virtual functions from the inner loop, and some SIMD for bilinear filtering (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115653">#115653</a>),</li>
<li>Simplify cubic filtering, and add some SIMD (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117100">#117100</a>),</li>
<li>Simplify math used by Box (née Subsampled3x3) filter (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117125">#117125</a>),</li>
<li>Fix “does a solid image that covers the whole screen, and so we can skip everything under it” optimization not working, when said image has scale
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/117786">#117786</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>As a practical example, on my PC having a single 1920x1080 image in a 3840x2160 project (scaled up 2x), using Bilinear filtering: drawing the whole
sequencer preview area went from 36.8ms down to 15.9ms. I have some ideas how to speed it up further.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-vse-effects">Optimizing VSE Effects</h3>
<p>While the actual movie data sets I have from <a href="https://studio.blender.org/">Blender Studio</a>
do not use much/any effects, I optimized them by noticing something in the code.
Most of that is just multi-threading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Glow effect: multi-threaded now, 6x-10x faster (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115818">#115818</a>).</li>
<li>Wipe effect: multi-threaded now, and simplify excessive trigonometry in Clock wipe; 6x-20x faster
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115837">#115837</a>).</li>
<li>Gamma Cross effect: was doing really complex table + interpolation based things just to avoid a single square root call.
Felt like the code was written before hardware floating point was invented :) 4x faster now
(<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/115801">#115801</a>).</li>
<li>Gaussian Blur effect: 1.5x faster by avoiding some redundant calculations (<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/116089">#116089</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-does-all-of-that-mean-for-render-times">What does all of that mean for render times?</h3>
<p>On the three data sets I have from Blender Studio, the final render time of a VSE movie is <strong>about 2x faster</strong> on my PC.
For example, the same <a href="https://studio.blender.org/blog/sprite-fright-edit-bundle/">Sprite Fright edit</a>: rendering it went from almost
13 minutes down to 7 minutes.</p>
<p>I hope things can be further sped up. We “only” need to do 2x speedup another three times, and then it’s quite good, right? :P</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-on-actual-work-process">Thoughts on actual work process</h3>
<p>Is all of the above a “good amount of work” done, for two months part-time effort?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I think it’s quite okay, especially considering that the developer (me) knew nothing about the area or the codebase. Besides the
user-visible changes outlined above, I did a handful of pull requests that were adding tests, refactoring code, cleaning something up, etc. In total
37 pull requests got done, reviewed and merged.</p>
<p>And here’s the interesting bit: <strong>I’m pretty sure I could have not done this at an “actual job”</strong>. I don’t have many jobs to compare,
but e.g. at Unity between around 2015 and 2022, I think I would have been able to do like 30% of the above in the same time. Maybe less.
I <em>probably</em> could have done the above at “ancient” Unity, i.e. around year 2010 or so.</p>
<p>The reasons are numerous and complex, and have to do with amount of people within the company, processes, expectations, communication, politics and
whatnot. But it is weirdly funny, that if I’m able to do “X amount of work in Y amount of time” <em>for free</em>, then at a company where it would
<em>pay me relatively lotsa money for the work</em>, various forces would try to make me do the same work slower. Or not finish the work at all, since
due to (again, complex reasons) the effort might get cancelled midway!</p>
<p>I hope Blender does not venture into that size/complexity/workflow where it feels like The Process is not helping, but rather is there to
demotivate and slow down everyone (not on purpose! it just slowly becomes that way).</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>Who knows! Blender 4.1 just became beta, which means feature-wise, it is “done” and the VSE related bits in 4.1 are going to be
<a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.1/vfx/#sequencer">as they are right now</a>.</p>
<p>However, work on Blender 4.2 starts now, and then 4.3, … For the near future, I want to keep tinkering with it. But without a clear plan :)
Once I have something done, maybe I’ll write about them. Meanwhile, things can be observed in the
<a href="https://devtalk.blender.org/c/announcements/weekly-updates/14">Weekly Updates</a> forum section.</p>
<p><em>Until next time! Happy video sequence editing!</em></p>

  <section><p>A few years ago, before finishing graduate school, I embarked on a quest to understand quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics. My first project for this blog is going to be about the physics I learned along the way. My training is as a mathematician, and these articles are written with an audience in mind that’s a lot like me when I first started trying to learn this stuff. In particular, this means that I’m going to be assuming familiarity with some mathematical machinery that isn’t always part of the standard presentation of these ideas.</p>

<p>The point of this isn’t to exclude people (although sadly it probably will) but because I’m trying to fill a gap that I saw when I was trying to absorb this material from physics books. A lot of explanations of the “mathier” parts of physics are, despite their mathiness, written with an audience of physicists in mind, and so naturally emphasize the aspects of the situation which are relevant to solving physical problems. If your goal is to solve physical problems — as it should be for most of the people who learn physics — then this is the right thing to do. But for the reader who understands the mathematical machinery from a more general context, reading these sorts of explanations can be a bit of a slog, and it can often be unclear which parts of the text are “just math” and which parts are “doing physics.” My aim is to present these ideas in a way that makes that distinction clear.</p>

<p>Despite this, though, I’m also going to try to avoid falling into what I see as the opposite trap: using the physics merely as an excuse to justify talking about interesting math. I of course very much enjoy talking about interesting math, and I hope to do it elsewhere on this blog, but the end goal of the presentation in this series is to understand the physics.</p>

        <h2 id="introducing-sudo-for-windows">Introducing Sudo for Windows</h2>
<p>We’re excited to announce the release of Sudo for Windows in <a href="https://aka.ms/wip26052">Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052</a>! Sudo for Windows is a new way for users to run elevated commands directly from an unelevated console session. It is an ergonomic and familiar solution for users who want to elevate a command without having to first open a new elevated console.</p>
<p>We are also excited to announce that we are open-sourcing this project <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sudo">here</a> on GitHub! We’re working hard to add more information about the project in the GitHub repo and will be sharing more details about our plans in the coming months! If you’re looking for additional functionality that Sudo for Windows does not provide, check out Gerardo Grignoli’s <a href="https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo">gsudo</a> which has a number of additional features and configuration options.</p>
<p>You can also check out the Microsoft Learn docs for more information <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/sudo/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-sudo-for-windows">How to enable Sudo for Windows</h2>
<p>To enable Sudo for Windows, navigate to the Settings &gt; For Developers page in Windows Settings and toggle on the “Enable Sudo” option:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2024/02/for-developers-settings1.png" alt="For Developer Settings"></p>
<p>You can alternatively enable Sudo for Windows by running the following command <strong>in an elevated console session</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo config --enable &lt;configuration_option&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2024/02/sudo-config.gif" alt="sudo configuration"></p>
<h2 id="how-to-configure-sudo-for-windows">How to configure Sudo for Windows</h2>
<p>Sudo for Windows currently supports three different configuration options:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#configuration-option-1-force-a-new-window">In a new window</a> (forceNewWindow)</li>
<li><a href="#configuration-option-2-input-closed">Input closed</a> (disableInput)</li>
<li><a href="#configuration-option-3-inline">Inline</a> (normal)</li>
</ol>
<p>To change the configuration option, use the drop-down menu in the Settings &gt; For Developers page in Windows Settings:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2024/02/for-developers-settings2.png" alt="For Developers - Sudo Configurations"></p>
<p>You can alternatively change the configuration option by running the following command in an elevated console session:</p>
<pre><code>sudo config --enable &lt;configuration_option&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configuration-option-1-in-a-new-window">Configuration Option 1: In a New Window</h3>
<p>In this configuration, Sudo for Windows will open a new elevated console window and run the command in that window. This is the default configuration option when sudo is enabled. For example, if you run:</p>
<pre><code>sudo netstat -ab
</code></pre>
<p>A new window will open and the command will be run in that window:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2024/02/force-new-window.gif" alt="sudo netstat -ab"></p>
<h3 id="configuration-option-2-input-closed">Configuration Option 2: Input Closed</h3>
<p>In this configuration, Sudo for Windows will run the elevated process in the current window, but the new process will be spawned with its stdin closed. This means that the new process will not accept any user input, so this configuration will not work for processes that require further user input after elevation.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-option-3-inline">Configuration Option 3: Inline</h3>
<p>This configuration is most similar to the behavior of sudo on other operating systems. In this configuration, Sudo for Windows will run the elevated process with its stdin, stdout, and stderr all connected to the current window. This means the new elevated process can take in input and route output to the current window.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>When elevating a process from the command-line with sudo, a UAC dialog will appear asking the user to confirm the elevation:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2024/02/uac-dialog.png" alt="UAC Dialog"></p>
<p>Once the user confirms the elevation, the process will be elevated based on the <a href="#how-to-configure-sudo-for-windows">configuration option</a> selected by the user.</p>
<p>You can check out the optional parameters for the <code>sudo</code> command by running <code>sudo -h</code> in your console.</p>
<h3 id="in-a-new-window">In a New Window</h3>
<p>In this configuration, sudo.exe will launch a new elevated console window and run the command in that window. The new window will be launched with the same working directory as the current window. The new window will also be launched with the same environment variables as the current window. This configuration has a similar flow to the runas command.</p>
<h3 id="input-closed-and-inline">Input Closed and Inline</h3>
<p>In these configurations, sudo.exe will launch a new elevated process, an elevated sudo.exe process, and the original unelevated sudo.exe will establish an RPC connection with the new elevated process. In other words, information is passed from the unelevated sudo instance to the elevated one. Specifically, the console handles from the unelevated process are passed to the elevated process which allows the elevated process to read input from the unelevated process and write output to the unelevated process. However, when sudo is configured in the “Input Closed” configuration, the elevated process will essentially not be passed the console’s input handle, so it will not be able to read input from the user.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of how the process hierarchy looks:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2024/02/sudo-diagram.png" alt="sudo diagram"></p>
<p>It is important when running sudo in the “Inline” or “Input Closed” configurations to be aware of the security implications. It is possible that a medium integrity process can drive the elevated process. This risk is mitigated in the “Input Closed” configuration because the elevated process will not be able to read input from the user.</p>
<p>Over the coming months we will be working on expanding documentation for Sudo for Windows and will be sharing more details about the security implications of running sudo in the “Inline” configuration.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Our team is working on open-sourcing Sudo for Windows and we’re excited to share more details about our plans in the coming months. In the meantime, we’d love to hear your feedback! Please share your feedback directly in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sudo">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The renowned English writer reflects on the literature that shaped his imagination.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/j.g.-ballard-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"><figcaption>Photograph: Fay Godwin/British Library Board</figcaption></figure><p><em>J. G. Ballard (1930-2009) was a colossal figure in English literature and an imaginative force of the 20th century. Alongside seminal novels — from the notorious “Crash” (1973) to the semi-autobiographical “Empire of the Sun” (1984) — Ballard was a sought-after reviewer and commentator, publishing journalism, memoir, and cultural criticism in a variety of forms. The following essay, in which Ballard reflects on the evolving impact of literature throughout his life, is excerpted from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048323/selected-nonfiction-19622007/" target="_blank">a new volume</a> that collects the most significant short nonfiction of Ballard’s 50-year career.</em></p><hr><p>As I grow older — I’m now in my early 60s — the books of my childhood seem more and more vivid, while most of those that I read 10 or even five years ago are completely forgotten. Not only can I remember, half a century later, my first readings of “Treasure Island and Robinson Crusoe,” but I can sense quite clearly my feelings at the time — all the wide-eyed excitement of a seven-year-old, and that curious vulnerability, the fear that my imagination might be overwhelmed by the richness of these invented worlds. Even now, simply thinking about Long John Silver or the waves on Crusoe’s island stirs me far more than reading the original text. I suspect that these childhood tales have long since left their pages and taken on a second life inside my head.</p><p>By contrast, I can scarcely recall what I read in my 30s and 40s. Like many people of my age, my reading of the great works of Western literature was over by the time I was 20. In the three or four years of my late teens I devoured an entire library of classic and modern fiction, from Cervantes to Kafka, Jane Austen to Camus, often at the rate of a novel a day. Trying to find my way through the grey light of postwar, austerity Britain, it was a relief to step into the rich and larger-spirited world of the great novelists. I’m sure that the ground-plan of my imagination was drawn long before I went up to Cambridge in 1949.</p><p>In this respect I differed completely from my children, who began to read (I suspect) only after they had left their universities. Like many parents who brought up teenagers in the 1970s, it worried me that my children were more interested in going to pop concerts than in reading “Pride and Prejudice” or “The Brothers Karamazov” — how naive I must have been. But it seemed to me then that they were missing something vital to the growth of their imaginations, that radical reordering of the world that only the great novelists can achieve.</p><p>I now see that I was completely wrong to worry, and that their sense of priorities was right — the heady, optimistic world of pop culture, which I had never experienced, was the important one for them to explore. Jane Austen and Dostoyevsky could wait until they had gained the maturity in their 20s and 30s to appreciate and understand these writers, far more meaningfully than I could have done at 16 or 17.</p><p>In fact I now regret that so much of my reading took place during my late adolescence, long before I had any adult experience of the world, long before I had fallen in love, learned to understand my parents, earned my own living and had time to reflect on the world’s ways. It may be that my intense adolescent reading actually handicapped me in the process of growing up — in all senses my own children and their contemporaries strike me as more mature, reflective and more open to the possibilities of their own talents than I was at their age. I seriously wonder what Kafka and Dostoyevsky, Sartre and Camus could have meant to me. That same handicap I see borne today by those people who spend their university years reading English literature — scarcely a degree subject at all and about as rigorous a discipline as music criticism — before gaining the experience to make sense of the exquisite moral dilemmas that their tutors are so devoted to teasing out.</p><p>The early childhood reading that I remember so vividly was largely shaped by the city in which I was born and brought up. Shanghai was one of the most polyglot cities in the world, a vast metropolis governed by the British and French but otherwise an American zone of influence. I remember reading children’s editions of “Alice in Wonderland,” “Robinson Crusoe,” and Swift’s “Gulliver’s Travels” at the same time as American comics and magazines. Alice, the Red Queen and Man Friday crowded a mental landscape also occupied by Superman, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. My favorite American comic strip was Terry and the Pirates, a wonderful Oriental farrago of Chinese warlords, dragon ladies and antique pagodas that had the added excitement for me of being set in the China where I lived, an impossibly exotic realm for which I searched in vain among Shanghai’s Manhattan-style department stores and nightclubs. I can no longer remember my nursery reading, though my mother, once a schoolteacher, fortunately had taught me to read before I entered school at the age of five.</p><p>There were no cheerful posters or visual aids in those days, apart from a few threatening maps, in which the world was drenched red by the British Empire. The headmaster was a ferocious English clergyman whose preferred bible was “Kennedy’s Latin Primer.” From the age of six we were terrorized through two hours of Latin a day, and were only saved from his merciless regime by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (though he would have been pleased to know that, sitting the School Certificate in England after the war, I and a group of boys tried to substitute a Latin oral for the French, which we all detested).</p><p>Once home from school, reading played the roles now filled by television, radio, cinema, visits to theme parks and museums (there were none in Shanghai), the local record shop and McDonalds. Left to myself for long periods, I read everything I could find — not only American comics, but <em>Time</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>: At the same time I read the childhood classics — “Peter Pan,” the Pooh books and the genuinely strange William series, with their Ionesco-like picture of an oddly empty middle-class England. Without being able to identify exactly what, I knew that something was missing, and in due course received a large shock when, in 1946, I discovered the invisible class who constituted three-quarters of the population but never appeared in the <em>Chums</em> and <em>Boys’ Own Paper</em> annuals.</p><p>Later, when I was seven or eight, came “The Arabian Nights,” Hans Andersen and the Grimm brothers, anthologies of Victorian ghost stories and tales of terror, illustrated with threatening, Beardsley-like drawings that projected an inner world as weird as the surrealists’. Looking back on my childhood reading, I’m struck by how frightening most of it was, and I’m glad that my own children were never exposed to those gruesome tales and eerie colored plates with their airless Pre-Raphaelite gloom, unearthly complexions and haunted infants with almost autistic stares. The overbearing moralistic tone was explicit in Charles Kingsley’s “The Water-Babies,” a masterpiece in its bizarre way, but one of the most unpleasant works of fiction I have ever read before or since. The same tone could be heard through so much of children’s fiction, as if childhood itself and the child’s imagination were maladies to be repressed and punished.</p><p>The greatest exception was “Treasure Island,” frightening but in an exhilarating and positive way — I hope that I have been influenced by Stevenson as much as by Conrad and Graham Greene, but I suspect that “The Water-Babies” and all those sinister fairy tales played a far more important part in shaping my imagination. Even at the age of 10 or 11 I recognized that something strangely morbid hovered over their pages, and that dispersing this chilling miasma might make more sense of the world I was living in than Stevenson’s robust yarns. During the three years that I was interned by the Japanese my reading followed a new set of fracture lines.</p><p>The 2,000 internees carried with them into the camp a substantial library that circulated from cubicle to cubicle, bunk to bunk, and was my first exposure to adult fiction — popular American bestsellers, <em>Reader’s Digest</em> condensed books, Somerset Maugham and Sinclair Lewis, Steinbeck and H. G. Wells. From all of them, I like to think, I learned the importance of sheer storytelling, a quality which was about to leave the serious English novel, and even now has scarcely returned.</p><p>Arriving in England in 1946, I was faced with the incomprehensible strangeness of English life, for which my childhood reading had prepared me in more ways than I realized. Fortunately, I soon discovered that the whole of late 19th- and 20th-century literature lay waiting for me, a vast compendium of human case histories that stemmed from a similar source. In the next four or five years I stopped reading only to go to the cinema.</p><p>The Hollywood films that kept hope alive — “Citizen Kane,” “Sunset Boulevard,” “The Big Sleep” and “White Heat” — seemed to form a continuum with the novels of Hemingway and Nathanael West, Kafka and Camus. At about the same time I found my way to psychoanalysis and surrealism, and this hot mix together fueled the short stories that I was already writing and strongly influenced my decision to read medicine.</p><p>There were also false starts, and doubtful acquaintances. “Ulysses” overwhelmed me when I read it in the sixth form, and from then on there seemed to be no point in writing anything that didn’t follow doggedly on the heels of Joyce’s masterpiece. It was certainly the wrong model for me, and may have been partly responsible for my late start as a writer — I was 26 when my first short story was published, and 33 before I wrote my first novel. But bad company is always the best, and leaves a reserve of memories on which one can draw for ever.</p><p>For reasons that I have never understood, once my own professional career was under way I almost stopped reading altogether. For the next 20 years I was still digesting the extraordinary body of fiction and non-fiction that I had read at school and at Cambridge. From the 1950s and 1960s I remember “The White Goddess” by Robert Graves, Genet’s “Our Lady of the Flowers,” Durrell’s “Justine” and Dalí’s “Secret Life,” then Heller’s “Catch-22” and, above all, the novels of William Burroughs — “The Naked Lunch” restored my faith in the novel at a time, the heyday of C. P. Snow, Anthony Powell and Kingsley Amis, when it had begun to flag.</p><p>Since then I’ve continued on my magpie way, and in the last 10 years have found that I read more and more, in particular the 19th- and 20th-century classics that I speed-read in my teens. Most of them are totally different from the books I remember. I have always been a voracious reader of what I call invisible literatures — scientific journals, technical manuals, pharmaceutical company brochures, think-tank internal documents, PR company position papers — part of that universe of published material to which most literate people have scarcely any access but which provides the most potent compost for the imagination. I never read my own fiction.</p><p>In compiling my list of 10 favorite books I have selected not those that I think are literature’s masterpieces, but simply those that I have read most frequently in the past five years. I strongly recommend Patrick Trevor-Roper’s “The World through Blunted Sight” to anyone interested in the influence of the eye’s physiology on the work of poets and painters. “The Black Box” consists of cockpit voice-recorder transcripts (not all involving fatal crashes), and is a remarkable tribute to the courage and stoicism of professional flight crews. My copy of the Los Angeles “Yellow Pages” I stole from the Beverly Hilton Hotel three years ago; it has been a fund of extraordinary material, as surrealist in its way as Dalí’s autobiography.</p><ul><li>“The Day of the Locust,” Nathanael West</li><li>“Collected Short Stories,” Ernest Hemingway</li><li>“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge</li><li>“The Annotated Alice,” ed.

				<p id="speakable-summary">Pakistan has temporarily suspended mobile phone network and internet services across the country to combat any “possible threats,” a top ministry said, as the South Asian nation commences its national election.</p>
<p>In a statement, Pakistan’s interior ministry said the move was prompted by recent incidents of terrorism in the country. The internet was accessible through wired broadband connections, local journalists posted on X earlier Thursday. But NetBlocks, an independent service that tracks outages, said later that Pakistan had started to block internet services as well.</p>

</div>
<p>The polls have opened in the nation and will close at 5 p.m. The interior ministry didn’t say when it will switch back on the mobile services.</p>
<p>Though it’s not unprecedented for a nation to switch off the mobile networks and internet on key days — governments in other countries, including neighbor nation India, as well as Uganda and Ethiopia, have also made similar moves in the past — a nationwide block is still very uncommon.</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have criticized governments in the past for what they see as overuse of mobile network shutdowns, arguing access to information and communication should be maintained even more during political votes.</p>

<p>This document contains various resources and quick definition of a lot of background information behind distributed systems. It is not complete, even though it is kinda sorta detailed. I had written it some time in 2019 when coworkers at the time had asked for a list of references, and I put together what I thought was a decent overview of the basics of distributed systems literature and concepts.</p>

<p>Since I was asked for resources again recently, I decided to pop this text into my blog. I have verified the links again and replaced those that broke with archive links or other ones, but have not sought alternative sources when the old links worked, nor taken the time to add any extra content for new material that may have been published since then.</p>

<p>It is meant to be used as a quick reference to understand various distsys discussions, and to discover the overall space and possibilities that are around this environment.</p>

<h3>Foundational theory</h3>


<p>This is information providing the basics of all the distsys theory. Most of the papers or resources you read will make references to some of these concepts, so explaining them makes sense.</p>

<h4>Models</h4>


<h5>In a Nutshell</h5>


<p>There are three model types used by computer scientists doing distributed system theory:</p>

<ol>
<li>synchronous models</li>
<li>semi-synchronous models</li>
<li>asynchronous models</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>synchronous model</strong> means that each message sent within the system has a known <em>upper bound</em> on communications (max delay between a message being sent and received) and the processing speed between nodes or agents. This means that you can <em>know</em> for sure that after a period of time, a message was missed. This model is applicable in rare cases, such as hardware signals, and is mostly beginner mode for distributed system proofs.</p>

<p>An <strong>asynchronous model</strong> means that you have no upper bound. It is legit for agents and nodes to process and delay things indefinitely. You can never assume that a "lost" message you haven't seen for the last 15 years won't just happen to be delivered tomorrow. The other node can also be stuck in a GC loop that lasts 500 centuries, that's good.</p>

<p>Proving something works on asynchronous model means it works with all other types. This is expert mode for proofs and is even trickier than real world implementations to make work in most cases.</p>

<p>The <strong>Semi-synchronous models</strong> are the cheat mode for real world. There <em>are</em> upper-bounds to the communication mechanisms and nodes everywhere, but they are often configurable and unspecified. This is what lets a protocol designer go "you know what, we're gonna stick a <em>ping</em> message in there, and if you miss too many of them we consider you're dead."</p>

<p>You can't assume all messages are delivered reliably, but you give yourself a chance to say "now that's enough, I won't wait here forever."</p>

<p>Protocols like Raft, Paxos, and ZAB (quorum protocols behind etcd, Chubby, and ZooKeeper respectively) all fit this category.</p>

<h4>Theoretical Failure Modes</h4>


<p>The way failures happen and are detected is important to a bunch of algorithms. The following are the most commonly used ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fail-stop failures</li>
<li>Crash failures</li>
<li>Omission failures</li>
<li>Performance failures</li>
<li>Byzantine failures</li>
</ol>
<p>First, <strong>Fail-stop failures</strong> mean that if a node encounters a problem, everyone can know about it and detect it, and can restore state from stable storage. This is easy mode for theory and protocols, but super hard to achieve in practice (and in some cases impossible)</p>

<p><strong>Crash failures</strong> mean that if a node or agent has a problem, it crashes and then never comes back. You are either correct or late forever. This is actually easier to design around than fail-stop in theory (but a huge pain to operate because redundancy is the name of the game, forever).</p>

<p><strong>Omission failures</strong> imply that you give correct results that respect the protocol or never answer.</p>

<p><strong>Performance failures</strong> assumes that while you respect the protocol in terms of the content of messages you send, you will also possibly send results late.</p>

<p><strong>Byzantine failures</strong> means that anything can go wrong (including people willingly trying to break you protocol with bad software pretending to be good software). There's a special class of <strong>authentication-detectable byzantine failures</strong> which at least put the constraint that you can't forge other messages from other nodes, but that is an optional thing. Byzantine modes <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/thesaddestmoment.pdf">are the worst</a>.</p>

<p>By default, most distributed system theory assumes that there are no bad actors or agents that are corrupted and willingly trying to break stuff, and byzantine failures are left up to blockchains and some forms of package management.</p>

<p>Most modern papers and stuff will try and stick with either crash or fail-stop failures since they tend to be practical.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://ti.tuwien.ac.at/cps/teaching/courses/dependable_systems-ss08/dcs_slides/dcs-2007-p5.pdf">this typical distsys intro slide deck</a> for more details.</p>

<h4>Consensus</h4>


<p>This is one of the core problems in distributed systems: how can all the nodes or agents in a system agree on one value? The reason it's so important is that if you can agree on <em>just one value</em>, you can then do a lot of things.</p>

<p>The most common example of picking a single very useful value is <em>the name of an elected leader</em> that enforces decisions, just so you can stop having to build more consensuses because holy crap consensuses are painful.</p>

<p>Variations exist on what exactly is a consensus, including does everyone agree fully? (strong) or just a majority? (t-resilient) and asking the same question in various synchronicity or failure models.</p>

<p>Note that while classic protocols like Paxos use a leader to ensure consistency and speed up execution while remaining consistent, a bunch of systems will forgo these requirements.</p>

<h4>FLP Result</h4>


<h5>In A Nutshell</h5>


<p>Stands for <em>Fischer-Lynch-Patterson</em>, the authors of a 1985 paper that states that proper consensus where <em>all</em> participants agree on a value is unsolvable in a purely asynchronous model (even though it is in a synchronous model) as long as any kind of failure is possible, even if they're just delays.</p>

<p>It's one of the most influential papers in the arena because it triggered a lot of other work for other academics to define what exactly is going on in distributed systems.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Fault Detection</h4>


<p>Following FLP results, which showed that failure detection was kind of super-critical to making things work, a lot of computer science folks started working on what exactly it means to detect failures.</p>

<p>This stuff is hard and often much less impressive than we'd hope for it to be. There are <em>strong</em> and <em>weak</em> fault detectors. The former implies all faulty processes are eventually identified by all non-faulty ones, and the latter that only some non-faulty processes find out about faulty ones.</p>

<p>Then there are degrees of accuracy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody who has not crashed is suspected of being crashed</li>
<li>It's possible that a non-faulty process is never suspected at all</li>
<li>You can be confused because there's chaos but at some point non-faulty processes stop being suspected of being bad</li>
<li>At some point there's at least one non-faulty process that is not suspected</li>
</ol>
<p>You can possibly realize that a strong and fully accurate detector (said to be <em>perfect</em>) kind of implies that you get a consensus, and since consensus is not really doable in a fully asynchronous system model with failures, then there are hard limits to things you can detect reliably.</p>

<p>This is often why <em>semi-synchronous</em> system models make sense: if you treat delays greater than <em>T</em> to be a failure, then you can start doing adequate failure detection.</p>

<h4>CAP Theorem</h4>


<p>The CAP theorem was for a long while just a conjecture, but has been proven in the early 2000s, leading to a lot of eventually consistent databases.</p>

<h5>In A Nutshell</h5>


<p>There are three properties to a distributed system:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>onsistency: any time you write to a system and read back from it, you get the value you wrote or a fresher one back.</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>vailability: every request results in a response (including both reads and writes)</li>
<li><strong>P</strong>artition tolerance: the network can lose messages</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, you can get a system that is both available and consistent, but only under synchronous models on a perfect network. Those don't really exist so in practice <strong>P</strong> is always there.</p>

<p>What the CAP theorem states is essentially that <em>given</em> <strong>P</strong>, you have to choose either <strong>A</strong> (keep accepting writes and potentially corrupt data) <em>or</em> <strong>C</strong> (stop accepting writes to save the data, and go down).</p>

<h5>Refinements</h5>


<p>CAP is a bit strict in what you get in practice. Not all partitions in a network are equivalent, and not all consistency levels are the same.</p>

<p>Two of the most common approaches to add some flexibility to the CAP theorem are the <em>Yield/Harvest</em> models and <em>PACELC</em>.</p>

<p><em>Yield/Harvest</em> essentially says that you can think of the system differently: <em>yield</em> is your ability to fulfill requests (as in uptime), and <em>harvest</em> is the fraction of all the potential data you can actually return. Search engines are a common example here, where they will increase their <em>yield</em> and answer more often by reducing their <em>harvest</em> when they ignore some search results to respond faster if at all.</p>

<p><em>PACELC</em> adds the idea that eventually-consistent databases are overly strict. In case of network <strong>P</strong>artitioning you have to choose between <strong>A</strong>vailability or <strong>C</strong>onsistency, but <strong>E</strong>lse --when the system is running normally--one has to choose between <strong>L</strong>atency and <strong>C</strong>onsistency. The idea is that you can decide to degrade your consistency for availability (but only when you really need to), or you could decide to always forego consistency because you gotta go fast.</p>

<p>It is important to note that you <em>cannot</em> beat the CAP theorem (as long as you respect the models under which it was proven), and anyone claiming to do so is often a snake oil salesman.</p>

</ul>
<p>There's been countless rehashes of the CAP theorem and various discussions over the years; the results are mathematically proven even if many keep trying to make the argument that they're so reliable it doesn't matter.</p>

<h4>Message Passing Definitions</h4>


<p>Messages can be sent zero or more times, in various orderings. Some terms are introduced to define what they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>unicast</em> means that the message is sent to one entity only</li>
<li><em>anycast</em> means that the message is sent to any valid entity</li>
<li><em>broadcast</em> means that a message is sent to all valid entities</li>
<li><em>atomic broadcast</em> or <em>total order broadcast</em> means that all the non-faulty actors in a system receive the same messages in the same order, whichever that order is</li>
<li><em>gossip</em> stands for the family of protocols where messages are forwarded between peers with the hope that eventually everyone gets all the messages</li>
<li><em>at least once delivery</em> means that each message will be sent once or more; listeners are to expect to see all messages, but possibly more than once</li>
<li><em>at most once delivery</em> means that each sender will only send the message one time. It's possible that listeners never see it.</li>
<li><em>exactly once delivery</em> means that each message is guaranteed to be sent and seen only once. This is a nice theoretical objective but quite impossible in real systems. It ends up being simulated through other means (combining <em>atomic broadcast</em> with specific flags and ordering guarantees, for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding ordering:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>total order</em> means that all messages have just one strict ordering and way to compare them, much like 3 is always greater than 2.</li>
<li><em>partial order</em> means that some messages can compare with some messages, but not necessarily all of them. For example, I could decide that all the updates to the key <code>k1</code> can be in a total order regarding each other, but independent from updates to the key <code>k2</code>. There is therefore a <em>partial</em> order between all updates across all keys, since <code>k1</code> updates bear no information relative to the <code>k2</code> updates.</li>
<li><em>causal order</em> means that all messages that depend on other messages are received after these (you can't learn of a user's avatar before you learn about that user). It is a specific type of partial order.</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't a "best" ordering, each provides different possibilities and comes with different costs, optimizations, and related failure modes.</p>

<h5>Idempotence</h5>


<p>Idempotence is important enough to warrant its own entry. Idempotence means that when messages are seen more than once, resent or replayed, they don't impact the system differently than if they were sent just once.</p>

<p>Common strategies is for each message to be able to refer to previously seen messages so that you define an ordering that will prevent replaying older messages, setting unique IDs (such as transaction IDs) coupled with a store that will prevent replaying transactions, and so on.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2187821">Idempotence is not a medical condition</a> for a great read on it, with various related strategies.</p>

<h4>State Machine Replication</h4>


<p>This is a theoretical model by which, given the same sequences of states and the same operations applied to them (disregarding all kinds of non-determinism), all state machines will end up with the same result.</p>

<p>This model ends up being critical to most reliable systems out there, which tend to all try to replay all events to all subsystems in the same order, ensuring predictable data sets in all places.</p>

<p>This is generally done by picking a leader; all writes are done through the leader, and all the followers get a consistent replicated state of the system, allowing them to eventually become leaders or to fan-out their state to other actors.</p>

<h4>State-Based Replication</h4>


<p>State-based replication can be conceptually simpler to state-machine replication, with the idea that if you only replicate the state, you get the state at the end!</p>

<p>The problem is that it is extremely hard to make this fast and efficient. If your state is terabytes large, you don't want to re-send it on every operation. Common approaches will include splitting, hashing, and bucketing of data to detect changes and only send the changed bits (think of <code>rsync</code>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle trees</a> to detect changes, or the idea of a <code>patch</code> to source code.</p>

<h3>Practical Matters</h3>


<p>Here are a bunch of resources worth digging into for various system design elements.</p>

<h4>End-to-End Argument in System Design</h4>


<p>Foundational practical aspect of system design for distributed systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>a message that is sent is not a message that is necessarily received by the other party</li>
<li>a message that is received by the other party is not necessarily a message that is actually read by the other party</li>
<li>a message that is read by the other party is not necessarily a message that has been acted on by the other party</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion is that if you want anything to be reliable, you <em>need</em> an end-to-end acknowledgement, usually written by the application layer.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2014/11/14/end-to-end-arguments-in-system-design/">Overview by the morning paper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf">Actual paper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">Wikipedia page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are behind the design of TCP as a protocol, but the authors also note that it wouldn't be sufficient to leave it at the protocol, the application layer must be involved.</p>

<h4>Fallacies of Distributed Computing</h4>


<p>The fallacies are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network is reliable</li>
<li>Latency is zero</li>
<li>Bandwidth is infinite</li>
<li>The network is secure</li>
<li>Topology doesn't change</li>
<li>There is one administrator</li>
<li>Transport cost is zero</li>
<li>The network is homogeneous</li>
</ul>
<p>Partial explanations on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">Wiki page</a> or full ones in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322500050_Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing_Explained">the paper</a>.</p>

<h4>Common Practical Failure Modes</h4>


<p>In practice, when you switch from Computer Science to Engineering, the types of faults you will find are a bit more varied, but can map to any of the theoretical models.</p>

<p>This section is an informal list of common sources of issues in a system. See also <a href="https://ferd.ca/beating-the-cap-theorem-checklist.html">the CAP theorem checklist</a> for other common cases.</p>

<h5>Netsplit</h5>


<p>Some nodes can talk to each other, but some nodes are unreachable to others. A common example is that a US-based network can communicate fine internally, and so could a EU-based network, but both would be unable to speak to each-other</p>

<h5>Asymmetric Netsplit</h5>


<p>Communication between groups of nodes is not symmetric. For example, imagine that the US network can send messages to the EU network, but the EU network cannot respond back.</p>

<p>This is a rarer mode when using TCP (although it has happened before), and a potentially common one when using UDP.</p>

<h5>Split Brain</h5>


<p>The way a lot of systems deal with failures is to keep a majority going. A split brain is what happens when both sides of a netsplit think they are the leader, and starts making conflicting decisions.</p>

<h5>Timeouts</h5>


<p>Timeouts are particularly tricky because they are non-deterministic. They can only be <em>observed</em> from one end, and you never know if a timeout that is ultimately interpreted as a failure was actually a failure, or just a delay due to networking, hardware, or GC pauses.</p>

<p>There are times where retransmissions are not safe if the message has already been seen (i.e. it is not idempotent), and timeouts essentially make it impossible to know if retransmission is safe to try: was the message acted on, dropped, or is it still in transit or in a buffer somewhere?</p>

<h5>Missing Messages due to Ordering</h5>


<p>Generally, using TCP and crashes will tend to mean that few messages get missed across systems, but frequent cases can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The node has gone down (or the software crashed) for a few seconds during which it missed a message that won't be repeated</li>
<li><p>The updates are received transitively across various nodes. For example, a message published by service <code>A</code> on a bus (whether Kafka or RMQ) can end up read, transformed or acted on and re-published by service <code>B</code>, and there is a possibility that service <code>C</code> will read <code>B</code>'s update before <code>A</code>'s, causing issues in causality</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>Clock Drift</h5>


<p>Not all clocks on all systems are synchronized properly (even using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a>) and will go at different speeds.</p>

<p>Using a timestamp to sort through events is almost guaranteed to be a source of bugs, even moreso if the timestamps come from multiple computers.</p>

<h5>The Client is Part of the System</h5>


<p>A very common pitfall is to forget that the client that participates in a distributed system is part of it. Consistency on the server-side will not necessarily be worth much if the client can't make sense of the events or data it receives.</p>

<p>This is particularly insidious for database clients that do a non-idempotent transactions, time out, and have no way to know if they can try it again.</p>

<h5>Restoring from multiple backups</h5>


<p>A single backup is kind of easy to handle. Multiple backups run into a problem called <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5414/2010fa/publications/BM93.pdf">consistent cuts</a> (<a href="https://blog.mattchung.me/2021/02/13/distributed-system-snapshots-consistent-vs-inconsistent-cuts/">high level view</a>) and distributed snapshots, which means that not all the backups are taken at the same time, and this introduces inconsistencies that can be construed as corrupting data.</p>

<p>The good news is there's no great solution and everyone suffers the same.</p>

<h4>Consistency Models</h4>


<p>There are dozens different levels of consistency, all of which are documented on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model">Wikipedia</a>, by <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p181-bailis.pdf">Peter Bailis' paper on the topic</a>, or overviewed by <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models">Kyle Kingsbury post on them</a></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Linearizability</em> means each operation appears atomic and could not have been impacted by another one, as if they all ran just one at a time. The order is known and deterministic, and a read that started after a given write had started will be able to see that data.</li>
<li><em>Serializability</em> means that while all operations appear to be atomic, it makes no guarantee about <em>which</em> order they would have happened in. It means that some operations <em>might</em> start after another one and complete before it, and as long as the isolation is well-maintained, that isn't a problem.</li>
<li><em>Sequential consistency</em> means that even if operations might have taken place out-of-order, they will appear as if they all happened in order</li>
<li><em>Causal Consistency</em> means that only operations that have a logical dependency on each other need to be ordered amongst each other</li>
<li><em>Read-committed</em> consistency means that any operation that has been committed is available for further reads in the system</li>
<li><em>Repeatable reads</em> means that within a transaction, reading the same value multiple times always yields the same result</li>
<li><em>Read-your-writes</em> consistency means that any write you have completed must be readable <em>by the same client</em> subsequently</li>
<li><em>Eventual Consistency</em> is a kind of special family of consistency measures that say that the system can be inconsistent as long as it eventually becomes consistent again. <em>Causal consistency</em> is an example of eventual consistency.</li>
<li><em>Strong Eventual Consistency</em> is like <em>eventual consistency</em> but demands that no conflicts can happen between concurrent updates. This is usually the land of <em>CRDTs</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while these definitions have clear semantics that academics tend to respect, they are not adopted uniformly or respected in various projects' or vendors' documentation in the industry.</p>

<h4>Database Transaction Scopes</h4>


<p>By default, most people assume database transactions are linearizable, and they tend not to be because that's way too slow as a default.</p>

<p>Each database might have different semantics, so the following links may cover the most major ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/transaction-iso.html">PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html">MySQL</a> (depends on the storage engine used)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">Transact-SQL</a> (most of Microsoft's products)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E25178_01/server.1111/e25789/consist.htm">Oracle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that while the PostgreSQL documentation is likely the clearest and most easy to understand one to introduce the topic, various vendors can assign different meanings to the same standard transaction scopes.</p>

<h4>Logical Clocks</h4>


<p>Those are data structures that allow to create either total or partial orderings between messages or state transitions.</p>

<p>Most common ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps">Lamport timestamps</a>, which are just a counter. They allow the silent undetected crushing of conflicting data</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">Vector Clocks</a>, which contain a counter per node, incremented on each message seen. They can detect conflicts in data and on operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector">Version Vectors</a> are like vector clocks, but only change the counters on state variations rather than all event seens</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ricardobcl/Dotted-Version-Vectors">Dotted Version Vectors</a> are fancy version vectors that allow tracking conflicts that would be perceived by the client talking to a server.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ricardobcl/Interval-Tree-Clocks">Interval Tree Clocks</a> attempts to fix the issues of other clock types by requiring less space to store node-specific information and allowing a kind of built-in garbage collection. It also has <a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/itc2008.pdf">one of the nicest papers ever</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>CRDTs</h4>


<p>CRDTs essentially are data structures that restrict operations that can be done such that they can never conflict, no matter which order they are done in or how concurrently this takes place.</p>

<p>Think of it as the specification on how someone would write a distributed redis that was never wrong, but only left maths behind.</p>

<p>This is still an active area of research and countless papers and variations are always coming out.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>Mozilla Corp., which manages the open-source Firefox browser, announced today that Mitchell Baker is stepping down as CEO to focus on AI and internet safety as chair of the nonprofit foundation. Laura Chambers, a Mozilla board member and entrepreneur with experience at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/airbnb/" target="_blank" rel="">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/paypal-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="">PayPal</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/ebay/" target="_blank" rel="">eBay</a>, will step in as interim CEO to run operations until a permanent replacement is found.</p><div>



<p>Baker, a Silicon Valley pioneer who co-founded the Mozilla Project, says it was her decision to step down as CEO, adding that the move is motivated by a sense of urgency over the current state of the internet and public trust. “We want to offer an alternative for people to have better products,” says Baker, who wants to draw more attention to policies, products and processes to challenge business models built on fueling outrage. “What are the connections between this global malaise and how humans are engaging with each other and technology?”</p>



<p>Chambers says she plans to focus on building out new products that address growing privacy concerns while actively looking for a full-time CEO. Prior to being recruited to the Mozilla board three years ago, Chambers says she was feeling “pretty disillusioned” about society because of the influence of money in politics and the growing power of the tech giants. “I was confused about what to do and this felt like a genuine way to make an impact.”</p>



<p>Chambers says she won’t be seeking a permanent CEO role because she plans to move back to Australia later this year for family reasons.&nbsp; “I think this is an example of Mozilla doing the right role modelling in how to manage a succession,” says Chambers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move comes at a time when Mozilla has no choice but to reimagine its role in a world dominated by Big Tech and AI. Firefox, which launched 20 years ago to challenge the dominance of Internet Explorer and once accounted for more than 30% of the global browser market, has shrunk to low single digits in a world dominated by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="">Google</a> Chrome. Mozilla now makes most of its almost $600 million in annual revenue from promoting Chrome as the default search engine on its home page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But AI has given the nonprofit foundation and its cofounder Baker a fresh sense of mission in creating alternatives to tackle deepfakes, data privacy issues and the power of big tech. It launched&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/" target="_self" rel="">a Mozilla.ai startup</a>&nbsp;last year and Mozilla Corp. is focused on product extensions like Mozilla Monitor that wipe subscribers’ data off the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Baker, success is about influencing the conversation and giving consumers, as well as developers, a meaningful choice in how they operate online. “Our goal is to build something different,” she says, “business models with some societal purpose and public benefit” that give users meaningful control over their data. “The qualities of online life can be improved.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive navigate the changing needs of the workplace. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/chro-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=chro_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The police intelligence services unlawfully monitored entire population groups, the Supervisory Committee of the Intelligence and Security Services (CTIVD) said. In the four-month period between February 23 and July 1, 2022, they crossed that line three times, <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2508037-inlichtingendiensten-onderzochten-onrechtmatig-hele-bevolkingsgroepen">NOS</a> reports.</p>

<p>All police units throughout the Netherlands have their own intelligence service. They work with the general intelligence service AIVD and monitor people who could pose a threat to national security. According to the CTIVD, these intelligence services sometimes receive a signal “about a person or a few persons” and then decide to investigate an entire community based on that. </p>

<p>There are strict requirements in Dutch law for monitoring an entire community due to the massive invasion of privacy that entails. The intelligence service must first look into obtaining information about suspects in a different way and carefully consider whether such a broad investigation is a proportionate matter.</p>

<p>Between February 2023 and July 1, 2022, that did not happen in three investigations, the CTIVD said. The supervisory body did not say which communities were involved but did explain that by “community,” it means a population group “based, for example, on ethnicity, religious belief, or occupational group.” So, theoretically, the police intelligence services may have been spying on visitors to a certain mosque or protesting farmers. The CTIVD did tell the “Stiekem Committee” - the parliamentary committee that supervises the CTIVD - which communities were involved.</p>

<p>Harm Trip of the CTIVD told NOS that the police intelligence services monitor communities more often, but in these three cases, they did not give proper substantiation for why they needed to do so. </p>

<p>Responsible Minister Hugo de Jonge (Home Affairs) said the police need to properly justify why they monitor entire communities. But he added: “I would like to emphasize that the approach of the investigations in all cases is focused on a threat perspective.” And then it may be necessary to get a picture of an entire community, which is allowed under certain conditions, he said. “It is inevitable that the ethnic background of people who are part of a particular community will be taken into account, but it is not the purpose of the investigation,” he said. </p>

<p>In response to the CTIVD revelation, D66 parliamentarian Joost Sneller demanded a broader debate in parliament about better supervision of the intelligence and security services. SP parliamentarian Michel van Nispen is also critical. “We already knew that individuals have been followed in a sloppy manner, but it is even worse for entire communities,” he said. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Electric Toothbrushes" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2024/02/06/electric-toothbrushes.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p><em>Update added below with Fortinet's&nbsp;statement confirming our reporting.</em></p>
<p>A widely reported story that 3 million electric toothbrushes were hacked with malware to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is likely a hypothetical scenario instead of an actual attack.</p>
<p>Last week, Swiss news site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/wirtschaft/kriminalitaet-die-zahnbuersten-greifen-an-das-sind-die-aktuellen-cybergefahren-und-so-koennen-sie-sich-schuetzen-ld.2569480?reduced=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aargauer Zeitung</a>&nbsp;published a story stating that an employee of cybersecurity firm Fortinet said 3 million electric toothbrushes had been infected with Java malware to conduct DDoS attacks against a Swiss company.</p>
<p>"The electric toothbrush is programmed with Java, and criminals have unnoticed installed malware on it - like on 3 million other toothbrushes," reads the article.</p>
<p>"One command is enough and the remote-controlled toothbrushes simultaneously access the website of a Swiss company. The site collapses and is paralyzed for four hours. Millions of dollars in damage is caused."</p>
<p>The story is dramatic and definitely newsworthy, if accurate, and began sweeping through other technology news sites yesterday, with numerous publications covering the alleged attack without verifying the story.</p>
<p>However, there is one problem with the story—there is no record that this attack ever happened.</p>
<p>Fortinet, who was attributed as the source of the article, has not published any information about this attack and has not responded to repeated requests for comment from BleepingComputer since the "toothbrush botnet" story went viral yesterday.</p>
<p>A DDoS attack is when an attacker sends enough requests or data at a website to overwhelm its resources or bandwidth so that it can no longer accept requests from legitimate visitors, effectively making the site unusable.</p>
<p>This type of attack has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-ddos-attacks-are-taking-down-even-the-largest-tech-companies/" target="_blank">increasingly used by hacktivists</a>&nbsp;to protest a country's or business's activities or by threat actors who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/" target="_blank">use them to extort businesses</a>.</p>
<p>To conduct these attacks, routers, servers, and IoT devices are hacked by brute forcing or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/15-percent-of-all-iot-device-owners-dont-change-default-passwords/" target="_blank">using default passwords</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mirai-ddos-malware-variant-expands-targets-with-13-router-exploits/" target="_blank">exploiting vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Once a device is compromised, malware is installed to enlist it as part of their DDoS botnet and use it on attacks. These devices are then collectively used to launch powerful attacks against a specified target.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1194682/iot-connected-devices-vertically/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Statista</a>, approximately 17 billion IoT devices connected to the internet are expected to be connected to the internet by the end of 2024, offering a massive footprint of devices that could potentially be recruited into DDoS botnets.</p>
<p>However, it is doubtful that 3 million electric toothbrushes would be exposed to the internet so that they could be infected with malware.</p>
<p>Instead, this was likely a hypothetical scenario shared by Fortinet with the newspaper that was misunderstood or taken out of context to create a story that is widely disputed by security experts.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1755059487663067489" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Rob tweet" height="350" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/attacks/t/toothbrush-ddos/rob2.jpg" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, electric toothbrushes do not connect directly to the internet but instead use Bluetooth to connect to mobile apps that then upload your data to web-based platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that a massive hack like this could only have been achieved through a supply chain attack that pushed down malicious firmware to the devices.</p>
<p>However, there is no record of this happening. If it did, it would be a much bigger story than a DDoS attack.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata/status/1755051642032964024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Remy Tweet" height="233" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/attacks/t/toothbrush-ddos/remy.jpg" width="500"></a></p>
<p>While a story of a toothbrush DDoS botnet taking down a site is amusing (and almost definitely untrue), it’s still a good reminder that threat actors would target any Internet-exposed device.</p>
<p>This includes routers, servers, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), printers, and web cameras.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential for any device exposed to the internet to have the latest security updates and strong passwords to prevent them from being recruited into DDoS botnets.<br>
The good news is that it likely won't be your toothbrush, so keep brushing.</p>
<p><em>Update 2/7/24 5:45 PM ET:&nbsp;</em>As expected, Fortinet told BleepingComputer that this was a hypothetical scenario and not a real attack.</p>
<p>"To clarify, the topic of toothbrushes being used for DDoS attacks was presented during an interview as an illustration of a given type of attack, and it is not based on research from Fortinet or FortiGuard Labs. It appears that due to translations the narrative on this topic has been stretched to the point where hypothetical and actual scenarios are blurred." - Fortinet.</p>
<p>FortiGuard Labs has also told BleepingComputer that they have not observed any IoT botnets targeting toothbrushes or similar embedded devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past few months we have been working hard to provide a fast, reliable and secure KVM backend for VirtualBox. VirtualBox is a multi-platform Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) with a great feature set, support for a wide variety of guest operating systems, and a consistent user interface across different host operating systems.</p><p>Cyberus Technology’s KVM backend allows VirtualBox to run virtual machines utilizing the Linux KVM hypervisor instead of the custom kernel module used by standard VirtualBox. Using KVM comes with a number of benefits.</p><p>Our customers use virtualization to isolate different security domains from each other. They rely on further hardening of the host system for additional security. This kind of hardening is needed to get certification from government bodies and as a result a hard requirements for our customers.</p><p>In client scenarios, Windows is often the guest system of choice. A lot of the security features that get built into Windows rely on virtualization. In cases where Windows is already virtualized, additional support from the Hypervisor is needed to enable those features. KVM provides a lot of the needed support to improve Windows’ security in virtualized environments.</p><p>In addition, modern hardware comes with many features that enhance virtualization performance, such as interrupt virtualization. All of the use cases above are currently difficult to support with the stock VirtualBox kernel module. However, the open-source KVM module, which is included in the Linux kernel by default, supports these use cases easily.</p><p>Furthermore, it is now possible to use VirtualBox and QEMU in parallel and we can even throw Cloud Hypervisor in the mix, just for the fun of it! This opens up some interesting use cases, as each of these frontends comes with a different set of priorities, benefits, and drawbacks. Isolating security critical services in a Cloud Hypervisor VM while the user-visible Windows guest runs in a VirtualBox VM could provide an improved security / user-experience trade-off.</p><p><img alt="VirtualBox and Qemu running in parallel on a Linux host" decoding="async" height="1200" loading="lazy" src="https://cyberus-technology.de/_astro/vbox_qemu_sidebyside.mBjM0HZX_UMnKI.webp" width="1920"></p><p>As a result of our work, our customers can enjoy faster virtual machines, better security, and broader support for hardware and guest use cases.</p><h2 id="open-source-release">Open-Source Release</h2><p>Since we care about open-source, we are also releasing our changes under an open-source license on <a href="https://github.com/cyberus-technology/virtualbox-kvm">GitHub</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>While deploying Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at Meta, we’ve developed a simplified version of the protocol (Simple Precision Time Protocol – SPTP), that can offer the same level of clock synchronization as unicast PTPv2 more reliably and with fewer resources.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In our own tests, SPTP boasts comparable performance to PTP, but with significant improvements in CPU, memory, and network utilization.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We’ve made the source code for the SPTP client and server available on</span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/time"> <span>GitHub</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We’ve previously spoken in great detail about</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/"> <span>how Precision Time Protocol is being deployed at Meta</span></a><span>, including </span><span>the protocol itself and Meta’s precision time architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>As we deployed PTP into one of our data centers, we were also evaluating and testing alternative PTP clients. In doing so, we soon realized that we could eliminate a lot of complexity in the PTP protocol itself that we experienced during data center deployments while still maintaining complete hardware compatibility with our existing equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>This is how the idea of Simple Precision Time Protocol (SPTP) was born.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But before we dive under the hood of SPTP we should explore why the IEEE 1588</span><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8265.1/en"> <span>G8265.1</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8275.2/en"> <span>G8275.2</span></a><span> unicast profiles (here, we just call them PTP) weren’t a perfect fit for our data center deployment.</span></p>
<h2><span>PTP and its limitations</span></h2>
<h3><span>Excessive network communication</span></h3>
<p><span>A typical IEEE 1588-2019 two-step PTPv2 unicast UDP flow consists of the following exchange:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_20920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20920"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=916,503 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=96,53 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=192,105 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20920">Figure 1: Typical two-step PTPv2 exchange.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>This sequence repeats either in full or in part depending on the negotiation result. The exchange shown is one of many possible combinations. It may involve additional steps such as grant cancellation, grand cancellation acknowledgements, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>The frequency of these messages may vary depending on the implementation and configuration. After completing negotiation, the frequency of some messages can change dynamically.</span></p>
<p><span>This design allows for a lot of flexibility, especially for less powerful equipment where resources are limited. In combination with multicast, it allows us to support a relatively large number of clients using either very old or embedded devices. For example, a PTP server can reject the request or confirm a less frequent exchange if the resources are exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span>This design, however, leads to excessive network communication, which is particularly visible on a</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/11/open-source/time-appliance/"> <span>time appliance</span></a><span> serving a large number of clients.</span></p>
<h3><span>State machine</span></h3>
<p><span>Due to the “subscription” model, both the PTP client and the server have to keep the state in memory. This approach comes with the tradeoffs such as:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Excessive usage of resources such as memory and CPU.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Strict capacity limits that mean multicast support is required for large numbers of clients.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Code complexity.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fragile state transitions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These issues can manifest, for example, in so-called abandoned syncs – situations where the work of a PTP client is interrupted (either forcefully stopped or crashed). Because the PTP server didn’t receive a cancellation signaling message it will keep sending sync and followup packets until the subscription expires (which may take hours). This leads to additional complexity and fragility in the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There are additional protocol design side effects such as:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An almost infinite Denial of Service Attack (DoS) amplification factor.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Server-driven communication with little control by the client.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Complete trust in the validity of server timestamps.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Asynchronous path delay calculations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In data centers, where communication is typically driven by hundreds of thousands of clients and multicast is not supported, these tradeoffs are very limiting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>SPTP</span></h2>
<p><span>True to its name, SPTP significantly reduces the number of exchanges between a server and client, allowing for much more efficient network communication.</span></p>
<h3><span>Exchange</span></h3>
<figure id="attachment_20921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20921"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg 1080w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=916,916 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=1024,1024 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=192,192 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20921">Figure 2: Typical SPTP exchange.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In a typical SPTP exchange:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The client sends a delay request.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The server responds with a sync.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The server sends a followup/announce.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The number of network exchanges is drastically reduced. Instead of 11 different network exchanges as shown on Figure 1 and the requirement for client and server state machines for the duration of the subscription, there are only three packets exchanged and no state needs to be preserved on either side. In the simplified exchange, every packet has an important role:</span></p>
<h4><span>Delay request</span></h4>
<p><span>A delay request initiates the SPTP exchange. It’s interpreted by a server not only as a standard delay request containing the correction field (CF1) of the transparent clock, but also as a signal to respond with sync and followup packets. Just like in a two-step PTPv2 exchange, it generates T3 upon departure from the client side and T4 upon arrival on the server side.</span></p>
<p><span>To distinguish between a PTPv2 delay request and a SPTP delay request, the PTP profile Specific 1 flag must be set by the client.</span></p>
<h4><span>Sync</span></h4>
<p><span>In response to a delay request, a sync packet would be sent containing the T4 generated at an earlier stage. Just like in a regular two-step PTPv2 exchange, a sync packet will generate a T1 upon departure from the server side. While in transit, the correction field of the packet (CF2) is populated by the network equipment.</span></p>
<h4><span>Followup/announce</span></h4>
<p><span>Following the sync packet, an announce packet is immediately sent containing T1 generated at a previous stage. In addition, the correction filed from the Delay Request field is populated by the CF1 value collected at an earlier stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The announce packet also contains typical PTPv2 information such as clock class, clock accuracy, and so on. On the client side, the arrival of the packet generates the T2 timestamp.</span></p>
<p><span>After a successful SPTP exchange, default two-step PTPv2 formulas for mean path delay and clock offset must be applied:</span></p>
<p><em><span>mean_path_delay = ((T4 – T3) + (T2-T1) – CF1 -CF2)/2</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>clock_offset = T2 – T1 – mean_path_delay</span></em></p>
<p><span>After every exchange the client has access to the announce message attributes such as time source, clock quality, etc., as well as the path delay and a calculated clock offset after every exchange with every server. And, because the exchange is client-driven, the offsets could be calculated at the exact same time. This avoids a situation where a client is following a faulty server and has no chance of detecting it.</span></p>

<h3><span>Reliability</span></h3>
<p><span>We can also provide stronger reliability guarantees by using multi-clock reliance.</span></p>
<p><span>In our implementation for precision time synchronization, we provide time as well as a window of uncertainty (WOU) to the consumer application via the fbclock API. As we described in a previous blog post on</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/"> <span>how PTP is being deployed at Meta</span></a><span> the WOU is based on the observation of time sync errors for the minimum duration to have stationarity of the state of the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, we’ve established a method based on a collection of clocks that each client can access for timing information that we call a </span><i><span>clock ensemble</span></i><span>. The clock ensemble operates in two modes, steady state and transient; where steady state is during normal operation and transient is in the case of holdover.</span></p>
<p><span>However, with a pool of N clocks, C, forming the clock ensemble, the question becomes which clocks to select for determining robustness and accurate timing information. Clocks that are not accurate are rejected (C_reject) and, thus, our ensemble size falls to N = C_total –&nbsp; C_reject. We employ two stages, one that is based on each individual clock, and the second that acts on the collection of valid clocks in the ensemble.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first stage observes the previous measurements of each individual clock, where the main criteria is to reject outliers in the previous states of the clock. Once this criterion threshold is exceeded, the entire clock is rejected from the valid clock ensemble pool. This is based off</span><a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/chauvenets-criterion/"> <span>Chauvenet’s criterion</span></a><span>, where the criterion is a probability band that is centered on the mean of the clock outputs (assuming a normal distribution during steady state). Based on the stationarity tests, we use a sample size of 400 previous clock outputs and calculate a maximum allowable deviation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example:</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D%5Cge%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CC%20-%20%5Cbar%7BC%7D%7C%7D%7BS_%7Bc%7D%7D">, where <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20C"> is the current clock output, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%5Coverline%20C">&nbsp;</span><span>is the clock sample mean, and <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20S_%7Bc%7D"> </span><span>is the clock set standard deviation.</span></p>
<p><span>We find the probability that the current clock output is in disagreement with the previous 400 samples:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%7BP_%7Bz%7D%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%28400%29%7D%20%5Capprox%200.9993%7D"></p>
<p><span>Based on a window size of 400 previous samples, the maximum allowed deviation is:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D%20%3D%203.2272"></p>
<p><span>Now, the clock outputs are tested against this value. If they exceed the <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D">&nbsp;</span><span>they are rejected, an alert is raised, and a threshold counter is incremented. Once the rejection threshold is reached for an individual clock, this clock is entirely rejected.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we enter the second stage of verifying the clock ensemble composed of the valid clocks. The second stage forms a weighted average of the non-rejected clocks in the valid clock ensemble, where each clock in the ensemble is reported as its sample size, mean, and variance. The average of the clocks’ means is the weighted average, where the weights are inversely proportional to the mean absolute deviations reported by each clock after applying Chauvenet’s criterion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now we can report the mean and variance of the clock ensemble, ensuring the clocks contained therewith are valid and not providing erroneous values. The confidence interval is scaled with the number of good clocks in the ensemble, where the higher the number of valid clocks out of the total clocks provides greater reliability.</span></p>
<p><span>For a number of hosts, we show that the distribution of clocks falls within the following heatmap:</span></p>

<p><span>We calculate the variance, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20v_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, of each individual clock’s observations, then we calculate a weighted mean, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, taking into consideration the reciprocal of each clock’s variance as the weight.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bv%7D%7Bk%7D%7D%7D%2C%20C%20%3D%20%5B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bv_%7Bk%7D%7D%5D%5E%7B-1%7D"></p>
<p><span>Due to independence of clocks, the variance of the weighted sum, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, is:</span></p>

<p><span>In summary, we collect samples from a number of clock sources that form our clock ensemble. The overall precision and reliability of the provided data by SPTP is a function of the number of reliable and in distribution clocks forming the clock ensemble.</span></p>
<p><span>A future post will focus on this specifically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>SPTP’s performance</span></h2>
<p><span>Let’s explore performance of the SPTP versus PTP.</span></p>
<p><span>Initial deployments to a single client confirmed no regression in the precision of the synchronization:</span></p>

<p><span>With large-scale deployment of our implementations, we can confirm resource utilization improvements.</span></p>
<p><span>We noticed that due to the difference in multi-server support, the performance gains vary significantly depending on the number of tracked time servers.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, with just a single time appliance serving the entire network there are significant improvements across the board. Most notably over 40 percent CPU, 70 percent memory, and 50 percent network utilization improvements:</span></p>

<h2><span>The next steps for SPTP at Meta</span></h2>
<p><span>Since SPTP can offer the exact same level of synchronization with a lot fewer resources consumed, we think it’s a reasonable alternative to the existing unicast PTP profiles.</span></p>
<p><span>In a large-scale data center deployment, it can help to combat frequently changing network paths and create savings in terms of network traffic, memory usage, and number of CPU cycles.</span></p>
<p><span>It will also eliminate a lot of complexity inherited from multicast PTP profiles, which is not necessarily useful in the trusted networks of the modern data centers.</span></p>
<p><span>It should be noted that SPTP may not be suitable for systems that still require subscription and authentication. But this could be solved by using PTP TLVs (type-length-value).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, by removing the need for subscriptions, it’s possible to observe multiple clocks – which allows us to provide higher reliability by comparing the time sync from multiple sources at the end node.</span></p>
<p><span>SPTP can offer significantly simpler, faster, and more reliable synchronization. Similar to G.8265.1 and G.8275.2 it provides excellent synchronization quality using a different set of parameters. Simplification comes with certain tradeoffs, such as missing signaling messages, that users need to be aware of and decide which profile is the best for them.</span></p>
<p><span>Having it standardized and assigned a unicast profile identifier will encourage wider support, adoption, and popularization of PTP as a default precise time synchronization protocol.</span></p>
<p><span>The source code for the SPTP client and the server can be accessed on our</span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/time"> <span>GitHub page</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<!-- Dealing with failure in complex computer systems mostly comes down to following your
human intuition. If a website is unavailable, what do you usually do? Just wait a bit and
try again. Still can't open it? Wait a bit more, maybe try again tomorrow. This approach
somewhat describes [exponential backoff], a popular technique used by libraries to re-try
failed HTTP requests.

Humans are great at dealing with failure. We have been growing up in the real world where
everything can go wrong, and our brains will easily pattern match the most effective way
of recovery to a specific failure. -->
<p>When it comes to computer systems, The <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> programming platform has an
interesting approach to failure handling. It's also widely known under the name "let it
crash". The core idea behind it has to do with the fact that modern applications have a
huge number of states that they can find themselves in. The more complex your application
is, the more variables you need to keep track of everything. Eventually it becomes
impossible for developers to predict all combinations of state that these variables will
form. Once your app gets into an undesirable state, the best thing you can do is to reset
it and start from a fresh, well known and correct state.</p>
<p>This works amazingly well together with Erlang's property that each process has a separate
memory space. Allowing us to selectively reset only parts of our application, while
keeping the system as a whole running. Then we can divide the application into a tree-like
structure and keep restarting parts of it until we reach the root and are forced to
restart the whole thing. This concept is also known as <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ">supervision trees</a>.</p>
<p>If you take a closer look at Erlang's approach, this is exactly what a human would do. If
your phone gets stuck playing a video, you will try restarting the app, and if this
doesn't fix it, you might end up restarting your phone. Or even the router of your home
internet connection. You intuitively know that propagating the failure through your home
will eventually bring all devices into a state that resembles the one when you first set
everything up and everything was working.</p>
<span>
Even sometimes Erlang's claims around resilience and fault tolerance are a bit
<b><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26447543" target="_blank">overblown</a></b>, I
still think that it's a very powerful way to deal with failure.</span> If my web app
breaks, the first thing I do is to restart the server. In the majority of cases this
immediately fixes the issue, while I dive deeper into the logs trying to figure out what
went wrong. Having this automatic restarting capability at every level of abstraction in
your app, will definitely help you sleep better.
<p>However, resetting the state is almost never enough. In the phone example, once the phone
starts up again, you still need to get back into the state where you stopped. This usually
means finding the video again and jumping back to the right point on the timeline. We are
partially reconstructing the state where we stopped, but ignoring all the other state
where things might have gone wrong, like our home internet connection being broken.</p>
<p>For humans, it's easy to approximately remember where we stopped watching a video, but for
an application it's impossible to reconstruct the state without the developer explicitly
keeping track of it. In Erlang, this would mean that we have one process as part of our
supervision tree that, for example, every second writes down how far the video got. Once
it's restarted as part of a parent supervisor, it will know how to restore the state from
disk.</p>
<h3 id="durable-execution">Durable Execution</h3>
<p>This brings me to a recent discovery I made, another approach to dealing with failure that
completely blew my mind 🤯. It's commonly known under the name durable execution, and is
so new that most developers never have heard of it. It's an elegant solution to the
"keeping track of the execution" problem, and perfectly complements Erlang's approach.</p>
<p>The simplest way of thinking of it is as <span>a database for compute
progression</span>. It stores the minimal amount of data to be able to reconstruct your
application's sate at any time. It makes your local variables indestructible, and for many
scenarios you will not even require a traditional database anymore.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could just start an arbitrary computation and the system guarantees that
it will run until completion and all the operations will be performed <strong>exactly once</strong>.
Even if your app needs to be restarted in the middle. Or even if you need to stop the
computation, move it to a different machine and continue. <span> Your
running code suddenly becomes this tangible thing, that you can look at, move and play
with.</span></p>
<p>All this intrigued me so much that I started working on my own engine for durable
execution called <strong><a href="https://flawless.dev/">flawless</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>
For structuring your page, you can use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element inside of the body.
It will be automatically centered on the page, with a maximum width of 640px, like the page you are reading right now.
</p>
<p>
To isolate the title of your page, and make it bigger, you can use the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element.
You can see an example at the top of this page.
</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element to separate between the different sections.
The section will simply be given some bottom padding.
</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element will center the text inside of it.
You can see an example at the bottom of this page.

          <div itemprop="text" id="post_1">
              <p>It is with great sadness that we announce John’s death on Friday, February 2, 2024. He was born in Maryland, USA to William and Bertha Walker, who preceded him in death. John is survived by his wife Roxie Walker and a brother, Bill Walker of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Declining to follow in his family tradition of becoming a medical doctor, John attended Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to pursue a future in astronomy. However, after he discovered the brave new world of computers, he never looked back. John worked at the university’s Project Chi (X) computing center where he studied computer science and earned a degree in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>John met Roxie on Thanksgiving Day in 1972, and they married the following year. Roxie and John drove cross-country a few months later for John’s new job in California. Eventually he left that first job and worked at various others in the bay area. In late 1976, John designed his own circuit board based on the then-new Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor. This venture became Marinchip Systems, and eventually led to Autodesk.</p>
<p>The beginnings of Autodesk are well documented by John himself in <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/">The Autodesk File</a> and from there John’s story is best told by John himself in his prodigious work, which is all methodically organized and available to the public at his website <a href="https://fourmilab.ch/">Fourmilab</a>.</p>

              <p>Former Ricochet/Ratburger member 10Cents writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First off, I suppose I should say I don’t feel up to the task to write a tribute for John Walker. I am sure others are more able. That is true, but here is my Dime’s worth.</p>
<p>I got to know John Walker on the <a href="http://ricochet.com/">ricochet.com</a> audio meet-ups (AMUs). He was a regular caller. Someone recently said that he was on those for over ten years. The AMU started at Ricochet but after I left there I started various ones which John joined. First at BallDiamondBall, then Ratburger which became the Scanalyst AMU without me. My guess he spent at least five hours a week since there were two or three calls per week. The AMUs were started by Curious John then through attrition I was left in charge. Now CTlaw is Mr. AMU.</p>
<p>I admired John for kindness in explaining things to almost anyone. I also appreciated his off-beat humor and stories. I learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>I don’t know about others, but I felt unbelievably surprised that someone like John would spend time with me. For me it was like going to the candy store but instead of candy it was insights and ideas. He brought so much to the table.</p>
<p>John was easy to take for granted because he was always there. He was a fixture in our lives. That fixture is gone. It is a struggle to think of life without him. It is hard not to cry at times.</p>
<p>I don’t know why John enjoyed our company but he did. I remember he teasing me when I came on a call. “There goes the neighborhood.” One of the last calls he invited me to “The Cheap Seats”. This was a part of his site where public domain movies could be seen. I am glad that the Ratburger experience showed him the way to start a forum site. He loved interacting with people on Scanalyst. And didn’t have the frustration of Wordpress there.</p>
<p>For those of us who got a lot of John’s time there are unending memories. For those of us who got a lot of John’s time, we struggle without the voice and wit we relied upon. I for one bow my head and humbly say thanks. I do wish I could have had a little bit more though.</p>
<p>I remember that John gave to this community day in and day out for years, first at Ratburger then at Scanalyst. He didn’t get a break. I calculate it was about six years. I am writing this post to fulfill my debt of gratitude to a kind man</p>

    </div><p>Repeat concussions, also referred to as repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, some people who experience repetitive mild traumatic brain injury never develop major disease.</p>

                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                    <p>Onder Albayram and colleagues investigated the role of a protein known as p17 in protecting brains from long-term pathologies. In stressed neurons, p17 initiates production of C18-Ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid that acts as a label of damaged <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mitochondria/" rel="tag">mitochondria</a> in neuronal axons. The study is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae018/7601436">published</a> in the journal <i>PNAS Nexus</i>.</p>
<p>Labeled mitochondria are then detected and removed by autophagosomes. The authors knocked out p17 in mice. Some p17-knockout mice underwent a new experimental model of repetitive concussive <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+injury/" rel="tag">brain injury</a>, known as the repetitive less-than-mild closed head injury (rlmTBI) paradigm.</p>
<p>These mice developed significant sensorimotor deficits after three months. By six months, the mice had cognitive deficits. Control mice showed no behavioral impairments.</p>
<p>In the rlmTBI p17-knockout mice's brains, the authors found compromised and disarranged membranes in axonal mitochondria. In normal mice, these mitochondria would have been destroyed, but since that process was interrupted, the dysfunctional organelles persisted, and caused <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/axonal+degeneration/" rel="tag">axonal degeneration</a>, which in turn led to pathological outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors developed a mitochondrial targeted pyridinium-ceramide analog drug, LCL768, which accumulates in damaged mitochondria and restores the process by which these organelles are removed.</p>
<p>In mice, treatment with LCL768 prevented the development of secondary axonal degeneration and led to improved functional outcomes compared to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag">mice</a> who received a placebo.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors examined <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+tissue/" rel="tag">human tissue</a> from six neuropathologically verified CTE cases with a history of repetitive traumatic brain injury. The CTE-positive samples exhibited less p17 expression and less mitochondrial C18-Ceramide than six age- and sex-matched healthy control samples.</p>
<p>According to the authors, drugs that ensure a healthy pool of axonal mitochondria in the brain could be candidates for use as prophylactic treatments after a concussion.</p>

      <p dir="auto">This is the initial work for the upcoming 3.0 release, which will be based on full rewrite in Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">I've contemplated this, but I didn't have as many good reasons to justify it in the past. However, there's plenty of good reasons for me to do a Rust rewrite now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Amongst other things the rewrite will:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>allow easy integration of <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/avt">avt</a> (which is written in Rust) to implement things like conversion to pure text, and give asciinema insight into what is actually happening in a terminal, enabling many more features</li>
<li>allow easy integration of <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/tst">tst</a> (which is written in Rust) to implement terminal live streaming</li>
<li>allow easy integration of <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/agg">agg</a> (which is written in Rust) so one doesn't need to install a separate tool</li>
<li>make startup faster - desired when automatically recording all shells/terminal tabs</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Last but not least, I enjoy working with Rust much much more than with Python :)</p>

When I heard that the United States could not produce sufficient 155 mm artillery shells to supply Ukraine, I thought it sounded odd. I knew essentially nothing about artillery save I would want to be on the other end of one. I was generally aware </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47751" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the industrial base for the defense industry had either atrophied or specialized or both</a><span>, depending on your perspective. Maybe this was just over-specialization? A dependency on a single part? Maybe it is a reliance on something exotic? Surely, there must be an explanation, something that would help me understand why we are so ill-prepared. Maybe there is some new technology that could be applied? This is a record of what I learned for the benefit of a more-educated citizenry and to save time for anyone else investigating the issue.</span></p><p>I approached this first to understand and second to know if-and-how I could help. My understanding is far from perfect—I went for breadth more than depth, often sacrificing detailed measurements in order to go fast. This is the short version.</p><ul><li><p>There is a shortage because our lone factory’s maximum capacity is 28,000 units (i.e. 24 ku) per month in the face of Ukraine asking for 600,000 units (600 ku) per month.</p></li><li><p><span>The major shortage is with producing </span><strong>steel casings</strong><span> for the artillery shells.</span></p><ul><li><p>The materials required to make these shells are relatively plentiful.</p></li><li><p>If you were to remove the casings bottleneck, other bottlenecks are possible. However, the next step (filling shells with explosive materials) is simpler to optimize vs. moving and precisely shaping a hundred pounds of steel at 2000°F.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There is no technological shortcut to producing more of these.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>3D printing is not viable. The metal itself is too precise to be printable with current technology, and the size of the shells would pose an issue.</p></li><li><p>Existing facilities use automation, but newer facilities will integrate more automation to improve quality and throughput.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Producing shells requires specific machine tools to accommodate the weight/heat and specially forming the nozzle. The tools themselves are fairly common, especially the furnaces; however, a factory optimized for building shells won’t be effective at building much else.</p></li><li><p>The existing production facility is part of a national landmark district, complicating expanding the existing facility.</p></li><li><p>The Department of Defense’s (DOD) current primary path forward is building a new facility in Garland, TX with modern automation and inspection equipment. Assuming it is contributing to the goal of scaling to 100ku per month of production by early 2025, it will have taken 3 years since hostilities started and 2 years since a contract was awarded for it to be online.</p></li><li><p>Building additional capacity is largely in DOD’s hands, as defense contractors are unwilling to build facilities without long-term (15 year) contracts. Today, the DOD typically awards 3-4 year contracts.</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, I am left with the impression that the US’ solution to problems that require building things is to avoid it at all costs. Congress is loathe to fund munition supplies that are never used, and defense contractors are loathe to build factories that sit idle (and despite what Hollywood may portray, everyone wants deterrence, not actual conflict). Though Congress and DOD are funding a new facility, 3-4 years will have passed before it produces a shell, which is entirely unhelpful in a present conflict. Instead, the DOD is attempting to plug the Ukraine-sized hole with shells from allied nations including Canada, South Korea, Finland, and Germany—places where it’s still possible to build new things.</p><p>I believe in alliances, especially when it is the free people of the world standing against aggression from authoritarians. What troubles me here, though, is that the US is pursuing that option because the domestic defense industrial base, inclusive of DOD and its contractors, is sclerotic. It treats time like it’s free. It does not respond quickly. It does not build or innovate around current problems, because of a combination of disincentives from DOD’s own structure and the pervasive challenges of trying to run a manufacturing business in the US. These are largely own goals. If the DOD would write longer term contracts. If we did not declare essential production facilities to be historic landmarks, strangling expansion. I did not even want to get into why GOCOs exist or the labyrinth of DOD procurement, but it is sufficient to say they both pose challenges to doing anything new or different. My solace is that in a real conflict, all of that red tape would be put to the side and people can get about building things. There will be a multi-year lag between when that crisis happens and how fast the factories can return, and I hope we can weather that storm.</p><p>Could an entrepreneur change this equation? Anduril’s success is a testament that with the right application of influence and creativity, new companies can compete effectively against the prime contractors. I am less certain that is a possibility here for a few reasons. The primary concern is getting an ROI in 3-4 years on the capital required to build such a facility. You either need a technological edge that dramatically reduces the capital expense, or you need to be able to blend production with other commercial goods (i.e. dual use). For the former, I do not see a dramatically cheaper option unless there is some arbitrage on cheaper electric arc furnaces and presses. For the latter, 3D printing could be an answer, if the material properties existed. However, metal 3D printing companies are struggling with sales as-is, reflecting a lack of commercial demand for commercial 3D printed metal parts. Therefore, even with the steel needed, I am confident it would be a battle to keep them full the rest of the time. This only gets harder without a technological edge like 3D printing, as it would be a sub-scale, commodity steel mill likely optimized for an application with only one real customer. </p><p>The rest of the post is specific research questions I had with the best quality of answers I could find and cited. Questions include:</p><ul><li><p><em>What is the 155 mm artillery shell?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How big is the gap between what we can produce and what is needed?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What does the supply chain for 155 mm shells look like?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Where’s the shortage?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How are casings made?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Can 3D printing help?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What kind of tools are used in the existing process?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What is the maximum capacity for the existing infrastructure?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What’s the yield among existing producers? Can it be improved?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Can they expand existing facilities?</em></p></li><li><p><em>If they’re going to get to 100ku per month by 2025, how are they going to do it?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How long does it take to set up a new plant? Why?</em></p></li><li><p><em>The need for 155 mm shells is unique to European wars. Why worry about this if the risk is a war in the Pacific?</em></p></li><li><p><em>In a direct conflict, what would we do?</em></p></li></ul><p>If you see anything incorrect or do additional research, please let me know.</p><p>Throughout the war in Ukraine, the 155mm shell has been a weapon of choice. Without air superiority, the 155 mm shell combines range, lethality, fire rate, and mobility to project force up to 20 miles. With small, cheap drones spotting for them, the army of Ukraine was able to consistently halt quantitatively superior Russian advances.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png" width="574" height="375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:574,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Base bleed variant of a M795 155 mm artillery, shown for its diagram of a M795 shell.

The basic requirements of an artillery shell are that it must withstand great force to be launched, before another explosion breaks the shell into fragments. The first force—launch—requires a high yield strength, such that the metal won’t deform (yield) under that pressure. In the vernacular, yield strength = yeet distance, while the fragmentation characteristics of the metal relate to the lethality. HF-1 was selected because of how predictable it shatters while maintaining a high yield strength. Everything you could ever want to know about this steel and its competitors is available in a report that Bethlehem Steel put together in 1973: Producibility of Artillery Shells Made from HF-1 Steel available here: </span><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0763988.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AD0763988.pdf (dtic.mil)</a></p><p>Additionally, Military Times visited the factory and put together a good video of the process, minus the technical details but plus a lot of the operational details: </p><div id="youtube2-3vbyoz6ETPc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3vbyoz6ETPc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3vbyoz6ETPc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Roughly, the process is:</p><ol><li><p>Precisely cutting 20’ lengths of steel scrap into billets</p></li><li><p>Billets are heated to 2000 °F</p></li><li><p>Billets are pressed into shape</p></li><li><p>Billets are cooled and shot-blasted</p></li><li><p>Billets are polished</p></li><li><p>Copper bands are added</p></li><li><p>The billet’s nose is heated and formed to shape&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Metal is heat-treated again before an oil bath</p></li><li><p>Casings are polished and washed again</p></li><li><p>Casings are given threads to fit fuses and rifling of the barrels</p></li><li><p>Casings are treated with phosphate, painted, and set aside for transport</p></li></ol><p>Given my experience in the 3D printing industry, this question was top of mind. A core problem for DOD and the defense contractors is that they have to build custom production lines to surge demand. But if there’s no conflict in Europe, these machines are mostly idle. 3D printing is essentially a line designed to be changed much faster, as you can make many different shapes. In theory, with a fleet of metal printers, you could be making war components when necessary and making commercial parts in peacetime. They would almost certainly be more expensive than a dedicated production line, but if the US doesn’t want to pay the capital for it, at least this would be an option. Unfortunately, the short answer is no, 3D printing can’t help here, at least not with today’s technology.&nbsp;</p><p>I am not aware of any metal 3D printer capable of making HF-1 steel or any other high-silicon, high-carbon steel. Metal 3D printing is still pretty limited with some vendors offering questionable material properties that are not attempting to touch high-performance steels. It makes sense the machine vendors wouldn’t prioritize a metal without much commercial appeal.</p><p>The other operative question is if a shell casing would fit in the build volume of a current 3D printer. Given the shells are 858 mm in length and 155 mm in diameter, they fit in the build chamber of Velo3D’s 1MZ printers (315x1000 mm and 600x1000 mm), though it looks like they exceed the existing build plate options. In that orientation, they would also have an extremely long print time.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.jmc.army.mil/Installations.aspx?id=ScrantonOverview" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Army overview page</a><span> for the facility lists the following:</span></p><ul><li><p>Multiple long stroke vertical hydraulic forge press lines</p></li><li><p>Capability to produce large mortar projectiles</p></li><li><p>In house metallurgical testingIn house metallurgical testing</p></li><li><p>Over 120 hydraulic tracer and CNC lathes</p></li><li><p>Machining capability exceeding current ammunition manufacturing requirements</p></li><li><p>In house end-to-end production processes, no outsourcing requirements&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Multiple automated paint lines&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Multiple heat treat furnaces that austenitize, quench, and temper</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png" width="1076" height="840" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:840,&quot;width&quot;:1076,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><span>From a 2017 brochure covering SCAAP’s capabilities: </span><a href="https://www.jmc.army.mil/thumbnails/pdfs/Scranton%20brochure%202017%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Scranton brochure 2017 Final.pdf (army.mil)</a></em></p><p><span>In February 2023, the US Army released some information about SCAAP: SCAAP is a leading producer of large-caliber artillery metal parts and components and can effectively and efficiently manufacture runs from small batch quantities to </span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263789/secretary_of_the_army_discusses_modernization_efforts_during_scaap_visit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">more than one million annually</a><span>”. 1mu annually would be a little over 83ku per month. Of course, in PR speak, they didn’t say they could make 83ku 155 mm shells per month—presumably they can make 83ku of something, maybe a mix of things, if all their lines were running flat out.</span></p><p><span>Given the US was flatout at the end of 2024 at 24ku per month with existing infrastructure, I assume all of that was coming from Scranton AAP. In 2022, the US government authorized an additional $243 million to “</span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263789/secretary_of_the_army_discusses_modernization_efforts_during_scaap_visit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">help ramp up production lines and help put in some new equipment that will allow the plant to be able to produce more shells at a higher rate</a><span>”. I assume some of that money went to scale production from 14ku to 24ku per month, but I can only guess how much remains to be added.</span></p><p>If you ask in the right rooms, the answer you get is there is room for improvement. Allegedly, the site’s structure as a GOCO disincentivizes optimizing yield. The contractor gets paid the same for operating it as-is, and if the government wants to fix it up, they would have to put in the time and energy.</p><p>Beyond the existing retrofits, you must be willing to let go of some history. Scranton AAP started life in 1908 as a steam locomotive erecting and repair facility. With trains on the decline, it was established as an army ammunition plant in 1953 but sits in a larger national historic district and is listed on the National Registry of Historical Places. I imagine it is a spectacular testament to when we used to build stuff.</p><p><span>Build a new facility somewhere else.

With the tools and raw materials, the next question is having the right mix of people and automation to operate the tools. In a crunch like this, you would likely have more people initially while you quickly automated what you could. Training those workers would be key.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
