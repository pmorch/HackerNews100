<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>I have served as a voting member of the Harvard College Honor Council, the body tasked with upholding the College’s community standards of academic integrity.</span></p><p><span>In my time on the Council, I heard dozens of cases. When students — my classmates, peers, and friends — appear before the council, they are distraught. For most, it is the worst day of their college careers. For some, it is the worst day of their lives. They often cry.</span></p><p><span>It is because I have seen first-hand how heart-wrenching these decisions can be, and still think them necessary, that I call on University President Claudine Gay to resign for her numerous and serious violations of academic ethics.</span></p><p><span>Let’s compare the treatment of Harvard undergraduates suspected of plagiarism with that of their president.</span></p><p><span>A plurality of the Honor Council’s investigations concern plagiarism. In the 2021-22 school year, the last year for which data is publicly available, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/5/22/harvard-honor-council-2021-2022/">43 percent of cases involved plagiarism</a> or misuse of sources.</span></p><p><span>Omitting quotation marks, citing sources incompletely, or not citing sources at all constitutes plagiarism according to Harvard’s definitions.</span></p><p><span>In my experience, when students omit quotation marks and citations, as President Gay did, the sanction is usually one term of probation — a permanent mark on a student’s record. A student on probation is no longer considered in good standing, disqualifying them from opportunities like fellowships and study-abroad programs. Good standing is also required to receive a degree.</span></p><p><span>What is striking about the allegations of plagiarism against President Gay is that the improprieties are routine and pervasive.</span></p><p><span>She is accused of plagiarism in her dissertation and at least two of her 11 journal articles. Two sentences from the acknowledgement section of her dissertation even seem to have been copied from another work.</span></p><p><span>According to the Honor Council’s procedures, the response to a violation depends on the “seriousness of the infraction” and “extenuating circumstances, including the extent to which a student has had similar trouble before.” In other words, while a single lifted paragraph could be blamed on a lapse in judgment, a pattern is more concerning.</span></p><p><span>In my experience, when a student is found responsible for multiple separate Honor Code violations, they are generally required to withdraw — i.e., suspended — from the College for two semesters. Since the Council was established in 2015, roughly 16 percent of students who have appeared before us have been required to withdraw.</span></p><p><span>It is a serious thing for the Council to render this judgment, and I have never taken any such vote lightly. Voting to suspend a peer with whom I might share a dorm, club, or class is not easy. We have even voted to suspend seniors just about to graduate.</span></p><p><span>But strict sanctions are necessary to demonstrate that our community values academic integrity. Cheating on exams is not okay. Plagiarism is not okay.</span></p><p><span>It may be true that the plagiarism allegations against President Gay fall short of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ interim policy on research misconduct. She may not have “intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly” tried to represent the work of her doctoral advisor and others as her own. And there is no evidence that any of her arguments posited as original contributions were plagiarized.</span></p><p><span>But President Gay’s pattern of mistakes is serious, and the Harvard Corporation should not minimize these allegations of plagiarism, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/12/gay-stays-in-office-corporation-support/">as it has readily done</a>.</span></p><p><span>In a Dec. 12 University-wide letter, the Corporation described the alleged plagiarism as “a few instances of inadequate citation.” The letter lauded President Gay for “proactively” correcting her articles by inserting citations and quotation marks.</span></p><p><span>By definition, Gay’s corrections were not proactive but reactive — she only made them after she was caught. And that the Corporation considers her corrections an adequate response is not fair to undergraduates, who cannot simply submit corrections to avoid penalties.</span></p><p><span>When my peers are found responsible for multiple instances of inadequate citation, they are often suspended for an academic year. When the president of their university is found responsible for the same types of infractions, the fellows of the Corporation “unanimously stand in support of” her.</span></p><p><span>There is one standard for me and my peers and another, much lower standard for our University’s president. The Corporation should resolve the double standard by demanding her resignation.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> In order to protect the author from retaliation, and because the proceedings of the Harvard College Honor Council are sensitive and confidential, we made the decision to grant this author anonymity.</em></span></p><p><span><em>Readers should also note that online commenting has been disabled for this piece in an effort to help protect the author’s identity.</em></span></p><p><span><em>—Tommy Barone and Jacob M.

I have rails guides bookmarked for this purpose - 5 minutes waiting for an uber gains me some useful knowledge while alleviating boredom.</p><p>- Search wide, be selective. A few good reads is better than a lot of average/bad ones. Be prepared to skip chapters if it isn't delivering value after 2-3 chapters, and quit entirely if you can't find worthy content after reading a few chapters + table of contents and skimming a few more chapters. Give it a little longer if you're unfamiliar with the topic or style.</p><p>- A lot of 200+ page books could have instead been 10 page essays. Quickly move over unimportant sections if you get the impression they're filler. Same (or, more so) for other mediums too.

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features from Fedora Linux (Kinoite &amp; Silverblue)</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A rock solid and stable base.</li>
<li>System packages stay relatively up to date.</li>
<li>Can layer Fedora packages to the image without losing them between updates.</li>
<li>Security focused with <a href="https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux">SELinux</a> preinstalled and configured out of the box.</li>
<li>The ability to rebase to different Fedora libostree images, if desired, without losing user data.</li>
<li>Printing support thanks to <a href="https://www.cups.org/" rel="nofollow">CUPS</a> being preinstalled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why</h2>
<p dir="auto">Bazzite started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS, mainly out of date packages (despite an Arch base) and the lack of a functional package manager.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite this project also being image-based, you are able to install any Fedora package straight from the command line. These packages will persist across updates <sub><sup>(So go ahead and install that obscure VPN software you spent an hour trying to get working in SteamOS)</sup></sub>. Additionally, Bazzite is updated multiple times a week with packages from upstream Fedora, giving you the best possible performance and latest features - all on a stable base.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bazzite ships with the latest Linux kernel and SELinux enabled by default with full support for secure boot <sub><sup>(Run <code>ujust enroll-secure-boot-key</code> and enter the password <code>ublue-os</code> if prompted to enroll our key)</sup></sub> and disk encryption, making this a sensible solution for general computing. <sup><sub>(Yes, you can print from Bazzite)</sub></sup></p>

<p>Meta's sudden interest in ActivityPub and Mastodon doesn't make much sense. There are a few impossibly consistent talking points floating through the Fediverse. Each tries to explain away the oddity of Meta's presence.</p>
<p>I don't buy <em>any of it</em>. This is a plan years in the making. And we're watching Meta's biggest hurdle play out in real-time.</p>
<p>What if Meta's hidden objective behind the Threads-to-Mastodon initiative is a play on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/app.net">app.net</a>? And, what if threads.net is a measured step towards what could be the greatest pivot in all of tech?</p>
<p>Put on your tinfoil hats, kids. Papa's got a story.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, Mark Zuckerberg has made moves that imply he's positioning Meta as a sort of <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> provider for social media companies.</p>
<p>This theory is in good company. Here's a 2019 tweet from "a member of Facebook's inner circle” reported by the Mostly Cloudy Newsletter<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to make a prediction: in five years, &gt;25% of Facebook Inc's revenue will comes from selling cloud services to other UGC companies to meet global compliance needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If successful, Meta would usher in a new social media era as the first lords of the "social web.” The aftermath could mean that Meta gains an unprecedented concentration of power over what we see, who we interact with, and where developers can build digital communities.</p>
<p>Indie developers could gain a much-needed revenue stream through an ad-share program, which would be great if it weren't Meta writing the checks. We saw what happened to small businesses and aggregator websites. We saw what almost happened to corporate media after Facebook launched Instant Articles.</p>
<p>Everyday-users would pay the highest price. We'd be left with little more than the illusion of choice, resembling something approaching Proctor &amp; Gamble's generic competitive strategy. We may gain the <em>technical</em> ability to move platforms with our followers and content in hand, but only so much as non-Meta affiliated social media exist. And perhaps not even then.</p>
<p>Meta must create a new market out of thin air to accomplish this monumental pivot. Such a feat could prove risky without something to compel indie developers and server admins to use Meta's shiny new infrastructure. That something could be regulation. Targeted lobbying has made it difficult for start-ups to compete in social media. Four new bills are floating around Congress. Each bill resembles Mark Zuckerberg's four-point plan.</p>
<p>Zuck's plan, published in the Washington Post, came one year after Cambridge Analytica and three months before the prediction tweet.</p>
<p>It sounds <em>absurd</em> that the biggest social media company would pivot from its golden goose. But when you peek into Meta's egg basket, you see it's empty. My guess is that goose was cooked a long time ago.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting it happens all at once. It'll take years to fully pivot. And it's not like Meta will give away the billions of users it currently serves. But a decision has been made, and action taken.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened: Zuck saw the writing on the wall, and he finally had enough— the congressional hearings, EU regulators, the impossible content moderation trap— all of it. It was time to get out of the social media game for good. Meta has the infrastructure skills and political influence to pull it off. He only needed the right angle to dip his toe in the water.</p>
<h3 id="mark-zuckerberg-s-four-point-plan" tabindex="-1">Mark Zuckerberg's Four-Point Plan <a href="#mark-zuckerberg-s-four-point-plan">#</a></h3>
<p>In 2019, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html">published an op-ed</a> in the Washington Post calling for more government regulation of social media. He identified four areas needing policy— harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and <strong>data portability</strong>.</p>
<p>From <em>Internet needs new rules. Let's start in these four areas, by Mark Zuckerberg, March 30th, 2019</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, regulation should guarantee the principle of data portability. If you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another. This gives people choice and enables developers to innovate and compete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg then announces his support for the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Project</a>.</p>
<p>The Data Transfer Project, or Data Transfer Initiative (no one can keep the name straight), was founded in 2018. It provides a common framework for internet-based service providers to transfer user data between each other.</p>
<p>The project (or initiative) has some big names attached to it—Google, Microsoft, and then Meta in 2019. Twitter may have dropped out recently, as it's no longer included in press coverage.</p>
<p>All involved with DTP/DTI frame their efforts as a step towards users' controlling their own data. Not so much the <em>type</em> of data big tech may collect on us or what it's allowed to do with it. Just the swapping part. There are a lot of folks jumping from Instagram to Microsoft these days?</p>
<p>On Meta's engineering website, the company <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2019/12/02/security/data-transfer-project/">writes in length</a> about the mission's importance and protocol's ease of use. But the tone for the project shifts within the context of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>A recent conference hosted by DTI (again with the name) announced guests from "the world's biggest ActivityPub projects" and Big Tech™. The <a href="https://dtinit.org/docs/dtp-federated-miniconference-report">event notes reveal</a> that participants were concerned with trust and safety challenges that arise with data transfers on ActivityPub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a baseline, the ability of users to migrate their data between federated services is desirable, but any naive approach to this goal is a loaded gun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's... <em>bleak</em>. Where have all the techno-optimists gone?</p>
<p>It's unclear which participants shared concerns, as statements were anonymous. Perhaps DTI implemented Chatham House Rules. The event also notes that it can't provide an investigation and appeals process because the Data Transfer Initiative is "a small organization.” I hope Meta sprung for lunch.</p>
<p>The ACCESS Act was introduced in 2019 and reintroduced in 2022 and 2023. It would make data portability required by law. The bill is still under revision.</p>
<p>The RESTRICT Act, SAFE TECH Act, and Kids Online Safety Act also float around Congress. Each addresses one point in Zuckerberg's four-point plan.</p>
<p>The final versions of these bills could be a public good. Or, it could make starting your own social media company only possible with supplemental infrastructure. My bet is on whatever history would suggest.</p>
<h2 id="threads-net-is-the-new-app-net-but-with-ads-and-interoperable" tabindex="-1">threads.net is the new app.net but with ads and interoperable <a href="#threads-net-is-the-new-app-net-but-with-ads-and-interoperable">#</a></h2>
<p>Consider a scenario where Meta leadership believed its business model was no longer viable long-term. What would their first step look like?</p>
<p>It might look a lot like the now-defunct app.net.</p>
<p>App.net was a microblogging platform that tried to compete with Twitter. App.net had a robust API that allowed 3rd party developers to build on its infrastructure. What made the start-up unique was that its founders encouraged developers to create social media platforms with their own branding, features, and experiences.</p>
<p>Threads.net would market itself similarly but with a few key differences— interoperability, content ownership, and a revenue split program. These flagship features make the platform attractive to small developers and server admins.</p>
<p>Threads.net's potential flagship features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interoperability ‌</strong>: All third-party apps are connected, or “federated”. Users can engage, follow, and migrate between apps easily.</li>
<li><strong>Content Ownership</strong>: Unlike app.net, third-party developers and users "own” their published data. Each third-party platform has a distinct URL where content lives.</li>
<li><strong>Ad revenue split</strong>: threads.net offers a turnkey ad delivery system. Qualifying third-party developers and admins can enroll in a revenue split program. If approved, they gain a dependable revenue stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>An ad-revenue split would likely gain enthusiastic participation in the tech community. Most indie devs scrape by for years, and that's if they're lucky. The poor saps who receive VC funding get to watch their best feature copied on Instagram.</p>
<p>The interoperable and data storage features would also be widely supported. Martin Reece, creator of Micro.blog wrote about app.net in his online book. He suggested that what the start-up got wrong was its centralization.</p>
<p>From&nbsp;<em>Indie Microblogging</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The app.net team got so much right —&nbsp;the early crowdfunding, the well-designed API, the developer story — that I didn't notice what they had left out until much later.&nbsp;<strong>All data lived at&nbsp;<code>app.net</code>&nbsp;URLs, and when the platform was gone, all the posts and data went with it. There was no way to own your content.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server admins would have their choice of third-party apps if they chose not to develop. For the adventurous, Meta would likely provide tools, resources, and UI kits for developing bespoke threads.net apps. Thanks to <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama</a>, Meta's open-source AI development tool, almost anyone can build their very own social media platform. Perhaps even large influencers with the means and desire to create a branded experience.</p>
<p>Meta's vision for threads.net won't be a cakewalk, though. This market doesn't actually exist. Except it does, and Meta has already leached onto its network. All Mastodon server admins need is a push in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="copy-acquire-and-kill" tabindex="-1">Copy, Acquire, and Kill <a href="#copy-acquire-and-kill">#</a></h2>
<p>In some ways, app.net failed where Mastodon succeeded. Eugene Rochko, Mastodon's CEO, has helped cultivate an impossibly vibrant social commons. He did it with zero ads, a decentralized network, and interoperable servers. If Meta could copy Mastodon's strategy, scale the ecosystem, and then monetize, it could pivot, <em>and</em> kill Mastodon at the same time.</p>
<p>The biggest lie in the Fediverse is that Mastodon is too small for Meta to care about. By all accounts and reason, that's simply not true. Zuck is in this impossible position because of how often and indiscriminately he kills off start-ups. Universities have <em>studied it.</em></p>
<p>Meta's <strong>Copy, Acquire, and Kill</strong> strategy is well documented. In 2020, Mark Zuckerberg faced a US Congress on allegations that Meta spies on small start-ups to identify targets for its insidious tactics.</p>
<p>Representative Pramila Jayapal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your company uses data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire, and kill rivals,” Jayapal added. "You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and to ensure that you always get your way."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some immediately apparent reasons why Meta is interested in Mastodon. None of which relate to building a better social media for regular folks. Mastodon has experienced server admins and nine million users that Meta can siphon after it fully invades the platform.</p>
<h2 id="a-thousand-little-nodes" tabindex="-1">A thousand little nodes <a href="#a-thousand-little-nodes">#</a></h2>
<p>My guess is Meta's plans are an open secret amongst the tech elite. A swarm of new micro blogging nodes are already buzzing around ActivityPub with great enthusiasm— Flipboard, Mozilla, Tumblr, Medium, Post.News, Pebble (previously T2), WordPress, Vivaldi, and Mammoth, to name a few. Some are even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/28/mozilla-leads-mastodon-app-mammoths-pre-seed-funding/amp/">well-funded</a>. None seem to have a viable monetization strategy. Shareholders can't buy a third house with the spirit of the open web, you guys.</p>
<p>As Meta pushes forward, we'll see more of these little nodes. Each will offer something unique, and Threads will be careful not to overlap. Post.news interoperable with a no-news Threads is perfect, don't you think?</p>
<p>But here's the question— why ActivityPub?</p>
<p>This is a tougher nut to crack. On the one hand, the protocol is a perfect fit for Meta's threads.net ambitions. But wouldn't the Data Transfer Project Initiative meet those needs as well? Perhaps. But DTI's "mission” isn't necessarily social, and I think Meta wants to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Look, there are lots of good people with the best intentions at every level of that project- er, initiative. But surely, Meta will use DTI to migrate Mastodon users over to threads.net at some point. By isolating the social graph portability to ActivityPub, Meta can swap the protocol out with something proprietary (and more restrictive) once it ditches the Fediverse.</p>
<p>In the end, ActivityPub still exists, but its platforms are a virtual wasteland. Some version of Mastodon lives on through threads.net. But at what cost?</p>
<h3 id="mark-s-catch-22" tabindex="-1">Mark's Catch 22 <a href="#mark-s-catch-22">#</a></h3>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is in a bit of a pickle right now. If he could, I think he'd be cool just swallowing up start-ups and surfing with that white shit on his face the rest of his life. I think he wants to <em>avoid</em> pivoting to infrastructure. Was the whole Metaverse thing his last-ditch effort to do anything but Platform as a Service? I wonder.</p>
<p>Meta could've offered those services years ago. Instead, it routinely gives away its server architecture. Those contributions are the least objectionable thing about Meta.</p>
<p>But he can't <em>not</em> grow the company. Wall Street won't allow it. And he can't grow it through acquisition because of anti-trust. He's stuck.</p>
<p>After Cambridge Analytica, Meta couldn't buy a WordPress blog from Theme Forrest without the government up their ass. Zuck's biggest fear is anti-trust breaking up Instagram and WhatsApp. If he can remove the "Gatekeeper” characterization, he might have a chance to save his empire.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is Zuckerberg's only play. It's a good one, too. Effectively, four companies currently run the cloud. Barriers to entry are high, and infrastructure is costly. Just ask Meta. In the last four years, they've <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/11427952/facebook-showcases-its-40-million-square-feet-of-global-data-centers">spent billions</a> on non-Metaverse, non-AI data center expansion<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Today, all your favorite apps run on Amazon Web Services. Soon, all your social media will run on threads.net.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>

</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Since 2019, Meta grew from 15 to 21 data centers across the globe, with at least three more reportedly in construction. This activity is in <em>addition</em> to any Metaverse needs, as Meta signed a long-term contract with Amazon Web Services for its virtual reality computing. In February 2023, Data Center Frontier <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/21548840/meta-will-abandon-some-data-center-builds-run-servers-longer">reported Meta halted at least three data center projects</a>. Its architects achieved a breakthrough that extended the lifespans of its servers. Meta decided to include those updates in new centers, so it delayed construction. The improvements did <strong>not</strong> extend to AI-based servers. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

                  <p><span>Happy New Year everyone! HN will always remain in my heart and mind. 5 years ago I moved to Amsterdam to work on a super interesting R&amp;D project that taught me a lot about GPS, coordinate systems, algorithms, and sadly the importance of having a short commute. I spent an hour and a half to get in either direction. That was demotivating and made me depressed and tired. HN was how I passed time, first on the train, then on the bus, reading curated articles and through thoughtful comments. I couldn't have managed without you all. Once again, I wish you all a Happy New Year and luck in all your endeavours!</span></p></div></td></tr>

Thanks to everyone making Hacker News both an interesting and welcoming space to hang out!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4836335289577539405" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I've studied a lot of chips from the 1970s and 1980s, so I usually know what to expect.
But an Ethernet chip from 1982 had something new: a strange layer of yellow wiring on the die.
After some study, I learned that the yellow wiring is a second layer of resistive polysilicon, used in
the chip's static storage cells and latches.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/poly.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip.

The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath." width="350"></a></p><p>A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath.</p>
<p>The die photo above shows a closeup of a latch circuit, with the diagonal yellow stripe in the middle.
For this photo, I removed the chip's metal layer so you can see the underlying circuitry.
The bottom layer, silicon, appears gray-purple under the microscope, with the active silicon regions slightly darker and bordered in black.
On top of the silicon, the pink regions are polysilicon, a special type of silicon.
Polysilicon has a critical role in the chip: when it crosses active silicon, polysilicon forms the gate of
a transistor. The circles are contacts between the metal layer and the underlying silicon or polysilicon.
So far, the components of the chip match most NMOS chips of that time.
But what about the bright yellow line crossing the circuit diagonally? That was new to me.
This second layer of polysilicon provides resistance. It crosses over the other layers, connected to the silicon at the ends with
a complex ring structure.</p>
<p>Why would you want high-resistance wiring in your digital chip? To understand this, let's first look at
how a bit can be stored.
An efficient way to store a bit is to connect two inverters in a loop, as shown below.
Each inverter sends the opposite value to the other inverter, so the circuit will be stable in two states,
holding one bit: a 1 or a 0.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/inverters.jpg"><img alt="Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit." height="161" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/inverters-w350.jpg" title="Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit." width="350"></a></p><p>Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit.</p>
<p>But how do you store a new value into the inverter loop? There are a few techniques.
One is to use pass transistors to break the loop, allowing a new value to be stored.
In the schematic below, if the <em>hold</em> signal is activated, the transistor turns on, completing the loop.
But if <em>hold</em> is dropped and <em>load</em> is activated, a new value can be loaded from the input into the inverter loop.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/pass-latch.png"><img alt="A latch, controlled by pass transistors." height="133" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/pass-latch-w300.png" title="A latch, controlled by pass transistors." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch, controlled by pass transistors.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use a weak inverter that produces a low-current output.
In this case, the input
signal can simply overpower the value produced by the inverter, forcing the loop into a new state.
The advantage of this circuit is that it
eliminates the "hold" transistor. However, a weak inverter turns out to be larger than a regular inverter,
negating much of the space saving.<span id="fnref:size"><a href="#fn:size">1</a></span> (The Intel 386 processor uses this type of latch.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/weak-latch.png"><img alt="A latch using a weak inverter." height="87" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/weak-latch-w300.png" title="A latch using a weak inverter." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch using a weak inverter.</p>
<p>A third alternative, used in the Ethernet chip, is to use a resistor for the feedback, limiting the
current.<span id="fnref:power"><a href="#fn:power">2</a></span>
As in the previous circuit, the input can overpower the low feedback current.
However, this circuit is more compact since it doesn't require a larger inverter.
The resistor doesn't require additional space since it can overlap the rest of the circuitry, as shown in the
photo at the top of the article.
The disadvantage is that manufacturing the die requires additional processing steps to create the resistive
polysilicon layer.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/latch-resistor.png"><img alt="A latch using a resistor for feedback." height="86" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/latch-resistor-w300.png" title="A latch using a resistor for feedback." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch using a resistor for feedback.</p>
<p>In the Ethernet chip, this type of latch is used in many circuits. For example, shift registers are built
by connecting latches in sequence, controlled by the clock signals.
Latches are also used to create binary counters, with the latch value toggled when the lower bits produce a carry.</p>
<h2>The SRAM cell</h2>
<p>It would be overkill to create a separate polysilicon layer just for a few latches.
It turns out that the chip was constructed with AMD's "64K dynamic RAM process".
Dynamic RAM uses tiny capacitors to store data. In the late 1970s, dynamic RAM chips started using
a "double-poly" process with one layer of polysilicon to form the capacitors and a second layer of polysilicon
for transistor gates and wiring (<a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/11/reverse-engineering-classic-mk4116-16.html">details</a>).</p>
<p>The double-poly process was also useful for shrinking the size of static RAM.<span id="fnref:patent-cell"><a href="#fn:patent-cell">3</a></span>
The Ethernet chip contains several blocks of storage buffers for various purposes. These blocks are implemented as static RAM,
including a 22×16 block, a 48×9 block, and a 16×7 block.
The photo below shows a closeup of some storage cells, showing how they are arranged in a regular grid.
The yellow lines of resistive polysilicon are visible in each cell.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/storage.jpg"><img alt="A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged." height="363" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/storage-w500.jpg" title="A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged." width="500"></a></p><p>A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged.</p>
<p>A static RAM storage cell is roughly similar to the latch cell, with two inverters in
a loop to store each bit.
However, the storage is arranged in a grid: each row corresponds to a particular word, and each column
corresponds to the bits in a word.
To select a word, a word select line is activated, turning on the pass transistors in that row.
Reading and writing the cell is done through a pair of bitlines; each bit has a bitline and a complemented bitline.
To read a word, the bits in the word are accessed through the bitlines.
To write a word, the new value and its complement are applied to the bitlines, forcing the inverters into
the desired state.
(The bitlines must be driven with a high-current signal that can overcome the signal from the inverters.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of one storage cell." height="195" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-schematic-w300.png" title="Schematic of one storage cell." width="300"></a></p><p>Schematic of one storage cell.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the physical layout of one memory cell, consisting of two resistors and four transistors.
The black lines indicate the vertical metal wiring that was removed.
The schematic on the right corresponds to the physical arrangement of the circuit.
Each inverter is constructed from a transistor and a pull-up resistor, and the inverters are connected into a loop.
(The role of these resistors is completely different from the feedback resistors in the latch.)
The two transistors at the bottom are the pass transistors that provide access to the cell for reads or writes.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-labeled.jpg"><img alt="One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic." height="408" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-labeled-w600.jpg" title="One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic." width="600"></a></p><p>One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic.</p>
<p>The layout of this storage cell is highly optimized to minimize its area. Note that the yellow resistors take
almost no additional area, as they overlap other parts of the cell.
If constructed without resistors, each inverter would require an additional transistor, making the cell larger.</p>
<p>To summarize, although the double-poly process was introduced for DRAM capacitors, it can also be used for SRAM cell pull-up resistors.
Reducing the size of the SRAM cells was probably the motivation to use this process for the Ethernet chip, with
the latch feedback resistors a secondary benefit.</p>
<h2>The Am7990 LANCE Ethernet chip</h2>
<p>I'll wrap up with some background on the AMD Ethernet chip.
Ethernet was invented in 1973 at Xerox PARC and became a standard in 1980.
Ethernet was originally implemented with a board full of chips, mostly TTL. 
By the early 1980s, companies such as Intel, Seeq, and AMD introduced chips to put most of the circuitry onto VLSI chips. 
These chips reduced the complexity of Ethernet interface hardware, causing the price to drop from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3kpkQKds0lAC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">$2000</a> to $1000.</p>
<p>The chip that I'm examining is AMD's Am7990 LANCE (Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet).
This chip implemented much of the functionality for Ethernet and "Cheapernet" (now known as 10BASE2 Ethernet).
The chip handles serial/parallel conversion,
computing the 32-bit CRC checksum, handling collisions and backoff, and recognizing desired addresses.
The chip also provides DMA access for interfacing with a microcomputer.</p>
<p>The chip doesn't handle everything, though.
It was designed to work with an Am7992 Serial Interface Adapter chip that encodes and decodes the bitstream
using Manchester encoding.
The third chip was the Am7996 transceiver that handled the low-level signaling and interfacing with the coaxial network cable, as well as
detecting collisions if two nodes transmitted at the same time.</p>
<p>The LANCE chip is fairly complicated.
The die photo below shows the main functional blocks of the chip.
The chip is controlled by the large block of microcode ROM in the lower right.
The large dark rectangles are storage, implemented with the static RAM cells described above.
The chip has 48 pins, connected by tiny bond wires to the square pads around the edges of the die.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Main functional blocks of the LANCE chip." height="597" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/die-labeled-w600.jpg" title="Main functional blocks of the LANCE chip." width="600"></a></p><p>Main functional blocks of the LANCE chip.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Since August 2018 I have run a social network site called Friend Camp for about 50 of my friends. I think Friend Camp is a really nice place, and my friends seem to agree that it has enriched our lives. I'd like to see more places like Friend Camp on the internet, and this document is my attempt to provide some practical guidance as to how you might run a social network site like this.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h3><a id="who-this-guide-is-for"></a>Who this guide is for</h3>
  <p>If you're tired of Facebook or Twitter or wherever else and have thought that there's got to be a better way, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you currently run a social network server for people besides just you, using software <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> or whatever else, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you have some programming experience, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you have no programming experience, this is for you.</p>
  <h3><a id="social-solutions-to-social-problems"></a>Social solutions to social problems</h3>
  <div>
    <p>This document exists to lay out some general principles of running a small social network site that have worked for me. These principles are related to community building more than they are related to specific technologies. This is because the big problems with social network sites are not technical: the problems are social problems related to things like policy, values, and power.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Running a social network site is community building first and a technical task second.</p>
  <p>And while community building is hard work, it's often worth it.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This is my pitch to you: using big social media sites is easy, but you pay a steep price for it. You should consider running your own site, which is harder, but can be extremely rewarding.</p>
    
  </div>

  <h2><a id="what-makes-a-small-social-network-site-different-from-a-big-one?"></a>What makes a small social network site different from a big one?</h2>
  <p>Friend Camp looks like this on a desktop web browser:</p>

    <figcaption>The phone view of Friend Camp.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div>
    <p>It's fairly Twitter-like at first blush: you post short messages, you can "@" individual users, you can follow and be followed, you can use hashtags, and you can boost things that you want your followers to see. While Friend Camp is small, the universe of content we have access to is big. We are connected to about 5,000 other communities on the web, allowing us to interact with hundreds of thousands of users if we want.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>So far, this seems like an underpowered Twitter, but there are some key differences from Twitter:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>you control the computer that runs the site</li>
  <li>you can modify the software that powers the site</li>
  <li>you get to make the rules and policies</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>Next I'll explain each of these in detail.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-control-the-computer-that-runs-the-site"></a>You control the computer that runs the site</h3>
  <p>Big social media sites all run on computers, usually a big complex network of computers. When you type "facebook.com" into your browser or load up your Facebook app, what happens is that your phone sends a message to a computer owned by Facebook, which then coordinates with a bunch of other computers owned by Facebook to collect all the information that is then displayed to you.</p>
  <p>In the context of Facebook, this means that everything you do on Facebook passes through computers that they control. And then they take the information about what you do and sell it to advertisers, directly or indirectly.</p>
  <p>But a small social network site doesn't need a huge complex network of computers. One computer can be enough. Often it's the kind of thing you can rent for $10 a month, or even run at home on an old computer you have lying around if you want.</p>
  <p>For example, Friend Camp <a href="#funding">costs about $30 a month to run</a>, it experiences about 10 minutes of down time each week, and it takes about 2 hours a week of my own time to maintain. I maintain the computer that Friend Camp's software runs on. I'm training another camper to be an administrator as well, so if something happens to me there is still someone who can make sure the site keeps going. The site is funded by campers who can afford to throw a few bucks a month at a Patreon that I run just for us. It's a small price to pay for a nice place to talk to friends on the internet.</p>
  <p>As a result of these economic realities, Friend Camp does not have the annoyances of big social network sites. We sell no data, we collect no extraneous data, there are no advertisements at all, and no major features get changed unless I talk to the campers about it first.</p>
  <p>Another result of these economic realities is that we're never going to grow much bigger than 50 active users. But that's okay, because it keeps costs low and we can still talk to people outside of our server.</p>
  <p>You might ask: how can one small computer replace something as huge as Facebook in my life? Well, the reason is that you control this one computer for your site, and then that computer talks to thousands of other computers, which gives you access to literally millions of people and organizations and videos and all sorts of other things. So what this does is replace thousands of computers owned by a single company with thousands of computers owned by thousands of different people.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-can-modify-the-software"></a>You can modify the software</h3>
  <div>
    <p>You don't have access to the code and the algorithms that Twitter uses to run their service. If I wanted Twitter to make it so that the word "tomato" always appears in bright red, I would have to submit a request to Twitter, and then they would laugh at me, and that would be the end of it. But on Friend Camp, I have the ability to change our code to do exactly that.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>A silly example of this kind of rule in action is <a href="https://dolphin.town/">Dolphin Town</a>, a fully functioning social network site that I started a couple years ago. Like Friend Camp, it's a modification of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. It behaves just like Mastodon with one important change: the only letter you are allowed to use is "E".</p>
  <div>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://runyourown.social/img/dolphin-town-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of Dolphin Town. It looks like Twitter except everyone is saying things like &quot;Eee, eee eee!&quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
      <figcaption>Dolphin Town in action.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
  </div>
  <p>The reason I can make these modifications is that Mastodon is <em>open source</em>. There are a lot of things that open source software enables, but for our purposes the important thing is that you can open up the software, tinker with it, and put it back together in its newly modified state.</p>
  <p>I made Dolphin Town to draw attention to something that I think a lot of people miss: if you run a social network based on open source software, you can fundamentally alter how it works to your liking, at least for the version that runs on the computer you own.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-get-to-makes-the-social-rules-and-policies"></a>You get to make the social rules and policies</h3>
  <p>On a big site like Facebook, if you encounter content that you think shouldn't be there, you need to ask Facebook to take it down.</p>
  <p>On a small site serving a small community, if the content comes from inside your community, then you can navigate it the way you navigate problems in small communities in the real world. You bring up with the rest of your community that someone is behaving in a way that is counter to the values of the community. It's unpleasant, but at least you have some control over that process, and it's something tangible that you can navigate.</p>
  <p>It's more work than simply letting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa">an army of underpaid and traumatized moderators</a> handle all of that for you. But it's worth it. (You might sense "it's hard work but it's worth it" as an ongoing theme.)</p>
  <h3><a id="wait,-who-is-%22you%22?"></a>Wait, who is "you"?</h3>
  <p>When I refer to "you" here I mean "your community" and "your decision making process". Some communities may have a single person who is kind of the "benevolent dictator". Other communities may run based on consensus or even more formal processes.</p>
  <p>Some servers are formal cooperatives that use <a href="https://www.loomio.org/">cooperative decision making tools like Loomio</a> to organize their node, which has its own advantages and drawbacks that I won't go into the details of here. Tools like Loomio are important when your group gets to a size that is too big to manage informally. This is why I am very much in favor of <a href="#keep-it-small">keeping these sites really small</a>, like way less than 100 people. It allows decision making to stay informal and means that running the site can be a hobby or a low-intensity community project instead of a full time job.</p>
  <p>And of course nothing is going to stop a corporation from running one of these sites either! But I don't recommend joining a corporate site; these things will eventually be driven by profit motive to replicate the same bad experience you get on the current social network sites that you hate.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="why-run-a-small-social-network-site?"></a>Why run a small social network site?</h2>
  <p>The main reason to run a small social network site is that you can create an online environment tailored to the needs of your community in a way that a big corporation like Facebook or Twitter never could. Yes, you can always start a Facebook Group for your community and moderate that how you like, but only within certain bounds set by Facebook. If you (or your community) run the whole site, then you are ultimately the boss of what goes on. It is harder work than letting Facebook or Twitter or Slack or Basecamp or  whoever else take care of everything, but I believe it's worth it.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Let's go back to Friend Camp. While there are a hundred thousand people we can talk to from Friend Camp, there are only about 50 people with an active Friend Camp login. We call ourselves "campers" because we are corny like that. And campers have a special communication channel that lets us post messages that only other campers can see.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Because we're mostly all friends with each other, this extra communications mode is kind of like a group chat on steroids. For our community it ends up being a sort of hybrid between Twitter and a group chat. As a result of having a community layer alongside a more public layer, we have a movie night, a book club, and a postcard club. Campers visit each other when we travel, even if we've never met in person before. We correspond with each other about what we're making for dinner and trade recipes. They're the kind of mundane interactions that you probably don't want to have with perfect strangers but you cherish in a group of people you care about.</p>
  <p>We are also able to have moderation rules that are hyper-specific to our own values as a community. It lets us maintain an environment that's far more pleasant than you find on most social media sites.</p>
  <p>And I can make custom features at the request of the people on the site. So if someone wants a particular kind of visual theme, or content filter, or a button to do something that the software can't do right now, I can make it happen, at least within the limits of my own ability.</p>
  <h3><a id="software-can-be-complicated-where-necessary"></a>Software can be complicated where necessary</h3>
  <p>There are certain things that are notoriously subtle and complex to communicate to users passively via a user interface. A classic example is security settings: Facebook, for example, offers a lot of decent security options but it can be overwhelming to many users. Of course, by having reasonable defaults you can get past this problem, but any default setting is at best going to work for some but not all users.</p>
  <p>For example, Mastodon has four levels of privacy available for your posts, ranging from "a private message to another person" to "anyone on the internet can see this". According to some discussions I've seen, one reason that Mastodon has been reluctant to add a "local-only" posting option to its service is that it multiplies that to a combination of eight total privacy settings. The idea is that it would confuse people and they would potentially use it wrong, which could lead to bad security breaches due to user error in dealing with a complex design.</p>
  <p>I agree with this in a situation where a user tries out Mastodon and has to learn to use it themselves. But in a case like Friend Camp, I can personally walk the user through what these complex features mean. I can tailor the instruction to their personal learning style and to their needs. Plus, I'm available to answer questions about it whenever they come up.</p>
  <p>I'll discuss this more below in the section <a href="#what-you-can-do-today">"What you can do today"</a>.</p>
  <p>All that said, there's no need for overly complicated software. It should be as simple as possible. But in cases like security and privacy I think the ability to granularly control your settings outweighs factors like ease of use.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-can-have-hyper-specific-norms"></a>You can have hyper-specific norms</h3>
  <p>Because of their need to have as many users as possible, big social network sites have to try to be everything to everyone. In practice this means they need to limit the number of people they alienate, which means they have to be very careful about what kinds of actions and speech they ban on their network. Every person they ban from their network is another set of eyeballs that could otherwise be looking at advertisements and making them money.</p>
  <p>In the end, this means everyone is going to be unhappy with the policies of a big site. You can see it right now on Twitter and Facebook: people on the left complain that these sites support right wing extremism, and people on the right complain that these sites support left wing extremism. And for a website with thousands of posts a second from hundreds of millions of potential sources that's aiming to please as many people as possible, both of these viewpoints are absolutely going to be true. There is no way to moderate this effectively, and you can never come up with rules for behavior that make millions of people happy.</p>
  <p>But on a small social network site, you can set hyper-specific norms. For example, Mastodon allows for "content warnings", where you hide content behind a text tag that you define for your post. It's often things like "nsfw" or "mental health discussion". This acts as a warning so people who don't want to read about that kind of stuff won't click through to see it. On Friend Camp, we generally tag anything related to United States politics as "uspol" — we didn't invent this tag, and lots of other servers use it too. I couldn't ever imagine people tagging politics tweets on Twitter, since Twitter styles itself as a news network, for the broadest possible interpretation of the word "news".</p>
  <p>You also don't need to implement some kind of draconian filtering system to have norms: you simply model the behavior you want to see, and remind people to act a certain way when they post outside of those norms. This kind of thing does not work well in a forum of even 200 people, but in the 50-ish range it is entirely doable.</p>
  <p>Your small social network site can have its own rules about, for example: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>what speech is acceptable</li>
  <li>what actions are considered violence</li>
  <li>what actions are considered protected speech or expression</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>This will be very different for every site and I think that's part of the beauty of this whole thing. I talk more about the specifics of this in the <a href="#what-you-can-do-today">"What you can do today" section</a> below.</p>
  <h3><a id="why-to-not-run-a-small-social-network-site"></a>Why to NOT run a small social network site</h3>
  <p>There are many reasons not to run a small social network site. As I've mentioned before and will continue to mention, it's really hard work. You need to at least have time for a hobby or figure out a way to get community support for doing it (maybe people chip in to keep things running; maybe you can trade in-kind services with your community members; etc.).</p>
  <div>
    <p>If you choose to run a site like this, it means that people will now depend on you for something that's important to them. People on Friend Camp are very forgiving when we have down time, and sometimes that down time can last hours if I'm asleep or at a movie or otherwise busy. Later in this document <a href="#keep-it-small">I discuss some cases where people had to abandon a site because it got too big and unwieldy to run</a>.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>But none of this is unique to running a social network site. I think all of this stuff applies if you take away the internet and computers entirely. This is exactly the cost of starting a community theater group, activist group, social group, sports club, book club, and so on. Even the bit about "down time" applies if you run a physical space like a theater. You can't be there for every performance but if something goes wrong with the building, you'd better have a plan to deal with it.</p>
  <p>In other words, the costs of running a small social network site end up being more or less the costs of starting, well, anything involving other people.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="what-you-can-do-today"></a>What you can do today</h2>
  <p>This section describes practices that anyone running Mastodon or similar software can do today to make for a cohesive, rewarding, and caring community. This section lays out some rules that have helped make Friend Camp a good place. The high level overview is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>keep the number of users on your server very small</li>
  <li>remember that your job is social first and technical second</li>
  <li>provide custom onboarding</li>
  <li>provide group activities</li>
  <li>provide custom features if you can</li>
  <li>enforce your code of conduct</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a id="keep-it-small"></a>Keep it small</h3>
  <p>It is absolutely necessary to have no more than 50 to 100 active users who log in to your online community.</p>
  <p>This is a number I am pulling out of my ass. And eagle-eyed readers will notice that I'm not even settling on a single number here. I know that 50 is a number that works as a cap, and I think anything more than 100 definitely does not work as a cap.</p>
  <div>
    <p>In my admittedly limited experience as a human being on this planet, you are not going to be able to form and maintain a cohesive group of more than about 50 to 100 people who all basically agree on values and moderation rules and that sort of stuff. Even as a group where people are mutually looking out for each other, you are not going to be able to meaningfully make sure everyone in that group's wellbeing is maintained. I don't have science to back this up. I have seen this happen in startups, in activist groups, and in internet forums.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p><strong>I can't stress enough how important it is to keep your numbers small.</strong> To draw from recent history, witches.town was one of the more popular Mastodon servers in 2017 and 2018. In mid-2018 there were a series of disagreements between the primary administrator and the users. I can't speak to the nature of these disagreements as I wasn't there but there were multiple disagreements about moderation policy, and also the primary administrator (who I believe actually owned the server and its domain) said they were burned out on running the server. In the end, the site was shut down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180307044118/https://witches.town/about/more">According to archive.org it had about 2400 registered accounts in April 2018</a>, shortly before the instance was deleted. If we look at instances of similar size today we can extrapolate that there were perhaps 500 active users on the server at the time it went dark. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627101519/https://knzk.me/about">KNZK</a> is another network site that shut down on June 30th 2019 and it had about 3100 registered accounts and 560 active users. It shut down due to maintenance tasks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627183952/https://knzk.me/@Knzk/102191413727426394">demanding too much time and effort from administrators</a>.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I posit that 500 active, invested community members will not be able to achieve a values-based harmony or consensus. It's simply too big to be possible. My assertion is not backed up by any studies I have read but rather my personal experience in online and offline groups of all kinds. You cannot wrangle consensus from 500 people. With that many active, committed community members you will necessarily have at least a few dedicated members who feel investment and ownership in the community who are also extremely unhappy with the direction of the community. </p>
    
  </div>
  <p>In addition to promoting group cohesion, having a small number of active users means moderation is completely achievable by a single person. With 50 active users I field, on average, one moderation request a month. This is in addition to me being vigilant and blocking bad actors as I see them. Now, this wouldn't be true if I had 50 random people who all signed up. But these are 50 users who are screened and onboarded into our community.</p>
  <p>Even tricky matters like delineating what is and is not acceptable speech become easier when you're dealing with a small community. For example, there may be some inalienable right for expression of disagreeable political speech, but if it is speech that all the people on your corner of the network agree you don't want to see, you can simply ban it internally and filter or block it externally.</p>
  <p>And when your community is small, you can use powerful tools that would be irresponsible to wield in a larger community. For example, when I discover a user on someone else's site engaging in speech that violates our local norms, I will often mute or ban the entire server that hosts the user in question on behalf of all the people on Friend Camp. This would be inadvisable on a huge network like Twitter, but on Friend Camp, we have all agreed we don't want to see certain things and we don't want to engage with other servers that allow for those types of speech.</p>
  <p>Of course, the question is how does this scale beyond those 50 people? Well, that is why I'm writing this guide. I think there should be thousands of these small servers talking to each other.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-are-the-party-host"></a>You are the party host</h3>
  <p>Running a small social network is like hosting a party. It requires social intelligence, empathy, and yes, technical skills.</p>
  <p>You might wonder what aspect of hosting a party is technical. I mean "technical" in the sense of "requiring technique and skill". Party hosts need all sorts of technical skills: managing RSVPs and calendars, planning and purchasing supplies, cooking and serving, wrangling a music playlist, etc. Not everyone is comfortable hosting a party because these are technical barriers to entry. Similarly, not everyone is comfortable running social network software because of technical barriers to entry.</p>
  <p>But as with hosting a party, technical skills aren't enough. You need to have social skills, or have someone assisting you who does.</p>
  <div>
    <p>For example, I need to maintain an understanding of everyone on the server. I have to remember what their individual needs are, which means that I need to be able to hold all of that information in my head. It's not a task that everyone is suited to, but it's critically important.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Among other things, my duty is to read the local timeline and catch up on everyone's posts. I need to take the temperature of the network and also provide social lubrication where necessary. ("Hey, you just mentioned you're traveling to Montreal! So-and-so lives there, maybe you should message them and see if they want to meet up.") Catching up on all local posts would take forever with hundreds of active users, but with dozens, I only have to read the timeline for 20 minutes a day.</p>
  <p>Do not fool yourself into thinking that your job as an administrator is primarily technical. It's social first, and technical second. If you want to only focus on the tech, then please find someone who cares deeply about the social organizing side and recruit them as a co-administrator.</p>
  <h3><a id="provide-a-custom-introduction-to-your-network-for-every-user"></a>Provide a custom introduction to your network for every user</h3>
  <p>Because you only have 50 people in your community, you are able to do all sorts of things that would never be possible in a larger group. One really important place where this comes into play is in new user onboarding.</p>
  <div>
    <p>When a new user joins Friend Camp, I now schedule a video chat with them (or an in-person chat if they are local). For one to three hours, I introduce them to Friend Camp and walk them through our basic features. I customize the content of the chat with them depending on their background. Generally we discuss the following topics:</p>
    
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>the basics of using Mastodon, tailored to the individual's needs</li>
  <li>how to find further help if they need it</li>
  <li>who <em>everyone</em> on the server is (I go down the list and explain in one sentence who every non-private user is, kind of like a party host might introduce guests to one another)</li>
  <li>our custom software features</li>
  <li>our group traditions and how to participate in them (movie night, for example)</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>If I know them to be social media power users, I'll spend more time on those kinds of features. If they are not very technical and need more basic training, then I spend more time on that. I'll ask them what kind of phone they use, and give them specific information about iOS or Android as needed.</p>
  <p>In addition to explaining who everyone else on the server is, I point out specific people who I think they might get along with. Again, it's like being a party host. If you know people in common or have common interests, I will mention that.</p>
  <p>This is one of those things that a small social network site can provide that a big site could <em>never</em> provide, because it just doesn't scale.</p>
  <h3><a id="group-activities"></a>Group activities</h3>
  <p>It's important to do things together as a group. Organize whatever makes sense for your community, and allow your community to organize as well.</p>
  <p>For example, on Friend Camp we have: movie night, book club, postcard club. Not everyone participates in these things, and that's okay too. But the option is there. The people on your site will probably want different activites than these specific ones, but the important thing about this is we are connecting through some kind of shared activity.</p>
  <h3><a id="keep-it-interconnected"></a>Keep it interconnected</h3>
  <p>The ultimate goal of the last three sections (hosting a party, custom onboarding, group activities) is to socialize everyone on your server with everyone else on your server.  Not everyone has to get along with or even interact with everyone else, but the more positive connections you build between people on your server the better a place it will be. Having a tight-knit group where lots of people know each other is key to the principle of maintaining <a href="#you-can-have-hyper-specific-norms">hyper-specific norms</a>.</p>
  <p>An interconnected network also helps with conflict resolution, so when things go "wrong" it's hardly noticeable. As one camper put it to me:</p>
  <blockquote>"Tiny scale conflict resolves between people without formal moderation. Alice says something that Bob didn't like, Bob points it out, Alice agrees and apologizes, and everyone moves on."
  </blockquote>
  <p>That kind of conflict resolution doesn't easily happen between strangers, even in a group where people share values with one another. But when the chance of any two people being complete strangers is close to zero, this happens way more frequently.</p>
  <h3><a id="funding"></a>Funding</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, running a social network node requires you to move electrons around on pieces of metal, which means you need metal and electricity. And to have access to those resources, you need some kind of funding. Either you have a benefactor, you get together as a group and buy some equipment and internet service and pay for repairs, or pay a company like Linode some money to host a server for you.</p>
  <p>We have a Patreon for Friend Camp simply because it's the easiest way for me to collect monthly donations. Campers contribute what they want or what they can. I needed to upgrade our server at some point for various reasons and I made an appeal to the community. I ended up getting the monthly pledges to cover the new server costs for everyone. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRtQiH1ZeK5HzPnocwfQmUutHVAhpusxcGq44hsKF7E/">The monetary costs of running Friend Camp are laid out in this spreadsheet.</a> At the moment, Friend Camp costs $31.00 a month to run. This is not a small cost for a single person, but spread between 50 people it can be very affordable, more like $1 per month per person even if half the active users can't afford to contribute anything.</p>
  <h3><a id="the-bus-problem"></a>The bus problem</h3>
  <p>For almost a year, Friend Camp had one person with the keys to the kingdom: me. In this first year, if I got hit by a bus, the server would probably run until its first crash and then never come back again. </p>
  <p>I decided to put out the word to see if a member of the community would be able to volunteer to be co-administrator. Thankfully, one of our own decided to take on the responsibility. I was lucky that there was a person in the community willing to do this and with development experience and experience running a server. It took just a handful of video calls to get them up to speed and within a month they had pushed their first production upgrade to Friend Camp.</p>
  <p>Not every community is going to have people who are willing and able to take on these duties. But if you have someone willing, there could be a longer mentoring process to get them to the point where they are able to do at least minimal work to maintain the server in the absence of the main administrator. If someone is at least able to reboot the server if things go weird, that's a huge step up from nothing.</p>
  <p>Ideally you can train a willing person to the point where they can do more complicated administrative tasks. If you have a small social network community that actually really means something to you, it's work that helps keep a thing alive that people deeply care about.</p>
  <h3><a id="code-of-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct</h3>
  <p>A code of conduct (CoC) is about what actions are acceptable on a network, which is absolutely necessary but not sufficient on its own for establishing a culture. A CoC perhaps implies certain values but it mostly states what is NOT acceptable rather than what IS encouraged. Some codes of conduct do state things like "please engage with people courteously" etc.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I think a good CoC should be specific enough that it is actively repulsive to some people. And frankly, the more people who are repulsed by it the better. Perhaps simple anti-racist sentiment is enough to repulse a small number of explicitly white supremacist people, but if you add in sentiment like "no <abbr title="Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminists">TERFs</abbr> allowed", suddenly a lot of people who consider themselves leftists will also decide not to join. As an example, Friend Camp is anti-free-speech, at least in the sense that freedom of speech is commonly understood as a value. This is repulsive to some people on both the left and the right, and it's important that people with that core value find somewhere other than Friend Camp to set up their online home.</p>
    
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Again this is a <em>good thing</em>. I remember one code of conduct I read for a chat forum where they stated that "before posting here, ask yourself if what you are saying is necessary for the health of the discourse". And I saw that and thought, "Wow, I would never feel comfortable posting on that forum because I am always doubting the necessity of what I have to say." This is good, though. The forum clearly signaled that they wanted a certain kind of person, one who is confident in the necessity of their speech. And that is not me, and I was able to steer clear. Did I feel excluded? Sure. But ultimately that feeling of pre-emptive exclusion is better than joining a community and THEN realizing that I don't belong there.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h4><a id="enforcement"></a>Enforcement</h4>
    <p>Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner have published a free book called <a href="https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/"><em>How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports</em></a> that I think is required reading for anyone with a code of conduct on their site. The book explains what a CoC is <em>and what it is not</em> and how to make yours actually effective. Some of their recommendations make more sense for very large communities (like conferences of thousands of people) than the small ones I'm advocating for, but most of their recommendations do apply, and the book comes with many real world examples that you can learn from.</p>
  <div>
    <p>One reason I'm a big fan of adding a local-only communication layer to these social network sites is that it helps with enforcement. The reason is that it creates serious social repercussions for violating rules to the point where you're kicked off of a server. This is because the person who was kicked out cannot just join a new server and re-follow everyone and continue to participate in or monitor conversations. It's more like being kicked from a group chat. It can be socially devastating, which  means there are real consequences to violating group policy.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>I'm sure there will be friction on Friend Camp but nobody has, to my knowledge, broken our code of conduct or otherwise required admonishment or disciplinary action. When that does happen and it is beyond a simple warning followed by an apology, I will individually solicit opinions from literally every active user on what should be done. Because we keep the server small, I could in theory host video calls with every single user where we discuss what ought to be done. I'm not sure if that last one is a good idea but I have that option, which you can't say for Facebook. This is all possible because we are a small group of people and we will never be a big group of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="technical-recommendations"></a>Technical recommendations</h3>
  <p><em>This section might not make a lot of sense if you're not a programmer. Feel free to skip it and move to <a href="#what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future">"What we need to do in the future"</a> if that's not you.</em></p>
  <p>Ideally you will pick social media software that has features which allow for communication that only your users on your server can see. In the case of Friend Camp, we maintain Friend Camp as <a href="https://github.com/friendcamp/mastodon/">a fork of Mastodon</a> and pull in <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/8427">Renato Lond's great work</a> that allows for posts that only the 50 people with logins to Friend Camp can see.  I would go so far as to say this is a necessary feature for group cohesion, and my hope is that implementors of decentralized social media software come to understand it's important.</p>
  <p>If you are a programmer, I suggest that you maintain a fork of whatever open source social network software you end up using so that you can implement custom features for your users. You might end up making purely aesthetic changes, small browser hacks, or complicated new features that you need to maintain version to version. If you implement custom features that your users ask for, it gives them a stronger sense of ownership over the site even if they are not the ones writing the software. Make sure to credit them somewhere too! I try to credit individual users for each suggested feature in the commit messages and also on our server's About page.</p>
  <p>Provide multiple services for your community members! Probably not email because that is a nightmare but there are other possibilities. I use Mastodon's login to authenticate small helper applications that I write for my users. I just put in a hard coded gateway so that only people from my server have access to them (so their OAuth login account has to originate from the server friend.camp). This means the basic social media login for your server is also a login for many other services; kind of like a default LDAP but not.</p>
  <h4><a id="examples-of-services-you-can-provide"></a>Examples of services you can provide</h4>
  <div>
    <p>I only have one auxilary service I provide my users that gets active use but I think it's a big one. Bugle is a bot that any Friend Camper can use that sends a direct message to <em>every other person on the server</em> (unless they have blocked it or have DMs otherwise disabled). This would normally be a horrible idea on a site like Twitter. But because we're a small community and we all know each other, I trust that my users will use it well and sparingly. If it is misused I will give the user a stern talking-to.</p>
    
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future"></a>What we need to do in the future</h2>
  <p>The current situation for small social network sites is not even close to perfect. There is work that needs to be done to make this idea better and more viable for more kinds of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="places-where-we-need-better-tech"></a>Places where we need better tech </h3>
  <p>Most of the problems that exist are social problems with social solutions, and I've tried to lay some of those out above. But there are still unsolved problems where better tech could really help, so I'll try to enumerate those here.</p>
  <h4><a id="fluidity-of-identity-and-the-ability-to-migrate"></a>Fluidity of identity and the ability to migrate</h4>
  <p>The existence of a server and an administrator implies some local form of centralization. I think this is necessary because most people don't want to run their own network node, and there are fantastic benefits to having a trusted local administrator. That said, the drawbacks are also great and we need to be able to mitigate the drawbacks.</p>
  <p>What happens if I, as the administrator, violate the social norms of my own community? In other words, <em>what happens if the person with all the real power is the problem</em>?</p>
  <p>People <em>need</em> to be able to jump ship and migrate their accounts, seamlessly and wholly, to other servers. We do not have a good technical solution for this yet. In my opinion it is the one big area regarding federated social networks where we need to work on technical solutions.</p>
  <p>If I decide that my values no longer align with a server, I need to be able to take that account to a new server. If the server decides to kick me off, that's fine, but I should <em>in theory</em> be able to set up shop elsewhere. </p>
  <p>I know that people have been working on this issue, but as far as I'm aware it's nowhere near resolved. As it stands right now, the fact that you can't uproot and take your stuff with you from one site to another means there is a very real kind of lock-in. This helps with enforcement (as I said above) but is a huge liability when it's simply the choice of the individual to move.</p>
  <h4><a id="let-people-keep-things-in-the-community"></a>Let people keep things in the community</h4>
  <p>Most open source social network software right now is designed to get your messages out to as many people as possible. We need support for private communities. For federated social networks this means support for messages that don't federate and can only be viewed by people with access to the server on which the message was posted.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Unlike the identity problem, this is a very easy thing to implement technically. It already exists on a minority of open source social network servers. But the big players don't support it and that's causing more harm than good.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h4><a id="server-forking-should-be-easy"></a>Server forking should be easy</h4>
  <p>It should be easy for, say, 25 members of Friend Camp to pick up and start "Friend Camp 2". This could be because Friend Camp is getting too big, or it could be because these people don't like what Friend Camp has become and would like to move en masse.</p>
  <p>As far as I'm aware there is no work at all being done on this issue, but I suppose a prerequisite to this is a solution to the identity migration problem above.</p>
  <h4><a id="lean-software-that-doesn%27t-have-to-scale"></a>Lean software that doesn't have to scale</h4>
  <p>What if we built software to run on very low spec, low power machines, that was a federated social media server for 50 people but could never grow to support more than that? You could use something like SQLite instead of a "real" database because you'd never realistically have to support a lot of writes to the DB. You could run on a raspberry pi.</p>
  <p>There are some federated servers that fit this bill already. <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> is a Twitter style server that extremely light on its use of resources. And <a href="https://writefreely.org/">Write Freely</a>, a federated Medium-style blogging server, is incredibly lean as well.</p>
  <p>But even Pleroma and Write Freely are built with thousands of users in mind. What kind of <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html">low tech solutions</a> can we enable if we keep our communities intentionally small? This may open up more paths to equitable access by communities with different resources available to them.</p>
  <h3><a id="more-on-scale"></a>More on scale</h3>
  <p>Any time I propose a new piece of software to a group of software engineers I'm asked the same question: how will it scale? We are trained as a group to ask this question. I think it's the software equivalent of in manufacturing when someone asks "What will it cost to produce?" Since the marginal cost of producing software is effectively zero, it's the scale, the ability for the software to be used by millions or billions of people, that becomes the limiting factor that everyone brings up.</p>
  <p>Imagine two different software developers. One person writes a piece of software that makes the lives of one million people slightly easier. Maybe it's better routing for navigation software and it shaves 30 seconds off the commute of a million people. Another person writes a piece of software that only ten people ever use, but it tangibly changes their lives for the better in very material ways; maybe they learn a trade that becomes a career. </p>
  <p>One of these outcomes is not necessarily better than the other, and yet due to myriad factors, only the software with a million users is likely to get funding from entities—whether the context is for profit or not for profit. </p>
  <p>I'd like to advance the notion that software does not have to scale, and in fact software can be better if it is not built to scale. I hope some of the examples I've given above have illustrated what is possible when software is used by a small number of people instead of a large number of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="beyond-local-and-public:-the-neighborhood"></a>Beyond local and public: the neighborhood</h3>
  <p>Right now on federated social networks you have a concept of people on your own "home" server (which I'll call local) and people on every other server in the world (which I'll call public). But we need concepts that are more fine grained than local and public.</p>
  <p>I would like to see groups of servers that band together through a kind of mutual approval system. The group of people on Server A decide that Server B is to be trusted, and vice versa. They approve each other, in a manner similar to friending someone on Facebook, but for a whole server instead of an individual user. Now the 50 people on server A and the 50 people on server B are in a "neighborhood" together.</p>
  <p>Servers that belong to the same neighborhood could share things with each other. For example, the servers could share access to posts that are tagged on either server as "available to the neighborhood". Servers could share block lists, since mutual trust between servers probably implies some level of shared values between the people on both servers.</p>
  <p>A neighborhood would necessarily consist of two or more servers, and could in theory grow to be very large. </p>
  <p>However, I don't think neighborhoods should be very big themselves. I think there should be a kind of mutual decision-making, so perhaps now that A and B are connected, both A and B have to agree that C is worth connecting to, and C has to agree that A and B are worth it. This makes every extra node you add more difficult, which is the point. Big "private" communities should be very very hard to come by — and "public" should be where the "broad" conversations happen. </p>
  <p>I also think there shouldn't be concepts of overlapping Venn diagrams of multiple neighborhoods. I <em>loved</em> the concept from Google Plus of <a href="http://socialmediasun.com/google-plus-circles/">circles</a>. The idea was that as a person you have friends, coworkers, college friends, family, IRL neighbors, etc. People you "know" on Google Plus could belong to none, one, or more than one of these groups. A childhood friend who you also work with would probably belong to "friends", "childhood friends", and "coworkers". This system sounded <em>great</em> to me… until I tried it in practice. And in practice it was so much tedious digital paperwork to keep it all fresh and updated. I didn't want to manage people into one or more of dozens of categories and in the end I just went for the default "mutual friends on the social network" and "public" circles.</p>
  <p>I think many of us can hold three of these groups in our head though, especially if it's not the job of the individual user to constantly maintain it. I'm sure lots of people can hold more than three groups in their head at a time, but I'm picking the smallest useful number in order to reduce the confusion I experienced with Google's "circles" feature.</p>
  <p>So for me an ideal network would be partitioned into three basic levels for posting:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>local - just the people on my physical server</li>
  <li>neighborhood - the concept I described above of people who belong to servers that have a mutual trust agreement</li>
  <li>public - everyone in the world</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>This would be in addition to the usual layers of "followers only" and that kind of thing.</p>
  <p>One way I see this breaking down is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>local - tin foil hat stuff, "I do not want this message to leave this piece of metal", or perhaps the <em>very</em> intimate like "only local mutual followers get to see my nudes"</li>
  <li>neighborhood - most of your friendly chatter and ideological debate happens here</li>
  <li>public - the place for things that are inconsequential (cute cats and jokes), or require signal boosting, or where you really want to put an idea in front of the public</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of unanswered questions here, and in a lot of ways I am still learning as I go. I don't want to give the impression that I have the answer to everything so I'd like to address some questions that I don't have good anwers to at all.</p>
  <h3><a id="hard-questions"></a>Hard questions</h3>
  <p><strong>How do people join one of these networks if they don't have friends who are already on such a network?</strong> This may be where sites with thousands of users come into play. Perhaps people join a giant server but then do it with the understanding that they are there to make friends on smaller servers with the idea of eventually moving there or even starting their own server. This is not very feasible until the account migration stuff I mention in the <a href="#what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future">"What we need to do in the future"</a> section is solved.</p>
  <p><strong>What happens to people who suck?</strong> Like what about people who are actively opposed to community cohesion? Will they find a sort of anti-community where they are accepted? Will they simply migrate to the giant networks of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people? Will they set up their own single-person networks? Will this kind of network even be the place for them at all? I don't know.</p>
  <p><strong>What about equity?</strong> For example, how do we get these servers run and operated by people in poor communities? I look to work by people like <a href="https://twitter.com/_brunaz_">Bruna Zanolli</a>, going in to Amazon indigenous communities and training the women to run the networks. If you have the privilege to run one of these sites then you might also have the ability to teach people how to run them for themselves. If that's you, then it's really your duty to get other people up and running. The more communities you help get started, the more options your own community will have for people to connect to. I also would love to see granting organizations support this kind of work.</p>
  <p><strong>Do the technical administrators have to be the same people doing the social organizing?</strong> I think the answer as of June 2019 is, sadly, yes. If you have 2 people with root access to the server and 2 people managing the community aspects, you'll end up with imbalances in that group of 4. You will end up with technical administrators who feel like code monkeys who never get the gratitude that the community organizers get, or you'll end up with community organizers who feel like glorified babysitters while the techies have all the real power. You might even end up with a situation where both are true. I think that if you're dedicated to this sort of project though, you could start with something like that 2 and 2, and then the techies could teach the organizers the technical skills, and the organizers could teach the techies the organizing skills.</p>
  <p>However, if more paid hosting services would support a wider variety of software and forks and features, this reliance on technical people like me will hopefully become lessened and an actual community organizer, or some kind of community organization structure, can be in charge.</p>
  <h3><a id="so-what-do-you,-the-reader,-do-next?"></a>So what do you, the reader, do next?</h3>
  <p>What you can do next depends on who you are.</p>
  <h4><a id="if-you-are-comfortable-with-servers-and-hosting"></a>If you are comfortable with servers and hosting</h4>
  <p>If you've done the system administrator thing, you have many options here.</p>
  <p>Ask your friends if they'd like to try out a social network run by you. If you can find 5 people who would be interested that's enough. Then get going! There are plenty of technical guides out there:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/">Setting up a Mastodon server</a> for a Twitter-like experience
    <ul>
      <li>This also works with the various forks, like <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">Glitch Social</a> and <a href="https://github.com/florence-social/mastodon-fork">Florence</a></li>
      <li>I now offer a fork of Mastodon that supports principles outlined in this document called <a href="https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown">Hometown</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma#installation">Setting up a Pleroma server</a> for another Twitter-like experience
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.pixelfed.org/master/">Setting up Pixelfed</a> for an Instagram-style experience
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#/install-any-os">Setting up PeerTube</a> for a YouTube-style experience
  </li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>There are many other servers and services out there as well, but these are the ones that I personally have used and can recommend.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that <strong>none of these services support any of the "future" concepts like neighborhoods</strong>. Some of the forks like <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">Glitch Social</a> do allow for local-only posting.</p>
  <h4><a id="if-learning-the-tech-stuff-is-realistically-not-going-to-happen"></a>If learning the tech stuff is realistically not going to happen</h4>
  <p>Do you have any technical friends? If you do, ask them if they might be willing to do this sort of thing.</p>
  <div>
    <p>You can also pay a company like <a href="https://masto.host/">Masto.host</a> to run all the technical stuff for you. If you take my advice and <a href="#keep-it-small">only have a small number of users</a>, then you can probably get away with paying less than $10/month for your hosting. Paying a company necessarily means that you have less control over your system. You won't be able to provide custom features for your users, but if you are not a technical person you probably aren't going to be writing custom features anyway.</p>

  <p>I suppose I'll repeat what I said multiple times in this document, which is that running a small social network site for your friends is hard work, but it's worth it. It is first and foremost the work of community building, and only secondarily is it a technical endeavor. And it's completely possible to do, today, though depending on who you are and what your resources are it's going to be difficult in different ways.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Email addresses are not good 'permanent' identifiers for accounts</h2>

	<p><small>December 30, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often someone needs to create a more or less permanent
internal identifier in their system every person's account. Some
of the time they look at how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OIDCThreeEmailAddresses">authentication systems like OIDC
return email addresses among other data</a> and decide that since pretty
much everyone is giving them an email address, they'll use the email
address as the account's permanent internal identification.
As <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">the famous saying</a> goes,
now you have two problems.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with email addresses as 'permanent' identifiers
is that people's email addresses change even within a single
organization (for example, <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">a university</a>).
They change for the same collection of reasons that people's
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/FullLegalNamesProblems">commonly used names</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/LoginsDoChange">logins change</a>. An organization that refuses to change
or redo the email addresses it assigns to people is being unusually
cruel in ways that are probably not legally sustainable in any
number of places.</p>

<p>(Some of the time there will be some sort of access or forwarding
from the old email address to the new one, but even then the old
email address may no longer work for non-email purposes such as
OIDC authentication. And beyond that, the person won't want to keep
using their old and possibly uncomfortable email address with you,
they want to use their new current one.)</p>

<p>The lesser problem is that you have no particular guarantee that
an organization won't reuse email addresses, either in general or
for particularly desirable ones that get reused or reassigned as
an exception because someone powerful wants them. Sometimes you
sort of have no choice, because account recovery has to run through
the email address you have on file, but at other times (such as in
theory with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)">OIDC</a>), you
have some form of internal ID that is supposed to be unique and
permanent, which you should use.</p>

<p>Even if you have to remember an email address for account recovery,
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/PowerOfMeaninglessIDs">you want your internal identifier for accounts to be meaningless</a>. This will make your life much simpler in
the long run, even if this is never exposed to people.</p>

<p>(There are also security issues lurking in the underbrush of reading
too much into email addresses, <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">cf</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38720544">via</a>).)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.onsclom.net/posts/javascript-tco">https://www.onsclom.net/posts/javascript-tco</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38823673">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main data-astro-cid-egg7nqdx=""><h2 data-astro-cid-egg7nqdx="">Bun, Javascript, and TCO</h2><p><a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> is a JavaScript runtime that just released version 1.0! Now you have three
choices for running JavaScript outside of the browser: Node, Deno, and Bun. One of Bun’s selling
points is speed! It makes some interesting decisions to acheive this.</p>
<p>For one, Bun is programmed using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. This results in an exciting universe:
Node is made with <strong>C++</strong>, Deno is made with <strong>Rust</strong>, and Bun is made with <strong>Zig</strong>. Isn’t this an
exciting battle of system languages?! We will actually focus on something else however.</p>
<p>Node and Deno are built on V8, while Bun is built on JavaScriptCore. You might know V8 as the
JavaScript engine of Chrome. JavaScriptCore is the engine for Safari. They have lots of interesting
differences, but we will be focusing on a niche optimization which JavaScriptCore implements and V8
does not: <strong>Tail Call Optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in by writing some real code! Imagine you need to implement the following function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/*</span></span>
<span><span>  Returns an array of numbers counting from 1 to amount.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Examples:</span></span>
<span><span>    count(3) =&gt; [1, 2, 3]</span></span>
<span><span>    count(5) =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span></span>
<span><span>    count(-1) =&gt; []</span></span>
<span><span>*/</span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> count</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[];</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Give it a try yourself if you want! I imagine most people will come up with a solution like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function</span><span> count</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] {</span></span>
<span><span>	let</span><span> nums</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] </span><span>=</span><span> [];</span></span>
<span><span>	for</span><span> (</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> 1</span><span>; i </span><span>&lt;=</span><span> amount; i</span><span>++</span><span>) nums.</span><span>push</span><span>(i);</span></span>
<span><span>	return</span><span> nums;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is a great solution that works totally fine! But now, I will present an arbitrary challenge to
introduce tail call optimization. Can you represent this as a recursive function? Give it a try.
After a bit of thinking, you might come up with this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> count</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> (amount </span><span>&gt;</span><span> 0</span><span> ?</span><span> [</span><span>...</span><span>count</span><span>(amount </span><span>-</span><span> 1</span><span>), amount] </span><span>:</span><span> []);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Its a succinct solution! It might look familiar to recurrence relations from math class. You might
be thinking, “It looks like loops can be expressed more elegantly with recursion!” But, now I have
something sad to share. Try doing <code>count(100000)</code> (Deno and Bun allow running TypeScript directly).
You will get the error <code>Maximum call stack size exceeded</code>.</p>
<p>Recursion takes up precious memory on the call stack! There may be commands to increase the call
stack size for your program, but there is only so much the OS will allow. Memory on the heap is much
less restricted. How can we use recursion without fear of exceeding the call stack? The answer: hope
your JavaScript engine implements TCO and write your recursion in a way that can be optimized!</p>
<p>The process of rewriting a function to be tail call optmized generally involves moving state to
arguments. The recursive call needs to be the last thing in the function’s AST. The TCO version of
our recursive function looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> count</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>, </span><span>cur</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] </span><span>=</span><span> []) </span><span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>	cur.</span><span>length</span><span> &gt;=</span><span> amount </span><span>?</span><span> cur </span><span>:</span><span> count</span><span>(amount, [</span><span>...</span><span>cur, cur.</span><span>length</span><span> +</span><span> 1</span><span>]);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Its slightly less succint and elegant, but it can be tail call optimized now! If we run
<code>count(100000)</code> with Deno, we still get
<code>error: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded</code>. With Bun, the program now
successfully runs! But there’s still one more problem… This solution is really slow.</p>
<p><code>count(100000)</code> with this TCO solution takes 7 seconds with bun. The original for loop solution
takes <code>.01s</code>. How can we get similar performance to the for loop solution while still using
recursion? We use mutation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function</span><span> count</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>, </span><span>cur</span><span>:</span><span> number</span><span>[] </span><span>=</span><span> []) {</span></span>
<span><span>	if</span><span> (cur.</span><span>length</span><span> &gt;=</span><span> amount) </span><span>return</span><span> cur;</span></span>
<span><span>	cur.</span><span>push</span><span>(cur.</span><span>length</span><span> +</span><span> 1</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>	return</span><span> count</span><span>(amount, cur);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This function is starting to look a lot like the orignal for loop solution. It’s not very succinct
or elegant anymore. But, it runs <code>count(100000)</code> at <code>.01s</code> as well. Nice!</p>
<p>The minimalist part of me really enjoys TCO. It enables a language to express complex and efficient
programs without imperative loops. In the case of JavaScript, it means a smaller subset of the
language can express all programs. Most beginners are taught loop statements as if they are
fundamental or required in every language. But that’s not true. With TCO, you can express any loop
statement using recursion and get similar performance.</p>
<p>Languages that rely on recursion like LISPs often specify that TCO must be implemented in their
language spec. Sadly, TCO is only implemented in JavaScriptCore. Thankfully, Bun and Safari use
JavaScriptCore!</p></main> </div></div>]]></description>

The 7 watts (measured at the wall) includes:</p><ul><li>Motherboard (Intel H770)</li><li>CPU (Intel i5-12400)</li><li>64GB RAM</li><li>SSD (booting Ubuntu Server 23.04)</li><li>PSU (Corsair)</li><li>C-States set up in BIOS so that it reaches C8</li><li><em>powertop</em> with auto-tune (which disabled the USB keyboard when the port went to sleep)</li></ul><p>Note that if I don’t allow <em>powertop</em> to disable the keyboard, I get 8 watts measured at the wall.</p><p>—</p><p>Let’s get into detailed specs and component choices. This time around I had the following goals:</p><ul><li>low idle power</li><li>reasonable CPU performance for compression</li><li>able to handle 12 hard drives + at least 1 NVMe</li><li>capacity to (eventually) convert those 12 hard drives to 6 NVMe + 6 SSD SATA</li><li>keep costs under control – since a motherboard purchase would be required, try to stick with DDR4 and reuse a CPU I already have.</li></ul><p>Putting together a new system with the hopes of getting in the ballpark of the 10 watt range *measured from the wall* is often not only a challenge, but a bit of a gamble. Sometimes you just have to take your best educated guesses in terms of components, build your rig, tune what you can, and let the chips fall where they may.<br> </p><h2>Motherboard – ASUS Prime H770-Plus D4</h2><p>Before I begin, here is a quick look at the motherboard layout. The GREEN CPU-connected slots and ORANGE chipset-connected slots will become relevant throughout this write-up.</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e-500x599.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASUS PRIME H770 with M.2 and PCIe port layout" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p>At the time of writing, widely available consumer options were motherboards in the Intel 600/700-series and AMD 500/600-series.</p><p>One of my goals above was the capacity for an eventual 6 NVMe drives.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Digging into deeper details as to why this can be a challenge (feel free to skip this section)…</em></strong></p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> There are 0 consumer motherboards with 6x M.2 slots that can all be used at the same time in PCIe mode. On AMD the MEG X570S Unify-X Max *looks* like it does, but check the manual and you’ll find that if you try to populate all 6, the last one has to be a SATA variant. The ASRock Z790 PG Sonic also has 6 slots, but you can only use 5 of them (with a legitimate excuse: they offer a Gen5 NVMe slot but it comes with an either/or caveat).</p><p><strong>Why This Problem Exists:</strong> There are chipset lane limitations on consumer boards. Assuming I want the ability to run all M.2 in Gen4x4 and assuming a manufacturer were actually willing to devote all the lanes to M.2 NVMe slots (they’re not), AMD X570 and Intel B760 would max at three M.2 slots, with AMD B650 and Intel H670/Q670/Z690/W680 managing four. Five M.2 slots is possible on AMD X670 and Intel H770 boards. Six on a Z790 board. Beyond that, extraordinary measures like robbing the main PCIE slot of lanes would be required. If sheer M.2 count were desired, manufacturers could run theoretically run lanes in Gen4x2 or add some Gen3 M.2 slots, but at that point they’ve created a *very* niche product.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> PCI-E to M.2 adapters became necessary. Now when searching for a motherboard, it became a matter if adding the M.2 slots included to any available PCI-E slots capable of x4 or higher. My options were now limited to AMD X570, Intel H770, and Intel Z790 motherboards. Note that while using bifurcation is a possibility on some motherboards to get more than 1 NVMe out of the main PCIe slot, I decided not to rely on it.</p></blockquote><p>I decided to go the Intel route for a few reasons:</p><ol><li><em>Chipset TDP:</em> 600/700-series Intel chipsets all have a 6W TDP, whereas the TDP of the AMD X670 chipset is pretty high (7w+7w). AMD chipset power consumption has concerned me for a while, as previous X570 chipsets had a TDP of 11w and needed a fan.</li><li><em>Chipset Speed:</em> Intel H670/Q670/W680/Z690/H770/Z790 chipsets have a DMI 4.0 x8 link to the CPU. AMD X570/B650/X670 have a PCIe 4.0 x4 link to the CPU. Theoretical throughput on the Intel should be twice as much as AMD (16GB/s vs 8GB/s).</li><li>I already had 64GB of DDR4 that the Intel system could use. AMD 600-series chipsets are all DDR5-only.</li><li>I already had an Intel 12th Gen CPU.</li><li>I’ve yet to see any positive discussion around AM5 power consumption. At all. Update: as I was writing this, news actually came out about AMD 7000-series CPUs burning/bulging where the motherboard socket pins meet the CPU. Yeah, sorry AMD, not this time.</li></ol><p>So Intel it was. After checking out available DDR4 motherboards on the market, I quickly narrowed options to 2 manufacturers: MSI and ASUS.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Don’t care about the board comparisons? Feel free to skip this.</em></strong></p><p>The enticing MSI boards were the PRO Z790-P WIFI DDR4 and Z790-A WIFI DDR4. Nearly identical on the surface, except the “A” is a little more premium (audio, rear ports, heatsinks, power phases, etc). Pros/cons:</p><ul><li>Pro: 4x M.2 (Gen4x4) + 1x PCIE Gen5x16 + 1x PCIE Gen4x4 supports a total of 6 Gen4 NVMe</li><li>Pro: 2x PCIE Gen3x1 extra</li><li>Pro: 6 SATA ports</li><li>Con: Intel 2.5G LAN (known to be problematic and buggy)</li><li>Con: I’m not a fan of the MSI BIOS</li><li>Con: My current B660 board that results in higher idle consumption than expected is an MSI.</li></ul><p>Attractive ASUS options were the Prime H770-Plus D4 and Prime Z790-P D4 (optional WIFI edition). Getting into the TUF, Strix, or ProArt was just too expensive.</p><p>I’ll start by listing pros/cons for the H770-Plus:</p><ul><li>Pro: 3x M.2 (Gen4x4) + 1x PCIE Gen5x16 + 2x PCIE Gen4x4 supports a total of 6 Gen4 NVMe</li><li>Pro: 2x PCIE Gen3x1 extra</li><li>Con: Only 4 SATA ports</li><li><del>Pro: 2.5G Realtek Network Adapter (preferable to Intel 2.5G LAN these days)</del> (see comments)</li></ul><p>The Z790-P D4 is similar except it has more power phases, better heatsinking, more USB ports, extra fan header, and for our purposes…:</p><ul><li>+1 PCIE Gen4x4</li><li>-1 PCIE Gen3x1</li></ul></blockquote><p>Ultimately the ASUS Prime H770-Plus D4 was about $100 cheaper at the time and is what I chose.</p><p>One upside I’ve found with “cheaper” boards is they tend to have fewer components and thus less vampire power drain at idle, though this isn’t always a certainty.<br> </p><h2>CPU – Intel i5-12400 (H0 stepping) – Alder Lake</h2><p>I already had this CPU as part of a previous desktop build. At the time it was chosen for the desktop system because:</p><ul><li>it had AV1 hardware decode</li><li>it had the highest performance available from the Intel lineup of the 12th generation that avoids the E-core silicon overhead</li><li>in that build, I was getting a new motherboard with 2xDP anyway, and going older-gen didn’t make sense to me.</li></ul><p>That desktop build turned out to be a disappointment, and ranks as one of my least favorite builds.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Some details…</strong></em></p><p>I had issues where sometimes only 1 of 2 DP-attached monitors would wake in Linux which meant I had to either pull/reconnect the other DP connector, or manually suspend/resume the system so it could try again.</p><p>Another issue was that rebooting between Windows/Linux sometimes caused odd issues which necessitated a full poweroff/restart.</p><p>Hardware decode on Ubuntu using Wayland is still problematic and when programs tried to use it to play video, problems would ensue.</p><p>Finally, unlike my previous Intel systems which could all be brought down near the 10 watt mark, this one was idling at 19 watts, though I suspected the MSI motherboard I was using may have been a factor.</p></blockquote><p>Most of the headaches I experienced were related to the GPU and display. Since I was about to build something server-oriented, that was no longer a factor.</p><h2>MEMORY – 64GB DDR4-3200</h2><p>Here’s what I used:</p><ul><li>2x16GB Kingston HyperX dual-rank (Hynix DJR)</li><li>2x16GB Kingston HyperX single-rank (Hynix CJR)</li></ul><p>This was memory I already had. I ran the 4 sticks of memory at the XMP profile of the dual-rank kit which was 16-18-18-36. Everything else was essentially left to the defaults except that I ran the RAM at 1.25 volts (higher than stock 1.20, but lower than the XMP 1.35v setting). TestMem5 and Memtest86 showed stability at 1.22v, though testing this memory on previous motherboards had shown 1.22v to be unstable, so for a little extra buffer when it comes to stability I boosted the voltage to 1.25v.</p><h2>Boot Drive – Sandisk Ultra 3D 1TB SSD</h2><p>This component wasn’t deliberately chosen. When I wanted a fresh Ubuntu Server install for testing, this happened to be the only SSD I had kicking around that wasn’t currently being used. I was going to be doing a lot of A/B testing on PCIE and NVMe devices, so installing Ubuntu 23.04 to a SATA SSD made sense to keep PCIE slots free.</p><p>Note that after testing, the main OS was to be run on a <strong>Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 500GB NVMe</strong>. Not much to say except that Samsung stuff tends to reliably go into low power modes.</p><p>Having used both drives, I can’t measure any power difference between them in my testing. Tom’s Hardware tested the Samsung idle at 0.072 watts (via ASPM/APST), and Anandtech tested the Sandisk Ultra 3D idle to be 0.056 watts (via ALPM). Both are well below the 1W resolution of my Kill-A-Watt meter.</p><h2>PSU – Corsair RM750</h2><p>As much as this 750W PSU may appear to be overkill for a system intended to sit around 10 watts, when 12 drive motors spin up at the same time, the instantaneous load is likely to be quite high. Seagate states 2A/3A DC/AC peak currents on the 12V rail for one of their 10TB 3.5″ drives. Even peak random read/writes can clock in at over 2A.</p><p>This bursty power demand has the potential to be problematic if the PSU isn’t up to the task. If an array of 6 drives collectively pull 150-200 watts at the same moment the CPU spikes to pull a peak 120W, that’s a jump from around 10 watts idle to around 400 watts. This could easily cause an instantaneous voltage dip – if it dips enough to cause an immediate crash/reboot it’s probably not a big deal, but if it dips just enough that data is corrupted during a memory refresh or when another drive is mid-write… that’s a more painful problem. Oversizing the PSU to some degree (or adding some in-line capacitors to the power rails) makes sense.</p><p>Fortunately, despite operating outside of the peak efficiency range, much of the Corsair RM series is pretty efficient across a wide range.<br> </p><h2>Power Measurements – Initial</h2><p>A few important bits:</p><ul><li>Power measured from the wall</li><li>Intel PowerTOP was used to auto-tune settings</li><li>Ubuntu Server 23.04</li></ul><p>A few potentially-important <strong>BIOS</strong> bits:</p><ul><li>CPU C-states were enabled in the BIOS (C10)</li><li>ASPM was enabled with everything set to L1</li><li>RC6 (Render Standby) enabled</li><li>Aggressive LPM Support enabled (ALPM)</li><li>DISABLED: HD Audio, Connectivity Mode, LEDs, GNA Device, Serial Port</li></ul><p><strong>9-10 watts</strong> was the consumption when the display output was on.</p><p><strong>7 watts</strong> was the consumption once the display turned off (consoleblank=600 kernel boot parameter for a 600s timer), which is where this system sits most of the week.</p><p><strong>8 watts</strong> was the consumption if the USB keyboard power management was disabled. If you don’t SSH into the server from elsewhere, spending the extra watt for keyboard use might be necessary.</p><h2>Problematic Power Measurements – Loaded up with spinning rust (spun-down)</h2><p>As mentioned in the beginning, I started with 12 hard drives. Half were 2.5″ and the other half were 3.5″. Because the motherboard only has 4 SATA ports, a SATA controller and a port multiplier were used to handle the remaining drives. Additionally, 4 NVMe drives were used early on: one of them, a Western Digital SN770 had a tendency to get quite hot even at idle which indicates it probably wasn’t going into a low power mode.</p><p>With all the equipment connected, at idle, with display off, and with the 12 drives spun down to standby, <strong>I was shocked to see that my idle power consumption had gone from 7 watts all the way up to a whopping 24-25 watts</strong>. Far too much! Something was amiss.</p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – High Power Investigation and Diagnosis</h4><p>I disconnected the hard drives and started testing components one at a time. These were fairly crude tests meant to get a rough idea as to the culprit, so numbers here aren’t precise.</p><p>I quickly discovered that the JMB585 SATA controller I was using caused power consumption to increase by something in the 6-10 watt range (precise measurements in a later section). The controller itself is only supposed to take a couple watts, and the tiny heatsink stayed cool, so there was obviously more going on. Where was the power going?</p><p>I decided to watch the CPU package C-states. Without the JMB585 SATA controller, the system hit C6. When the JMB585 was reconnected, the best the system hit was C3. Ah ha! But why? Turns out that if a PCIE-connected device won’t go into ASPM L1, the CPU won’t go into as deep a sleep. The JMB585 controller cards don’t seem to have ASPM support.</p><p>A little further experimentation revealed something else that I hadn’t known, and it has to do with C6 vs C8. The system will only hit C8 if there’s nothing hooked up to the CPU-attached PCIE lanes. In other words, if anything is plugged in to the top PCIE slot or the top NVMe slot, C6 is the maximum. The power consumption difference between C6 and C8 *seemed* to be less than a watt in a simple test.</p><p>So while C8 would be a luxury, hitting C6 was a must. C3 uses too much power. If SATA controllers were going to prevent the CPU from hitting the best power saving states, I started to wonder whether I should have been looking for a motherboard with 6-8 SATA ports so that I wouldn’t have to rely on add-on controllers…</p><p>A little searching for SATA HBAs showed that while there aren’t many options here, the ASM1166 SATA controller should support ASPM L1, though the firmware has to be flashed for it to work properly (and to work at all on newer Intel boards). This was something I’d have to order: I have Marvel and JMicron spares, but they don’t support ASPM. I’d actually been avoiding ASMedia for years, but out of necessity they were now getting another chance: I ordered a couple ASM1166 6 port SATA controllers.<br> </p><h4>Aside: BadTLP, Bad! AER Bus Errors from the pcieport</h4><p>Worth a mention… During initial testing with a WD Black SN770 (Gen4 NVMe), I found a problem when the primary (top CPU-attached) PCIE and NVMe ports were used. Running dmesg resulted in output littered with stuff like:</p><blockquote><p>pcieport 0000:00:06.0: AER: Corrected error received: 0000:02:00.0<br>nvme 0000:02:00.0: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Physical Layer, (Receiver ID)<br>pcieport 0000:00:06.0: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, (Transmitter ID)<br>pcieport 0000:00:06.0: AER: Error of this Agent is reported first<br>nvme 0000:02:00.0: [ 6] BadTLP</p></blockquote><p>…after much trial-and-error I found that if the “PEG – ASPM” BIOS setting was set to [Disabled] or [L0s] there were no errors.</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/bios-06-advanced-platform-misc-aspm.png" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/bios-06-advanced-platform-misc-aspm-500x375.png" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASUS PRIME H770-PLUS BIOS Advanced Platform Misc ASPM" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/bios-06-advanced-platform-misc-aspm.png" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p>Of course, this was a bad option, as [L1] is crucial for power savings. If [L1] or [L0sL1] were used, the only option was to set the Link Speed of those ports to [Gen3], which didn’t stop the errors, but reduced them substantially.</p><p>Some research showed the root cause can be any number of things. Because swapping the motherboard or CPU wasn’t a pleasant thought, my best hope was swapping to a different brand of NVMe.</p><p>I ordered some Crucial P3 NVMe drives. This turned out to be a successful endeavor: <strong>with the WD drives replaced by the Crucial drives, I was no longer getting any errors</strong>, though keep in mind these are Gen3 drives.</p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – Finding L1.1 and L1.2 to be enabled on chipset-connected ports only</h4><p>When I had the 2 Crucial P3 NVMe drives installed in the CPU-connected PCIEx16 slot and the top M2 slot, I noticed higher idle temps than expected. While the NAND sat at about 27-29C, the controllers were reporting 49-50C – much higher than I expected for these particular drives.</p><p>I moved the one from the PCIEx16 slot to a chipset-connected PCIEx4 slot. An interesting difference between these drives showed up via lspci -vvv:</p><blockquote><p><strong>CPU-connected M2 slot:</strong> L1SubCtl1: PCI-PM_L1.2- PCI-PM_L1.1- ASPM_L1.2- ASPM_L1.1-<br><strong>Chipset-connected PCIE slot:</strong> L1SubCtl1: PCI-PM_L1.2+ PCI-PM_L1.1+ ASPM_L1.2+ ASPM_L1.1+</p></blockquote><p>L1 sub-states only seem to get enabled on the chipset-connected slots. Unfortunate, but it does seem to coincide with the available BIOS settings in the screenshot above.</p><p>Let’s reference that motherboard picture again to show the situation:</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e-500x599.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASUS PRIME H770 with M.2 and PCIe port layout" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asus-h770-pci-e.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p>I put both NVMe drives on chipset-connected PCIE slots. Now both showed L1.1+/L1.2+ and both controller temps were down from the 49-50C range to 38-41C.</p><p>Unfortunately when attempting various A/B tests using these 2 Crucial NVMe drives with different slot configurations and various BIOS settings, I saw very inconsistent behavior in terms of temperature, though it’s worth noting the JMB585 and an NVMe boot drive were also connected during these tests. For example, both drives might idle at around 40C until a soft reboot at which point 1 (or both) might now idle at the 50C range. Sometimes it seemed possible to keep 1 drive on the CPU-connected M.2 and retain 40C temperatures on both drives as long as the x16 slot wasn’t populated. Presumably I was hitting some sort of bug. The Samsung boot NVMe seemed to keep a consistent idle temperature regardless of what was happening with the Crucial NVMe drives, so I suspected the Crucial drives themselves are at least partly to blame.</p><p>Interestingly, sometimes one (or both) controller temps would drop all the way down to the 29C range when on the chipset-connected slots. Since trying to find a low-power 4TB NVMe replacement for the Crucial P3 wasn’t a realistic goal, my best hope at this point was that the ASPM-incompatible JMicron JMB 585 was somehow to blame, since it was soon to be replaced with the ASPM-compatible ASMedia ASM 1166.</p><p><em>Late Update: I unfortunately didn’t keep track of temperatures throughout the rest of the testing, and heatsinks/airflow between drives have all been jumbled around. But for whatever it’s worth, In the final build, my Crucial P3 controller temps are 31-34C, and NAND temps are 23-24C.</em><br> </p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – Swapping from the JMB585 to the ASM1166.</h4><p>After a couple weeks the ASM1166 arrived. First a couple bits regarding the card which you might find helpful if you’re considering it…</p><blockquote><p>I began with a firmware flash – ASM1166 cards often have old firmware which doesn’t work with Intel 600-series motherboards and from what I understand can have issues with power management. Newer firmware can be found floating around in various places, but I decided to grab a copy from SilverStone (“fix compatibility issue” in the Download section of <a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/expansion-cards/ECS06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/expansion-cards/ECS06/</a>) and followed the instructions at <a href="https://docs.phil-barker.com/posts/upgrading-ASM1166-firmware-for-unraid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.phil-barker.com/posts/upgrading-ASM1166-firmware-for-unraid/</a> . Note that the SilverStone files had an identical MD5 to firmware I found by following the thread at <a href="https://forums.unraid.net/topic/102010-recommended-controllers-for-unraid/page/8/#comment-1185707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://forums.unraid.net/topic/102010-recommended-controllers-for-unraid/page/8/#comment-1185707</a> .</p><p>For anyone planning to purchase one of these ASMedia cards, I should note that like most SATA controllers and HBAs out there, the quality really varies. One of my cards had a heatsink that was on a bit crooked: the thermal pad was thick enough to prevent it from shorting nearby components, but be aware that these products can be really hit-and-miss. This is one of the situations where paying a little more to buy from somewhere with a good return policy can be prudent.</p></blockquote><p>I did quite a bit of A/B testing, so here is a quick “JMicron JMB585 vs ASMedia ASM1166” in terms of total system power consumption, though it may only be applicable to this platform (or perhaps even this specific motherboard).</p><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/jmb585-vs-asm1166.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/jmb585-vs-asm1166-500x375.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="JMicron JMB585 vs ASMedia ASM1166" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/jmb585-vs-asm1166.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><p><strong><u>DRIVELESS</u></strong></p><p>First, power consumption without any drives connected to the cards (the SATA SSD boot drive is connected to the motherboard) to get a baseline. PowerTOP used on all devices except for the keyboard (adding +1 watt). Measurements after the display output went to sleep.</p><ul><li>8 watts – No SATA controller – C8 power state</li><li>9 watts – ASM1166 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C8 power state</li><li>12 watts – JMB585 on the CPU-connected x16 slot – C3 power state</li><li>15 watts – JMB585 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C3 power state</li><li>22 watts – ASM1166 on the CPU-connected x16 slot – C2 power state</li></ul><p>The ASM1166 does well here if plugged into a chipset-connected slot (only +1 watt), but does horribly if connected to the main PCI-E slot (+14 watts) where the CPU package power state plummets to C2. Shockingly, the JMB585 behaves in an opposite manner where it’s consumption is lower on the CPU-connected slot (and it didn’t cause C2) – however, you’ll soon see that things change when drives are actually connected…</p><p>I did additional testing with the controllers, including playing “musical chairs” with a couple NVMe drives to see if multiple devices would throw a wrench into things, but nothing unexpected took place so I’ll skip those details.</p><p><strong><u>ADDING DRIVES</u></strong></p><p>With baseline measurements complete, next it was time to actually put some drives on these controllers. The SATA SSD boot drive stayed on the motherboard, 2 NVMe drives were added to the mix (chipset-connected unless otherwise noted), and 4 of the 2.5″ SATA hard drives were placed on the controller. I’ll list the “spun down” consumption after the hard drives went into standby – “spun up” was exactly 2 watts higher in every test while the drives were idle.</p><ul><li>10 watts – ASM1166 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C8 power state</li><li>11 watts – ASM1166 on a chipset-connected x4 slot with 1 NVMe moved to the CPU-connected x16 slot – C6 power state</li><li>11 watts – 2x ASM1166 on chipset-connected x4 slots, with only 1 NVMe drive – C8 power state</li><li>16 watts – JMB585 on a chipset-connected x4 slot – C3 power state</li><li>24 watts – JMB585 on CPU-connected x16 slot – C2 power state</li></ul><p>With 4 drives connected via a chipset-connected slot, the ASM1166 adds +2 watts to system power consumption, whereas the JMB585 adds +8 watts. No contest.</p><p>An additional benefit is that I was able to use <em>both</em> of the ASM1166 cards in the system, whereas attempting to use both of my JMB575 cards at the same time resulted in the system refusing to boot, though that could be a platform or motherboard-specific issue.</p><p>There is a trade-off though – I always found the JMB585 to be rock-solid reliable, including when paired with a JMB575 port multiplier. My past experience with ASMedia SATA controllers has been less than stellar: reliability with the ASM1166 remains to be seen, but at the very least it’s a bad candidate for a port multiplier since it doesn’t support FBS (only CBS).</p><p>A couple other minor hiccups that presented with the ASM1166:</p><ol><li>When removing/reinserting the NVMe boot drive, a BIOS message appeared claiming that it couldn’t boot due to GPT corruption. The ASM1166 cards had to be temporarily removed for the BIOS to “find” the NVMe boot drive again (after which they could be reinstalled).</li><li>The ASM1166 cards claim to have a *lot* of ports – this causes additional boot time as Linux has to iterate through all of them.</li></ol><p><a href="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asm1166-sata-port-claim.jpg" onclick="return false;"><img src="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asm1166-sata-port-claim-500x667.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="auto" alt="ASMedia ASM1166 claiming many ports it does not actually have" data-jslghtbx="https://mattgadient.com/i/2023/05/asm1166-sata-port-claim.jpg" data-jslghtbx-group="4814"></a></p><h4>Update: SATA and SSD Brands</h4><p>One of the comments mentioned an older Samsung 840 PRO SSD limiting to C3 whereas a Crucial Force GT SSD allowed C8. While those are older drives, I still found this a bit surprising. It was worth investigating.</p><p>I used the H770 as a testbed with a Samsung 850 EVO SATA SSD boot drive along with a Crucial P3 NVMe and built a custom kernel to allow the Realtek network adapter to reach L1.2. No ASM1166, just using the Intel onboard SATA. I reached C10 after running powertop with auto-tune and allowing the display to sleep.</p><p>I then added a Patriot P210 SATA SSD. Stuck at C6.</p><p>I removed the Patriot P210 and tried a 4TB 2.5″ Seagate SATA HDD. C10. Swapped it for an 8TB 3.5″ Seagate SATA HDD. C10. Swapped that for a 14TB Toshiba SATA HDD. C10. Added a 1TB Sandisk Ultra 3D SATA SSD to the Toshiba HDD. C10.</p><p>Later test: a 4TB Crucial MX500. C10.</p><p>The lesson here: we clearly need to be picky about SATA SSDs. Feel free to leave a comment with good/bad ones you come across.</p><h4>Power Consumption Puzzles – Conclusion</h4><p>A few important bits if aiming for low consumption:</p><p>1) Motherboard support and BIOS configuration are critical – I’ve had motherboards with very inflexible BIOS’s. On this one, “Native ASPM” and the appropriate L1 states must be enabled (to allow OS-controlled instead of BIOS-controlled) for low power consumption to work.</p><p>2) Devices all need to support ASPM L1. Otherwise you’re really rolling the dice. The hardest part here as you might have guessed is finding SATA controllers that support it – if possible, get a motherboard enough sufficient Intel chipset-connected SATA ports to avoid needing a separate card. I should note that finding NVMe drives that have working low-power APST power states under ASPM isn’t always a given and you’ll want to do some research there too.</p><p>3) If you can hit the C8 power state, avoid using CPU-attached PCIe lanes (top PCIe and M2 slot). On this specific motherboard, my advice would be to avoiding using them altogether if you can, unless you either need the low-latency full-bandwidth path to the CPU or your devices are so active they never sleep anyway. Recall that BOTH my JMicron and ASMedia SATA cards caused the CPU Package C-State to plummet to C2 if plugged into the x16 PCI-E slot.</p><p>4) Measuring power from the wall is the only way to make sure that what you *think* is happening is actually happening. A Kill-A-Watt device will pay for itself over time if you use it – consider that I bought mine in 2006 ($16USD + $14USD shipping at the time through eBay). At that time I found our rarely-used fax machine which was always powered on used 7 watts… just keeping that one device powered off when unused during the next 10 years more than paid for the Kill-A-Watt.</p><h2>Power Consumption when loaded up with a bunch of HDDs</h2><p>Now that a variety of parts have moved in-and-out of the system throughout this process, the current setup is as follows:</p><ul><li>1x Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe (500GB boot drive)</li><li>2x Crucial P3 NVMe (4TB each)</li><li>5x Seagate 2.5″ HDD (5TB each – 4TB utilized)</li><li>6x Seagate 3.5″ HDD (10TB each – 8TB utilized)</li><li>2x ASM1166 cards providing SATA ports</li></ul><p>Total power measured from the wall (display on, keyboard enabled):</p><ul><li>50 watts with all 11 HDD in active-idle</li><li>38 watts with the 6x 3.5″ HDD in Idle B</li><li>34 watts with the 6x 3.5″ HDD in Idle C</li><li>21 watts with the 6x 3.5″ HDD in Standby_Z (spun down)</li><li>18 watts with the 5x 2.5″ HDD ALSO in Standby</li><li>16 watts with the display output ALSO off</li><li>15 watts when PowerTOP is allowed to disable the USB Keyboard</li></ul><p>Seagate rates standby consumption of these 3.5″ drives at about 0.8w each, and the 2.5″ drives at about 0.18w each. This lines up with what I’m seeing above. My active-idle numbers actually match up pretty well to Seagate specs too.</p><p><strong>The obvious observation: compared to the rest of the system components, the 3.5″ drives are power-hungry monsters.</strong></p><p>The HDDs will eventually be replaced with SSDs. With idle consumption as low as it is during HDD standby, there isn’t a major rush and this process will gradually take place as my HDD drives/spares <u>fail</u> and SSD prices <u>fall</u>.</p><p>The plan for “end game” is for an all-SSD build. Originally the plan was for 1 boot drive, 6xNVMe (likely Crucial P3 4TB) for a RAIDZ2 array, and 6xSATA (likely Samsung 870 QVO 8TB) for the 2nd RAIDZ2 array. Since using the CPU-connected M2/PCIe slots not only brings unpredictability but also comes at a slight C-state/power/temperature cost, I might alter that plan and give up a couple NVMe in the first array and use SATA instead so that I don’t have to touch CPU-connected lanes. Time will tell.<br> </p><h2>Unnecessary Storage Details</h2><p>This part is only worth reading if you’re interested in meticulous details about the storage. Feel free to skip to the final section otherwise.</p><blockquote><h4>NVMe boot drive</h4><p>As alluded to earlier, this is a Samsung 970 EVO Plus. Currently less than 4GB of the 500GB space is used (a 64GB swap partition exists but always sits at 0 used). It was originally chosen because Samsung had developed a reputation for reliability (which has been falling by the wayside lately), and Samsung also scored well in reviews every time it came to idle power consumption. This drive is almost always idle and both Controller and NAND temps stayed low throughout all testing (20-24C). It may eventually be swapped to a SATA SSD to free up an NVMe port.</p><h4>2.5″ HDD</h4><p>These drives are used for the primary 6-drive ZFS RAIDZ2 array – the one that gets the most use. One day a week it’s busy with a task that involves reading a few TB over the course of 24 hours. Usage through the rest of the week is sporadic, and the drives spend most of the week spun down. For anyone wondering why piddly 2.5″ drives are used instead of 3.5″ drives, there *is* a reason: <strong>power consumption</strong>.</p><p>Power consumption of the 2.5″ Seagate drives is honestly <strong>pretty impressive</strong>. Spun down they’re each rated at 0.18w, in low power idle they’re rated at 0.85w, and the read/write averages are rated at about 2w. There are plenty of SSDs out there with worse power consumption numbers than this spinning rust. 5TB capacity gives a lot of storage-per-watt.</p><p>The major downsides to these 2.5″ Seagate drives are:</p><ul><li>Not great performers. 80-120MB/s peak read/write. To be fair though, many TLC/QLC SSDs fall to these write levels when their SLC cache is exhausted.</li><li>SMR (Shingled Magnetic recording). Reads are fine, but write performance absolutely plummets when random writes take place – it acts like a QLC SSD without an SLC cache that also doesn’t have TRIM.</li><li>Low rated workload (55TB/year vs 550TB/year for 3.5″ Exos drives).</li><li>No configurable error recovery time (SCT ERC), and these drives can hang for minutes if they hit an error while they relentlessly try to re-read the problematic sector. Ubuntu needs to be configured to wait instead of trying to reset the drive after 30 seconds.</li><li>Higher error rates if they heat up (I’ve had to replace a few and have discovered they don’t like running hot).</li><li>Typical HDD pain points (slow to spin up, etc).</li></ul><p>To be absolutely fair to Seagate, these are sold as external USB backup drives. Pulling these 15mm tall drives out of the enclosures and using them as RAID members in a NAS isn’t exactly using them as intended. The ultra low power consumption is tremendous, but there are obvious trade-offs.</p><p>Long term, these 2.5″ 4/5TB drives will slowly be replaced by 4TB SSD drives (possibly all NVMe). SSDs in 4TB capacity started to become available on the consumer end in 2021/2022 at about 4-5x the cost of the spinners. Less than 2 years later they’ve dropped to about 2x the cost, and I expect decent brands to last more than 2x as long as the Seagate spinners.</p><p>If availability of the Crucial P3 (Gen3) model remains, I’ll likely keep with this model despite being limited to Gen3 speeds. I strongly considered the Crucial P3 Plus (Gen4), but power consumption in reviews was higher despite very few situations where performance was notably higher as well. My biggest concern with the P3 Plus (Gen4) was that if I had issues with ASPM/APST, Tom’s Hardware showed it with a 0.3w idle power premium over the P3 (Gen3) for the 2TB model. I prefer “worst-case scenario” power to be as low as possible.</p><h4>3.5″ HDD</h4><p>Used in the secondary 6-drive RAIDZ2 array – a backup array that’s spun up for about 2 hours a week where it receives constant heavy writes.</p><p>Power consumption of the 3.5″ Seagate drives is about what you’d expect. These 10TB drives are rated at about 0.8w each in standby, 2-5w idle, and 6-9w reading and writing.</p><p>Two concerns here:</p><ul><li>These are rated to collectively pull about 45-50 watts when writing. That’s a bit of extra UPS load I don’t really want if a lengthy power outage takes place during the backups (I stick with consumer 1500 watt UPS’s).</li><li>These are rated to collectively pull about 4.8 watts when in standby. Again, some UPS load I wouldn’t mind shaving off.</li></ul><p>Long-term these drives will likely be replaced by Samsung 870 QVO 8TB SATA drives. The 870 QVO sports 0.041w/0.046w idle with ALPM, 0.224w/0.229w idle without, and 2.0-2.7w during a copy (according to Toms/Anandtech).</p><p>Price-wise, the Samsung 8TB SATA SSD is currently a fair bit more expensive than 8TB spinners (closer to 3x the cost) so unless these drives start to see more frequent use for some reason, replacement with the SSDs will almost certainly wait until I’ve run out of spares.</p><h4>NVMe Cache Drive</h4><p>Replacing my spinning rust with SSDs is a process that will likely take a while.</p><p>In the meantime, ZFS has a couple options to make use of high-speed storage (typically SSD) in front of slower storage:</p><ul><li>“Special” Allocation Class – allows you to create a vdev specifically for metadata and for “small” blocks if desired.</li><li>A cache drive, known commonly as an L2ARC.</li></ul><p>If you create the “special” vdev at pool creation, all your metadata (and optionally, small blocks of a size you choose) will go on the “special” vdev instead of your spinning rust. Very fast file listings and directory traversal whilst keeping the spinning rust for the files themselves. Yes, you can “ls” a bunch of directories without waking your HDDs from sleep. Biggest downside is that because all your metadata is on this vdev, if it ever dies, access to all your data is essentially gone. So it really should be at least mirrored. Maybe even a 3-way mirror. Say goodbye to a few ports.</p><p>The L2ARC is a bit different. It’s essentially a level 2 cache. When the cache in RAM gets full, ZFS will copy some of the blocks to the L2ARC before it evicts that content from RAM. The next time that data needs to be accessed, it’ll be read from the L2ARC instead of the disk. One benefit compared to the “special” vdev is that you’re fine with only 1 SSD – if there’s a problem with the data in the L2ARC (bad checksum, drive dies, etc), ZFS will just read the content from the original disk. Also, once the L2ARC is full, ZFS will just start again at the beginning of the L2ARC SSD and overwrite stuff it wrote before which has some pros (old data never accessed anymore) and cons (data that was frequently accessed and will need to get written to the L2ARC again). You can also add/remove L2ARC devices from the pool at your leisure – want to add a 64GB SSD, 500GB SSD, and 2TB SSD? Go right ahead – ZFS will distribute blocks among them. Need to remove the 500GB SSD from the pool a few days later and use it elsewhere? Go right ahead. The biggest downside to the L2ARC is that if you forget to specify “cache” when adding the device, you probably mucked up your pool. It’s also imperfect: even with careful tuning it’s hard to get ZFS to write EVERYTHING you want to the L2ARC before it gets evicted from memory. At the same time, depending on your data, the L2ARC may see a lot of writes, and you may have to carefully watch the health of your SSD.</p><p>In the past I’ve used the “special”, used L2ARC, and have used both at the same time (you can even tell the L2ARC not to cache things already contained in the “special” vdev).</p><p><strong>This time around I simply went with an L2ARC on a 4TB NVMe:</strong> once all the other 2.5″ drives have been replaced by SSD and the speed benefits of an SSD cache no longer apply, I can simply remove this cache device (though theoretically having 1 L2ARC cache drive handling the bulk of reads *would* allow the other NVMe drives to stay in low power mode more…).</p></blockquote><h2>Conclusion – Regrets? Second-guessing? What could have gone differently?</h2><p>Unlike the <a href="https://mattgadient.com/9w-idle-creating-a-low-power-home-nas-file-server-with-4-storage-drives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASRock J4005 build</a> where I realized part way through that I’d kneecapped myself in a number of ways, I don’t get the same sense here. This time I ended up with low idle power AND a pretty capable system that should be flexible even if repurposed in the future.</p><p>I’m quite happy with my component choices, though I’d be curious to know how the MSI PRO Z790-P DDR4 (one of the other motherboards I considered) would do in comparison. Functionality-wise the MSI has the advantage of 6xSATA ports, but it comes with the obvious downside of the notorious Intel 2.5G networking chip. The MSI also has a PS/2 port and I’ve never actually checked to see if PS/2 keyboard power consumption is lower than USB (recall that I save 1 watt if I allow powertop to shut down the USB keyboard port). And of course it would be interesting to compare the ASPM and ALPM settings, and to see if the snags I hit with CPU-attached PCIe/M.2 slots exist in the same way.</p><p>While this system currently sits in the 15-16 watt range when idle with drives in <i>standby</i>, once all HDDs are replaced with SSDs, I’d expect idle consumption of around 10-11 watts which isn’t bad for 72TB worth of drives, 64GB of RAM, and a pretty decent processor.</p><p><b>Update:</b> Recent Linux kernels disable the L1 power saving modes of most Realtek NICs which prevents the CPU from entering decent C-states, thus increasing power consumption by quite a lot. While there are workarounds, moving forward I’ll likely limit myself to motherboards containing Intel 1 Gigabit network adapters (perhaps moving to Intel 2.5 Gigabit when it becomes clear they’ve worked out all the kinks). You can find further details about the Realtek NIC situation in the comments below. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>The Carolina African Runner peanut re-emerges, giving farmers and chefs a new culinary adventure.</strong></p><p>At Clemson University’s Coastal Research and Education Lab, horticulturist Dr. Brian Ward stands for hours at a time carefully hand sorting, shelling and cleaning a small, distinctive and somewhat celebrated peanut known as the Carolina African Runner peanut. And like most rare finds, it has a story behind it.</p><blockquote>“The Carolina African peanut is so tiny that when it runs through a shelling machine, only about 70% will make it into a pile of good seed, then the sheller has to throw the rest out,” Ward said.</blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/54y5ztcs/production/eb5a9a9dc0b7af69ae531a021629edf7995a107c-550x550.jpg?w=650&amp;q=90" alt="a man crouched in a peanut crop field wearing a plaid shirt."></p><p><em>Horticulturist Dr. Brian Ward, Clemson University</em></p><p>This spring, Ward is bent on safeguarding as many good seeds as possible to provide farmers with enough seeds to sustain the heirloom peanut. So, he’s hand-shelling that last 30%.</p><blockquote>“It takes about six of us cleaning and separating to get about 20 extra pounds of seed in a day,” Ward said.</blockquote><p>The necessary tedium to ensure the peanuts are edible helps explain one reason food historians, chefs and artisans assumed this peanut was extinct.</p><h2>Once Upon a Time</h2><p>Brought to the port of Charleston in 1690 by African slaves, the re-emerged Carolina African Runner peanut is known as the first peanut planted in the American colonies. It is denser, sweeter, smaller and had a higher oil content than the peanuts we eat today.</p><p>Originally, its culinary uses were influenced by West African practices: the peanuts were boiled, ground into meal, candied, mashed or made into a hot beverage, roasted and pressed into oil.</p><p>In the 1800s, taste buds in the northern cities preferred roasted peanuts, and street and ballpark vendors popularized the larger Virginia snack peanuts. The public quickly deemed Virginias as America’s “eating” peanut.</p><p>When the boll weevil threatened to wipe out the South’s cotton crop in the 1910s, and cottonseed was unavailable for cottonseed oil production, the Carolina African peanut saw a brief resurgence because of its high oil content. But by the 1930s, the peanut’s small size created additional work at harvest and field workers complained. It was vulnerable to certain diseases in the field, which made it unreliable for growers who needed to produce larger crops.</p><p>Historians believe the last commercial crops of Carolina African peanuts date from the late 1920s, and it was believed to be extinct by the end of the 1950s.</p><p>Whether by fate or foresight, a mere 40 Carolina African Runner Peanut seeds were carefully tucked away in cold storage by plant breeders at North Carolina State University (NCSU).</p><h2>A Quest Begins</h2><p>Some 60 years later, food historian Dr. David Shields of the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation, along with Southern food artisans, chefs and financial partners, began a quest to recreate a historic Southern menu. Shields searched through colonial ship manifests and early papers to find proof that in 1690 peanut seeds arrived on our shores. Five years later, a phone call to NCSU’s breeding facility produced the ancestral peanut.</p><blockquote>“They gave me half of the entire collection,” Ward said. “They just told me it was ‘special seed’ and to take good care of it. It wasn’t until harvest that I learned these were the original Carolina African Runner peanuts everybody thought were extinct."</blockquote><p>In 2013, Ward planted the seeds next to his field lab to watch them closely, and twelve plants made it. The next season, Ward and a South Carolina farmer Nat Bradford multiplied the seeds to 1,200 plants. Other farmers got involved and the first commercial crop of 15 million peanuts was harvested in 2016.</p><p>Then, bad weather struck the Southeastern growing regions for two seasons, hitting the heirloom peanut fields hard. Flooding and a GPS error greatly reduced the yield and Ward is growing out a smaller two-acre field -- “not for selling, but just for seed.”</p><h2>The Most “Peanutty” of Peanuts</h2><blockquote>“The best part of this discovery is it has cultural and historical significance,” Ward said. “The flavor is ‘wow,’ ‘bam!’ The aroma is more potent than our traditional peanuts today.”</blockquote><p>Chef Forrest Parker of the Old Village Post House in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina was the first chef who received the peanuts. He calls them “the most peanutty peanut of peanuts,” Ward said.</p><p>Nat Bradford, an artisan farmer in Seneca, South Carolina, and was given enough of the revived peanut seeds for three-fourths of an acre.</p><blockquote>“The story behind it is fascinating to me,” Bradford said, “Once you acquire the seed, it’s precious and you’re a steward of it. You don’t want to store it, but to put it back into use, to reproduce it and discover the market potential.”</blockquote><p>This year, he’s planting five acres and “making it successful enough to be sustainable and profitable,” Bradford said. “I’ve never had a peanut like it.”</p><p>Bradford admits the price is high right now ($20 per pound) but he said it’s because “there’s so much work involved in cleaning, sorting and shelling. I’ve spent most of my winter evenings with my kids cleaning, picking out debris, shelling them—it’s a labor of love.”</p><h2>Reawakening an Original Superfood</h2><p>Ward sees market potential for the Carolina African peanut. He’s had dozens of farmers interested in growing it and shipped it to 50 or 60 artisan farmers so far. Several chefs throughout South Carolina and Georgia are experimenting with different culinary uses, such as making peanut hummus and peanut brittle or boiled peanuts.</p><p>As Bradford said, “The difference is the flavor. I want chefs to find new ways to use them, so more people can experience their flavor. It is uniquely amazing.”</p><p>One peanut butter company, Good Spread, is interested in the heirloom peanut because it reflects their mission of “fighting global malnutrition and using our footprint to protect and enrich the environment and communities we impact,” said Robbie Vitrano, founder and owner of Good Spread. Each jar the company sells provides one packet of peanut butter-based Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to treat malnourished children worldwide.</p><p>Plus, Vittrano is working on a peanut butter with the heirloom peanut. But why the Carolina African peanut?</p><blockquote>“We love the cultural narrative of the artisan peanut, and the opportunity to use agricultural practices that protect and improve the environment," Vittrano said. "Peanuts are an original superfood—we believe one way we’ll reawaken people to that is with products that have both an original story and bring new flavors and tastes to our customers.”</blockquote><p>That’s why many believe the story of America’s original peanut is just beginning.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteamOS 3 (“Holo”) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the Steam Deck, Valve Software’s portable PC gaming device. It’s a very interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into that partition. But consumers can also run <code>steamos-devmode</code> to unlock the root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them a working Linux distro with a normal package manager.</p><p>This A/B atomic updates system is pretty standard for OSes these days, but there’s a lot going on in SteamOS that makes them work even with heavy customization by the end-user. I wanted to explore that while still being able to make changes to the root filesystem images. <code>steamos-devmode</code> is the easy way out; I wanted to make a proper fork. Here’s how I did it.</p><ili-callout role="note"><p>I use these instructions, but am providing them here to help publicly document some of what SteamOS does. I’m not responsible for you breaking your Steam Deck, and if you send me questions asking why these steps don’t work for you I won’t answer.</p></ili-callout><h2>Why?</h2><p>I don’t own a Steam Deck. A bunch of my friends do, but they know better than to let me have root access on a device they actually like using. What I do have is a recently-built living room PC that I wanted to play games on… and SteamOS seemed like a reasonable choice. It almost even worked perfectly out of the box, although I think that is primarily because I built a computer that looks vaguely similar to a really heavy, battery-less Steam Deck<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-fragile" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-fragile">1</a></sup>.</p><p>The one thing that didn’t work was resume from suspend. Other distributions running on my computer using mainline or stable kernels did. Eventually, I found <a href="https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources/">the sources for Valve’s kernel</a> (it’s weird, I’ll explain when we get there) and started a <code>git bisect</code>, leading me to a commit that seems to fix resume from suspend on Steam Deck hardware, but ultimately breaks it on mine. Needing to revert this commit and do my own build is the ultimate reason I headed down this path.</p><p>At several points in this process my partner asked if this made more sense than just using Arch or something else directly. I still don’t know the answer, although I think I still prefer relying on a Valve-tested set of packages than whatever’s current in the Arch repos. If I’m going to have to tinker with a Linux distro for running games, it may as well be one that people actually test their games on.</p><p>I apparently have a tendency to make poor choices like this, because you are reading the second post in what has become a series on <a href="https://iliana.fyi/blog/installing-fedora-on-mac-mini/">installing Linux distros onto systems they’re not ready for yet</a>.</p><h2>SteamOS in a nutshell</h2><p>A SteamOS system has eight partitions. The stage 1 bootloader is stored on the EFI system partition, along with metadata files that describe the two A/B partition sets and how to choose which one to boot. Each of the two partition sets contains a stage 2 bootloader (GRUB), the root filesystem, and a <code>/var</code> partition. Finally, there’s a single <code>home</code> partition that fills the rest of the disk.</p><pre><code>Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048          133119   64.0 MiB    EF00  esp
   2          133120          198655   32.0 MiB    0700  efi-A
   3          198656          264191   32.0 MiB    0700  efi-B
   4          264192        10749951   5.0 GiB     8304  rootfs-A
   5        10749952        21235711   5.0 GiB     8304  rootfs-B
   6        21235712        21759999   256.0 MiB   8310  var-A
   7        21760000        22284287   256.0 MiB   8310  var-B
   8        22284288      4000797319   1.9 TiB     8302  home
</code></pre><p>When the system boots, a number of other pseudo-filesystems get mounted. Almost a dozen directories, including <code>/var/log</code>, <code>/root</code>, and <code>/nix</code>, are bind-mounted from <code>/home/.steamos/offload</code> to keep their data persistent.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite detail of SteamOS is how it handles <code>/etc</code>: it mounts an overlayfs on top of it, with modifications persisted at <code>/var/lib/overlays/etc/upper</code>. This allows persisting the usual things that need to be persisted in <code>/etc</code> (e.g. the <code>machine-id</code> file, NetworkManager connections) while allowing updates to untouched configuration files. Most Linux package managers have similar behaviors around <code>/etc</code>, only updating config files that haven’t been changed from their defaults, but Valve’s approach makes this work with the A/B partition system without any package manager logic.</p><p>A system update is started when the Steam client, or a user in a terminal, runs <code>steamos-update</code>. This runs a Python program, <code>steamos-atomupd-client</code>, which sends a request containing the current OS information and the user’s update channel configuration to the URLs in <code>/etc/steamos-atomupd/client.conf</code> in order to determine whether there is a new update.</p><p>If there is, the servers respond with a path to a <a href="https://rauc.io/">RAUC bundle</a>, which the client downloads and runs <code>rauc install</code> on. RAUC verifies the signature of the bundle and looks for the <code>rootfs.img.caibx</code> file, then runs <code>casync extract</code> to download all the necessary pieces of the new image and write them to the inactive rootfs partition. RAUC then runs a post-install script that selectively<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-selectively" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-selectively">2</a></sup> synchronizes data from the active <code>/var</code> partition to the inactive <code>/var</code> partition, and modifies the stage 1 bootloader configuration on the EFI system partition to boot into the newly-written partition set.</p><h2>Patching the kernel</h2><p>Valve uses a heavily-modified Linux kernel in SteamOS. We can know this because we can readily download the sources. It’s a little more convoluted than <code>git clone</code>, but not by much. Their <a href="https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/">pacman mirror</a> can be found in <code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code>, and the sources used for current (as of writing) SteamOS images are in the <code>sources/holo-3.5</code> and <code>sources/jupiter-3.5</code>. Right now, the current stable image’s kernel is <code>6.1.52-valve9-1-neptune-61</code>, whose source lives at <a href="https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources/jupiter-3.5/linux-neptune-61-6.1.52.valve9-1.src.tar.gz">https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources/jupiter-3.5/linux-neptune-61-6.1.52.valve9-1.src.tar.gz</a>.</p><p>This is a 2.9 GiB tarball. Why is it that big? Because there’s an entire Linux Git tree in here.</p><pre><code>$ tar xvf linux-neptune-61-6.1.52.valve9-1.src.tar.gz

</code></pre><p>Then <code>makepkg</code> should spit out a package. (Tip: <code>makepkg MAKEFLAGS=-j$(nproc)</code>, or updating <code>/etc/makepkg.conf</code>, is a good idea if you are not building in a tiny virtual machine.) This same general process should apply for any SteamOS-specific packages; all the ones I’ve looked at similarly use a Git repository as their first source.</p><p>To make the next steps easier, I set up a pacman repo containing my package outputs. This also helps the <code>steamos-devmode</code> tool work properly if you choose to run that in the future. This is <a href="https://archlinux.org/pacman/repo-add.8.html">very simple</a>: put the packages in a directory, run <code>repo-add $REPO_NAME.db.tar.zst [PACKAGES...]</code> in that directory, and upload the directory to a web host somewhere.</p><h2>Repacking the root filesystem</h2><p>The update client is perfectly-readable Python, and the sources for the rest of the packages on the system can be found adjacent to Valve’s pacman repos, but I haven’t yet found any release engineering scripts. Reverse engineering these would be fraught, time-consuming, and beyond what I believe my attention span would allow, so I decided to take the existing root filesystem and “repack” it to fit my needs.</p><p>If you want my scripts without the explanations and commentary, you can find them at <a href="https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/">https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/</a>.</p><h3>Getting the root filesystem</h3><ili-callout role="note"><p>The normal way to get a copy of the SteamOS root filesystem image is to buy a Steam Deck or download the recovery image from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download?ver=steamdeck">https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download?ver=steamdeck</a>, both of which require agreeing to the Steam End User License Agreement<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-agreement" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-agreement">4</a></sup>. The methods I describe below don’t make you do this, but now you’re aware of it.</p></ili-callout><p>First, we need the root filesystem. You could install SteamOS, run an update, and pull it off the disk, but that is kind of obnoxious, especially if you don’t have any hardware to install it on.</p><p>Every build of a Steam Deck image can be found at <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/">https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/</a>, but to find the current release version you can look at what appears to be a fallback URL for the updates system, <a href="https://steamdeck-atomupd.steamos.cloud/meta/steamos/amd64/snapshot/steamdeck.json">https://steamdeck-atomupd.steamos.cloud/meta/steamos/amd64/snapshot/steamdeck.json</a> (or <a href="https://steamdeck-atomupd.steamos.cloud/meta/steamos/amd64/snapshot/steamdeck-beta.json">this path for the preview channel</a>). As of writing, the current stable version is <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20231122.1/">https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20231122.1/</a>.</p><p>To download the root filesystem, we follow the same steps <code>steamos-atomupd-client</code> does: first, download the RAUC bundle (the <code>.raucb</code> file). Then extract the <code>rootfs.img.caibx</code> from inside; these RAUC bundles are SquashFS filesystems with a signature at the end, so you can either mount it or use unsquashfs (from squashfs-tools) or p7zip to extract it without mounting. Finally, use casync to fetch the image using the <code>.castr</code> store adjacent to the <code>.raucb</code> bundle:</p><pre><code>casync extract \
	--store=https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20231122.1/steamdeck-20231122.1-3.5.7.castr \
	rootfs.img.caibx rootfs.img
</code></pre><p>The casync store URL is the RAUC bundle URL, but with <code>.raucb</code> replaced with <code>.castr</code> (this is hardcoded in <code>steamos-atomupd</code>).</p><p><a href="https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/fetch-current.sh?id=c50eb80f23c08f1ffc824d4983d5b9a740fb1273">Here is a script I use to do all this.</a></p><ili-tangent role="note"><p>The adjacent <code>.img.zip</code> and <code>.img.zst</code> files are not the root filesystem, sadly, but are separate bootable recovery images:</p><pre><code>$ sgdisk --print disk.img
Disk disk.img: 15125000 sectors, 7.2 GiB
[...]

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name

</code></pre><p>You could extract the rootfs partition and use it in the next steps, but for some reason it’s not a bit-for-bit copy of the image that is downloaded via RAUC and casync, and doing this doesn’t save you from having to use those tools as we need them to turn our repacked image back into an update bundle.</p></ili-tangent><h3>Mounting the root filesystem</h3><p>First, we should randomize the filesystem UUID. If you update from a currently-released SteamOS image to your customized one without randomizing the filesystem UUID, you will end up with two distinct filesystems with the same UUID. This can cause problems.</p><pre><code>btrfstune -fu rootfs.img
</code></pre><p>Valve is currently using Btrfs images with zstd compression, so to maintain that compression as we change the image, we need to mount it with the appropriate option:</p><pre><code>mkdir rootfs
mount -o compress=zstd rootfs.img rootfs
</code></pre><p>SteamOS uses Btrfs’s <code>readonly</code> subvolume property; clear that flag:</p><pre><code>btrfs property set -ts rootfs ro false
</code></pre><p>Modifying certain packages, such as the Linux kernel, triggers scripts that want /dev and /proc, so mount those:</p><pre><code>mount -t devtmpfs dev rootfs/dev
mount -t proc proc rootfs/proc
</code></pre><p>It’s also a good idea to prevent writes to directories that will be mounted by the booted system. We can mount tmpfs to these directories:</p><pre><code>mount -t tmpfs tmpfs rootfs/tmp
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755 tmpfs rootfs/run
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755 tmpfs rootfs/var
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=755 tmpfs rootfs/home
</code></pre><p>In this example we’ll be installing packages via pacman repositories in a chroot (using pacman’s <code>--sysroot</code> option). Networking functions fine in a chroot, but name resolution still relies on a correct /etc/resolv.conf, so bind mount one in:</p><pre><code>mount --bind "$(realpath /etc/resolv.conf)" rootfs/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><h3>Replacing packages</h3><p>To add your custom repository, make it the first repository entry in <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code>. This will ensure your packages override any newer-versioned ones from Valve’s repositories. It also allows your packages to be reinstalled by <code>steamos-devmode</code> if you run that on this image. I used this stanza:</p><pre><code>[fauxlo]
Server = https://fauxlo.ili.fyi/pacman/$arch
SigLevel = Never
</code></pre><p><code>SigLevel = Never</code> allows the packages to have no signatures. If you want to GPG-sign your packages, go for it, but that’s beyond what I have patience for.</p><ili-tangent role="note"><p>If you do end up installing GPG-signed packages, you’ll need to populate the pacman keyring. I think it’s best to avoid messing with the empty keyring in <code>/etc/pacman.d/gnupg</code> by populating a new keyring on a tmpfs:</p><pre><code>chroot rootfs pacman-key --gpgdir /tmp/gnupg --init
chroot rootfs pacman-key --gpgdir /tmp/gnupg --populate
# These start a gpg-agent, which we need to stop before we can unmount at the end.
chroot rootfs gpgconf --homedir /tmp/gnupg --kill all
</code></pre><p>Then add <code>--gpgdir /tmp/gnupg</code> to your pacman incantation.</p></ili-tangent><p>Then, we install:</p><pre><code>pacman --sysroot rootfs --noconfirm -Sy linux-neptune-61
</code></pre><ili-tangent role="note"><p>In my script, I avoid using <code>-y</code> and instead synchronize my repository’s database behind pacman’s back before running the install command:</p><pre><code>curl -Ro rootfs/usr/lib/holo/pacmandb/sync/fauxlo.db \
	https://fauxlo.ili.fyi/pacman/x86_64/fauxlo.db
</code></pre><p>This keeps the state of the other repositories on disk frozen at the same point in time when the image was originally built. I don’t think this actually matters, but it reduces the changes that show up if I diff my image against Valve’s.</p></ili-tangent><h3>Changing the build ID</h3><p><code>steamos-atomupd</code> reads from <code>/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</code>, or if that is somehow missing, <code>/etc/os-release</code>, to determine the version and build ID of the current image. It will refuse to perform an update if the server says the available update’s build ID is the same as the current image. It’s also good to know what image you’re running.</p><p>The build ID <em>must</em> be of the form YYYYMMDD.N. If it isn’t, <code>steamos-atomupd</code> exits with a Python traceback upon encountering it. To avoid having to remember to count up manually, I set N to a timestamp; either HHMMSS or a Unix timestamp would work fine.</p><p>Update the <code>buildid</code> field in <code>rootfs/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</code> and the <code>BUILD_ID</code> field in <code>rootfs/etc/os-release</code> with whatever you pick. You can steal from <a href="https://git.iliana.fyi/fauxlo/tree/repack.sh?id=c50eb80f23c08f1ffc824d4983d5b9a740fb1273#n47">the Bash script I wrote to do this</a>.</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>--- a/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</span>

</code></pre><h3>Other changes</h3><p>You can make pretty much any change you want at this point as long as you don’t run out of space in a 5 GiB Btrfs image. For instance, if you want your SteamOS device to be resolvable as <code>hostname.local</code> on your network, you could remove <code>rootfs/usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/00-disable-mdns.conf</code>. This <em>can</em> be overridden with a configuration in the <code>/etc</code> overlay, but it’s kind of a pain in the ass.</p><p>In general, my philosophy here is that you should avoid making changes that are trivial to perform without modifying the image. You <em>could</em> install Firefox in the root filesystem this way, instead of using Flatpak or Nix, but then you’d need to repack the image every time you want to install a Firefox security update.</p><h3>Unmounting the root filesystem</h3><p>Mark the filesystem read-only once again:</p><pre><code>btrfs property set -ts rootfs ro true
</code></pre><p>Discard any unused blocks:</p><pre><code>fstrim -v rootfs
</code></pre><p>Then, unmount. <code>--recursive</code> is particularly helpful here to take care of all the pseudo-filesystems we mounted in:</p><pre><code>umount --recursive rootfs
</code></pre><h2>Creating the RAUC bundle</h2><p>First we need to create the casync store and blob index. We can do this with:</p><pre><code>mkdir bundle
casync make --store=rootfs.img.castr \
	bundle/rootfs.img.caibx rootfs.img
</code></pre><p>The RAUC bundle needs two other files. The first is <code>manifest.raucm</code>:</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>cat</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>bundle/manifest.raucm</span><span> </span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOF</span>

<span>filename=rootfs.img.caibx</span>
<span>EOF</span>
</code></pre><p>The second is a <code>UUID</code> file containing the filesystem UUID:</p><pre><code>blkid -s UUID -o value rootfs.img &gt;bundle/UUID
</code></pre><p>With those three files:</p><pre><code>$ ls bundle
manifest.raucm  rootfs.img.caibx  UUID
</code></pre><p>we can now call <code>rauc bundle</code>:</p><pre><code>rauc bundle \
	--signing-keyring=cert.pem --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem \
	bundle rootfs.img.raucb
</code></pre><p>Upload <code>rootfs.img.raucb</code> and <code>rootfs.img.caibx</code> to the web server specified by <code>ImagesUrl</code> in <code>rootfs/etc/steamos-atomupd/client.conf</code>. These need to be in the same directory.</p><h2>Final update server setup</h2><p>The web server you used for <code>QueryUrl</code> and <code>MetaUrl</code> in <code>rootfs/etc/steamos-atomupd/client.conf</code> will need to serve a JSON file. This doesn’t need to be fancy; what I do is write a <code>live.json</code> file with these contents:</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>{</span>

<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>Note that the object at <code>.minor.candidates[0].image</code> should be the same as <code>/lib/steamos-atomupd/manifest.json</code> in your image. <code>update_path</code> is what the updates client will append to your <code>ImagesUrl</code> to download the bundle.</p><p>I use the following Caddy configuration to rewrite the requests <code>steamos-atomupd</code> makes to <code>QueryUrl</code> and <code>MetaUrl</code> to the above <code>live.json</code>:</p><pre><code>root * /var/www/fauxlo.ili.fyi
rewrite /updates /live.json
rewrite /meta/*/*/*/*.json /live.json
rewrite /meta/*/*/*/*/*.json /live.json
file_server browse
</code></pre><p>The real SteamOS <code>QueryUrl</code> and <code>MetaUrl</code> seem to have quite a bit more logic to them, but this is sufficient to get <code>steamos-atomupd</code> to find the new update. It has logic to avoid updating if it’s already running the image advertised as currently available.</p><h2>Updating!</h2><p>Once you have all this in place, you can update an existing SteamOS installation to this by modifying <code>/etc/rauc/keyring.pem</code> and <code>/etc/steamos-atomupd/client.conf</code>. (No <code>steamos-readonly disable</code> required, as your changes will land on the <code>/etc</code> overlay; after you run <code>steamos-update</code>, consider cleaning those changes out of <code>/var/lib/overlays/etc/upper</code>.)</p><p>You can also probably install your modified SteamOS by modifying one of Valve’s recovery images, replacing their rootfs with your own.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tesla cars are shoddily built pieces of shit liable to fall apart and malfunction in dangerous ways at inopportune moments. No, this is not a blog from 2012! It is also not a blog from 2015 or 2018 or 2022. It is not even a blog from two weeks ago about Tesla's self-driving systems <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killing people all over the place</a>. It is a blog from today, Dec. 21, 2023.</p><p>On Wednesday, Reuters published <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a big, thorough investigative story</a> documenting a pattern of major parts failures on low-mileage Tesla vehicles—and Tesla's organized years-long effort to obscure the pattern and offload its costs onto drivers, so as to sustain the illusion that it is a profitable company making cars that are not piece-of-shit death traps. By "major parts failures," I should specify here that we are not talking about, like, a faulty turn signal, or an unreliable trunk latch. We are talking about stuff like <em>a whole-ass wheel falling off of your Model 3 while it travels at highway speeds</em>, or <em>the suspension collapsing while you make a left turn, causing the body of the car to crunch down onto the road</em>, or <em>an axle half-shaft fucking snapping while you accelerate</em>, or <em>the power steering suddenly failing while you are zooming along at 60 miles per hour.</em> </p><p>We are talking, in short, about engineering failures—failures that anyone would find alarming if they encountered them in a soap box derby racer made out of literally a soap box—happening, abruptly and without warning,<strong> </strong>to Tesla cars that are for all practical purposes brand new. Moreover, they're happening to lots of them, because of manufacture and assembly problems the company knew about, and hid, and lied about, and blamed on the poor suckers who bought its crappy cars.</p><p>The Reuters piece is quite long, and earns its length with an incredible wealth of damning receipts, including internal Tesla communications making clear that the company has known about its own shoddy work for a long time, even as it deceived investors, regulators, and drivers. I urge you to read it for yourself. It opens with a representative anecdote, funny only because its events take place at low speed on a surface road rather than on a highway, where someone would have died: The front-right suspension collapses beneath a brand-new Tesla Model Y with a whopping 115 miles on the odometer, leaving parts of the car scraping along the pavement. </p><p>A Tesla technician initially (and correctly) diagnoses a parts failure, obligating the company to pay for repairs. Later, however, the SUV's owner, who'd had the vehicle for 24 hours when its suspension kerploded beneath him, receives an official email blaming the collapse on "prior external influenced damage"—claiming, in other words, than in less than 24 hours he'd managed to beat up his Model Y's front-right suspension enough to cause its <em>complete spontaneous collapse</em>—and putting him on the hook for a $14,000 repair bill.</p><p>Here I would like to pause for a moment of personal reflection. I have been an owner and driver of automobiles for, oh God, something like 25 years. These vehicles have cut a fairly wide sample of the world of automobiles. Many of them were absolute beaters that couldn't come within shouting distance of passing a safety inspection. A smaller number were nice late-model used cars still effectively new. One was an ill-chosen base-model Dodge Neon bought brand-new for reasons that surpass all explanation or defense. American cars, Japanese cars, Swedish cars, Korean cars. Compacts, sedans, minivans, even a couple of sprightly little sports cars. I drove across the country in a then-newish Toyota Celica and in a crusty old Jeep Cherokee and in a dangerously overloaded Ford Contour; I did hellish daily D.C. commutes in a capable Honda Civic and in a Geo Metro micro-compact only slightly larger than the jacket I was wearing. I foolishly drove an early-80s Volvo station wagon straight through a flood so deep it washed over the bottom of the windshield. I drove back and forth to a bookstore job in an ancient Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais so apocalyptically derelict that when I got pulled over for a busted taillight, the lady cop fixed me with sad eyes and asked "Is everything OK with you?"</p><p>Where I am going with this is, I have never, <em>ever</em> had the suspension of a car collapse under me. I have never had a wheel come off of the car I was driving. No axle shaft has ever snapped while I was driving a car; not once have I had to replace a steering column. Some of those cars were held together with paperclips, man. That Geo Metro's frame was just rolled-up logs of aluminum foil. I couldn't have sold that Cutlass Calais for a packet of Toast Chee.</p><p>Back to Tesla. The Reuters piece makes clear that the internal practice of blaming part failures on drivers themselves—others can fight over whether it's fraud in any legal sense—was a common tactic on Tesla's part, made explicit in company documents. In this way it fought off expensive recalls in Europe and the U.S.—it couldn't do so in China, where regulators were less eager to fall for its bullshit—and made its business appear more profitable to investors, whose calculations would look quite different if they assumed hundreds or thousands of dollars of repair liability for each Tesla vehicle sold. Given that regulatory arbitrage, not selling cars, is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-credits-gm-fiat-20190603-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla's real business</a>, I suppose it makes a grim sort of sense that this would be baked into the front-facing, car-selling part of the operation.</p><p>In general I don't like spoiling the kicker of somebody else's article, but I'd like to call your attention to the following quote, which ends the Reuters piece and crystallizes, I think, something important. The context is: A Tesla driver has brought his wife's Model 3 in for servicing because the power steering ceased operating after the car went over a normal speed bump. The service manager (note that Tesla, unlike other car manufacturers, owns and operates all of its dealerships, so the workers there are Tesla employees) identifies the culprit: A system component has become corroded—probably, he says, because the car went through a car wash. The repairs will cost $4,400. The driver observes, reasonably, that he has never heard of a car's wiring being damaged by simply taking it through a car wash.</p><blockquote><p>Lundeen [the driver] said he was so shocked by the manager’s frank explanation of Tesla’s part failures&nbsp;that he wrote it down: “All I can tell you,” the Tesla manager said, “is we’re not a 100-year-old company like GM and Ford. We haven’t worked all the bugs out yet.”</p><span><blockquote><cite><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></cite></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Imagine offering this as a defense, as you charge a customer $4,400 to fix your own shoddy product. <em>Look, pal, all I can tell you is that I don't know how to make the thing I sold you at great expense.</em> Contained in this doofus Tesla service manager's quote is the ethos shared among all Elon Musk's ventures. It is the defining ethos of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The engineers who work at GM and Ford (or at Toyota or Honda or Nissan or Mercedes-Benz or any other company whose cars you can drive through a car wash without corroding their power steering components) are not themselves 100 years old; they are not the original discoverers of how to design and manufacture power steering systems. The reason those companies, and not Tesla, know how to build cars that (in general) can drive from here to there without dropping a wheel or bursting into flames is not that they are staffed by a bunch of centenarian Lore Wizards who learned the secrets of auto manufacture back in nineteen-aught-dickity and now hide this sacred knowledge in a walled mountaintop abbey. What those car companies know about building cars is collective industry knowledge. It is best practice. It is, that is to say, Out There. It can be had by any car company that wants it.</p><p>What keeps Tesla from having that knowledge, then, isn't that the company is too young to have acquired it, or that it simply cannot be had except by learning it from scratch. The knowledge can be had in the person of any number of far-less-than-100-years-old engineers Tesla could hire; moreover it can be had by reverse-engineering a frickin' Miata. The reason Tesla hasn't "worked all the bugs out yet" is that the company is run by people who hold established best practice in ideological contempt, and is defined by a tech-industry culture that fetishizes innovation and regards product quality as a third-order concern. There simply isn't as much investment money and credulous tech-media adulation to suck up in the promise of iterating on what already works. You must reinvent, almost literally in this case, the wheel—this time, apparently on the premise of "...and what if it sucked?"</p><p>All the upside-down incentives and warped prerogatives of the startup world are on display here (including a preference for lying and monkeying with data over actually doing good work). They're also, in turn, mere appendages of a deeper and more profound decadence. In 2023, discovery, exploration, and invention are just vibes you rent, by investing in a future-costumed effort to ignore all of what's already been learned and pretend "making a car that works" (or tunnels, or spaceships, or social media) is a new frontier. What matters isn't whether any of this has been done before, and more authentically, and well enough to be built upon—what matters is that <em>this particular rich man-child </em>hasn't done it yet, from scratch, for himself and for his own dream of being The Most Special Boy. In the absence of any real opportunity to envision a brighter future, you sign up to support some inheritance goober's personal fantasy camp by dumping money into his company or buying his stupid-looking car. In this way, you are meant to understand, you have participated in the great grand adventure of discovering tomorrow.</p><p>Then the wheel falls off while you're driving, or the autopilot plows into a jersey wall, and you're meant to be thrilled.* Glad even. Grateful! This is proof: You were an early adopter. A beta tester, a brave explorer. You're helping to work out the bugs, mapping new territory. Who knows? In a hundred years this car's descendants might be as reliable as cars that by then will be 150 years old, and you will have played a part in making it so. Won't that be nice.</p><p><sub>*Assuming you lived through it.</sub></p></div></div>]]></description>
