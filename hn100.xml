<blockquote>
<p>PAYPHONES at High Volume</p>
<p>Existing sites! Earn BIG $$. Money Back Guarantee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dropshipping AliExpress watches, AI-generated SEO spam websites... marginally
legal and ethical passive income schemes, that serve to generate that income
mostly for their promoters, can feel like a modern phenomenon. The promise of
big money for little work is one of the fundamental human weaknesses, though,
and it has been exploited by "business coaches" and "investment promoters" for
about as long as the concept of securities has existed. We used to refer mostly
to the "get rich quick" scheme, but fashions change with the time, and at the
moment "passive income" is the watchword of business YouTubers and Instagram
advertising.</p>
<p>And what income is more passive than vending machine coin revenue? Automated
vending has had a bit of a renaissance, with social media influencers buying
old machines and turning them into a business. The split of their revenue
between vending machine income and social media sponsorship is questionable,
but it's definitely brought some younger eyes to an industry that is as rife
with passive income scams as your average spam folder. Perhaps it's the
enforcement efforts of the SEC, or perhaps today's youth just need a little
more time to advance their art, but I haven't so far seen a vending machine
hustle quite as financialized as the post-divestiture payphone industry.</p>
<p>For much of the history of the telephone system, payphones were owned and
operated by telephone carrier. As with the broader telephone monopoly, there
were technical reasons for this integration. Payphones, more specifically
called coin operated telephones, were "dumb" devices that relied on the
telephone exchange for control. In the case of a manual exchange, you would
pick up a payphone and ask the operator for your party---and they would advise
you of the price and tell you to insert coins. The coin acceptor in the
payphone used a simple electrical signaling scheme to notify the operator of
which and how many coins you had inserted, and it was up to the operator to
check that it was correct and connect the call. If coins needed to be returned
after the call, the operator would signal the phone to do so.</p>
<p>With the introduction of electromechanical and then digital exchanges, coin
control became automated, but payphones continued to use specialized signaling
schemes to communicate with the coin control system. They had to be connected
to special loops, usually called "coin lines," with the equipment to receive
and send these signals. The payphone itself was a direct extension of the
telephone system, under remote control of the exchange, much like later devices
like line concentrators. It was only natural that they would be operated by the
same company that operated the control system they relied on.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of things have changed about the payphone industry. The 1968
Carterfone decision revolutionized the telephone industry by allowing the
customer to connect their own device. Coin operated telephones in the
traditional sense were unaffected, but Carterfone opened the door to a whole
new kind of payphone.</p>
<p>In 1970, burglar alarm manufacturer Robotguard blazed the trail into a new
telephone business. They imported a Japanese payphone that was a little
different from the American models of the time: it implemented coin payment
internally. Robotguard connected the payphone through one of their burglar
alarm autodialers, a device that was already fully compliant with telephone
industry regulations, and then hooked it up to a Southwestern Bell telephone
line in a department store in in St. Louis. By inserting a dime, the phone was
enabled and you could make a local call (the autodialer was used, in part, to
limit dialing to 7 digits to ensure that only local calls were made).</p>
<p>Robotguard had done their homework, consulting the same law firm that
represented Carterfone in the 1968 case. They believed the scheme to be legal,
since the modified Japanese payphone behaved, to the telephone company, just
like any other customer-owned phone. The New York Times quotes Southwestern
Bell, whose attitude is perhaps best described as resignation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spokesmen for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, the operating company
in that area, acknowledge that the equipment is in the store, that it is
working as described and that it appears completely legal. There is nothing
they can do about it at this time, they say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was, indeed, nothing that they could do about it. Robotguard had
introduced the Customer-Owned Coin-Operated Telephone, or COCOT, to the United
States. Payphones were now a competitive business.</p>
<p>Despite a certain air of inevitability, COCOTs had a slow start. First, there
would indeed be an effort by telephone companies to legally restrict COCOTs.
This was never entirely successful, but did result in a set of state
regulations (and to a lesser extent, federal regulations related to
long-distance calls) that made the payphone business harder to get into. More
importantly, though, the technical capabilities of COCOTs were limited. The
Robotguard design could charge only a fixed fee per call, which made it a
practical necessity to limit the payphone to local calls. Telephone company
payphones, which allowed long-distance calls at a higher rate, had an
advantage. Long-distance calls were also typically billed by minute, which made
it important for a payphone to impose a time limit before charging more. These
capabilities were difficult to implement in a reasonably compact, robust device
in the 1970s.</p>
<p>A number of articles will tell you that COCOTs became far more common as a
result of payphone deregulation stemming from the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T. I would
love to hear evidence to the contrary, but from my research I believe this is a
misconception, or at least not the entire story. In fact, payphones were
deregulated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, but that was done in large
part because COCOTs were already common and telephone companies were unhappy
that conventional payphones were subject to rate regulation while COCOTs were
not [1].</p>
<p>Divestiture did definitely open the floodgates of COCOTs, although I think that
the advances in electronics around that time were also a significant factor in
their proliferation. In any case, several manufacturers introduced COCOTs in
1984 and 1985.</p>
<p>These later-generation COCOTs were significantly more sophisticated than the
mechanical system used by Robotguard. To the user, they were pretty much
indistinguishable from carrier-operated payphones, charging varying rates based
on call duration and local or long distance. This local simulation of the
telephone exchange's charging decisions required that each COCOT have, in
internal memory, a prefix and rate table to determine charges. Early examples
used ROM chips shipped by their manufacturer, but over time the industry
shifted to remote programming via modems. These sophisticated,
electronically-controlled coin operated phones that did not rely on an
exchange-provided coin line came to be known as "smart payphones" and even,
occasionally, as "smartphones."</p>
<p>Smart payphones greatly simplified payphone operations and were even adopted by
the established telephone companies, where they could save money compared to
the more complex exchange-controlled system. But they also made COCOTs
completely practical, as good to the consumer as any other payphone. As COCOTs
became remotely programmable, the payphone business started to feel like a way
to generate---dare I say it---passive income. All you had to do was collect the
coins. Well, that and keep the phone in working order, which would become a
struggle for the thinly staffed and overleveraged Payphone Service Providers
(PSPs) that would come to dominate the industry.</p>
<p>One of the new entrants into the payphone business was a company that
specialized in exactly the kind of remote management these new smart payphones
required: Jaroth Inc., which would do business as Pacific Telemanagement
Solutions or PTS. Today, PTS is the largest PSP in the United States, but that
isn't saying a whole lot. They enjoyed great success in the 1990s, though, and
were so well-positioned as a PSP in the '00s that they often purchased the
existing payphone fleet from former Bell Operating Companies that decided to
abandon the payphone business.</p>
<p>The 1990s were a good time for payphones, and they were also a good time for
investment scams. Loose enforcement of regulations around investment offerings,
the Dot Com Boom, and a generally strong economy created a lot of opportunities
for "telecom entrepreneurs" that were more interested in moving money than
information.</p>
<hr>
<p>The problem of 1990s telecommunications companies funded in unscrupulous ways
is not at all unique to payphones, although it did reach a sort of apex there.
I will take this opportunity to go on a tangent, one of those things that I
have always wanted to write an article about but have never quite had enough
material for: MMDS, the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service.</p>
<p>MMDS was, essentially, cable television upconverted to a microwave band and
then put through directional antennas. It was often marketed as "Wireless
Cable," sort of an odd term, but it was intended as a direct competitor to
conventional cable television. I think it's fair to call it an ancestor of what
we now call WISPs, using small roof-mounted parabolic antennas as an
alternative to costly CATV outside plant. Some MMDS installations literally
were early WISPs: MMDS could carry a modified version of DOCSIS.</p>
<p>Wireless cable got a pretty bad rap, though. If you pay attention to WISPs, you
will no doubt have noticed that while the low capital investment required can
enable beneficial competition, it also enables a lot of companies that you
might call "fly by night." Some start out with good intentions and just aren't
up to the task, while some come from "entrepreneurs" with a history of fraud,
but either way they end up collecting money and then disappearing with it.</p>
<p>MMDS had a <em>huge</em> problem with shady operators, and more often of the "history
of fraud" type. Supposed MMDS startups would take out television and newspaper
ads nationwide offering an incredible opportunity to invest in this exciting
new industry. The scam took different forms in the details, but the most common
model was to sell "shares" of a new MMDS company in the four-to-five-digit
range. Investors were told that the company was using the capital to build
out their network and would shortly have hundreds of customers.</p>
<p>In practice, most of these "MMDS startups" were in cities with powerful
incumbent cable companies and, even worse, preexisting MMDS operators using the
limited spectrum available for such a wideband service. They never had any
chance of getting a license, and didn't have anyone with the expertise to
actually build an MMDS system even if they got one. They just pocketed the
money and were next seen on a beach in Mexico or in prison, depending on the
whims of fortune.</p>
<p>These wireless cable schemes became so common, and so notorious, that if you
asked a lot of people what wireless cable was the two answers you'd get are
probably "no idea" and "an old scam."</p>
<hr>
<p>It only takes a brief look at newspaper archives to find that the payphone
industry was a little sketchy. There are constant, nationwide, near-identical
classified ads with text like "buy and retire now" and "$150k yearly potential"
and "CALL NOW!". Sometimes more than one appear back to back, and they're still
nearly identical. None of these ads give a company name or really anything but
a phone number, and the phone numbers repeat so infrequently that I suspect the
advertisers were intentionally rotating them. This was pretty much the
Craigslist "work from home" post of the era.</p>
<p>To understand payphone economics better, let's talk a little about how the
payphone business operated. Telephone companies had long run payphones on the
same payment model, by finding a location for the payphone (or being contacted
by the proprietor of a location) and then offering the location a portion of
revenue. In the case of incumbent telcos, this was often a fixed rate per
call. So someone owned the location and the payphone operator paid them in
the form of a royalty.</p>
<p>COCOTs enabled a somewhat more complex model. A COCOT might be located in a
business, connected to a telephone company line, and remotely programmed by a
service provider, all of which were different companies from the person that
actually collected the money. The revenue had to get split between all of these
parties somehow, but COCOTS weren't regulated and that was all a matter of
negotiation.</p>
<p>Much like the vending machine industry today, one of the most difficult parts
of making money with a payphone was actually finding a good location---one that
wasn't already taken by another operator. As more and more PSPs spread across
the country, this became more and more of a challenge. So you can imagine the
appeal of getting into the payphone hustle without having to do all that
location scouting and negotiation. Thus all the ads for payphone routes for
sale... ostensibly a turnkey business, ready to go.</p>
<p>Ah, but people with turnkey, profitable businesses don't tend to sell them.
Something is up.</p>
<p>Not all of these were outright scams, or at least I assume some of them
weren't. There probably were some PSPs that financed expansion by selling
or leasing rights to some of their devices. But there were also a lot of...
well, let's talk about the second largest PSP of the late '90s.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 1994, Charles Edwards of Atlanta, Georgia had an idea. His
history is obscure, but he seems to have been an experienced salesman, perhaps
in the insurance industry. He put his talent for sales to work raising capital
ETS Payphones, Inc., which would place and operate payphones on the behalf of
investors.</p>
<p>The deal was something like this: ETS identified locations for payphones and
negotiated an agreement to place them. Then, they sold the payphone itself,
along with rights to the location, to an investor for five to seven thousand
dollars a pop. ETS would then operate and maintain the payphone while paying
a fixed monthly lease to the investor who had purchased it---something like
$83 a month.</p>
<p>It was a great deal for the investors---they didn't need any expertise or
really to do any work, since ETS arranged the location, installed the phones,
and even collected the coins. In fact, most investors purchased phones in
cities far from where they lived, such was the convenience of the ETS model.
There was virtually no risk for investors, either. ETS promised a monthly
payment up front, and the contract said that they would refund the investor
if the payphone didn't work out.</p>
<p>The ETS network was far larger than just Edwards could manage. Most of the
investment deals were sold by independent representatives, the majority of them
insurance agents, who could pick it up as a side business to earn some
commission. Edwards sold nearly 50,000 payphones on this basis, many of them in
deals of over $100,000. Small-time investors convinced of the value by their
insurance agents, many of them retirees, put over $300 million into ETS from
1996 to 2000.</p>
<p>There was, as you might have guessed, a catch. One wonders if the payphones
were even real. I think that at least many of them were; ETS ran job listings
for payphone technicians in multiple cities and occasionally responded to press
inquiries and complaints about malfunctioning payphones bearing their logo.
Besides, the telecom industry recognized ETS as a huge PSP in terms of both
installed base and call volume.</p>
<p>What definitely wasn't real was the revenue. ETS was a ponzi scheme. In 2000,
the SEC went for Charles Edwards, showing that ETS had never been profitable.
Edwards sponsored a NASCAR team and directed millions of dollars in salary and
consulting fees to himself, but in the first half of 2000 ETS lost $33 million.
The monthly lease payments to investors were being made from the capital put in
by newer investors, and even that was drying up.</p>
<p>SEC v. ETS went on for six years, in good part due to an appeal to the Supreme
Court based on ETS' theory that a contract that paid a fixed, rather than
variable, monthly rate could not be considered a security. In 2006, Charles
Edwards was convicted of 83 counts of wire fraud and sentenced to thirteen
years in prison.</p>
<p>Edwards was far from the only coin-op fraudster. ETS was not unusual except in
that it managed to be the largest. When a class-action firm and several state
attorneys general went after ETS, their press releases almost always mentioned
a few other similar payphone schemes facing similar legal challenges. Remember
all of those classified ads? I suspect some of them <em>were</em> ETS, but ETS also
had a more sophisticated sales operation than two-line classified ads. Most of
them were probably from competitors.</p>
<p>The payphone industry crashed alongside ETS; ETS almost certainly would have
collapsed (albeit likely more slowly) even if it had been above board.
Increasing cellphone ownership from the '90s to '00s made payphones
increasingly obsolete, and more and more established telcos and PSPs decided to
drop payphones. One of the reasons for PTS's ascent was its willingness to buy
out operators who wanted out: in 2008, PTS bought most of AT&amp;T's fleet. In
2011, they bought most of Verizon's fleet. Almost every incumbent telephone
company got out of the payphone business and most of them sold to PTS.</p>
<p>Given all that, you might think that payphone scams were only a thing of the
'90s. And they mostly were, but you can imagine that there was an opportunity
for anyone who could adapt the ETS model to the internet age.</p>
<p>Pantheon Holdings did just that. It's even more difficult to untangle the early
days of Pantheon than it is ETS. Pantheon operated through a variety of shell
companies and brands, but "the Internet Machine Company" was perhaps the most
to the point. Around 2005, Pantheon built "internet kiosks" where customers
could check their email, print documents, and even make phone calls for a
nominal cash or credit card payment. Sometimes called "global business
centers," these kiosks were presented as an exciting business opportunity to
mostly elderly investors who were given the opportunity to buy one for just
$18,000.</p>
<p>Once again, the kiosks were real, but the revenue was not. Pantheon placed the
machines in low-traffic locations and did nothing to market them. By 2009, more
than a dozen people had been convicted of fraud in relation to Prometheus.</p>
<p>Prometheus kiosks still turn up on the junk market.</p>
<p>[1] I spent quite a bit of time researching the history of payphone regulation
to try to understand exactly what did change in 1984, how many COCOTs operated
and on what legal basis from 1970-1984, etc. I did not have much success. What
I can tell is that COCOTs were very rare prior to 1984 (so rare that the FCC
apparently didn't know of any, according to a 1984 memo, despite the 1970
example), and by the late '80s were very common. The FCC seems to have taken
the view, in 1984, that COCOTs had <em>always</em> been legal, and just weren't being
made or used on any significant scale. That's somewhat inconsistent, though,
with the fact that suddenly after 1984 divestiture a bunch of companies started
making COCOTs for the first time. My best guess right now is that from 1970-1984
COCOTs were probably legal but were something of a gray area because of the lack
of any regulations specifically applying to them. Some combination of divestiture
broadly "shaking up" the phone industry, electronics making COCOTs much more
feasible, and who knows what else lead multiple companies to get into the COCOT
business in the mid-'80s. That lead the FCC to issue a series of regulatory
opinions on COCOTs that consistently upheld them as legal, culminating in the
1996 act dropping payphone regulation entirely.</p>

                 <div><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-intelligence-is-available-today-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/" target="_blank">Apple Intelligence</a> ushers in a new era for the Mac, bringing personal intelligence to the personal computer. Combining powerful generative models with industry-first privacy protections, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to unlock new ways for users to work, communicate, and express themselves on Mac. It is available in U.S. English with macOS Sequoia 15.1. With systemwide Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write. With the newly redesigned Siri, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac and other Apple products. New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months. Image Playground gives users a new way to create fun original images, and Genmoji allows them to create custom emoji in seconds. Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to take actions across the system and draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.

        <div>Apple Intelligence does all this while protecting users’ privacy at every step. At its core is on-device processing, and for more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute gives users access to Apple’s even larger, server-based models and offers groundbreaking protections for personal information. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Robert Bork, a professor of art history at the University of Iowa and a specialist in the study of Gothic architecture, was working in his office when a student knocked on the door. Throughout the room were pictures of Cologne Cathedral, an 1880 church in Germany and one of Dr. Bork’s favorite buildings. The images, seemingly, caught the student’s attention. “Dr. Bork,” he said. “Why does it look so evil?”</p><p>There is nothing inherently scary or sinister about the structure. As an example of Gothic architecture, it bears many iconic elements of the style: pointed arches, flying buttresses, tall spires, rib vaults, window tracery, and stained glass. But it was never meant to invoke fear. So the student’s question was interesting to the professor. “I asked him why he said that,” Dr. Bork tells <em>AD.</em> “And he replied, ‘Well, it looks just like the skyscraper in <em>Ghostbusters.</em>’”</p><figure><p><span><p>Cologne Cathedral in Cologne, Germany</p>
</span><span>Photo: Sparwasser/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>For decades, Gothic architecture has been a go-to style for production designers, writers, and even musicians looking to convey terror through physical spaces. In <em>Dracula</em> (1931) Carfax Abbey is based on Whitby Abbey, a Gothic monastery; Manderly from Alfred Hitchcock’s R<em>ebecca</em> (1939) pulls inspiration from Gothic houses; and more modern films and shows like <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/crimson-peak-set-design-exclusive-video"><em>Crimson Peak</em></a> (2015) and <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/wednesday-on-netflix-inside-the-castle-used-for-nevermore-academy"><em>Wednesday</em></a> (2022) keep the trope alive.</p><p>“The idea of Gothic buildings being scary or haunted is fairly recent,” says Michael Crosbie, an architect and professor of the course Architecture in Film at Hartford University. “In the early to mid 20th century, there were a lot of Gothic buildings in movies that showed them as haunted places.”</p><p>One could argue that repetition has perhaps conditioned viewers to think of the style as scary, so creators continue using it, prompting something of a never-ending loop. But their original introduction into horror media was always a deliberate choice. “It’s not random,” Dr. Bork says. “There are good reasons.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Notre-Dame in Paris is among the most famous Gothic buildings.</p>
</span><span>Photo: Pete Douglass/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>Gothic architecture first emerged in the 12th century and was most closely related with church architecture, though other uses did exist. In religious settings, it was meant to suggest the superhuman. “Buildings were supposed to make you feel like you were in the presence of a bigger, more mysterious God,” Dr. Bork says. Architects did this by circumventing many of the “rules” previously established in Romanesque architecture, which had been widespread in the decades before and has roots in <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/greek-architecture-101" target="_blank">Greek</a> and <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/roman-architecture-101" target="_blank">Roman</a> classicism.</p><figure><p><span><p>Built in 1790, the exterior of the Pantheon in Paris showcases a neoclassical style, with direct references to Greek and Roman design.</p>

In fact, each order of Greek design—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—was based on the human body, and therefore felt safe, approachable, and familiar. As Gothic architecture emerged, many <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/neoclassical-architecture-explained" target="_blank">classical traditions</a> receded. “In the Middle Ages, [architects] left behind the human metaphor and moved to the superhuman,” Dr. Bork adds.</p><p>Suddenly, columns became arbitrarily tall and stretched, ornamentation grew bolder, and interiors felt more cavernous thanks to new construction techniques that allowed higher ceilings and required less interior columns. Architects pushed the envelope and were willing to experiment outside of what was previously deemed correct or right. The general vertical presence through elongated columns and high ceilings was meant to evoke a heavenly reach.</p><figure><p><span><p>Inside Notre Dame Basilica of Montreal. Gothic interiors were designed to symbolize a higher power.</p>
</span><span>Photo: Felipe Mulè/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>Though perhaps intimidating in their grandeur, they weren’t intended to inspire fear. “It was supposed to be positive, transcendent, and godly, not scary,” Dr. Bork explains. However, the designs assumed a less favorable association in the early 16th century during the Renaissance, when there was once again a desire for the rules, order, and “perfection” of classical antiquity. “It was perceived as lawless, chaotic, and disorderly because it didn’t follow the rules of classicism,” Dr. Bork explains. “It got stuck with that association.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Throughout the next two centuries, the style largely lost favor, until Horace Walpole, a writer, decided he wanted his own “little Gothic castle.” In 1749, he built his estate in London, called Strawberry Hill, modeled off of Gothic cathedrals and medieval castles. Defined by arched windows, stained glass, turrets, and battlements, the residence is largely considered the first Gothic Revival building and contributed to the widespread re-interest in the historic aesthetic.</p><figure><p><span><p>Strawberry Hill House in west London</p>
</span><span>Photo: Sam Mellish/Getty Images</span></p></figure><p>The 18th century then saw a boom in neo-Gothic buildings, many of which were residences. Today, they are recognizable for their use of pointed arches (seen on doors, windows, and gables), high-pitched roofs, and vergeboard (wooden trim attached to gables).</p><p>Perhaps coincidentally, philosopher Edmund Burke published <em>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</em> around this same time, in 1757, which became an extremely an influential text that detailed what he called sublime art. “Whatever is in any sort terrible or is conversant about terrible objects or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime,” he wrote. Burke separated the beautiful from the sublime, and aesthetic theories generally classify the sublime as work that showcases greatness beyond measurement, comprehension, or experience; its magnitude is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><p>The interiors of Strawberry Hill</p>

His novel, <em>Castle of Otranto,</em> was reportedly inspired by a dream he had while living at Strawberry Hill. Set in a castle in the Middle Ages, the epic details a lord and his family living in a haunted mansion. “In the late 18th and 19th century, Gothic became associated with spookiness, which got wound into ideas of the exotic and sublime,” Dr. Bork says. “By the 20th century, you have movies and mass media that start using this.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Today, filmmakers—and, more broadly, storytellers—use these ingrained historical associations to great effect. “When I teach my course, I approach architecture as a character in a film,” Crosbie says. “The character has a role, which is to get across and reinforce themes.” If the idea is to express something otherworldly or beyond comprehension—say, a ghost—what better style to use than Gothic? Of course, not every viewer will know its history, but, subconsciously, these messages may still come across.</p><p>Jennifer Spence, a production designer who has worked on movies such as <em>The Nun</em> (2018), <em>Splinter</em> (2008), and those in the <em>Insidious</em> (2013, 2015), <em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2010, 2011, 2012), and <em>Annabelle</em> (2017, 2019) franchises, notes that the style’s age is also compelling. “If you’re writing a story with a ghost, there has to be an origin,” she says. “An older home offers decades of opportunities for backstories to happen, maybe they got murdered or something else happened to them in the home.”</p><figure><p><span><p>An illustration of a neo-Gothic residence leans into horror motifs including bats, dead plants, and a seemingly abandoned home.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://candost.blog/on-good-software-engineers/">https://candost.blog/on-good-software-engineers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41968892">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <p>Setting expectations for software engineers is tricky for all managers. Every company has different needs and a different structure, tech stack, and culture. Whenever someone joins a team, one of the manager’s challenges is aligning the organization’s expectations with those of the new joiner. As there’s no universal guidance on this subject, I set out to find a simple definition that would help managers frame the fundamental things they expect from software engineers.</p>
<p>I first found definitions of 10x engineers, superstars, or rockstar developers, which aren’t definitions of good engineers in any way. Someone may produce a lot of work but it’s often at the cost of team spirit and results in low-quality code. Ultimately, the team is demoralized and the organization bears the cost of substandard code.</p>
<p>I also looked at different career progression frameworks or career matrices (which aim to give engineers perspective on how to map their professional development to roles) to see how tech- or product-driven organizations define good engineers. I found that all were incomplete (I wrote about the good, the bad and the ugly of these frameworks <a href="https://candost.blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-career-ladders-and-frameworks/">here</a>. In general, career frameworks are helpful in defining roles, but they don’t define a good engineer. After sharing my thoughts and findings with peers, well-respected engineers and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7243636598557347840/">on LinkedIn</a>, I arrived at one definition of a good software engineer.</p>
<p><em>A good engineer is one whom I, as a manager or peer, can trust to progress a project, knowing that they will deliver a solution by working with the team and producing good quality, again and again.</em></p>
<p>This definition applies to software engineers at all levels (from junior to staff+). We can’t expect a junior engineer to drive a big project; their scope will be limited. Yet, we can expect them to deliver small, unambiguous tasks with high quality again and again. We can expect good senior+ engineers to drive and deliver a feature or project. When it comes to staff+ engineers, this expectation will span over big and long-term projects with many unknowns.</p>
<p>It’s a super simple definition but has a lot of subtleties around how a good engineer, at any level, will approach and deliver a project by using many hard and soft skills. Let’s delve into them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers know how to influence others and the organization to deliver a solution as a team.</strong> At any seniority level, a good engineer must know how to communicate well both in written and spoken form. An engineer’s work always depends on collaboration (code reviews, pair programming, <a href="https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/">RFCs</a>, <a href="https://candost.blog/adrs-rfcs-differences-when-which/">ADRs</a>, feedback, etc.). Good collaboration demands clear communication, <a href="https://candost.blog/importance-of-the-feedback/">giving and receiving feedback</a> giving and receiving feedback, and <a href="https://candost.blog/the-must-have-skill-for-every-leader-listening-with-empathy/">listening with empathy</a>. However, these soft skills are not enough.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers understand the processes they are operating in while taking a project from an idea to a solution.</strong> There are different approaches when it comes to doing code reviews or writing <a href="https://candost.blog/adrs-rfcs-differences-when-which/">RFCs or ADRs</a>. Each organization uses different methodologies like Kanban, Scrum, or Scrumban. Some organizations use Tech Radar to help teams make technology choices. Good engineers know the processes and guidelines so thoroughly that they know where they can bend the rules. They don’t stop there; they take their time to understand the organization as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers spend extra time learning the environment they’re in, going beyond the processes so they can independently drive the work.</strong> They learn how the organization works, about its culture, norms, and people. As they need to adapt to the organizational requirements to deliver a job of good quality, they have to develop not only hard skills but people and organizational skills. If the organization is hierarchical, they’ll have a difficult time driving a solution <a href="https://candost.blog/how-to-handle-and-overcome-objections-to-your-proposal-at-work/">when they face rejection from a more senior person</a>. If the organization works with short-lived task forces instead of long-living teams, their work style will be focused on speed and getting things done quickly. In any situation, they’ll need to find how to implement quality sustainably.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers take a proactive approach and embed quality elements into their deliverables to increase consistency and velocity.</strong> There is no need to ask for extra permission to write tests when you do test-driven development; no discussion will be needed if you consider refactoring as part of the new feature implementation. A good engineer chooses their approach wisely. If they inherit a legacy codebase, they look for ways to make it better, step by step. If they work with giving estimations, they include all these to keep a good level of quality. But above all, a good engineer needs to understand what quality means in their current circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers understand the stakeholders’ needs and fine-tune their approach so they don’t unnecessarily delay the delivery.</strong> They might need to do a proof of concept first or a full solution design upfront. Even when working in the same place, the organization evolves and changes; good engineers <a href="https://candost.blog/learnings-on-dealing-with-ambiguity/">adapt to these changes</a> and adjust the project’s codebase accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers constantly work on reducing complexity in the codebase to consistently provide high quality.</strong> They seek a modular design, separate concerns at every level while keeping the right amount of cohesion, and have a good testing setup and strategy. These are quality levers, and they know how to adjust them according to the organization, the situation, and the people around them. Keeping the same implementation and delivery strategies rarely works; good engineers constantly adapt and have a learning mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers are reliable in constantly changing organizations.</strong> They seek to learn at every chance, even if it puts them in uncomfortable situations, such as publicly admitting mistakes, holding themselves accountable, and looking for ways to prevent the same mistakes from happening again. If a good engineer doesn’t know how to tackle a problem, they don’t avoid tackling it. They have a growth mindset and eagerness to learn. But they don’t stop there.</p>
<p><strong>Good engineers are team players regardless of personality type.</strong> They recognize a problem and offer a solution. They don’t throw the problem over the fence and ask others to fix it.</p>
<p>I’ve covered good engineers in detail. But what makes a great engineer? <strong>Great engineers do all of the above but <em>proactively</em>.</strong> If they see a broken process, <a href="https://candost.blog/strong-ownership-culture-in-a-team/">they don’t walk past the problem</a> or wait for someone else’s permission. <a href="https://candost.blog/bias-towards-action/">They take action to fix it</a>. If they can’t change the process themselves, they don’t complain without bringing solutions to the people who can change it.</p>
<p>These expectations will not be easy for inexperienced engineers, but their scope will be limited at first. They will gain experience in time. If they keep learning, stay reliable, and improve quality day-to-day, it’s safe to call them good engineers.</p>
<p>I already hear some of you saying, “Well, Candost, you expect a lot of things from a good engineer.” No, I don’t. I strongly believe all that I’ve mentioned is a basic expectation from any engineer. More generally, these expectations apply to, in fact, any good employee.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

It's basically a curated stream of cool videos, and I would feel totally safe letting my daughter browse it alone (she never does because we usually watch them together, but the curation is that good). Videos on all sorts of topics, and good enough to be really entertaining for both kids and adults - I can spend an evening there easily. They also have a really fantastic gift guide.</p>

                  <p>This is a great idea! Recommendation algos are weaponized against kids and would be great to have some way of managing it.
There is a similar problem with movies as well. It is hard to know whether a movie is appropriate for a child e.g. some kind of violence may be acceptable but not adult themes. So marking a movie PG-13 for example doesn't help much. There are some crowd-sourced solutions to this right now such as <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews" rel="nofollow">https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews</a> But LLMs could really help automate this</p>

And we're not talking promotion of a few posts, YC is now doing multiple batches a year and has hundreds of companies per batch meaning we're seeing a LOT of promotion / advertisements on this site coming via Launch HN threads as well as jobs ad threads.</p><p>I don't think Xerox park would have done as well if 5% of the people get got the opportunity for a microphone in the auditorium every week and the other 95% did not. That would seem like a caste system. I understand that YC funds this website so the caste system is inevitable but I don't see why moderation should further stratify it - unless you're prioritizing advertising YC companies over a great community.</p><p>Next, I see this "HN is not for self promotion" do a lot of downstream damage on the community in the sense that it's much better for big, existing trillion dollar companies than smaller players. If a small bootstrapped startup writes a blog post and mentions there product, people will complain about "blogspam" and "this blog post is really just an ad for a link at the end". But if Google or Amazon have a new announcement for a new product, nobody complains that it's an advertisement, even though it's often as much or more one. The end result is that the website tends to focus more "corporate" news than "hacker" news as a downstream consequence of a well-meaning "no self-promotion" rule.</p><p>Finally, as we've discussed over email, the rules around self-promotion are extremely opaque and in many cases algorithmically enforced by closed algorithms. This leads to a lot of confusion around what's allowed and a lot of ambiguous favoritism.</p><p>I understand this site is called "Hacker" news and there's some mystique around the "hacker" building "just for fun" , the purism around intellectual curiosity that you don't want tainted by dirty commercialism. I just think that once the website has decided it's going to be the media arm of one of the most powerful venture capital firms in the world, the ship has sailed.If people really want pure tech news, they should go to <a href="https://lobste.rs/" rel="nofollow">https://lobste.rs/</a> . I've personally found in recent years quality of interesting conversation is much higher on /r/saas, Indie Hackers board, and Small Bets campfire, as well as various Discords, all because they allow self-promotion and don't encourage the "self-promotion police" who frequently show up aghast someone would try to make money on the internet (unless it's their daddy FAANG employer).</p><p>Another rule I've seen in various places be very effective is a simple guideline to contribute 10x as much non-promotional content as promotional content. If someone only posts links to their projects and nothing else, I see how that gets spammy. But if someone regularly contributes they should get a pass. I understand that's partially how the submission system works via algorithmic enforcement, but , see above about its opaque and ambiguous nature.</p><p>Show HN is a "place" for self-promotion but it's a pretty bad place if 99% of submissions get entirely lost and ignored and I think you should encourage more places for promotion without inflicting a caste system where only YC companies and certain golden children get special rules.</p><p>Overall, HN's guidelines against self-promotion are too rigid, there's too few opportunties for small players to promote, which makes the discussion here less egalitarian, more corporate, and less interesting. You'd be better served encouraging more self-promotion in threads like these.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Nice idea, but right now the villagers mostly say some variation on "I eagerly await the valiant hero's return!".

                  <p>Building Split Flap Displays. Started 18 months ago and kept me on a super interesting learning path. First shot was using open source designs (<a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap">https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap</a>), but then kept building more and more parts myself. Coming from a software engineering background, getting into designing mechanical things – and then more importantly the electronics around it - has been really challenging, but also very rewarding. At this point I have my own screen printed flaps, custom PCB Design and a, what I consider, really smart protocol that allows me to daisy chain a basically arbitrary number of display elements.

Uses PID control to maintain any course I set on the chartplotter, using the cross-track error and heading. I’ve had it out on the water a few times now and it works great.

- Built and trained a compact TensorflowJS model (~3MB) that runs entirely in-browser
- Model lazy loads only when users are submitting reviews
- Classifies uploaded photos into Menu, Food &amp; Drink, or Vibes (interior/exterior)
- Zero server costs for inference, quick enough classification feedback</p><p>This approached solved several problems:
1. Reduced server costs by moving inference to the client

You can currently link to other recipes. So if you make a sauce, that can be a recipe on its own, and it can be linked from another recipe.

Raga is a term for a particular scale of notes (both ascending and descending).</p><p>Until now, this has mostly been in the domain of research and there is a ton of published literature out there. At the very basic level, if you have just voice, it is trivial to apply a pitch detection algorithm like YIN to get a pitch estimate and then analyse the sequence to figure out the raga. This doesn't work as well in a concert setup where speeds are higher due to gamakas, different instruments are used alongside and counterpoint melodies may make the music polyphonic. A lot of papers apply a variety of ML models (neural nets and otherwise) using several different features (cepstrum and mel-cepstrum, pitch distributions etc) with varying results.</p><p>So this is an interesting exercise in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. If anyone else is working on or has worked on this, I'd love to hear from you.</p><p>[1] -  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga" rel="nofollow">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga</a>)</p></div></td></tr>

I hope I'm wrong though, I still want this to succeed, for once in my life, I want to actually succeed on at least one thing. I want to contribute some good thing to the society.</p><p>First, what is it? It's a bookmarking app alternative to Pocket or Raindrop.io. Yeah, you can already tell it's not the most original idea. What makes it different, though, it's supposed to be self-hostable and additionally it's easy to deploy as it's only single binary file with no other runtime dependency--the database uses SQLite, which you can include it as a library in Rust.</p><p>What problems I'm facing while developing this? Honestly? I don't know, but I can't finish the last 10% progress of the app. It's funny--I first wrote it in Go, and it almost reached MVP. But, instead, I decided to just rewrite in Rust. Well, at least I got to learn new language while building this app, two birds one stone, or in Bahasa Indonesia, swimming while drinking water.</p><p>But now, I just can't force myself to continue. And I don't know why. Maybe perfectionism? It definitely doesn't have to do with skill though.</p><p>There are also another thing I'm working on: recovering from depression. One year ago, out of nowhere, I lost all my motivation doing anything--including university. I lost all my friends. Since then, I'm at the lowest point of my life. I visited psychiatrist multiple times. I don't know if it was effective, but recently I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>The Tagbox Project is also one of the efforts for me to recover from depression. The depression phase made me realize that I _want my works to have a positive effect on the world, even for just a little bit_. I don't want my skill to be used for evil companies that throws away moral and ethics. Specifically AI stuff, but that's OOT of this thread.</p><p>Here are the links if you're interested,</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/muhrizqiardi/tagbox_rs/" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/muhrizqiardi/tagbox_rs/</a></p><p>This link is only the Rust rewrite version.

                  <p>Even without the other problems, I can assure you that the vast majority of managers will think that a 80% done project is almost done. The truth is the remaining 20% is where you have to fit everything together so you revisit an rewrite most of the project. It's a different kind of work that feels boring because you already did those things maybe 3,4 times already. It helps to understand the phase of the project you are in, to reduce the frustration. It also helps to do something even very small, every day and focus on that. One day you will run out of things to do.</p>

I would try to perhaps solve the mental health problem first perhaps before tackling big projects. Maybe try gym, hiking, somehow finding friends, talk to more people, solve your sleep, eat better - something.

You can export the colors for use with Tailwind, CSS, Figma, and Adobe.</p><p>I started working on this because for design projects I was almost always getting handed brand style guides that were missing thought into accessible colors pairs and lacked tints/shades, where I had to fill in the gaps. There's lots of color tools out there, but this supports multiple swatches, checking the contrast of multiple color pairs at the same time and the HSLuv based color picker makes it easier to explore accessible colors.</p><p>It's really only usable on desktop right now but I'd love any feedback good or bad on if it's useful and what to work on next! There's actually a lot of directions to go in, and it's tricky to balance more features with keeping it simple. 
Some tips:</p><p>- The "Load examples" menu in the top-left lets you compare the colors from Tailwind, IBM Carbon and United States Web Design System.</p><p>- The "contrast" menu lets you see how WCAG 2 contrast checks compare against APCA when "vs black/white" is turned on. WCAG 2 has known inaccuracies, especially for dark mode. APCA is the candidate contrast method for WCAG 3 that's meant to improve on this.</p><p>- Use the "..." menu to create a swatch based on a brand color.</p><p>- Use the "..." menu to "flip to dark/light palette" to create a dark theme. Or just manually flip the lightness curves horizontally.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I created a Weird Clock that shows the local sunrise and sunset within a conventional 12-hour clock face.  This normally would only work on a 24-hour clock face, which is kind of unfamiliar to most people, so I developed a way to show a 24-hour day within a 12-hour clock face; essentially it shows a 2-turn spiral so both night and day will fit.  This needs to know your location in order to compute your local sunrise and sunset, so don't freak out when the browser asks for location permission!  Includes option to enter lat/long and other goodies. Works on phones but better on a large screen. https:\\www.coolweird.net</p>

I'm between a few projects at the moment though but the biggest one is an image processing application I've been working on for quite some time. A lot of stuff I've programmed and learned about over the last 3 years has been leading up to the goal of making something like this haha. I wanted to leverage OpenCL for compute but I had a lot of trouble getting OpenGL OpenCL interoperability to work.</p><p>A big motivation for such a project is my passion for photography. I've taken many thousands of photos over just the last 2 years alone. A lot of them are digital, and so far a few dozen rolls of film. A big challenge for me is that I'm not satisfied with the tools available to develop the raw files that are free or open source. Either they're quite finnicky, or they have noticeable issues with color transformations.</p><p>I've done a lot of rendering projects over the last few years relating to color that have been focused on getting a better understanding of working with color spaces. Lots of 2D and 3D fractals haha.</p><p>Unfortunately I've had quite a turbulent life the last few years so development is very off/on. Every autumn for me seems to be a period of change, this one no different as I'm moving and I'm a bit uncertain of things. However, a side project to all of this has been an OpenGL project where I'm working on things related to voxels! I did a lot of research on data structures like interval trees, octrees, segment trees, etc. It does seem that a lot of people jump for the octree approach, however I've been able to render a lot of voxels with just a hashmap of chunks and a 3d array haha (albeit, mostly initial implementation of chunk generation, single threaded at that!). With this I'm hoping to explore OpenGL compute as I intend of generating world geometry in compute shaders :D</p><p>I havent published a project in a while and I'm hoping to get back to putting things out there, so hopefully some of the stuff I've been working on goes well and I can put it up on GitHub or something</p></div></td></tr>

Years of Buddhist meditation only got me so far. But two months of this new technique, and I finally see a path to being able to program my emotional self like I program a computer. Here's how it works.</p><p>Step one. Identify the negative belief you want to change. This is the core belief. It is something you feel is true. For example, “I am a bad manager.”</p><p>Step two. Create a statement related to the belief that you believe is not true. This is the false statement. For example, “No employees Ive managed have thought I did anything right as a manager.”</p><p>Step three. This is the training step. You spend a few minutes following your breathe to quiet your mind. Then you think the false statement and watch the emotional reaction the mind has to it. The reaction is an aversion, a kind of disgust. Then, say the false statement and the core belief together. “No employees I’ve managed have thought I did anything right as a manager. I’m a bad manager.” Repay the false statement and core belief together again and again, watching how the mind rejects the false statement and that aversion feeling lingers as the core belief is thought.</p><p>Step four. Repeat the training step in  daily sessions. During the session, repeated think the false belief and core belief. The session should last at least ten minutes. The daily sessions should be repeated for at least a week, and longer for more deeply held core beliefs. Over time, you come to reject the core belief just like you reject the false statement.</p><p>Here's why I think it works. There is a rational part of the mind in the prefrontal cortex. It is what we think with. But it is not where our beliefs are. We can rationalize our way to a new belief or to change a belief. Instead, beliefs are felt. And they’re felt in the limbic emotional part of the brain. The limbic system is mute and cannot think with words. The prefrontal cortex can’t directly talk to the limbic system with words. Instead, the prefrontal cortex must communicate with emotion. You have to train the limbic system to feel differently about a belief. You can’t use positive affirmations because they are not felt as strongly as aversion.</p></div></td></tr>

I know on paper the circuit ratings are nearly 2x, but in practice it sounds like it's closer to 1.5x for the average kettle comparison.</p><p>80% efficiency for the heating coil, 1.6L of water, you need about ~750kJ (200Wh) get to a boil from 10C tap water.</p><p>So you'll need at least 70Wh output from your battery, and it needs to provide 1kW continuously.  Accounting for conversion losses and some buffer to avoid deep discharge I'll target 80Wh.  At 1kW that's a continuous 13C discharge rate, which is pretty high.  Hobby-oriented LiPo packs will do it, but I'm not sure how they would hold up for consumer product safety and longevity.  LiFePO cells could be a good choice since density is _less_ of a concern, and are readily available with 20+C continuous discharge.</p><p>I don't know my power electronics very well, so I'm not sure the best way to merge the outputs.  Any conversions are going to eat into total power and thus boil time, just rectifying the AC will take 20%.  Maybe it makes the most sense to have two separate coils, one direct from AC and a second from the battery?  With smaller cells in series, say 10+, to get a decent voltage it could end up with a manageable current to use directly with the 1kW boost.  In that case the only expensive power electronics needed would be to charge the batteries.</p><p>Also have to figure out how much recharge time matters to people, since by default it would be an hour or so.</p><p>It's going to have a chunky, heavy base, and guessing it will have to be pretty expensive for what it does, but I like it.</p></div></td></tr>

Who's going to pay hundreds of dollars for a battery-powered kettle just so they can save 1-2 minutes of time (and less if you're just making enough boiling water for 1 cup).  I use a little 100V (900W I think, according to the label) kettle to make tea, either 1 or 2 cups at a time, and while it's certainly not as speedy as those EU/UK market kettles, and a bit slower than a US kettle, it's fast enough.</p><p>A battery-powered one might save me 1 minute of time at best, but will cost probably at least 5-10x as much for the kettle, it'll be MUCH larger than my current kettle (that battery pack and power electronics needs space) which is a problem with my tiny kitchen, and I have to worry about how long the battery will last and how to dispose of it later and if I can even replace it.</p><p>This is really a solution in search of a problem.</p></div></td></tr>

Broadly speaking, it's an event based programming model, where "events" are things like "gaining a new belief", "dropping a belief", "selecting a plan to execute" (aka an "intention"), etc. AgentSpeak programs (normally) run "forever" cycling through a "reasoning cycle" that involves perceiving the world, updating beliefs, choosing intentions, executing intentions, communicating with other agents, etc.</p><p>And to commit a little self-plagiarism, from a recent post on LinkedIn:</p><p>----</p><p>On the one hand, AgentSpeak is basically a logic programming language with a lot of #prolog in its heritage. On the other hand, the runtime is all Java and to do anything interesting you have to write your custom Environment class and other helper functions in #Java. And while the interop is seamless in a way, getting your head around the execution model and knowing what's really happening at runtime can be a bit tricky.</p><p>Still, it's starting to make sense. And I do think this #BDI inspired approach has a lot going for it. I'm just looking forward to getting to the point where I can really start to exercise this. I have a few things that I want to accomplish soon:</p><p>1. I want to create a BDI agent that I can connect to an #XMPP server so I can talk with it from anywhere.</p><p>2. I want to start working on customized perception, using neural networks and various sensors (web-cam, microphone, accelerometer, distance sensor, etc.) to create an embodied agent that can truly sense its environment.</p><p>3. I want to take a stab at integrating some symbolic reasoning. I've given thought to trying to adapt the "belief base" to be an #RDF triplestore (probably #Apache #Jena) and include a reasoning engine or two. This all starts to get really speculative from here, but I spent a lot of time working on abductive inference a couple of years ago, and I'd like this thing to be able to use abductive inference, along with deductive reasoning, rule induction, possibly case based reasoning, etc. all in one system.</p><p>4. Might experiment with implementing a #Blackboard architecture and have specialized "problem solving" agents that collaborate by using the Blackboard in some situations. What would be really interesting here would be to figure out how to seamlessly translate in and out of a structured representation that lets you use existing specialized code for things like, eg. R for statistical operations.</p><p>5. And of course, experimenting with continual learning, as opposed to the "batch training job" stuff that we all use for ANN's today. This gets <i>really</i> speculative as well, but I want to explore contrastive learning, Hebbian learning, associative learning, operant conditioning (ala Pavlov), etc.</p><p>[5] above is why you'll see me spending as much time lately with Developmental Psychology, Infant Development, and Cognitive Psychology books, as with "AI" books per-se. I still believe that getting an AI that can learn from its environment, and build up useful mental representations with the minimal set of hard-coded behaviors, will be the best way to make progress with regards to #AGI.</p><p>----</p><p>I didn't mention it in the LinkedIn post, but as part of all  of this, I've been building a hardware platform for some time now as well, where said platform is meant to support "perceiving the environment" so the system can learn from the physical world. It's not finished yet, but today it includes a GPS receiver so it can "know" it's location in physical space, a 6-DOF accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope board so it can sense movement (of itself), and two microphones (for stereo audio input). Future plans include one or two webcams to emulate vision, and possibly some other sensors: IR and/or ultrasonic distance sensors, temperature sensor, humidity and barometric pressure sensors, etc.</p><p>Also in the "speculative / for the future" category: AgentSpeak programs don't have any inherent notion of learning built into the model. All "plans" (aka "desires" or "candidate intentions") have to be coded by the developer up-front. This is obviously pretty limiting if you're trying to create truly autonomous agents, so another area I want to dig into is how we might combine work on "AI Planning"[5] to dynamically create new plans.</p><p>And since this has kind of turned into a big brain-dump of stuff that's on my mind, I'll finish by saying that I've been chewing on some ideas about explicitly modeling other "mental states" that aren't part of the base BDI model. Things like "attitudes", "values", different emotional states (eg "boredom", "frustration", etc.), "curiosity", "confusion" / "cognitive dissonance", and so on.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://jason-lang.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://jason-lang.github.io/</a></p><p>[3]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93...</a></p><p>[4]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_model" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93...</a></p><p>[5]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_schedul...</a></p></div></td></tr>

    </header>
    <p><em>This post is an edited and expanded version of a now-mangled <a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/113346554300095442">Mastodon thread</a>.</em></p>

<p>Some in the JavaScript community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_9JYPLU-8s&amp;t=404s">imagine that I harbour an irrational dislike of their tools</a> when, in fact, I want nothing more than to stop thinking about them. Live-and-let-live is excellent guidance, and if it weren't for React <em>et. al.</em>'s predictably ruinous outcomes, the public side of my work wouldn't involve educating about <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the problems JS-first development has caused.</a></p>
<p>But that's not what strategy demands, and strategy is my job.<sup><a href="#fn-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1" id="fnref-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I've been holding my fire (and the confidences of consulting counterparties) for most of the last decade. Until <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/reckoning/">this year,</a> I only occasionally posted traces documenting the worsening rot. I fear this has only served to make things look <em>better</em> than they are.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, my work helping teams deliver competitive PWAs gave me a front-row seat to a disturbing trend. The rate of failure to deliver usable experiences on phones was <em>increasing</em> over time, despite the eye-watering cost of JS-based stacks teams were reaching for. Worse <em>and</em> costlier is a bad combo, and the opposite of what competing ecosystems did.</p>
<p>Native developers reset <em>hard</em> when moving from desktop to mobile, getting deeply in touch with the new constraints. Sure, developing a codebase multiple times is more expensive than the web's write-once-test-everywhere approach, but at least you got speed for the extra cost. But that's not what happened on the web. Contemporary frontend practice pretended that legacy-oriented, desktop-focused tools would perform fine in this new context, without ever checking if they <em>did</em>. When that didn't work, the toxic-positivity crowd blamed the messanger.<sup><a href="#fn-failure-on-repeat-2" id="fnref-failure-on-repeat-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Frontend's <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/">tragically timed turn towards JavaScript</a> means the damage isn't limited to <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/">the public sector</a> or "bad" developers. Some of the strongest engineers I know find themselves mired in the same quicksand. Today's popular JS-based approaches are simply unsafe at any speed. The rot is now ecosystem-wide, and JS-first culture owns a share of the responsibility.</p>
<p>But why do I care?</p>
<h2 id="platforms-are-competitions">Platforms Are Competitions <a href="#platforms-are-competitions">#</a></h2>
<p>My primary motivation is that I want the web to win.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Concretely, folks should be able to accomplish most of their daily tasks on the web. But capability isn't sufficient; for the web to win in practice, users need to turn to the browser for those tasks because it's easier, faster, and more secure.</p>
<p>A reasonable diagnostic metric of success is <em>time spent as a percentage of time on device</em>. The fraction of <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">"Jobs To Be Done"</a> happening on the web would be the natural leading metric, but it's hard to track.</p>
<p>This phrasing — fraction of time spent, rather than absolute time — has the benefit of not being thirsty. It's also tracked by various parties.</p>
<p>OK, but why should anyone prefer one platform over another?</p>
<p>As I see it, the web is the only generational software platform that has a reasonable shot at delivering a potent set of benefits to users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh</li>
<li>Frictionless</li>
<li>Safe by default</li>
<li>Portable and interoperable</li>
<li>Gatekeeper-free (no prior restraint on publication)<sup><a href="#fn-our-awol-tech-press-3" id="fnref-our-awol-tech-press-3">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Standards-based, and therefore...</li>
<li>User-mediated (extensions, browser settings, etc.)</li>
<li>Open Source compatible</li>
</ul>
<p>No other successful platform provides all of these today and others that could are too small to matter.</p>
<p>Platforms like Android and Flutter deliver subsets of these properties but capitulate to capture by the host OS agenda, allowing their developers to be taxed through app stores and proprietary API lock-in. Most treat user mediation like a bug to be fixed.</p>
<p>The web's inherent properties have created an ecosystem that is unique in the history of software, both in scope and resilience.</p>
<h2 id="...and-we're-losing">...and We're Losing <a href="#...and-we're-losing">#</a></h2>
<p>So why does this result in intermittent antagonism towards today's JS community?</p>
<p>Because the web is losing, and instead of recognising that we're all in it together, then pitching in to right the ship, the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">Lemon Vendors</a> have decided that predatory delay and <em>"I've got mine, Jack"</em>-ism is the best response.</p>
<p>What do I mean by "losing"?</p>
<p>Going back to the time spent metric, the web is cleaning up on the desktop. The web's JTBD percentage and fraction of time spent both continue to rise as we add new capabilities to the platform, displacing other ways of writing and delivering software, one fraction of a percent every year.<sup><a href="#fn-no-kos-4" id="fnref-no-kos-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>But make no mistake; the web is the indispensable ecosystem for desktop users. Who, a decade ago, thought the web would be such a threat to Adobe's native app business that it would need to respond with a <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/adobe-to-acquire-figma">$20BN acquisition attempt</a> and a full-fledged version of <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web">Photoshop (<em>real</em> Photoshop) on the web?</a></p>
<p>Model advantages grind slowly but finely. They create space for new competitors to introduce the intrinsic advantages of their platform in previously stable categories. But only when specific criteria are met.</p>
<h2 id="win-condition">Win Condition <a href="#win-condition">#</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, challengers need <strong>a cost-competitive channel</strong>. That is, users have to be able to acquire software that runs on this new platform without a lot of extra work. The web drops channel costs to nearly zero, assuming...</p>
<p><strong>80/20 capability</strong>. Essential use-cases in the domain have to be (reliably) possible for the vast majority (90+%) of the TAM. Some nice-to-haves might not be there, but the model advantage makes up for it. Lastly...</p>
<p><strong>It has to feel good</strong>. Performance can't suck for core tasks.<sup><a href="#fn-status-tracking-5" id="fnref-status-tracking-5">[5]</a></sup> It's fine for UI consistency with native apps to wander a bit.<sup><a href="#fn-ui-coherence-6" id="fnref-ui-coherence-6">[6]</a></sup> It's even fine for there to be a large peak performance delta. But the gap can't be such a gulf that it generally changes the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/planning-and-measuring-performance#time">interaction class</a> of common tasks.</p>
<p>So if the web is meeting all these requirements on desktop – even running away with the lead – why am I saying "the web is losing"?</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265878/global-shipments-of-pcs-tablets-ultra-mobiles-mobile-phones/">more than 75% of new devices that can run full browsers are phones</a>. And the web is getting <em>destroyed</em> on mobile.</p>
<p>Utterly routed.</p>

</figure>
<p>If that graph looks rough-but-survivable, understand that it's only this high in the US (and other Western markets) because the web was <em>already</em> a success in those geographies when mobile exploded.</p>
<p>That history isn't shared in the most vibrant growth markets, meaning the web has fallen from "minuscule" to "nonexistent" as a part of mobile-first daily life globally.</p>
<p>This is the landscape. The web is extremely likely to get cast in amber and will, in less than a technology generation, become a weird legacy curio.</p>
<p>What happens then? The market for web developers will stop expanding, and the safe, open, interoperable, gatekeeper-free future for computing will be entirely foreclosed — or at least the difficulty will go from "slow build" to "cold-start problem"; several orders of magnitude harder (and therefore unlikely).</p>
<p>This failure has many causes, but they're all tractable. This is why I have worked so hard to close the capability gaps with <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers">Service Workers</a>, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">PWAs</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/explore/notifications">Notifications</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/fugu-showcase">Project Fugu</a>, and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/">structural solutions</a> to the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/">governance problems</a> that <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/08/doing-science-on-the-web/">held back progress.</a> All of these projects have been motivated by the logic of platform competition, and the urgency that comes from understanding that that web doesn't have a natural constituency.<sup><a href="#fn-fair-weather-friends-7" id="fnref-fair-weather-friends-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>If you've read any of my writing over this time, it will be unsurprising that this is why I eventually had to break silence and <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">call out what Apple has done on iOS, and what Facebook and Android have done to more quietly undermine browser choice.</a></p>
<p>These gatekeepers are kneecapping the web in different, but overlapping and reinforcing ways. There's much more to say here, but I've tried to lay out the landscape <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">over the past few years,</a>. But even if we break open the necessary 80/20 capabilities and restart engine competition, today's web is unlikely to succeed on mobile.</p>
<h2 id="you-do-it-to-yourself%2C-and-that's-what-really-hurts">You Do It To Yourself, And That's What Really Hurts <a href="#you-do-it-to-yourself%2C-and-that's-what-really-hurts">#</a></h2>
<p>Web developers and browsers have capped the web's mobile potential by ensuring it will feel terrible on <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/">the phones most folks have.</a> A web that can win is a web that doesn't feel like sludge. And today it does.</p>
<p>This failure has many fathers. Browsers have not done nearly enough to intercede on users' behalf; hell, we don't even warn users that links they tap on might take them to sites that lock up the main thread for seconds at a time!</p>
<p>Things have gotten so bad that even the extremely weak pushback on developer excess that Google's <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> effort provides is a slow-motion earthquake. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/introducing-inp">INP,</a> in particular, is forcing even the worst JS-first lemon vendors to <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components">retreat to the server</a> — a tacit acknowledgement that their shit stinks.</p>
<p>So this is the strategic logic of why web performance matters in 2024; for the web to survive, it must start to grow on mobile. For that growth to start, we need the web to be a credible way to deliver these sorts of 80/20 capability-enabled mobile experiences with not-trash performance. That depends both on browsers that don't suck (we see you, Apple) and websites that don't consistently lock up phones and drain batteries.</p>
<p>Toolchains and communities that retreat into the numbing comfort of desktop success are a threat to that potential.</p>
<p>There's (much) more for browsers to do here, but developers that want the web to succeed can start without us. Responsible, web-ecology-friendly development is more than possible today, and the great news is that <a href="https://wpostats.com/">it tends to make companies more money, too!</a></p>
<p>The JS-industrial-complex culture that pooh-poohs responsibility is self-limiting and a harm to our collective potential.</p>
<h2 id="groundhog-day">Groundhog Day <a href="#groundhog-day">#</a></h2>
<p>Nobody has ever hired me to work on performance.</p>
<p>It's (still) on my plate because terrible performance is a limiting factor on the web's potential to heal and grow. Spending nearly half my time diagnosing and remediating easily preventable failure <em>is not fun</em>. The teams I sit with <em>are not having fun either</em>, and goodness knows there are APIs I'd <em>much</em> rather be working on instead.</p>
<p>My work today, and for the past 8 years, has only focused on performance today because until it's fixed <em>the whole web</em> is at risk.</p>
<p>It's actually that dire, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the research I publish</a> indicates that we are not on track to cap our JS emissions or mitigate them with CPUs fast enough to prevent ecosystem collapse.</p>
<p>Contra the framework apologists, pervasive, preventable failure to deliver usable mobile experiences <em>is</em> often because we're dragging around IE8 compat and long toolchains premised on outdated priors like a ball and chain.<sup><a href="#fn-sinking-costs-8" id="fnref-sinking-costs-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="reboot">Reboot <a href="#reboot">#</a></h2>
<p>Things look bad, and I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that it could just be too late. Apple and Google and Facebook, with the help of a pliant and credulous JavaScript community, might have succeeded where 90s-era Microsoft failed — we just don't know it yet.</p>
<p>But it seems equally likely that the web's advantages are just dormant. When browser competition is finally unlocked, and when web pages aren't bloated with <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript">half a megabyte of JavaScript (on average)</a>, we <em>can</em> expect a revolution. But we need to prepare for that day and do everything we can to make it possible.</p>
<p>Failure and collapse aren't pre-ordained. We <em>can</em> do better. We <em>can</em> grow the web again. But to do that, the frontend community has to decide that user experience, the web's health, and their own career prospects are more important than whatever JS-based dogma VC-backed SAAS vendors are shilling this month.</p>

  <ol><li id="fn-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1"><p>My business card says <em>"Product Manager"</em> which is an uncomfortable fudge in the same way <em>"Software Engineer"</em> was an odd fit in my dozen+ years on the Chrome team.</p>
<p>My job on both teams has been somewhat closer to <em>"Platform Strategist for the Web"</em>. But nobody hires platform strategists, and when they do, it's to support proprietary platforms. The tactics, habits of mind, and ways of thinking about platform competition for open vs. closed platforms could not be more different. Indeed, I've seen many successful proprietary-platform folks try their hand at open systems and bounce hard off the different constraints, cultures, and "soft power" thinking they require.</p>
<p>Doing strategy on behalf of a collectively-owned, open system is extremely unusual. Getting paid to do it is almost unheard of. And the job itself is strange; because facts about the ecosystem develop slowly, there isn't a great deal to re-derive from current events.</p>
<p>Companies also don't ask strategists to design and implement solutions in the opportunity spaces they identify. But solving problems is the only way to deliver progress, so along with others who do roughly similar work, I have camped out in roles that allow arguments about the health of the web ecosystem to motivate the concrete engineering projects necessary to light the fuse of web growth.</p>
<p>Indeed, nobody <em>asked</em> me to work on web performance, just as nobody <em>asked</em> me to develop PWAs, in the same way that nobody <em>asked</em> me to work on the capability gap between web and native. Each one falls out of the sort of strategy analysis I'm sharing in this post for the first time. These projects are examples of the sort of work I think anyone would do once they understood the stakes and marinated in the same data.</p>
<p>Luckily, inside of browser teams, I've found that largely to be true. Platform work attracts long-term thinkers, and those folks are willing to give strategy analysis a listen. This, in turn, has allowed the formation of large collaborations (like <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu/">Project Fugu</a> and <a href="https://conffab.com/in_person_session/summit-23-front-end-engineering-afternoon-day-2/">Project Sidecar</a> to tackle the burning issues that pro-web strategy analysis yields.</p>
<p>Strategy without action isn't worth a damn, and action without strategy can easily misdirect scarce resources. It's a strange and surprising thing to have found a series of teams (and bosses) willing to support an oddball like me that works both sides of the problem space without direction.</p>
<p>So what is it that I do for a living? Whatever working to make the web a success for another generation demands. <a href="#fnref-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Needless to say, these results are significantly worse than those of responsible JS-centric metaframeworks like <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> or HTML-first systems like <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Spot-checking their results gives me hope.</p>
<p>Failure doesn't have to be our destiny, we only need to change the way we build and support <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">efforts that can close the capability gap.</a> <a href="#fnref-failure-on-repeat-2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-our-awol-tech-press-3"><p>Web developers aren't the only ones shooting their future prospects in the foot.</p>
<p>It's bewildering to see today's tech press capitulate to the gatekeepers. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/">The Register</a> stands alone in using above-the-fold column inches to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/28/apple_apps_challenge/">cover</a> just how <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/21/eu_apple_owa/">rancid</a> and self-dealing <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/27/inapp_browsers/">Apple, Google, and Facebook's suppression</a> of the mobile web has been.</p>
<p>Most can't even summon <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/the-web-is-the-app-store/">their opinion bytes to highlight how broken the situation has become</a>, or how the alternative would benefit everyone, even though it would <em>directly</em> benefit those outlets themselves.</p>
<p>If the web has a posse, it doesn't include The Verge or TechCrunch. <a href="#fnref-our-awol-tech-press-3">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-no-kos-4"><p>There are rarely KOs in platform competitions, only slow, grinding changes that look "boring" to a tech press that would rather report on social media contratemps.</p>
<p>Even the smartphone revolution, which featured never before seen device sales rates, took most of a decade to overtake desktop as the dominant computing form-factor. <a href="#fnref-no-kos-4">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-status-tracking-5"><p>The web wasn't always competitive with native on desktop, either. It took Ajax (new capabilities), Moore's Law (RIP), and broadband to make it so. There had to be enough overhang in CPUs and network availability to make the performance hit of the web's languages and architecture largely immaterial.</p>
<p>This is why I continue to track the <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">mobile device and network situation.</a> For the mobile web to take off, it'll need to overcome similar hurdles to usability on most devices.</p>
<p>The only way that's likely to happen in the short-to-medium term is for developers to emit less JS per page. And <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript">that is not what's happening.</a> <a href="#fnref-status-tracking-5">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-ui-coherence-6"><p>One common objection to metaplatforms like the web is that the look and feel versus "native" UI is not consistent. The theory goes that consistent affordances create less friction for users as they navigate their digital world. This is a nice theory, but in practice the more important question in the fight between web and native look-and-feel is which one users encounter more often.</p>
<p>The dominant experience is what others are judged against. On today's desktops, browsers that set the pace, leaving OSes with reduced influence. OS purists decry this as an abomination, but it just is what it is. "Fixing" it gains users very little.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in a world where OSes change up large aspects of their design languages every half decade. Even without the web's influence, this leaves a trail of unreconciled experiences sitting side-by-side uncomfortably. Web apps aren't an unholy disaster, just more of the same. <a href="#fnref-ui-coherence-6">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-fair-weather-friends-7"><p>No matter how much they protest that they love it (sus) and couldn't have succeeded without it (true), the web is, at best, an also-ran in the internal logic of today's tech megacorps. They can do platform strategy, too, and know that that exerting direct control over access to APIs is worth its weight in Californium. As a result, the preferred alternative is always the proprietary (read: directly controlled and therefore taxable) platform of their OS frameworks. API access gatekeeping enables distribution gatekeeping, which becomes a business model chokepoint over time.</p>
<p>Even Google, the sponsor of the projects I pursued to close platform gaps, couldn't summon the organisational fortitude to inconvenience the Play team for the web's benefit. For its part, Apple froze Safari funding and API expansion almost as soon as the App Store took off. Both benefit from a cozy duopoly that forces businesses into the logic of heavily mediated app platforms.</p>
<p>The web isn't suffering on mobile because it isn't good enough in some theoretical sense, it's failing on mobile because the duopolists directly benefit from keeping it in a weakened state. And because the web is a collectively-owned, reach-based platform, neither party has to have their fingerprints on the murder weapon. At current course and speed, the web will die from a lack of competitive vigour, and nobody will be able to point to the single moment when it happened.</p>
<p>That's by design. <a href="#fnref-fair-weather-friends-7">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-sinking-costs-8"><p>Real teams, doing actual work, aren't nearly as wedded to React vs., e.g., Preact or Lit or FAST or Stencil or Qwik or Svelte as the JS-industrial-complex wants us all to believe. And moving back to the server entirely is even easier.</p>
<p>React is the last of the totalising frameworks. Everyone else is living in the interoperable, plug-and-play future (via Web Components). Escape doesn't hurt, but it can be scary. But teams that want to do better aren't wanting for off-ramps. <a href="#fnref-sinking-costs-8">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-the-softest-target-9"><p>It's hard to overstate just how fair this is to the over-Reactors. The (still) more common <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> <s>metaframework</s> starter kit would suffer terribly by comparison, and Vercel has had years of browser, network, and CPU progress to water down the negative consequences of Next.js's blighted architecture.</p>
<p>Next has also been pitched since 2018 as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191227200506/https://nextjs.org/"><em>"The React Framework for the Mobile Web"</em> and <em>"The React Framework for SEO-Friendly Sites"</em></a>. Nobody else's petard is doing the hoisting; these are the sites that <em>Vercel</em> is chosing to highlight, built using <em>their</em> technology, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201021152422/https://nextjs.org/">consistently advertised performance-oriented features like code-splitting and SSG support.</a> <a href="#fnref-the-softest-target-9">↩︎</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NotebookLlama: An Open Source version of NotebookLM</h2><a id="user-content-notebookllama-an-open-source-version-of-notebooklm" aria-label="Permalink: NotebookLlama: An Open Source version of NotebookLM" href="#notebookllama-an-open-source-version-of-notebooklm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/resources/Outline.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/raw/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/resources/Outline.jpg" alt="NotebookLlama"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/resources/_podcast.mp3">Listen to audio from the example here</a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a guided series of tutorials/notebooks that can be taken as a reference or course to build a PDF to Podcast workflow.</p>
<p dir="auto">You will also learn from the experiments of using  Text to Speech Models.</p>
<p dir="auto">It assumes zero knowledge of LLMs, prompting and audio models, everything is covered in their respective notebooks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Outline:</h3><a id="user-content-outline" aria-label="Permalink: Outline:" href="#outline"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here is step by step thought (pun intended) for the task:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Step 1: Pre-process PDF: Use <code>Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct</code> to pre-process the PDF and save it in a <code>.txt</code> file.</li>
<li>Step 2: Transcript Writer: Use <code>Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</code> model to write a podcast transcript from the text</li>
<li>Step 3: Dramatic Re-Writer: Use <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct</code> model to make the transcript more dramatic</li>
<li>Step 4: Text-To-Speech Workflow: Use <code>parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1</code> and <code>bark/suno</code> to generate a conversational podcast</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note 1: In Step 1, we prompt the 1B model to not modify the text or summarize it, strictly clean up extra characters or garbage characters that might get picked due to encoding from PDF. Please see the prompt in Notebook 1 for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note 2: For Step 2, you can also use <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct</code> model, we recommend experimenting and trying if you see any differences. The 70B model was used here because it gave slightly more creative podcast transcripts for the tested examples.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note 3: For Step 4, please try to extend the approach with other models. These models were chosen based on a sample prompt and worked best, newer models might sound better. Please see <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/TTS_Notes.md">Notes</a> for some of the sample tests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Detailed steps on running the notebook:</h3><a id="user-content-detailed-steps-on-running-the-notebook" aria-label="Permalink: Detailed steps on running the notebook:" href="#detailed-steps-on-running-the-notebook"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Requirements: GPU server or an API provider for using 70B, 8B and 1B Llama models.
For running the 70B model, you will need a GPU with aggregated memory around 140GB to infer in bfloat-16 precision.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: For our GPU Poor friends, you can also use the 8B and lower models for the entire pipeline. There is no strong recommendation. The pipeline below is what worked best on first few tests. You should try and see what works best for you!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Before getting started, please make sure to login using the <code>huggingface cli</code> and then launch your jupyter notebook server to make sure you are able to download the Llama models.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You'll need your Hugging Face access token, which you can get at your Settings page <a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Then run <code>huggingface-cli login</code> and copy and paste your Hugging Face access token to complete the login to make sure the scripts can download Hugging Face models if needed.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>First, please Install the requirements from <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama">here</a> by running inside the folder:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes
cd llama-recipes/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/
pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes
cd llama-recipes/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 1:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This notebook is used for processing the PDF and processing it using the new Feather light model into a <code>.txt</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Update the first cell with a PDF link that you would like to use. Please decide on a PDF to use for Notebook 1, it can be any link but please remember to update the first cell of the notebook with the right link.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please try changing the prompts for the <code>Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct</code> model and see if you can improve results.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 2:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This notebook will take in the processed output from Notebook 1 and creatively convert it into a podcast transcript using the <code>Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</code> model. If you are GPU rich, please feel free to test with the 405B model!</p>
<p dir="auto">Please try experimenting with the System prompts for the model and see if you can improve the results and try the 8B model as well here to see if there is a huge difference!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 3:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This notebook takes the transcript from earlier and prompts <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct</code> to add more dramatization and interruptions in the conversations.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also a key factor here: we return a tuple of conversation which makes our lives easier later. Yes, studying Data Structures 101 was actually useful for once!</p>
<p dir="auto">For our TTS logic, we use two different models that behave differently with certain prompts. So we prompt the model to add specifics for each speaker accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please again try changing the system prompt and see if you can improve the results. We encourage testing the feather light 3B and 1B models as well at this stage</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 4:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Finally, we take the results from last notebook and convert them into a podcast. We use the <code>parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1</code> and <code>bark/suno</code> models for a conversation.</p>
<p dir="auto">The speakers and the prompt for parler model were decided based on experimentation and suggestions from the model authors. Please try experimenting, you can find more details in the resources section.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note: Right now there is one issue: Parler needs transformers 4.43.3 or earlier and for steps 1 to 3 of the pipeline you need latest, so we just switch versions in the last notebook.</h4><a id="user-content-note-right-now-there-is-one-issue-parler-needs-transformers-4433-or-earlier-and-for-steps-1-to-3-of-the-pipeline-you-need-latest-so-we-just-switch-versions-in-the-last-notebook" aria-label="Permalink: Note: Right now there is one issue: Parler needs transformers 4.43.3 or earlier and for steps 1 to 3 of the pipeline you need latest, so we just switch versions in the last notebook." href="#note-right-now-there-is-one-issue-parler-needs-transformers-4433-or-earlier-and-for-steps-1-to-3-of-the-pipeline-you-need-latest-so-we-just-switch-versions-in-the-last-notebook"></a></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Speech Model experimentation: The TTS model is the limitation of how natural this will sound. This probably be improved with a better pipeline and with the help of someone more knowledgable-PRs are welcome! :)</li>
<li>LLM vs LLM Debate: Another approach of writing the podcast would be having two agents debate the topic of interest and write the podcast outline. Right now we use a single LLM (70B) to write the podcast outline</li>
<li>Testing 405B for writing the transcripts</li>
<li>Better prompting</li>
<li>Support for ingesting a website, audio file, YouTube links and more. Again, we welcome community PRs!</li>

<p>In a quiet corner of the Pacific last August, a vessel unlike any other was making what many thought was its final voyage. <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">R/P FLIP </a>(Floating Instrument Platform), the U.S. Navy’s<a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/"> legendary research vessel </a>that could stand on end like a floating skyscraper, was being towed to Mexico to be scrapped. For well over half a century, FLIP had been an icon of oceanographic research, a testament to audacious engineering and the human thirst for discovery. Its <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">decommissioning</a>, announced last year, marked the end of an era—or so it seemed.</p>



<p>But then, a twist befitting a maritime thriller unfolded. It looks like she has been saved! </p>

<p>Giulio Maresca was sitting in his London office at <a href="https://www.deep.com/">DEEP</a>, the subsea design firm with ambitions to pioneer underwater human habitats, when the news crossed his desk: FLIP was <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">headed for dismantlement</a>. To Maresca and his colleagues, FLIP was more than metal and machinery; it was a symbol of what could be achieved when imagination met engineering.</p>



<p>“The directive from our founder was quite clear,” Maresca recalls with a smile. “‘Save her. Don’t come back without her.'”</p>



<p>Within 48 hours, a DEEP team was en route to Mexico, racing against time to intercept the vessel before it met an ignoble end. It was a mission as quixotic as it was urgent.</p>

<p>FLIP isn’t your typical ship. At 355 feet long, it was designed to do the unthinkable: flip from a horizontal floating position to a vertical one, submerging 300 feet of its length below the ocean surface. This unique capability allowed it to become an exceptionally stable platform, unaffected by surface waves—a perfect sentinel for studying acoustics, wave dynamics, and marine life.</p>



<p>Commissioned in 1962, FLIP was a <a href="https://gcaptain.com/the-flip-scripps-institute-of-oceanography/">collaborative effort </a>between the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Over decades, it facilitated groundbreaking research that deepened our understanding of the ocean’s mysteries.</p>



<p>Shaped like a giant baseball bat, the 700-ton FLIP is technically not a ship but a barge. It has no propellers, propulsion, or engine room, and requires towing by a tugboat when conducting scientific missions.</p>



<p>“FLIP was from a time when bold engineering met boundless optimism,” <a href="https://www.deep.com/article/the-onrs-flipping-vessel-which-was-believed-to-be-scrapped-has-been-saved/">says</a> Kristen Tertoole, CEO of DEEP. “An ethos we share and seek to embody.”</p>

<h2 id="h-the-journey-across-oceans">The Journey Across Oceans</h2>



<p>After tense negotiations and a flurry of logistical hurdles, DEEP secured ownership of FLIP. The vessel began a new journey—from Mexico, through the Panama Canal, and across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. It was a voyage that mirrored its original mission: bridging gaps and breaking boundaries.</p>



<p>Now docked in France, FLIP is slated for a 12 to 18-month refit at <a href="https://mb92.com/">MB92</a>, a shipyard rin Barcelona renowned for refurbishing superyachts and handling unusual projects.</p>



<p>“Modernizing FLIP to further our understanding of the ocean is what’s in our DNA,” says Rob Papworth, MB92 Group Managing Director. “We’re exceptionally proud to be involved in this historic endeavor.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bold-vision-for-the-future">A Bold Vision for the Future</h2>



<p>DEEP’s ambitions for FLIP go beyond restoration. The company envisions the vessel as a cornerstone in their mission to “make humans aquatic,” enabling people to live, work, and thrive underwater.</p>



<p>“FLIP will play a key role in our fleet, providing a one-of-a-kind platform for ocean research,” Tertoole explains. “She’s not just a ship; she’s a bridge to the next frontier.”</p>



<p>The refitted FLIP will support DEEP’s Sentinel habitat deployments, underwater living spaces designed for extended research missions. Interest from the global scientific community has been immediate and enthusiastic.</p>



<p>“I’m thrilled to confirm that many oceanographic and research groups are already in contact to ensure access,” Tertoole says.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-legacy-continued">A Legacy Continued</h2>



<p>News of FLIP’s salvation has reached those who knew her best.</p>



<p>“I’m delighted by DEEP’s decision to revitalize and modernize the R/P FLIP,” says Dr. Tom Drake of the Office of Naval Research. “This modernization will significantly expand her capabilities in ocean science, breathing new life into a vessel that has been vital to our mission.”</p>



<p>For Maresca, the rescue of FLIP is both professional and deeply personal.</p>



<p>“Everyone in maritime research has a FLIP story,” he says. “She’s inspired generations of scientists and engineers. To be part of her next chapter is beyond rewarding.”</p>



<h2 id="h-turning-tides">Turning Tides</h2>



<p>As FLIP prepares for her relaunch in early 2026, she carries with her not just instruments and equipment, but the weight of history and the promise of future discoveries.</p>



<p>“She’s a vessel born from audacity,” Tertoole reflects. “And that’s exactly what we need now—to be bold in our pursuit of understanding our oceans.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br>Up to $41 billion in World Bank climate finance —nearly 40 percent of all climate funds disbursed by the Bank over the past seven years— is unaccounted for due to poor record-keeping practices, reveals a new Oxfam report published today ahead of the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings in Washington D.C.</p><p>An Oxfam audit of the World Bank’s 2017-2023 climate finance portfolio found that between $24 billion and $41 billion in climate finance went unaccounted for between the time projects were approved and when they closed.</p><p>There is no clear public record showing where this money went or how it was used, which makes any assessment of its impacts impossible. It also remains unclear whether these funds were even spent on climate-related initiatives intended to help low- and middle-income countries protect people from the impacts of the climate crisis and invest in clean energy.</p><p>“The Bank is quick to brag about its climate finance billions —but these numbers are based on what it plans to spend, not on what it actually spends once a project gets rolling,” said Kate Donald, Head of Oxfam International’s Washington D.C. Office. "This is like asking your doctor to assess your diet only by looking at your grocery list, without ever checking what actually ends up in your fridge.”</p><p>The Bank is the largest multilateral provider of climate finance, accounting for 52 percent of the total flow from all multilateral development banks combined.</p><p>The issue of climate finance will take center stage at this year’s COP in Azerbaijan, where countries are set to negotiate a new global climate finance goal, the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG). Climate activists are demanding the Global North provide at least $5 trillion a year in public finance to the Global South "as a down payment towards their climate debt" to the countries, people and communities of the Global South who are the least responsible for climate breakdown but are the most affected. Oxfam warns that the lack of traceable spending could undermine trust in global climate finance efforts at this critical juncture.</p><p>“Climate finance is scarce, and yes, we know it’s hard to deliver. But not tracking how or where the money actually gets spent? That’s not just some bureaucratic oversight —it’s a fundamental breach of trust that risks derailing the progress we need to make at COP this year. The Bank needs to act like our future depends on tackling the climate crisis, because it does,” said Donald.</p><p>Oxfam’s investigation revealed that obtaining even basic information on how the World Bank is using climate finance was painstaking and difficult.</p><p>"We had to sift through layers of complex and incomplete reports, and even then, the data was full of gaps and inconsistencies. The fact that this information is so hard to access and understand is alarming —it shouldn’t take a team of professional researchers to figure out how billions of dollars meant for climate action are being spent. This should be transparent and accessible to everyone, most importantly communities who are meant to benefit from climate finance," said Donald.<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>
