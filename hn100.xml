      <p><em>work in progress</em></p>

      <p>It's fun to play with data<sup>[citation needed]</sup>. All data on Bluesky is extremely public, and with 15 million users (as of today and with mind-boggling growth), there's a lot of public data to play with.</p>

      <p>You can get the firehose as a websocket JSON feed with <a href="https://jazco.dev/2024/09/24/jetstream/">Jetstream</a>. This connects you to <em>everything</em> happening on the network in real time. It's extremely easy to get started and very fun.</p>

      <p>Here's a random word from every post being posted <em>right now</em>:</p>

      

      <p>There you go, you just consumed it for free from your browser.</p>

      <h2>little app</h2>

      <p>After noodling around a bit, i sketched out <a href="https://deletions.bsky.bad-example.com/" target="_blank">this questionable little app</a> which listens for all <code>delete</code> events from the firehose, and then shows the just-deleted text one last time in an anonymized disappearing feed. Kind of fascinating to see what people choose to delete. (also please note that I made this millions of users ago when the network was a fraction of the current chaotic speed). Maybe I'll write more about it later.</p>

      <p>Anyway it runs on fly:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fly machine, shared-cpu-1x with 256MB RAM: $1.94/mo</li>
        <li>2GB Persistent volume: $0.30/mo</li>
      </ul>

      <p><img src="https://bsky.bad-example.com/consuming-the-firehose-cheaply/fly-dash.png" alt="screenshot of fly.io dashboard showing app metrics over 7 days. network io has a daily cycle (growing since bsky is growing), cpu memory and load average are all flat, volume usage grows (backfill), then levels (steady state), then grows again (bsky growing)."></p><p>Granted it's not doing <em>much</em>, but it's doing it happily on the smallest instance fly offers.</p>

      <p>What <em>is</em> it doing?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Receive every new create-post event from the <code>app.bsky.feed.post</code> collection</li>
        <li>Filter out empty posts, apply redactions to mentions and links</li>
        <li>Cache the clean text content on the volume in pebbledb, keyed by <code>did+rkey</code></li>
        <li>Every few seconds, do a range-delete on saved texts older than 48hr</li>
        <li>For every delete-post event, try to fetch the text from the cache, and if found, broadcast it to all current observers</li>
      </ol>

      <p>More interesting apps might not scale down this far, but some will.</p>

<h2 id="the-polars-vs-pandas-difference-nobody-is-talking-about">The Polars vs pandas difference nobody is talking about</h2>
<p>I attended PyData Berlin 2024 in April, and it was a blast! I met so many colleagues, collaborators, and friends.
There was quite some talk of Polars - some people even gathered together for a Polars-themed dinner!
It's certainly nice to see people talking about it, and the focus tends to be on features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>lazy execution</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>consistent handling of null values</li>
<li>multithreading</li>
<li>query optimisation</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet there's one innovation which barely ever gets a mention: non-elementary group-by aggregations.</p>
<p>I'll start by introducing the group-by operation. We'll then take a look at elementary aggregations
with both the pandas and Polars APIs. Finally, we'll look at non-elementary aggregations, and see
how the Polars API enables so much more than the pandas one.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-group-by">What's a group-by?</h2>
<p>Suppose we start with a (Polars) dataframe such as:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>shape: (6, 3)</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ id  ‚îÜ sales ‚îÜ views ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ --- ‚îÜ ---   ‚îÜ ---   ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ i64 ‚îÜ i64   ‚îÜ i64   ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚ïû‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï°</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 1   ‚îÜ 4     ‚îÜ 3     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 1   ‚îÜ 1     ‚îÜ 1     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 1   ‚îÜ 2     ‚îÜ 2     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 2   ‚îÜ 7     ‚îÜ 8     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 2   ‚îÜ 6     ‚îÜ 6     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 2   ‚îÜ 7     ‚îÜ 7     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>A group-by operation produces a single row per group:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.group_by('id').agg('sales')</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>shape: (2, 2)</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ id  ‚îÜ sales     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ --- ‚îÜ ---       ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ i64 ‚îÜ list[i64] ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚ïû‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï°</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 1   ‚îÜ [4, 1, 2] ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 2   ‚îÜ [7, 6, 7] ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>If we want a single scalar value per group, we can use a reduction ('mean', 'sum', 'std', ...):</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.group_by('id').agg(pl.sum('sales'))</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>shape: (2, 2)</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ id  ‚îÜ sales ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ --- ‚îÜ ---   ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ i64 ‚îÜ i64   ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚ïû‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï°</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 1   ‚îÜ 7     ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îÇ 2   ‚îÜ 20    ‚îÇ</span></p></div><div><p><span>‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h3 id="group-by-in-pandas">Group-by in pandas</h3>
<p>If you're coming from a pandas-like library, you may have been used to writing the above example as</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.groupby('id')['sales'].sum()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>And indeed, for such a simple task as this one, the pandas API is quite nice. All we had to do was:</p>
<ol>
<li>select which columns we're grouping by</li>
<li>select the column(s) we want to aggregate</li>
<li>specify an elementary aggregation function</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's try something else: "find the maximum value of 'views', where 'sales' is greater than its mean, per
'id'".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pandas API has no way to express this, meaning
that no library which copies the pandas API can truly optimise such an
operation in the general case.</p>
<p>You might be wondering whether we can just do the following:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.groupby('id').apply(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    lambda df: df[df['sales'] &gt; df['sales'].mean()]['views'].max()</span></p></div><div><p><span>)</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>However, that uses a Python <code>lambda</code> function and so is generally going to be inefficient.</p>
<p>Another solution one might come up with is this one:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df[df['sales'] &gt; df.groupby('id')['sales'].transform('mean')].groupby('id')['views'].max()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>It's not as bad as the <code>apply</code> solution above, but it still looks overly complicated and requires
two group-bys.</p>
<p>There's actually a third solution, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>relies on <code>GroupBy</code> caching its groups</li>
<li>performs in-place mutation of the original dataframe</li>
<li>uses the fact that <code>'max'</code> skips over missing values</li>
</ul>
<p>Realistically, few users would come up with it (most would jump straight to <code>apply</code>), but for
completeness, we present it:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>gb = df.groupby("id")</span></p></div><div><p><span>mask = df["sales"] &gt; gb["sales"].transform("mean")</span></p></div><div><p><span>df["result"] = df["views"].where(mask)</span></p></div><div><p><span>gb["result"].max()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Surely it's possible to do better?</p>
<h2 id="non-elementary-group-bys-in-polars">Non-elementary group-bys in Polars</h2>
<p>The Polars API lets us pass <a href="https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/expressions/">expressions</a> to <code>GroupBy.agg</code>.
So long as you can express your aggregation as
an expression, you can use it in a group-by setting. In this case, we can express "the maximum value
of 'views' where 'sales' is greater than its mean" as</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>pl.col('views').filter(pl.col('sales') &gt; pl.mean('sales')).max()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Then, all we need to do is pass this expression to <code>GroupBy.agg</code>:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.group_by('id').agg(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    pl.col('views').filter(pl.col('sales') &gt; pl.mean('sales')).max()</span></p></div><div><p><span>)</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Wonderful! Like this, we can express the operation cleanly and without hacks, meaning that any dataframe
implementation which follows the Polars API has the possibility to evaluate this efficiently.</p>

<p>We've learned about the group-by operation, elementary aggregations in both pandas and Polars, and how
Polars' syntax enables users to cleanly express non-elementary aggregations.</p>
<p>pandas is a wonderful tool which solves a lot of real problems for a lot of real people.
However, when new dataframe libraries insist on copying its API, they are stunting their own potential.
If an API doesn't allow for an operation to be expressed and users end up using <code>apply</code> with custom
Python lambda functions, then no amount of acceleration is going to make up for that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, innovation on the API side can enable new possibilities. There's a reason
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I came for the speed, but stayed for the syntax</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a common refrain among Polars users.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The FTC also highlighted fees charged on users transferring data out of certain cloud systems and minimum spend contracts, which offer discounts to companies in return for a set level of spending.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also attracted scrutiny from international regulators over similar matters. The UK‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority is investigating Microsoft and Amazon after its fellow watchdog Ofcom found that customers complained about being ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to a single provider, which offers discounts for exclusivity and charge high ‚Äúegress fees‚Äù to leave.</p>
<p>In the EU, Microsoft has avoided a formal probe into its cloud business after agreeing to a multimillion-dollar deal with a group of rival cloud providers in July.</p>
<p>The FTC in 2022 sued to block Microsoft‚Äôs $75 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard over concerns the deal would harm competitors to its Xbox consoles and cloud-gaming business. A federal court shot down an attempt by the FTC to block it, which is being appealed. A revised version of the deal in the meantime closed last year following its clearance by the UK‚Äôs CMA.</p>
<p>Since its inception 20 years ago, cloud infrastructure and services has grown to become one of the most lucrative business lines for Big Tech as companies outsource their data storage and computing online. More recently, this has been turbocharged by demand for processing power to train and run artificial intelligence models.</p>
<p>Spending on cloud services soared to $561 billion in 2023 with market researcher Gartner forecasting it will grow to $675 billion this year and $825 billion in 2025. Microsoft has about a 20 percent market share over the global cloud market, trailing leader Amazon Web Services that has 31 percent, but almost double the size of Google Cloud at 12 percent.</p>
<p>There is fierce rivalry between the trio and smaller providers. Last month, Microsoft accused Google of running ‚Äúshadow campaigns‚Äù seeking to undermine its position with regulators by secretly bankrolling hostile lobbying groups.</p>
<p>Microsoft also alleged that Google tried to derail its settlement with EU cloud providers by offering them $500 million in cash and credit to reject its deal and continue pursuing litigation.</p>
<p>The FTC and Microsoft declined to comment.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game.</li>
						<li>Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference.</li>
						<li>Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog!</li>
						<li>Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game!</li>
						<li>Removed green glow from the G-Man model‚Äôs eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release.</li>
						<li>Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game!</li>

    <pre>Those of you how know me, know that I am not a big fan of the X86
architecture, which I think is a bad mess, mangled by market power
considerations, rather than the CPU architecture this world actually
needs, in particular in terms of performance/energy ratio.

So when my regular HW-pusher had a T14s G6 with Qualcomm Snapdragon
ARM64 CPU, for only EUR1000 + VAT, and I couldn't resist.

Physical:
---------

Lenovo T-series as we know it.

FreeBSD-current status:
-----------------------

-CURRENT needed some patches to ARM64-specific interrupt stuff,
that too half a day or so, patches are in transit.

A lot of my time were spent trying to slow down the EFI console
enough to be able to capture the boot messages with my mobile phone's
camera.

One particular note here is that the VT console switches to a 25Hz timer
driven screen update once interupts are supposed to work, and if they dont,
you wont see why on the screen.

I think we ought to have a loader-tunable, settable to a number,
which slows down the console proportional to that number, and if
non-zero, the VT console should not rely on the timer.  That would
have saved me some trouble and confusion yesterday.

With those pending patches:

What works:  Screen, NVME, the two USB-A ports and that's probably about it.

What does not work: Keyboard, mouse, TB &amp; USB-C ports, thermal/freq mgt.

What is not tested: Everything else

Worldstone:
-----------

	&gt;&gt;&gt; World built in 3210 seconds, ncpu: 12, make -j12

... using 24 Wh of energy, measured with a proper power-meter.

Likely explanation: Twelve real CPUs and none of that HTT-crap ?

Conclusion:
-----------

Highly recommended.

<p>Like Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson, I have a garage. The door on that garage is opened and closed by a device made by a company that, as with Lee's, offers you a way to open and close it with a smartphone app. But that app doesn't work with my preferred home automation system, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, and also looks and works like an app made by a garage door company.</p>
<p>I had looked into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/i-home-automated-my-garage-door-finally-with-a-ratgdo/">the ratgdo Lee installed, and raved about</a>, but hooking it up to my particular Genie/Aladdin system would have <a href="https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/03_wiring.html">required installing limit switches</a>. So I instead installed <a href="https://opengarage.io/">an OpenGarage unit</a> ($50 plus shipping). My garage opener now works with Home Assistant (and thereby pretty much anything else), it's not subject to the whims of API access, and I've got a few ideas how to make it even better. Allow me to walk you through what I did, why I did it, and what I might do next.</p>
<h2>Thanks, I‚Äôll take it from here, Genie</h2>
<p>Genie, maker of my Wi-Fi-capable garage door opener (sold as an "Aladdin Connect" system), is not in the same boat as the Chamberlain/myQ setup that inspired Lee's project. There was <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">a working Aladdin Connect integration</a> in Home Assistant, until the company changed its API in January 2024. Genie said it would release its own official Home Assistant integration in June, and it did, but then it was quickly pulled back, <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/make-aladdin-connect-garage-integration-compatible-working-again/748076/5">seemingly for licensing issues</a>. Since then, no updates on the matter. (I have emailed Genie for comment and will update this post if I receive reply.)</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This is not egregious behavior, at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/12/what-is-drm-doing-in-my-garage/">on the scale of garage door opener firms</a>. And Aladdin's app works with Google Home and Amazon Alexa, but not with Home Assistant or my secondary/lazy option, HomeKit/Apple Home. It also logs me out "for security" more often than I'd like and tells me this only after an iPhone shortcut refuses to fire. It has some decent features, but without deeper integrations, I can't do things like have the brighter ceiling lights turn on when the door opens or flash indoor lights if the garage door stays open too long. At least not without Google or Amazon.</p>
<p>I've seen <a href="https://opengarage.io/">OpenGarage</a> passed around the Home Assistant forums and subreddits over the years. It is, as the name implies, fully open source: hardware design, firmware, and app code, API, everything. It is a tiny ESP board that has an ultrasonic distance sensor and circuit relay attached. You can control and monitor it from a web browser, mobile or desktop, from IFTTT, MQTT, and with the latest firmware, you can get email alerts. I decided to pull out the 6-foot ladder and give it a go.</p>

<h2>Installing the little watching owl</h2>
<p>You generally mount the OpenGarage unit to the roof of your garage, so the distance sensor can detect if your garage door has rolled up in front of it. There are options for mounting with magnetic contact sensors or a side view of a roll-up door, or you can figure out some other way in which two different sensor depth distances would indicate&nbsp;an open or closed door. If you've got a Security+ 2.0 door (the kind with the yellow antenna, generally), you'll need <a href="https://opensprinkler.com/product/security20/">an adapter</a>, too.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The toughest part of an overhead install is finding a spot that gives the unit a view of your garage door, not too close to rails or other obstructing objects, but then close enough for the contact wires and USB micro cable to reach. Ideally, too, it has a view of your car when the door is closed and the car is inside, so it can report its presence. I've yet to find the right thing to do with the "car is inside or not" data, but the seed is planted.</p>

<p>My garage setup, like most of them, is pretty simple. There's a big red glowing button on the wall near the door, and there are two very thin wires running from it to the opener. On the opener, there are four ports that you can open up with a screwdriver press. Most of the wires are headed to the safety sensor at the door bottom, while two come in from the opener button. After stripping a bit of wire to expose more cable, I pressed the contact wires from the OpenGarage into those same opener ports.</p>

<p>After that, I connected the wires to the OpenGarage unit's screw terminals, then did some pencil work on the garage ceiling to figure out how far I could run the contact and micro-USB power cable, getting the proper door view while maintaining some right-angle sense of order up there. When I had reached a decent compromise between cable tension and placement, I screwed the sensor into an overhead stud and used a staple gun to secure the wires. It doesn't look like a pro installed it, but it's not half bad.</p>

<h2>A very versatile board</h2>
<p>If you've got everything placed and wired up correctly, opening the OpenGarage access point or IP address should give you an interface that shows you the status of your garage, your car (optional), and its Wi-Fi and external connections.</p>

<p>It's a handy webpage and a basic opener (provided you know the secret device key you set), but OpenGarage is more powerful in how it uses that data. OpenGarage's device can keep a cloud connection open to <a href="https://blynk.io/">Blynk</a> or the maker's own <a href="https://openthings.io/">OpenThings.io cloud server</a>. You can hook it up to MQTT or an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> channel. It can send you alerts when your garage has been open a certain amount of time or if it's open after a certain time of day.</p>

<h2>You really don‚Äôt need a corporate garage coder</h2>
<p>For me, the greatest benefit is in hooking OpenGarage up to Home Assistant. I've added an opener button to my standard dashboard (one that requires a long-press or two actions to open). I've restored the automation that turns on the overhead bulbs for five minutes when the garage door opens. And I can dig in if I want, like alerting me that it's Monday night at 10 pm and I've yet to open the garage door, indicating I forgot to put the trash out. Or maybe some kind of NFC tag to allow for easy opening while on a bike, if that's not a security nightmare (it might be).</p>
<p>Not for nothing, but OpenGarage is also a deeply likable bit of indie kit. It's a two-person operation, with Ray Wang building on his work with the open and handy <a href="https://opensprinkler.com/">OpenSprinkler project</a>, trading Arduino for ESP8266, and doing some 3D printing to fit the sensors and switches, and Samer Albahra providing mobile app, documentation, and other help. Their enthusiasm for DIY home control has likely brought out the same in others and certainly in me.</p>

					<h3>November 15, 2024</h3>
					<p>November has sucked so far. One upside of the terrible nonsense is that more people are fleeing X. Many are choosing Bluesky. I‚Äôve seen a bunch of takes about this recently, but I keep seeing things I disagree with. I figure that‚Äôs a good enough excuse to write more about this weird-assed social network.</p>

<h3 id="decentralized-federated-neither">Decentralized? Federated? Neither.</h3>

<p>When writing about Bluesky, I‚Äôve seen folks mention that it‚Äôs  either federated or decentralized. I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs currently neither. This one really irks me because the service is getting the credit for work it hasn‚Äôt done.</p>

<p>One problem here is that the whole ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù thing is complicated. I believe the Bluesky team is putting in a lot of good-faith effort to becoming a decentralized platform. But, this work is tricky because their architectural choices are quite&nbsp;novel.</p>

<p><a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/21/thoughts-on-the-recent-migration-from-x-to-bluesky">As I‚Äôve written previosuly</a>, the AT Protocol (atproto) that powers Bluesky is <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture">really complex</a>. It‚Äôs made up of three main parts: Personal Data Servers (PDSs), Relays, and App Views.</p>

<p>Currently people can set up their own <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#relay">PDSs</a>, which will host both their identity‚Äôs signing keys and their content on Bluesky. Setting this up requires a fair amount of server-level knowledge, but it‚Äôs relatively cheap (maybe $15/month USD) and lets people control their own data. This is kind of like hosting your own website. The content will be available if someone knows how to get to it. By default, it‚Äôs just some stuff sitting on a server somewhere.</p>

<p>The PDS part of the stack is interesting to me. In Bluesky‚Äôs view, it‚Äôs great if people start hosting their own PDSs ‚Äî it means they don‚Äôt have to pay for people‚Äôs content storage!  It also means that users can relocate their data at any time. This is something that ActivityPub should do better. That said: yes, it‚Äôs a bit of a pain to move my data from one Mastodon server to another, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs currently possible. The only server that‚Äôs actively reading PDSs and doing anything productive with them is the one Bluesky controls. More on this in a second.</p>

<p>Next up the chain are <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#relay">Relays</a>. These are what gather data from PDSs and make it available to the atproto ecosystem. If a PDS is like a website, a Relay is like Google. Relays constantly look at PDSs to see if there‚Äôs any new content, and then index that content so it‚Äôs actually useful. The trouble with this is that it‚Äôs expensive and there‚Äôs <strong>a lot</strong> of data. I recently <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q">read an interesting post</a> outlining the steps required to self-host Bluesky content. The author mentions that setting up a Relay requires <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q#:~:text=make%20sure%20you%20have%20at%20least%20~4.5%20TB%20of%20disk%20space">around 4.5 TB of disk space</a>, and that it‚Äôs <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alice.mosphere.at/post/3laewhb55zp2v">growing by around 18 GB a day</a>. However, that was said before the most recent bump in growth. The data and processing requirements will only accelerate as more people use the service.</p>

<p>While the Relay aggregates the data, it doesn‚Äôt do anything to display it to users. That‚Äôs up to the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#relay">App View</a>, which is what most people think of as ‚ÄúBluesky‚Äù. This is the piece that pulls out data that has been scraped by a Relay and turns it into something useful. In the case of Bluesky ‚Äî&nbsp;the social network ‚Äî&nbsp;it‚Äôs about showing you posts from people you follow, not showing you stuff from people you‚Äôve blocked, and notifying you of people who‚Äôve mentioned you. The idea here is that this part could be replaced with something that isn‚Äôt a social network, and could be used for just about anything. The problem is that it‚Äôs currently extremely loosely defined, and also <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q#:~:text=documented%20here.-,AppView,-The%20elephant%20in">hasn‚Äôt been implemented by anyone else</a>.</p>

<p>There are two other things that are directly under Bluesky‚Äôs control: the <a href="https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc">DID:PLC</a> and <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/23/digging-into-bluesky-dms">DMs</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> are an open standard to allow people to identify things in a distributed way. However, the PLC method that Bluesky uses is currently under their control. It was <a href="https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc/blob/0e8370fc1e616e6f1f76f8b8c445d6dfe8e95f04/README.md">previously known as the ‚Äúplaceholder‚Äù method</a>, because they intended to get away from it as soon as they could build something decentralized. Instead, they (I think wisely) decided to stick with it for the meantime. However, if you want to look up a DID:PLC, you need to query the Bluesky servers. This is important because every user is identified by a DID:PLC, and all interactions need to reference them.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap#:~:text=Basic%20%22Off%2DProtocol%22%20Direct%20Messages%20%28DMs%29">DMs are currently handled outside of atproto</a>. They‚Äôre not part of the atproto spec, and need to go through Bluesky‚Äôs servers. I‚Äôm not sure how or when these will be updated.</p>

<p>All this to say: the Bluesky team seems like they‚Äôre earnestly working toward a decentralized platform, but they have a lot of work ahead of them. Years of effort, in my estimation. In the meantime, Bluesky is slightly more decentralized than, say, Facebook ‚Äî&nbsp;but not by much. Yes, you can host your own data. Yes, you can scrape all of the content on the network. But you can‚Äôt do anything with it unless you‚Äôre attached to the Bluesky service. I believe this will change with time, but it will be prohibitively expensive and we‚Äôre not there yet.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll also add that the reason I‚Äôm a big fan of a ActivityPub solution like Mastodon is that it‚Äôs <a href="https://masto.host/pricing/">quite inexpensive</a> to run your own complete stack unless you‚Äôre extremely famous. Hosting a Mastodon instance is a one-step process, and you then control everything. To get the same experience with atproto, you‚Äôll need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a month, and even then you still don‚Äôt control everything as of today.</p>

<h3 id="radically-open">Radically open</h3>

<p>I think some might be surprised to learn how open Bluesky is. It‚Äôs trivially easy to <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/repo-export">grab an export of any user‚Äôs data</a>. It‚Äôs also a core assumption of the service that all the data (aside from out-of-protocol stuff like DMs) is completely open. You can watch the <a href="https://firesky.tv/">firehose of data</a> go by if you‚Äôd like. If you want to run a Relay, you have to download all the data. This is because the data in the network is all <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/repository">cryptographically signed based on what came before it</a>. The protocol does this using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree structure</a>, which is also how Git stores data. The issue with this is: if you want to look at one piece of content in the system, you also need to know about everything that happened before. For people using the Bluesky service, this isn‚Äôt something you need to think about. But behind the scenes, it‚Äôs helpful to know that everything being added to the service could potentially be available for anyone else to use for any purpose.</p>

<h3 id="financial-concerns">Financial concerns</h3>

<p>Bluesky is currently free to use, and I think they intend it to stay that way. This is easier when there are fewer users, and I‚Äôd bet that the technical choices discussed above make things more expensive to run. The CEO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber">Jay Graber</a>, seems like a smart person who‚Äôs trying to do the right thing. However, she‚Äôs also someone with a background in the crypto industry who <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">recently accepted funding lead by a crypto investor</a>. What does that mean for the service? Who knows! But it doesn‚Äôt sound great to me. Investors like to make returns. Bluesky is currently only making money by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">reselling domains for usernames</a>. That‚Äôs not exactly a high-margin business.</p>

<h3 id="small-things">Small things</h3>

<p>The above pieces are things I worry about, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm in the minority. Most people don‚Äôt care about decentralization or even if their content is being scraped. I can‚Äôt imagine they care how the service is being paid for. But here are two nitpicks I‚Äôll add here that I think are more product-level: repost control and post editing.</p>

<p>On Mastodon and Twitter-of-old, I was able to follow a user, but only see posts from them. Many people hit the repost button a lot, and overwhelm my feed. I‚Äôd love the ability to selectively disable reposts from a user without having to build a custom feed to do so.</p>

<p>Also, it would be great to edit posts! I believe this is tricky because of the Merkle tree structure mentioned above, but it‚Äôs a pain these days when every other platform has the feature.</p>

<h3 id="good-things">Good things</h3>

<p>Now that I‚Äôve gotten some grumpiness out of my system, I would like to recognise some legitimately great things that Bluesky is doing. First up, domain-based usernames.</p>

<p>You can follow me on Bluesky as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gavin.anderegg.ca">@gavin.anderegg.ca</a>. I was able to set this up easily by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">adding a TXT record to my domain that links to my DID:PLC</a>. This is great! It allows me to effectively ‚Äúblue check‚Äù myself, in a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/verification">similar way to Mastodon</a>. The domain-based approach is quite flexible, and I think it‚Äôs a great solution.</p>

<p>Bluesky also offers both <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> and the ability to <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">choose your own algorithm</a>. I‚Äôm someone who just wants to see a chronological feed of posts from the folks I follow, but I absolutely understand the appeal of these features. It‚Äôs made especially clear when compared to Threads, which only wants to show me <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264382/threads-engagement-bait-problem-mosseri-meta">inane engagement bait</a> by default. There are even some <a href="https://www.southernfriedscience.com/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-to-making-custom-feeds-on-bluesky/">third-party services</a> which make setting up your own custom feed easier.</p>

<p>I also really love the idea of <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">starter packs</a>. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs joining the service, picking who you want to follow is rough. A starter pack lets you to follow a set of users recommended by someone you trust. Anyone can create a starter pack, so it‚Äôs easy to grab a few and have a lively feed a few moments after joining.</p>

<h3 id="everyones-experience-is-different">Everyone‚Äôs experience is different</h3>

<p>As people are fleeing X, I‚Äôve seen a lot of thoughts from people about engagement. I‚Äôm on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads. On each network, I‚Äôve seen a post like, ‚ÄúI joined and I‚Äôve got more engagement here than anywhere else‚Äù. I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs true for that person, but I think this is so variable as to be useless.</p>

<p>I joined Mastodon in late 2022, along with the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Relay</a>, <a href="https://atp.fm/">ATP</a>, and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> crowd. I get a lot of engagement on Mastodon! I‚Äôm also a white guy who cares too much about expensive technology. Bluesky seems to be winning with artists and random local groups. I <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/21/thoughts-on-the-recent-migration-from-x-to-bluesky">mentioned this before</a>, but my new city councillor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lecwhite.bsky.social">campaigned on Bluesky</a> and it was to her credit!</p>

<p>I bring this up because I think different social networks might ‚Äúfit‚Äù better for some than others. I‚Äôve seen Bluesky described as having ‚Äú<a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/bluesky-s-the-new-twitter-probably#:~:text=that%20Bluesky%20had%20%E2%80%9C-,theater%20kid%20energy,-.%E2%80%9D%20%28He%E2%80%99s%20not%20exactly">theater kid energy</a>‚Äù, which, heck, I‚Äôm here for! Others have said Mastodon has a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-replacing-twitter-with-bluesky-threads-and-mastodon-heres-what-i-found/#:~:text=joining%20a%20Mastodon%20server%20feels%20a%20lot%20like%20joining%20a%20homeowner%27s%20association">homeowner‚Äôs association</a>‚Äù vibe. I haven‚Äôt personally felt that, but I recognise that the content warnings and block lists can give that impression.</p>

<h3 id="maybe-bluesky-has-won">Maybe Bluesky has ‚Äúwon‚Äù</h3>

<p>I don‚Äôt know what the social media landscape will look like in 6 months, but I‚Äôd bet things will change. If Bluesky comes out as a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù and more posting happens there, I think I‚Äôm generally fine with that. At least for now.</p>

<p>The whole Twitter mess has taught me not to attach myself too closely with these things anymore. I hung on far too long to Twitter while it made me feel terrible. My goal going forward is to post more to my own site and aggregate to any social channel I currently care about. I‚Äôm happy to interact on any that I‚Äôm a part of, but I‚Äôm also going to be much quicker to pull the ripcord if things start going down hill.</p>

But real scaling isn‚Äôt about handling hypothetical millions of users - it‚Äôs about systematically eliminating bottlenecks as you grow. Here‚Äôs how to do it right, based on patterns that work in production.</p>
<p>Django is the framework of choice for many of the largest web applications (e.g. Instagram, Pinterest, etc.). But it‚Äôs not hard to get bogged down by common pitfalls.</p>

<li>File I/O</li>
<li>Network latency</li>

<h2 id="the-scaling-checklist">The Scaling Checklist</h2>
<p>Before adding complexity, verify you‚Äôve done these:</p>
<p>‚ñ° Optimized database queries (select_related, prefetch_related)</p>
<p>‚ñ° Added proper database indexes</p>
<p>‚ñ° Implemented view and template caching</p>
<p>‚ñ° Moved static/media files to CDN</p>
<p>‚ñ° Set up monitoring and alerting</p>
<p>‚ñ° Configured connection pooling</p>
<p>‚ñ° Implemented background tasks for heavy operations</p>
<p>‚ñ° Added read replicas for heavy read loads</p>
<p>‚ñ° Set up proper logging and error tracking</p>
<p>Remember: Django can handle more load than most people think when properly optimized. Start simple, measure everything, and scale what actually needs scaling.</p>
<p>The best scaling strategy isn‚Äôt adding more resources - it‚Äôs eliminating waste in your existing ones.</p> <a href="https://slimsaas.com/">

<p><strong>Freezing Solid</strong></p>
<p>The most remarkable thing about wood frogs happens not in the summer when they transform from tadpoles to frogs, but in the winter when they hibernate.</p>
<p>The northern forests of Alaska and Canada have some of the most dramatic temperature ranges in the world. Summer days stretch to 24 hours and temperatures can climb into the 90‚Äôs. Winter brings some of the earth‚Äôs coldest temperatures: it is not unusual to have temperatures of minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Prospect Creek, just south of the Brooks Range, had the coldest temperature ever recorded in Alaska‚Äîminus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Almost certainly, there were hibernating wood frogs near Prospect Creek when that record was set.</p>
<p>This is the winter world in which the wood frog must survive. Remember, frogs are cold blooded, so their body temperature is about the same as the surrounding air. How do these delicate little creatures endure the intense, protracted, iron-cold subarctic winter?</p>
<p>This mystery has intrigued scientists for a long time. Biologists have studied wood frog hibernation and what they‚Äôve learned is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Most frogs survive northern winters by hibernating deep under water, in ponds, lakes and streams‚Äîthey are cold and dormant but their body temperature never falls below freezing.</p>
<p>Wood frogs have a different strategy. They hibernate by nestling down into the leafy litter on the forest floor. The leaves, duff and overlying snow give some insulation from extreme cold, but the frogs are not protected from subfreezing temperatures as they would be if they chose the underwater strategy.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008228">
<p>Researchers have found that wood frogs spend the winter frozen! This amazing strategy allows wood frogs to become active very early in spring, because the land thaws and warms more quickly than the ice-covered lakes The newly active frogs can mate and lay eggs in small ponds and even in melt water pools that dry up by midsummer. By contrast, frogs that hibernate underwater take longer to become active, so they must breed later. These frogs need permanent water that won‚Äôt dry out.</p>
<p>For most other animals, survival depends on protecting themselves from any condition that could freeze their flesh. Why is freezing so dangerous? Several things can happen: If ice crystals form inside an animal they can puncture blood vessels. When blood freezes, there is no mechanism to deliver oxygen and nutrients to organs, so extreme metabolic damage occurs. And ice severely injures cells by drawing out water and causing dehydration, scrambling the interior structure of cells and fracturing the cell walls. The result is pervasive and deadly internal damage.</p>

<p>Yet wood frogs have evolved ways to freeze solid for up to eight months each year. They‚Äôve accomplished what would seem to be a biological miracle. How do they pull this off?</p>
<p>At the beginning of winter, ice quickly fills the wood frog‚Äôs abdominal cavity and encases the internal organs. Ice crystals form between layers of skin and muscle. The eyes turn white because the lens freezes.</p>
<p>At the same time, the wood frog‚Äôs liver produces large amounts of glucose that flushes into every cell in its body. This syrupy sugar solution prevents the cells from freezing and binds the water molecules inside the cells to prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, the wood frog‚Äôs body allows ice to form around the <em>outsides</em> of cells and organs; and on the other hand, it prevents ice from forming <em>inside</em> the cells--thus avoiding the lethal damage suffered by most animals when they freeze.</p>
<p>What does a hibernating wood frog look like? There is no muscle movement. No heartbeat. No breathing. For the entire winter, the wood frog is like a lump of hard, frigid, icy stone carved in the shape of a frog. But it‚Äôs alive, in a state of suspended animation.</p>
<p>In spring, the wood frog thaws from the inside outward. First the heart starts beating. Then the brain activates. Finally, the legs move.</p>
<p>Nobody yet understands what starts the wood frog‚Äôs heart after being frozen and inert for the entire northern winter. Once the frog is fully thawed, it heads off through the woods to find a breeding pond or other suitable water.</p>
<p>The wood frog is completely undamaged by conditions that would be fatal to nearly all other animals.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008244">
<p><span color="#000000"><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong>Wood Frogs and Humans</strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></p>
<p>Glucose in the wood frog's blood keeps it from freezing during the extreme arctic winter temperatures. This is the same as the blood sugar in all vertebrate animals, including humans.</p>
<p>Hibernating wood frogs can tolerate blood sugar levels 100 times higher than normal without the damage suffered by human diabetics when their blood sugar is only 2 to 10 times above normal. Understanding how frogs can do this might provide valuable knowledge to help in the management of high blood sugar in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Also, the wood frog's ability to withstand freezing may help researchers discover how human organs used for transplants could be frozen and thawed without damage. This would increase the allowable time between removing an organ from a donor and implanting it within the recipient, which could make many more transplants possible.</p>
<p>Researchers are also interested in how the wood frog's body can stop blood circulation and start it again many months later without blood clots or other injuries. Understanding the mechanism which allows this could be valuable for treating people after their blood flow is temporarily halted by heart attack or stroke.</p>

<p dir="auto">Scooter is an interactive find-and-replace terminal UI app.</p>
<p dir="auto">Search with either a fixed string or a regular expression, enter a replacement, and interactively toggle which instances you want to replace. You can also specify a regex pattern for the file paths you want to search.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the instance you're attempting to replace has changed since the search was performed, e.g. if you've switched branches and that line no longer exists, that particular replacement won't occur: you'll see all such cases at the end.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/thomasschafer/scooter/blob/main/media/preview.gif"><img src="https://github.com/thomasschafer/scooter/raw/main/media/preview.gif" alt="Scooter preview" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Scooter respects both <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.ignore</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can add capture groups to the search regex and use them in the replacement string: for instance, if you use <code>(\d) - (\w+)</code> for the search text and <code>($2) "$1"</code> as the replacement, then <code>9 - foo</code> would be replaced with <code>(foo) "9"</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id1">Overview</a></h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">pex is a library for generating .pex (Python EXecutable) files which are
executable Python environments in the spirit of <a href="http://virtualenv.org/" rel="nofollow">virtualenvs</a>.
pex is an expansion upon the ideas outlined in
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0441/" rel="nofollow">PEP 441</a>
and makes the deployment of Python applications as simple as <code>cp</code>.  pex files may even
include multiple platform-specific Python distributions, meaning that a single pex file
can be portable across Linux and OS X.</p>
<p dir="auto">pex files can be built using the <code>pex</code> tool.  Build systems such as <a href="http://pantsbuild.org/" rel="nofollow">Pants</a>, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/buck/" rel="nofollow">Buck</a>, and  <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/pygradle">{py}gradle</a>  also
support building .pex files directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Still unsure about what pex does or how it works?  Watch this quick lightning
talk: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmpnGhRwsu0" rel="nofollow">WTF is PEX?</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">pex is licensed under the Apache2 license.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id2">Installation</a></h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To install pex, simply</p>

<p dir="auto">You can also build pex in a git clone using tox:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ tox -e package
$ cp dist/pex ~/bin"><pre>$ tox -e package
$ cp dist/pex <span>~</span>/bin</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This builds a pex binary in <code>dist/pex</code> that can be copied onto your <code>$PATH</code>.
The advantage to this approach is that it keeps your Python environment as empty as
possible and is more in-line with what pex does philosophically.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id3">Simple Examples</a></h2><a id="user-content-simple-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Simple Examples" href="#simple-examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Launch an interpreter with <code>requests</code>, <code>flask</code> and <code>psutil</code> in the environment:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pex requests flask 'psutil>2,<3'"><pre>$ pex requests flask <span><span>'</span>psutil&gt;2,&lt;3<span>'</span></span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Or instead freeze your current virtualenv via requirements.txt and execute it anywhere:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pex $(pip freeze) -o my_virtualenv.pex
$ deactivate
$ ./my_virtualenv.pex"><pre>$ pex <span><span>$(</span>pip freeze<span>)</span></span> -o my_virtualenv.pex

<p dir="auto">Run webserver.py in an environment containing <code>flask</code> as a quick way to experiment:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pex flask -- webserver.py"><pre>$ pex flask -- webserver.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Launch Sphinx in an ephemeral pex environment using the Sphinx entry point <code>sphinx:main</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Projects specifying a <code>console_scripts</code> entry point in their configuration
can build standalone executables for those entry points.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build a standalone <code>pex-tools-executable.pex</code> binary that runs the

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pex &quot;pex>=2.1.35&quot; --console-script pex-tools --output-file pex-tools-executable.pex"><pre>$ pex <span><span>"</span>pex&gt;=2.1.35<span>"</span></span> --console-script pex-tools --output-file pex-tools-executable.pex</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">You can also build pex files that use a specific interpreter type:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ pex &quot;pex>=2.1.35&quot; -c pex-tools --python=pypy -o pex-tools-pypy-executable.pex"><pre>$ pex <span><span>"</span>pex&gt;=2.1.35<span>"</span></span> -c pex-tools --python=pypy -o pex-tools-pypy-executable.pex</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Most pex options compose well with one another, so the above commands can be
mixed and matched, and equivalent short options are available.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a full list of options, just type <code>pex --help</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you use tox (and you should!), a simple way to integrate pex into your
workflow is to add a packaging test environment to your <code>tox.ini</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[testenv:package]
deps = pex
commands = pex . -o dist/app.pex"><pre><span>[testenv:package]</span>
<span>deps</span> = pex
<span>commands</span> = pex . -o dist/app.pex</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then <code>tox -e package</code> will produce a relocatable copy of your application
that you can copy to staging or production environments.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id10">Development</a></h2><a id="user-content-development" aria-label="Permalink: Development" href="#development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pex uses <a href="https://tox.wiki/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">tox</a> for test and development automation. To run
the test suite, just invoke tox:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you don't have tox, you can generate a pex of tox:</p>
<pre>$ pex tox -c tox -o ~/bin/tox
</pre>
<p dir="auto">Tox provides many useful commands and options, explained at <a href="https://tox.wiki/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">https://tox.wiki/en/latest/</a> .
Below, we provide some of the most commonly used commands used when working on Pex, but the
docs are worth acquainting yourself with to better understand how Tox works and how to do more
advanced commands.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run a specific environment, identify the name of the environment you'd like to invoke by
running <code>tox --listenvs-all</code>, then invoke like this:</p>
<pre>$ tox -e fmt
</pre>
<p dir="auto">To run MyPy:</p>
<pre>$ tox -e check
</pre>
<p dir="auto">All of our tox test environments allow passthrough arguments, which can be helpful to run
specific tests:</p>
<pre>$ tox -e py37-integration -- -k test_reproducible_build
</pre>
<p dir="auto">To run Pex from source, rather than through what is on your PATH, invoke via Python:</p>
<pre>$ python -m pex
</pre>

    <p>Let‚Äôs talk about tech interviews ‚Äì specifically, the ones that go overboard with unrealistic coding assignments. If you‚Äôre a developer who‚Äôs been asked to debug legacy PHP or build a mini-app from scratch in just a few hours, you know what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs becoming a trend, and it‚Äôs not helping anyone.</p>
<h2 id="unrealistic-tests-that-dont-measure-real-skills">Unrealistic Tests That Don‚Äôt Measure Real Skills</h2><p>These high-stress, solo coding assignments don‚Äôt reflect the actual job. Instead, they put developers in situations they‚Äôd never face in the workplace, where collaboration and support are standard. When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team? Yet companies claim this somehow measures ‚Äúproblem-solving‚Äù skills.</p>
<p>What companies often ignore is the extra time candidates invest beyond the ‚Äúsuggested time‚Äù for these tests. Developers don‚Äôt just jump into an assignment; they research the company, study the job requirements, and meticulously work to polish the project. A ‚Äú4-hour‚Äù assignment can quickly turn into 8, 10, or even more, just to ensure it‚Äôs in great shape. For developers balancing jobs and life, this can feel like working unpaid shifts for a job they don‚Äôt even have yet.</p>
<h2 id="the-flexibility-myth">The Flexibility Myth</h2><p>Many companies justify these tests by saying they need ‚Äúadaptable‚Äù developers, even if the tech stack has nothing to do with the role. This is like asking a Ruby developer to debug PHP as a test of flexibility. Sure, adaptability is important, but that doesn‚Äôt mean a candidate‚Äôs worth should be based on their ability to tackle obscure, unrelated challenges.</p>
<h2 id="are-companies-testing-candidates-or-just-flexing">Are Companies Testing Candidates or Just Flexing?</h2><p>For some companies, these tests feel like a way to show off how ‚Äúelite‚Äù their standards are rather than truly evaluating fit. There‚Äôs an inflated ‚Äútop 1%‚Äù mentality where every hire has to jump through hoops, even if those hoops don‚Äôt make sense. This turns away skilled candidates who could do the job well but don‚Äôt thrive in these artificial, high-pressure situations.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-reality-check">Time for a Reality Check</h2><p>It‚Äôs time for companies to admit these interview practices are broken. If the job requires specific tech skills, test those skills. But don‚Äôt put candidates through unrealistic coding boot camps that don‚Äôt reflect the role‚Äôs actual needs.</p>
<p>Hiring processes should focus on problem-solving, collaboration, and growth in relevant areas. Unrealistic expectations don‚Äôt attract the best talent ‚Äì they just exhaust and discourage it. If companies want adaptable developers, they should focus on the long-term ability to learn, not how fast someone can tackle an arbitrary test. Dropping these absurd assignments and focusing on what really counts could foster a better, more inclusive tech culture.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Some Norwegian fishermen off the coast of Troms√∏ were out and about on their vessel named √òygutt looking for halibut. Something significantly larger than fish, however, found its way into their trawl net. The fishermen <a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/norwegian-fishermen-snagged-us-nuclearpowered-submarine/420357?ICID=ref_fark">caught the USS Virginia</a>, a 115-meter-long nuclear-powered attack submarine outfitted with cruise missiles.</p>





<p>The ship‚Äôs crew, made up entirely of young men in their 20s, had no idea that the USS Virginia had been dragging its net for two nautical miles before its crew realized what was going on and cut it loose. </p>

<p>The USS Virginia, a US naval ship, was sailing near the surface when its propeller snagged a part of the fishing net. The fishermen were unaware of it until they were contacted by the US Coast Guard. They were on the way to a new spot hoping to catch more halibut, all the while blissfully ignorant to the fact that their net was now being dragged away by the setting for several excellent ‚Äô90s military thrillers.</p>







<p>The US Embassy in Oslo later confirmed the incident and that the submarine was operating in the area. The U.S. Navy uses the waters around Norway as a hub for resupply and crew changes in NATO‚Äôs ongoing surveillance of Russian naval activities. </p>



<p>Russian subs are regularly deployed from the Kola Peninsula in the northern Atlantic in the United States and NATO has a vested interest in understanding what the Russkies are up to with their super silent modern submarines. Hopefully, all these wargames can keep the fishermen out of it ‚Äî which is apparently rather difficult.</p>



<p>You see, this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened. A quick Google search brought up an article archived by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/world/soviet-submarine-is-trapped-by-norwegian-fishing-wire.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>, seemingly originally published by UPI, titled ‚ÄúSoviet Submarine Is Trapped By Norwegian Fishing Wire.‚Äù The article dates back to June 20, 1984.</p>







<p>The short blurb tells the story of a Soviet sub trapped in the fishing wire of a Norwegian trawler for 3 ¬Ω hours. The lesson here is that as long as the US and Russia are butting heads, Norwegian fishing boats will always get caught in the middle. Keep your Cold War the hell away from innocent Norwegian fishermen!</p>

Two days later, the Belgium government refused the German demands with the backing of the British government which guaranteed military support. The German government responded by declaring war on August 4th and on the same day, the Imperial German Army crossed the border into Belgium.</p><p>By August 19th about 15,000 troops ‚Äî including infantry, artillery and cavalry ‚Äî descended upon the university town of Louvain (or ‚ÄúLeuven‚Äù) in Central Belgium. Despite not encountering any resistance from the population, due to a perceived counter-attack, German troops soon began a massacre of murder, pillaging, arson and other war crimes towards the town‚Äôs civilian population. Over the course of five days 248 civilians were killed, most of the town‚Äôs remaining 10,000 residents exiled, 1,500 deported and some 2,000 homes, including about 1/6th of the town‚Äôs structures destroyed. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" width="1456" height="1057" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1057,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2777122,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Ruins of the university library at Louvain (Photo: Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Among the buildings lost during the atrocities was the Central Hall and University Library of the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven.

Yet we are bound to point out that a very different view of war, and of national aggrandizement based on the threat of war, has been advocated by such influential writers as Nietzsche, von Treitschke, von B√ºlow, and von Bernhardi, and has received widespread support from the press and from public opinion in Germany. This has not occurred, and in our judgment would scarcely be possible, in any other civilized country.

Another name that was notably absent was prominent mathematician </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Hilbert" rel="">David Hilbert</a><span> (1862-1943), who distrusted Fulda‚Äôs motives and refused to sign.

Among those who later claimed not to know what they were signing were Planck, Fischer and Klein (Wolff, 2003). Planck, for instance, had been traveling and without knowing the formulation of the text authorized his children to sign it on his behalf. Astronomer Wilhelm J.

The translated text is available in its entirety below:</span></p><pre><code><strong>Proclamation</strong><span>
Because of the war, the relations of physical scientists to enemy countries will undergo revision. This will effect our relationship with England particularly in view of the hostile declaration drafted by English scholars without any understanding of the German mind and signed by eight well-known English physicists (Bragg, Crookes, Fleming, Lamb, Lodge, Ramsay, Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson).

Two lines of the signatures are missing now! It has been demonstrated by their action that the long-standing efforts to reach a better mutual understanding with the English have failed and cannot be resumed in the foreseeable future. The steps we have taken in the interest of a rapprochement between the scientific communities of both peoples are no longer justified. Thus, we must eliminate the unjustified English influence on German physics.

Naturally, this does not mean a rejection of English scientific ideas and suggestions. But the frequently criticized ‚ÄúAusl√§nderei‚Äù of the Germans has become so evident in our science that it appears necessary to draw attention to it. 

On this basis we limit ourselves for now to propose that all physicists observe the following rules:

1. In citing the literature, the English should no longer receive greater consideration than our countrymen, as has happened often in the past;

2. German physicists should no longer publish in English journals, except to respond;

3. Publishers should only accept scientific works written in German and
translations only if, in the opinion of experts, the translated works are particularly important contributions to the literature;

4. Government money is not to be used for translations.

<p dir="auto">Normally Seer will just show the source code as tabs in the Code Manager. The program's assembly can also be show as a tab.</p>
<p dir="auto">Select "View-&gt;Assembly View" and an extra tab will be shown alongside the source code tabs that shows the current assembly being executed. Here is an example.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/epasveer/seer/blob/main/images/mainview_assemby.png"><img src="https://github.com/epasveer/seer/raw/main/images/mainview_assemby.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Like the source code tabs, breakpoints can be set in the assembly tab. The current instruction is highlighted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Double-clicking on entries in the "Breakpoints" tab and the "Stack frames" tab will show the assembly for those addresses.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are "Nexti" and "Stepi" hot-keys, as defined by your config settings. Normally "Ctrl+F5" and "CTRL+F6".
Using "^F" in the assembly tab will show a powerful search bar.</p>
