<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ratatui</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui</a> is a crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces in Rust. It is a lightweight
library that provides a set of widgets and utilities to build complex Rust TUIs. Ratatui was
forked from the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tui" rel="nofollow">tui-rs</a> crate in 2023 in order to continue its development.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Add <code>ratatui</code> and <code>crossterm</code> as dependencies to your cargo.toml:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo add ratatui crossterm"><pre>cargo add ratatui crossterm</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Ratatui uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm" rel="nofollow">Crossterm</a> by default as it works on most platforms. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/installation/" rel="nofollow">Installation</a>
section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for more details on how to use other backends (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/termion" rel="nofollow">Termion</a> /
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/termwiz" rel="nofollow">Termwiz</a>).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Ratatui is based on the principle of immediate rendering with intermediate buffers. This means
that for each frame, your app must render all widgets that are supposed to be part of the UI.
This is in contrast to the retained mode style of rendering where widgets are updated and then
automatically redrawn on the next frame. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/rendering/" rel="nofollow">Rendering</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for
more info.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart</h2>
<p dir="auto">The following example demonstrates the minimal amount of code necessary to setup a terminal and
render "Hello World!". The full code for this example which contains a little more detail is in
<a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/hello_world.rs">hello_world.rs</a>. For more guidance on different ways to structure your application see the
<a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/application-patterns/" rel="nofollow">Application Patterns</a> and <a href="https://ratatui.rs/tutorials/hello-world/" rel="nofollow">Hello World tutorial</a> sections in the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> and the various
<a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/tree/main/examples">Examples</a>. There are also several starter templates available:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui-template">ratatui-template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ratatui-org.github.io/ratatui-async-template" rel="nofollow">ratatui-async-template</a> (book and template)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Every application built with <code>ratatui</code> needs to implement the following steps:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Initialize the terminal</li>
<li>A main loop to:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Handle input events</li>
<li>Draw the UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restore the terminal state</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The library contains a [<code>prelude</code>] module that re-exports the most commonly used traits and
types for convenience. Most examples in the documentation will use this instead of showing the
full path of each type.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Initialize and restore the terminal</h3>
<p dir="auto">The [<code>Terminal</code>] type is the main entry point for any Ratatui application. It is a light
abstraction over a choice of <code>Backend</code> implementations that provides functionality to draw
each frame, clear the screen, hide the cursor, etc. It is parametrized over any type that
implements the <code>Backend</code> trait which has implementations for <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm" rel="nofollow">Crossterm</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/termion" rel="nofollow">Termion</a> and
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/termwiz" rel="nofollow">Termwiz</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most applications should enter the Alternate Screen when starting and leave it when exiting and
also enable raw mode to disable line buffering and enable reading key events. See the <a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/backend"><code>backend</code>
module</a> and the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/backends/" rel="nofollow">Backends</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Drawing the UI</h3>
<p dir="auto">The drawing logic is delegated to a closure that takes a <code>Frame</code> instance as argument. The
<code>Frame</code> provides the size of the area to draw to and allows the app to render any <code>Widget</code>
using the provided <code>render_widget</code> method. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/how-to/widgets/" rel="nofollow">Widgets</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for
more info.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Handling events</h3>
<p dir="auto">Ratatui does not include any input handling. Instead event handling can be implemented by
calling backend library methods directly. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/event-handling/" rel="nofollow">Handling Events</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui
Website</a> for more info. For example, if you are using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm" rel="nofollow">Crossterm</a>, you can use the
<a href="https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/index.html" rel="nofollow"><code>crossterm::event</code></a> module to handle events.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Layout</h2>
<p dir="auto">The library comes with a basic yet useful layout management object called <code>Layout</code> which
allows you to split the available space into multiple areas and then render widgets in each
area. This lets you describe a responsive terminal UI by nesting layouts. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/how-to/layout/" rel="nofollow">Layout</a>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Text and styling</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>Text</code>, <code>Line</code> and <code>Span</code> types are the building blocks of the library and are used in
many places. <code>Text</code> is a list of <code>Line</code>s and a <code>Line</code> is a list of <code>Span</code>s. A <code>Span</code>
is a string with a specific style.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/style"><code>style</code> module</a> provides types that represent the various styling options. The most
important one is <code>Style</code> which represents the foreground and background colors and the text
attributes of a <code>Span</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/style"><code>style</code> module</a> also provides a <code>Stylize</code> trait that allows
short-hand syntax to apply a style to widgets and text. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/how-to/render/style-text/" rel="nofollow">Styling Text</a> section of the

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mvp-content-main"><p>In a significant development for the European artificial intelligence sector, Paris-based startup <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a> has achieved a noteworthy milestone. The company has successfully secured a substantial investment of €450 million, propelling its valuation to an impressive $2 billion. This funding round marks a pivotal moment, not only for Mistral AI but also for the burgeoning European AI landscape, signifying the region's increasing prominence in the global AI arena.</p><p>Leading the charge in this investment round is Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent name in the venture capital world, demonstrating a strong vote of confidence in Mistral AI's potential. Joining the fray are tech giants Nvidia Corp and Salesforce, contributing an additional €120 million in convertible debt. This diverse array of investors, encompassing both traditional venture capital and major tech corporations, underscores the wide-ranging appeal and potential of Mistral AI's technology and vision.</p><p>This influx of capital is a testament to Mistral AI's innovative approach and its perceived potential to disrupt the AI industry. With this substantial financial backing, Mistral AI is poised to advance its research and development, expand its reach, and further cement its position as a leading player in the AI domain. The scale of this investment round also reflects the growing recognition of the strategic importance of AI technologies and the increasing competition to lead in this transformative field.</p><h2><strong>Technological Advancements and Market Impact</strong></h2><p>Mistral AI stands at the forefront of innovation with its flagship product, Mistral 7B, a large language model (LLM) renowned for its efficiency and advanced capabilities. Released under the open-source Apache 2.0 license, Mistral 7B represents a significant leap in AI technology, characterized by its customized training, tuning, and data processing methods.</p><p>What sets Mistral 7B apart is its ability to compress knowledge and facilitate deep reasoning capacities, even with fewer parameters compared to other models in the market. This optimized approach not only enhances the model's performance but also contributes to sustainability by reducing training time, costs, and environmental impact.</p><p>The successful deployment of Mistral 7B has positioned Mistral AI as a key player in the AI market and a competitor to OpenAI. Its impact extends across various industries, offering potential transformations in fields such as healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing. The company's ability to provide high-performance, scalable solutions is poised to impact how these sectors leverage AI for innovation and efficiency.</p><h2><strong>European AI Landscape and Competitive Edge</strong></h2><p>Mistral AI's recent funding round is a clear indicator of Europe's rapidly growing stature in the global AI landscape. Historically, European ventures in AI have lagged behind their counterparts in the US and Asia in terms of investment and innovation. However, Mistral AI's success, alongside other significant investments, marks a decisive shift, showcasing Europe's rising potential and commitment to AI innovation.</p><p>In the competitive arena of generative AI, Mistral AI distinguishes itself with its open-source approach and focus on creating scalable and efficient models. This strategy sets it apart from established giants such as OpenAI, Google AI, and DeepMind, offering a unique value proposition to the market. By prioritizing accessibility and efficiency, Mistral AI not only contributes to the democratization of AI technology but also positions itself as a formidable competitor in the global AI race.</p><p>The trajectory of Mistral AI and the burgeoning European AI sector signals a vibrant and dynamic future for AI development. With substantial investments pouring into European AI startups, the region is rapidly catching up and carving out its niche in the highly competitive and ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Romero announced on December 8, 2022, that he would stream the building of a SIGIL II level on December 10, 2022—Doom's 29th release anniversary—at 5:00 PM Eastern time on Twitch.<sup id="cite_ref-dec8tweet_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-dec8tweet-6">[6]</a></sup> He also noted at this time that the episode will again consist of nine levels, and that it will be for Doom rather than Doom II (earlier use of the term <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Megawad" title="Megawad">megawad</a> made this somewhat unclear).
</p><p>A previously released level, "<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/One_Humanity" title="One Humanity">One Humanity</a>," was released as a standalone WAD for charity on March 2, 2022. However that level was for Doom II, and Romero has since reassigned it to the "Hellion" project for Doom II.<sup id="cite_ref-pagbtweet_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-pagbtweet-7">[7]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Bees help pollinate over a third of the world’s crops, contributing <a href="https://www.ipbes.net/article/press-release-pollinators-vital-our-food-supply-under-threat">an estimated US$235 billion to $577 billion</a> in value to global agriculture. They also face a myriad of stresses, including pathogens and parasites, loss of suitable food sources and habitat, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-air-pollution-is-making-life-tougher-for-bugs-213122">air pollution</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/bees-face-many-challenges-and-climate-change-is-ratcheting-up-the-pressure-190296">climate-driven weather extremes</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46948-6">recent study</a> has identified another important but understudied pressure on bees: “inert” ingredients in pesticides. </p>

<p>All pesticide products in the U.S. contain <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">active and inert ingredients</a>. Active ingredients are designed to kill or control a specific insect, weed or fungus and are listed on product labels. All other ingredients – emulsifiers, solvents, carriers, aerosol propellants, fragrances, dyes and such – are considered inert.</p>

<p>The new study exposed honeybees to two treatments: the isolated active ingredients in the fungicide <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/007969-00199-20221130.pdf">Pristine</a>, which is used to control <a href="https://agriculture.basf.us/content/dam/cxm/agriculture/crop-protection/products/documents/BASF_Pristine_Almonds_TIB_medres.pdf">fungal diseases in almonds</a> and <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/007969-00199-20221130.pdf">other crops</a>, and the whole Pristine formulation, including inert ingredients. The results were quite surprising: The whole formulation impaired honeybees’ memory, while the active ingredients alone did not. </p>

<p>This suggests that the inert ingredients in the formula were actually what made Pristine toxic to bees – either because the inerts were toxic on their own or because combining them with the active ingredients made the active ingredients more toxic. As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B1qAtjIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">social scientist focusing on bee declines</a>, I believe that either way, these findings have important implications for pesticide regulation and bee health. </p>

<h2>What are inert ingredients?</h2>

<p>Inert ingredients have a variety of functions. They may extend a pesticide’s shelf life, reduce risks for people who apply the pesticides or help a pesticide work better. Some inerts, called adjuvants, help pesticides stick to plant surfaces, reduce pesticide drift or help active ingredients better penetrate a plant’s surface. </p>

<p>The “inert” label is a colloquial misnomer, though. As <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notes</a>, inerts aren’t necessarily inactive or even nontoxic. In fact, pesticide users <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289%2Fehp.118-a168">sometimes know very little</a> about how inerts function in a pesticide formula. That’s partly because they are regulated very differently than active ingredients. </p>

<h2>Measuring bee effects</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-federal-insecticide-fungicide-and-rodenticide-act">Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act</a>, or FIFRA, the EPA oversees pesticide regulation in the U.S. To register a pesticide product for outdoor use, chemical companies must provide <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-07/documents/guidance-exposure-effects-testing-assessing-risks-bees.pdf">reliable risk assessment data</a> on the active ingredients’ toxicity for bees, including the results of an acute honeybee contact test. </p>

<p>The acute contact test tracks how honeybees react to a pesticide application over a short period of time. It also aims to establish the dose of a pesticide that will kill 50% of a group of honeybees, a value known as the LD50. To determine the LD50, scientists apply the pesticide to bees’ midsections and then observe the bees for 48 to 96 hours for signs of poisoning. </p>



<p>In 2016, the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-07/documents/guidance-exposure-effects-testing-assessing-risks-bees.pdf">expanded its data requirements</a> by requiring an acute honeybee oral toxicity test, in which adult bees are fed a chemical, as well as a 21-day honeybee larval test that tracks larval reaction to an agrochemical from the egg to their emergence as adult bees. </p>

<p>These tests all help the agency determine what potential risk an active ingredient may pose for honeybees, along with other data. Based on the information from these varied tests, pesticides are labeled as nontoxic, moderately toxic or highly toxic. </p>

<h2>A chemical black box</h2>

<p>Despite this rigorous testing, much remains unknown about how safe pesticides are for bees. This is particularly true for pesticides that have sublethal or chronic toxicities – in other words, pesticides that don’t cause immediate death or obvious signs of poisoning but have other significant effects.</p>

<p>This lack of knowledge about sublethal and chronic effects is problematic, because bees can be repeatedly exposed over long time spans to pesticides on floral nectar or pollen, or to pesticide contamination that builds up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009754">in beehives</a>. They even may be exposed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saaa041">through miticides</a> that beekeepers use to control Varroa mites, a <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/tucson-az/carl-hayden-bee-research-center/research/varroa/varroa-overview/">devastating bee parasite</a>.</p>

<p>Complicating the issue, symptoms of sublethal exposure are often more subtle or take longer to become apparent than acute or lethal toxicity. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62487">Symptoms might include</a> abnormal foraging and learning ability, decreased egg laying by the queen, wing deformation, stunted growth or decreased colony survival. The EPA doesn’t always require chemical companies to perform the tests that could detect these symptoms.</p>

<p>Inert ingredients add another level of mystery. While the EPA reviews and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">must approve all inert ingredients</a>, it does not require the same toxicity testing as for active ingredients. </p>

<p>This is because under FIFRA, inert ingredients are protected as trade secrets, or <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">confidential business information</a>. Only the total percentage of inert ingredients is required on the label, often lumped together and described as “other ingredients.”</p>

<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that inerts are not as harmless as the name suggests. For example, exposure to two types of adjuvants – organosilicone and nonionic surfactants – can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040848">impair honeybees’ learning performance</a>. Bees rely on learning and memory functions to gather food and return to the hive, so losing these crucial skills can endanger a colony’s survival. </p>

<p>Inerts can also affect bumblebees. In a 2021 study, exposure to alcohol ethoxylates, a coformulant in the fungicide Amistar, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00919-x">killed 30% of the bees exposed to it</a> and caused a number of sublethal effects.</p>

<p>While some inerts may be nontoxic on their own, it’s hard to predict what will happen when they are combined with active ingredients. Research has shown that when two or more agrochemicals are combined, they can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03787-7">become more toxic for bees</a> than when applied on their own. This is known as <a href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/synergism.html">synergistic toxicity</a>. </p>

<p>Synergism can also occur when inerts are combined with pesticides. Another 2021 study showed that adjuvants that were nontoxic on their own caused <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41348-021-00541-z">increased colony mortality when combined with insecticides</a>. </p>

<h2>A better testing strategy</h2>

<p>Mounting evidence on the toxicity of inerts points to three key changes that could better support bee health and minimize bees’ exposure to potential stressors. </p>

<p>First, environmental risk assessments for pesticides could test the whole pesticide formulation, including inert ingredients, to provide a more complete picture of a pesticide’s toxicity to bees. This is already done <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/pollinator-risk-assessment-guidance">in some cases</a> but could be required for all outdoor uses where bees are at risk of exposure.</p>

<p>Second, inerts could be identified on product labels to enable independent research and risk assessment. </p>

<p>Third, more testing could be required on pesticides’ long-term sublethal effects on bees, such as learning impairment. Such research would be especially relevant for pesticides that are applied to blooming crops or flowers that attract bees.</p>

<p>Researchers and environmental groups have been arguing for changes like these since <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.9374">at least 2006</a>. However, because pesticide regulation is dictated by federal law, changes require congressional action. This would be challenging politically, since it would increase the regulatory burden on the chemical industry. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, rising concerns about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-111847">bumblebee declines</a> and beekeepers’ significant <a href="https://beeinformed.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BIP-2022-23-Loss-Abstract.pdf">annual colony losses</a> make a strong case for a more precautionary approach to pesticide regulation. With a growing world population and <a href="https://theconversation.com/cop28-7-food-and-agriculture-innovations-needed-to-protect-the-climate-and-feed-a-rapidly-growing-world-218414">food supplies under increasing stress</a>, supporting bees’ contribution to agriculture is more important then ever.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Buried beneath the oceans surrounding continents is a naturally occurring frozen form of methane and water. Sometimes dubbed “fire-ice” as you can literally set light to it, marine methane hydrate can melt as the climate warms, uncontrollably releasing methane – a potent greenhouse gas – into the ocean and possibly the atmosphere. </p>

<p>Colleagues and I have just published <a href="https://rdcu.be/dsTTt">research</a> showing more of this methane hydrate is vulnerable to warming than previously thought. This is a worry as that hydrate contains about as much carbon as all of the remaining oil and gas on Earth. </p>

<p>Releasing it from the seabed could cause the oceans to become more acidic and the climate to warm further. This is a dangerous set of circumstances. </p>

<p>The massive venting of methane from similar ancient marine hydrate reservoirs has been linked to some of the severest and most rapid climate changes in the Earth’s history. There is even evidence that the process has started again near the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11528">east coast of the US</a>. </p>

<p>I have worked on hydrates for over a decade, mainly looking at the methane hydrate offshore of Mauritania, West Africa. Recently I have taken 3D seismic data intended to reveal oil and gas and repurposed it to map out the hydrates under the ocean floor. Ultimately, I wanted to work out if climate change is causing methane to bubble to the surface. </p>

<p>3D seismic is the geologist’s equivalent of the doctor’s CT scan. It can cover hundreds of square kilometres, and can reveal hydrates a few kilometres below the seabed. Hydrate is easily identified in these giant surveys because the sound waves created by a source of seismic energy towed by a ship reflect off the bottom of the hydrate layers.  </p>

<h2>Looking for methane using 3D seismic imagery</h2>

<p>As I settled into a new way of life during the first COVID lockdown in early 2020, I reopened the much-studied dataset and started mapping again. I knew there were many examples of hydrate that had thawed as a result of warming since the last glacial period peaked some 20,000 years ago, and I knew we could detect this on the 3D datasets. </p>

<p>But what was the fate of the methane? Did it reach the oceans and atmosphere? Because if it did, this is a major clue that it could happen again.</p>

<p>Around continents, where the oceans are relatively shallow, hydrate is only just cold enough to remain frozen. So it is very vulnerable to any warming, and that is why these areas have been the focus of most scientific investigations. </p>

<p>The good news is that only 3.5% of the world’s hydrate resides in the vulnerable zone, in this precarious state. Most hydrate is instead deemed to be “safe”, buried hundreds of metres below the seabed in deeper waters tens of kilometres further from land.</p>

<p>But frozen methane in the deep ocean may vulnerable after all. In oceans and seas where the water is deeper than around 450 metres to 700 metres are layer upon layer of sediment that contains the hydrate. And some of it is deeply buried and warmed geothermally by the Earth so, despite being hundreds of metres below the seafloor, it is right at the point of instability. </p>

<p>Some layers of sediment are permeable and create a complex underground plumbing for the gas to move through if it’s liberated during climatic warming. Just like holding a football underwater methane gas wants to push upwards because of its buoyancy and burst through the 100s of metres of sediment layers. </p>

<p>Imposed upon this complex geology has been the seven glacials (or ice ages) and interglacials, which warmed and cooled the system repeatedly over the last million years.</p>

<h2>Methane is migrating</h2>

<p>During this first lockdown of 2020 I found spectacular evidence that during warm periods during the last million or so years methane migrated laterally, upwards and landwards toward Africa and leaked in much shallower water. Beneath a layer of up to 80 metres of sediment are 23 giant craters on the ancient seabed, each one kilometre wide and up to 50 metres deep, big enough to be filled with multiple Wembley stadiums. </p>

<p>The seismic imaging provides the tell tale signs of methane immediately below the craters. And similar craters elsewhere form due to prolonged or explosive release of gas at the seabed. </p>

<p>These craters are not located in the vulnerable zone where all the attention has been – they are landward of it at about 330 metres water depth. With the discovery in hand, I gathered an international team of scientists (modellers, physicists, geoscientists) to work out what caused the formation of these remarkable things and when they formed. Our results are now published in <a href="https://rdcu.be/dsTTt">Nature Geoscience</a>.</p>

<p>We believe they formed as a result of repeated warming periods. These periods impacted hydrate in the deep ocean and the released methane migrated up to 40km towards the continent, to be vented beyond the shallowest hydrate deposits. So during a warming world the volume of hydrate that will be vulnerable to leaking methane is more significant than previously thought. </p>

<p>The positive outlook is that there are many natural barriers to this methane. But be warned, we expect that in some places on earth, as we warm the planet, methane from the deep will escape into our oceans.</p>

Instead, “they pass through a kind of digital post office run by the phone’s operating system provider,” typically meaning Apple or Google.&nbsp;</p><p>When a user gets a push notification on their phone, Apple or Google receive a lot of information, including metadata that shows which app received a notification, and which phone and associated Google or Apple account it was to be sent to, Wyden says in his letter. In some cases, unencrypted content like the actual text displayed in the notification may be included too, Wyden adds.</p><p>The letter does not disclose the legal mechanism used by governments to demand this data from Apple or Google. But the court record reviewed by 404 Media does include some specifics around push notification demands. <a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?ref=404media.co"><u>Court Watch</u></a> shared the record with 404 Media. The record is a search warrant application from May 2020 related to the investigation of a person suspected of theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.</p>

<p>In the search warrant application for information associated with a specific Yahoo email account, an FBI Special Agent writes under a section of the record entitled “Background Information Regarding Provider Services” that when a user of a mobile app installs and launches an app, the app will direct the device to obtain a “Push Token.” This is “a unique identifier that allows the provider associated with the application [...] to locate the device on which the application is installed.”</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png" width="1064" height="538" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 1064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png" width="1040" height="422" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 1040w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>Screenshots from the search warrant application.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The court record then points specifically to Apple and Google, adding “After the applicable push notification (e.g., Apple Push Notifications (APN) or Google Cloud Messaging) sends a Push Token to the device, the Token is then sent to the application, which in turn sends the Push Token to the application’s server/provider.” When a company then sends push notifications, it sends both the token itself and what the court record describes as the “payload” associated with the notification, “the substance of what needs to be sent by the application to the device.”</p><p>The Special Agent adds that these Push Tokens are stored on the relevant tech company’s servers, and that these may help identify a specific phone or computer used by the target. Or, as the Special Agent puts it, “Accordingly, the computers of PROVIDER are likely to contain useful information that may help to identify the specific device(s) used by a particular subscriber to access the subscriber’s PROVIDER account via the mobile application.”</p><p>It is not clear if this is boilerplate language that has been included in the search warrant application or whether the agent was specifically seeking this information from Yahoo.</p><p>As Wyden’s letter continues, “as with all of the other information these companies store for or about their users, because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”</p><p>Wyden concludes the letter by saying that Apple and Google should be permitted to “generally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate this surveillance practice,” and to publish aggregate data on the number of demands they have received. When Reuters contacted Apple for comment, the company told the outlet that Wyden’s letter gave them the opening needed to share more details about how governments monitor push notifications.</p><p>“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” Apple told Reuters in a statement. “Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.” Reuters cited a source familiar with the matter who described the foreign governments involved in making the requests as democracies allied to the U.S. government.</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to 404 Media’s request for comment on the legal mechanisms used against push notification-related data. A Google spokesperson told 404 Media in an emailed statement that “We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden. We share the Senator’s commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>The full section of the court record discussing push notifications is included below.</p><blockquote><em>PROVIDER also allows its subscribers to access its various services through an application that can be installed on and accessed via cellular telephones and other mobile devices. This application is associated with the subscriber’s PROVIDER account. In my training and experience, I have learned that when the user of a mobile application installs and launches the application on a device (such as a cellular telephone), the application directs the device in question to obtain a Push Token, a unique identifier that allows the provider associated with the application (such as PROVIDER) to locate the device on which the application is installed. After the applicable push notification (e.g., Apple Push Notifications (APN) or Google Cloud Messaging) sends a Push Token to the device, the Token is then sent to the application, which in turn sends the Push Token to the application’s server/provider. Thereafter, whenever the provider needs to send notifications to the user’s device, it sends both the Push Token and the payload associated with the notification (i.e., the substance of what needs to be sent by the application to the device). To ensure this process works, Push Tokens associated with a subscriber’s account are stored on the provider’s server(s). Accordingly, the computers of PROVIDER are likely to contain useful information that may help to identify the specific device(s) used by a particular subscriber to access the subscriber’s PROVIDER account via the mobile application.</em></blockquote>

</header><p>Created on <span><span>[2023-12-10]</span></span>, last updated <span><span>[2023-12-10]</span></span></p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> the following contains several hyperboles that reflect my
emotions, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt, or not at
all. While I am intentionally expressing criticism, I most sincerely
hope not to offend anyone.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/notes/emacs.html" title="Notes about Emacs (this free software text OS thingy here)">Emacs</a> master branch is broken—for good, it seems. Emacs
maintainers accepted a heavy-handed, harmful change, disregarding
concerns voiced by multiple users and developers. I’ve created a
fixed, and improved, Emacs fork. I’ll be using and developing this
fork, and you’re welcome to join.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a step back. What is the Emacs master branch? That’s
essentially the development version of Emacs, and what will soon
become Emacs version 30. Many Emacs hackers and enthusiasts track the
master branch to enjoy all of the latest developments and
improvements. Thanks to the tireless work of the Emacs maintainers in
scrutinizing incoming patches, the Emacs master branch has been very
stable in recent years. But a few weeks ago, Emacs master users got a
very unpleasant surprise.
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>commit 589e6ae1fb983bfba42f20906773555037246e45</span>
<span>Author: Thierry Volpiatto</span>
<span>Date:   Sun Nov 19 20:42:56 2023 +0100</span>

<span>Improve register-preview (bug#66394)</span>

<span>    A minibuffer is used now instead of read-key.</span>
    ...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This commit crippled all user interaction with Emacs registers,
turning commands such as <code>C-x r s</code>, once smooth and frictionless, into
a cumbersome and painful mess. Concretely, instead of just typing the
key for the register you want to operate on, you now get a fully blown
minibuffer for inserting a single key. This is nonsensical in various
ways, but most staggering is probably the fact that you now need to
confirm your register selection by pressing another <code>RET</code>, effectively
doubling the work you have to do for the simplest task of specifying a
single character.
</p>
<p>
Emacs registers (used to) provide a perfect UX. Silky smooth, really.
But no more, not in GNU Emacs 30. It’s gone, without as much as a
<code>NEWS</code> entry to inform the unwary user about this regression.
</p>
<p>
Surely, it’s not too late to revert one bad change, right? That’s
what I thought, unfortunately the Emacs maintainers seem bent on
dismissing the community’s outcry in an unwarranted and misguided
attempt to save face.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the core problems with this change were brought up already in
the first technical <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/87sf67qqmp.fsf@web.de/">comment</a> regarding this patch proposal, from
Michael Heerdegen:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If your version is accepted, I would vote for an option to get the old
behavior back. Your intended behavior is safer but requires more keys
(at least confirmation with RET). Some people might prefer the old
way.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, duh! If you’re gonna change long standing Emacs behavior, it
better be optional and backward compatible, people have been using
this thing for decades, after all. Hmm apparently, the patch author,
Thierry, doesn’t see it that way:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is only RET as additional key and it is a good thing IMO as it
let the time to user to see what he is doing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This rather arrogant statement, and the approach that underlies it,
led us to where we are today. After some further discussion, <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/notes/eli-zaretskii.html" title="Notes about Eli Zaretskii (Emacs maintainer)">Eli
Zaretskii</a> applied this patch to Emacs master. I’m not sure he
understood the breaking nature of this change when he did that, which
I think might be even more disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Bastien Guerry chimed in, saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I use registers ~100 times a day, so enhancements here are very
welcome, thanks!
</p>
<p>
I wonder about this [change], though. It badly hinders my usual flow,
where I do remember what registers I use and like to store new ones
quickly.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sounds like a clear and honest testimony from an esteemed community
member. But wait, no, Thierry doesn’t think so, he thinks it’s all
for the better and his change is all right. At this point I got
somewhat involved, and seconded Bastien’s request to restore the
previous, perfectly good behavior, at least optionally. Thierry
wasn’t willing to fix this damage, so Eli asked me to help out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So maybe a better way forward is for someone, perhaps you Eshel, to
add whatever is needed to provide optionally the previous behavior?
</p>
<p>
Would you like to work on that?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Easy enough. I crafted and <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/m1wmtvnfpn.fsf@dazzs-mbp.home/">posted</a> a couple of patches that add some
bells and whistles from Thierry’s patch in an optional and compatible
manner. It’s really not that hard to make no harm in this case. But
my work was disregarded just as well, sadly. Thierry didn’t like how
I reverted his change to use the minibuffer for reading a single key,
which is exactly the root cause of the problems I tried to fix—and
in fact I did fix it, just not in Emacs master, but in my new fork.
</p>
<p>
Since then, <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/CA+Nei8MfEw_iDj3Xjbzop+7n-oqNp1jSJcweOgEQMKUkB3mifQ@mail.gmail.com/">another bug report</a> came in from an Emacs master branch
user that suffered from one of the consequences of this change (a
specific regression that I spelled out days before, but was ignored,
for some reason), and several users reached out to the Emacs
development in request to restore the previous behavior in an ongoing
thread titled <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/CAFgA-y2wUR0tGRk+RkUGn2TF2YoMyf3B=+78TGyDZP5+Ew2uyA@mail.gmail.com/">“Please, Restore Previous Behavior for
jump-to-register”</a>. Astonishingly, the maintainers seem insistent
not to budge, and Emacs 30 will thus likely suck.
</p>
<p>
I find the willingness of the Emacs maintainers to entertain this bad
behavior (of both a rouge developer and of Emacs itself) at the
expense of user experience, unacceptable. This demonstrates clear
disrespect for Emacs user preferences, and indeed their freedom.
</p>
<p>
For me, this freedom is the number one reason for using Emacs, so I
obviously won’t use an Emacs that forces on me weird breaking changes.
For that reason I’ve created a new Emacs branch, the “main” branch,
which was born from the master branch before this registers fiasco.
</p>
<p>
If these changes will be reverted before Emacs 30, I’ll surely
consider switching back to building Emacs from the upstream master
branch. But in the meantime, and for the foreseeable future, I’ll be
keeping my main branch up to date by cherry picking (only) good
changes from the master branch. And of course, I also improve it with
developments of my own.
</p>
<p>
If you’re interested, feel free to checkout my main branch from here:
</p>
<div>
<pre>git clone git://git.eshelyaron.com/emacs.git

git clone https://git.sr.ht/~eshel/emacs
</pre>
</div>
<p>
I’ll be happy to coordinate and incorporate other’s work. <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#513c3411342239343d2830233e3f7f323e3c">Let me know</a>
if you have any suggestions, thoughts, or nice harmless patches that I
should try out.

I'm always on the lookout for materials that I can give my team and other developers to help them get better at design. It's not a course, but "The Non-Designer's Design Book" (ISBN 978-0133966152, Robin Williams) is the best material for design fundamentals I've found. It's very approachable for anyone and it's broadly applicable across all kinds of design. Everyone I have convinced to read it has loved it, and I've seen an improvement in output and understanding. I highly recommend this if you have an interest in design.<p>Refactoring UI is also valuable and can be impactful, though it's heavily web focused and is more like a Web Component Design Cookbook rather than foundational knowledge.

I find it funny how people always talk about "technical" founders but never about design founders even though design is often just as useful, if not more useful, especially in the early stages where you can build the best product in the world but if it doesn't look good, nobody will try it.<p>I am also especially bad at design and visual art skills in general. I recognize this and get plenty of feedback around it. So this year I set out to improve to at least try to get to "mediocre" instead of "terrible".</p><p>Refactoring UI and Erik Kennedys blog / class are mentioned and are great resources and I own both.</p><p>I did Dribbble's Figma UI design class which was $600. It's biggest strength is that its a cohort based class, and cohort classes tend to have much higher finishing rates than self-paced classes. Their instructor will review your Figma designs but only if you finish in time so if you want to get your $600 worth you better open up Figma, so I recommend it for that reason. Kennedy's is self-paced and while it's extremely high quality, I haven't even worked through most of it for this reason.</p><p>Of course, the single most important thing you can do is build lots of UIs. If you're like me, your UIs will suck, but if you do it more regularly, you will also notice more UI/UX techniques on other websites. I save all those in a Notion database organized by category and refer to them.</p><p>One last thing I almost never see mentioned but it was a really good piece of advice. I told someone that I was between hiring contractor designers for my project, and trying to improve at design and do it myself. One person told me, it's not mutually exclusive. So you can design an app, and it will probably look bad. Then hire an experienced UI/UX designer off Upwork to do a better job. And pay attention to the decisions they made and the decsions you made and compare the difference. Figma is a great tool these days because it's much more collaborative than just getting a big stack of PNGs or SVGs at the end, you can discuss design choices in Figma comments as the designer works.</p><p>One final thing I really struggle with that is worth noting - professional designers will make several versions and iterations of everything, each screen and each component on that screen. And then pick the best one. The Dribbble instructor said, the best design is almost never the first one. This is time consuming and tedious if you don't love design but it's how you get the best results.</p><p>If you just have a one-off project and don't truly care about improving at design, the simplest option is to hire a contractor. UI/UX is not something you learn in a weekend and then you're good to go, it's more like learning a language or an instrument in that you're either going to invest a lot of time to learn it well or you're going to suck. It's pretty affordable to hire-out because it's mostly up-front work.</p><p>Hiring contractors and spending for classes is the expensive route but spending money can expedite the process. But, there's lots of free resources if you're broke. The single most important thing is design a lot, and pay attention to other people's designs and what they're doing.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ast-grep(sg)</h2>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep(sg) is a CLI tool for code structural search, lint, and rewriting.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep is a AST-based tool to search code by pattern code. Think it as your old-friend <code>grep</code> but it matches AST nodes instead of text.
You can write patterns as if you are writing ordinary code. It will match all code that has the same syntactical structure.
You can use <code>$</code> sign + upper case letters as wildcard, e.g. <code>$MATCH</code>, to match any single AST node. Think it as REGEX dot <code>.</code>, except it is not textual.</p>
<p dir="auto">Try the <a href="https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html" rel="nofollow">online playground</a> for a taste!</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Feature Highlight</h2>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep's core is an algorithm to search and replace code based on abstract syntax tree produced by tree-sitter.
It can help you to do lightweight static analysis and massive scale code manipulation in an intuitive way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Key highlights:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">An intuitive pattern to find and replace AST.
ast-grep's pattern looks like ordinary code you would write every day. (You can call the pattern is isomorphic to code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">jQuery like API for AST traversal and manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">YAML configuration to write new linting rules or code modification.</p>

<p>Stealthy and multifunctional Linux malware that has been infecting telecommunications companies went largely unnoticed for two years until being documented for the first time by researchers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Researchers from security firm Group-IB have named the remote access trojan “Krasue,” after a nocturnal spirit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue">depicted in Southeast Asian folklore </a> “floating in mid-air, with no torso, just her intestines hanging from below her chin.” The researchers chose the name because evidence to date shows it almost exclusively targets victims in Thailand and “poses a severe risk to critical systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant attackers remote access to the targeted network.</p>
<p>According to the researchers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Krasue is a Linux Remote Access Trojan that has been active since 20 and predominantly targets organizations in Thailand.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Group-IB can confirm that telecommunications companies were targeted by Krasue.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The malware contains several embedded rootkits to support different Linux kernel versions.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Krasue’s rootkit is drawn from public sources (3 open-source Linux Kernel Module rootkits), as is the case with many Linux rootkits.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The rootkit can hook the `kill()` syscall, network-related functions, and file listing operations in order to hide its activities and evade detection.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Notably, Krasue uses RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) messages to serve as a disguised “alive ping,” a tactic rarely seen in the wild.</li>
<li aria-level="1">This Linux malware, Group-IB researchers presume, is deployed during the later stages of an attack chain in order to maintain access to a victim host.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Krasue is likely to either be deployed as part of a botnet or sold by initial access brokers to other cybercriminals.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Group-IB researchers believe that Krasue was created by the same author as the XorDdos Linux Trojan, documented by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/19/rise-in-xorddos-a-deeper-look-at-the-stealthy-ddos-malware-targeting-linux-devices/">Microsoft in a March 2022 blog post</a>, or someone who had access to the latter’s source code.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During the initialization phase, the rootkit conceals its own presence. It then proceeds to hook the <b>`kill()`</b> syscall, network-related functions, and file listing operations, thereby obscuring its activities and evading detection.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The researchers have so far been unable to determine precisely how Krasue gets installed. Possible infection vectors include through vulnerability exploitation, credential-stealing or -guessing attacks, or by unwittingly being installed as trojan stashed in an installation file or update masquerading as legitimate software.</p>
<p>The three open source rootkit packages incorporated into Krasue are:</p>
<ul>

<p>Rootkits are a type of malware that hides directories, files, processes, and other evidence of its presence to the operating system it’s installed on. By hooking legitimate Linux processes, the malware is able to suspend them at select points and interject functions that conceal its presence. Specifically, it hides files and directories beginning with the names “auwd” and “vmware_helper” from directory listings and hides ports 52695 and 52699, where communications to attacker-controlled servers occur. Intercepting the kill() syscall also allows the trojan to survive Linux commands attempting to abort the program and shut it down.</p>

          fzf is a popular tool among command line hackers. But if you're an Emacs user, it's hard to use as it requires an interactive terminal. What if you could use Emacs to do the fuzzy finding instead of fzf?

<p>Filtering long lists of output on the command line usually involves taking the list of items – maybe the output of <code>ls</code>, <code>git</code> or <code>find</code> – and doing something with it. If you’re lucky you can mechanically filter the list with pipes and <code>grep</code>. If you’re unlucky and you can’t think of a heuristic, you’ll have to sift through the output with a pager like <code>less</code> and remember the items you want to keep.</p><figure>

<figcaption><code>fzf</code> filtering output from <code>apt-cache search</code> intended for <code>apt-get</code></figcaption>
</figure><p>Typically you do this because you want to cherry pick a subset of the items and feed them into another command, like <code>rm</code>, <code>cat</code> or <code>apt-get</code> as the picture above illustrates.</p><p>But the manual way is tedious and slow. And that’s the problem <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> tries to solve. The premise is simple: you feed it (via stdin) a list of items, and it displays a curses-like window where you can “fuzzy find” and select the items you care about. It’s designed to slot into command substitutions and pipes — like an interactive <code>grep</code>.</p><p>So that got me thinking. There’s no reason why you can’t use Emacs to do this instead of <code>fzf</code>! Emacs has better fuzzy finding and it’s the text editor you’re already using, so why not use Emacs?</p><p>Another reason to ditch <code>fzf</code> is that you might be using <a href="https://masteringemacs.org/article/running-shells-in-emacs-overview">a shell and not a terminal emulator in Emacs</a>. It’s not impossible to run curses apps in <code>shell-mode</code>, but it is harder.</p><h2 id="ezf-emacs-fuzzy-finder">EZF: Emacs Fuzzy Finder</h2><figure>

<figcaption><code>ezf</code> filtering output from <code>apt-cache</code> before passing it back to the shell</figcaption>
</figure><p>So the game plan is simple:</p><dl><dt>Build a shell script</dt><dd><p>This is the shell-facing part that we feed into pipes and command substitution sub-shells.</p><p>It must talk to <code>emacsclient</code>, the client in the Emacs client-server duo. That way it’ll run in your existing Emacs instance and it won’t interrupt your workflow if you also use – as you well should! – Emacs as your shell or terminal emulator.</p></dd><dt>Write some Elisp glue code</dt><dd><p>We’ll need a few functions capable of letting you filter and select the match candidates you like. Luckily this is generally very easy.</p></dd><dt>Return the picked candidates</dt><dd><p>After matching and selecting the candidates we want to keep, we must return them from whence they came. We’ll need to be mindful of annoying bagatelles like proper quoting.</p></dd><dt>Make it easy to extend</dt><dd><p>It should be easy to extend or modify to suit individual tastes.</p><p>We’ll add a few command switches to <code>ezf</code> to highlight how easy it is to pass customizable switches through bash into Emacs.</p></dd></dl><h3 id="sending-to-emacss-standard-input">Sending to Emacs’s standard input</h3><p>Let’s start with the shell script. I’ve done it in <code>bash</code>. There’s a number of little gotchas and workarounds required for this to work well. So the script’s freighted with one or two annoying hacks.</p><p>Chiefly, it’s not possible to ask <code>emacsclient</code> or even <code>emacs</code> to read directly from a file descriptor device. So process substitution with <code>&lt;(ls ...)</code> is out. I don’t know why, as Emacs is absolutely 100% capable of <em>doing</em> it inside Emacs. So I’m chalking it up to oversight.</p><p>That means we have to work around that problem with real files. I’m using <code>mktemp</code> to <code>cat</code> standard input to a temporary file. To avoid clobbering your <code>tmpfs</code> with junk files, there’s a <code>trap</code> to clean up when the script exits.</p><p>Now all we need to do is add a little command argument parsing: I want <code>-c</code> to let us choose the completion tool to invoke in Emacs; and <code>-f</code> is there to pick the field offset to return. The latter is particularly useful if you have a line of text and you want just the first word, for example.</p><p>After that, there’s a little bit of house keeping in case you exit out of the selection process without picking anything. Oh, when you tell <code>emacsclient</code> to evaluate elisp it’ll use <code>prin1</code> to emit the representation of the Lisp object to standard output, and that forces quote symbols around strings, even if we don’t really want that. Sieving the output from Emacs through a pipe to <code>xargs</code> cunningly strips the quotes.</p><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

So I’ve kept things open and made it work with <code>completing-read</code> – well, specifically <code>completing-read-multiple</code> so you can pick multiple items.</p><p>If you’re unsure how that fits into <em>your</em> completion framework, then my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/understanding-minibuffer-completion">understanding Minibuffer Completion</a> is a good place to start. If you want IDO to work with it, you’ll have to tweak the code yourself. Luckily I have <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/find-files-faster-recent-files-package">an example here</a> to get you started.</p><p>I’ve also made it work out of the box with Helm which, as we all know, is awesome. Helm in particular is perfect for this as it comes with great fuzzy matching, multiple selection <em>and</em> it’s easy to add custom actions like returning matches to the shell <em>and</em> opening them as files in Emacs, for example.</p><p>There’s three parts: two completion mechanisms and a generic wrapper that turns lists of candidates into usable output.</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> ezf-default </span>(filename)
  <span>"EZF completion with your default completion system."</span>
  (completing-read-multiple
   <span>"Pick a Candidate: "</span>
   (with-temp-buffer
     (insert-file-contents-literally filename <span>nil</span>)
     (string-lines (buffer-string) <span>t</span>))))</code></pre><p><code>completing-read-multiple</code> takes a prompt and a list of strings. And that’s all you need to get Emacs’s completion system to work. I create a temporary buffer to hold the file contents before it’s split up into lines. If you want NULL-separated output, this is the place to change it.</p><p>If you’re wondering why I’m using a buffer, you should read my article <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/why-emacs-has-buffers">Why Emacs has Buffers</a>.</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> ezf-helm </span>(filename)
  <span>"EZF completion with `helm'."</span>
  <span>;; Uncomment if you want Helm to full screen.</span>
  <span>;; (helm-set-local-variable 'helm-full-frame t)</span>
  (helm :sources
        (helm-build-in-file-source <span>"EZF Completion"</span> filename
          :action (<span>lambda</span> (_) (helm-marked-candidates)))))</code></pre><p>For Helm the solution is similar. I’m using Helm’s ability to build candidates directly from a file. If you want to add more than one action then I recommend you use <code>helm-make-actions</code> to build the alist.</p><p>Now for the generic wrapper. Its job is to take a list of strings you picked from a candidate function and turn it into something the shell can properly read. If you specified <code>-f</code> to <code>ezf</code> then it’ll also split the string and only use the field index you chose.</p><pre><code><span>;; If you start Emacs's server some other way, you can remove this.</span>
(server-start)

(<span>defvar</span><span> ezf-separators </span><span>" "</span>
  <span>"Regexp of separators `ezf' should use to split a line."</span>)

(<span>defun</span><span> ezf </span>(filename &amp;optional field completing-fn)
  <span>"Wrapper that calls COMPLETION-FN with FILENAME.</span>

<span>Optionally split each line of string by `ezf-separators' if FIELD</span>
<span>is non-nil and return FIELD.</span>

<span>If COMPLETING-FN is nil default to `ezf-default'."</span>
  (when-let (candidates (<span>funcall</span> (<span>or</span> completing-fn 'ezf-default) filename))
    (mapconcat (<span>lambda</span> (candidate)
                 (shell-quote-argument
                  (<span>if</span> field
                      (<span>nth</span> (<span>1-</span> field) (split-string candidate ezf-separators <span>t</span> <span>" "</span>))
                    candidate)))
               candidates
               <span>" "</span>)))</code></pre><p>Here the goal is simply to take a <code>filename</code> containing our candidates; an optional <code>completing-fn</code>, as set by passing <code>-c</code> to <code>ezf</code>; and an optional <code>field</code> index.</p><p><code>ezf-separators</code> is a regular expression to split each line by. So if you want NULL-delimited support then you can easily add that and a switch to go along with it.</p><p>Because we’re taking unsanitized candidates and passing them through our completion system, it’s good form to ensure the filtered candidates are properly escaped when we hand them back to the shell. That’s what <code>shell-quote-argument</code> does. <code>mapconcat</code> merely ensures the quoted candidates are space-separated as that’s what shells expect. (And if you want NULL separation you should change this also.)</p><p>Because the last value is by convention the value that is returned from a function in Lisp, we know that the output of <code>emacsclient</code> is the result of the <code>mapconcat</code> form if we selected any matches, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p><p>With all this in place it’s time to test it:</p><figure>

<figcaption>Fuzzy matching dictionary words with Emacs and <code>ezf</code></figcaption>
</figure><p>Yep. Looks good.</p><p>This tool is able to do most of the things you’d use <code>fzf</code> for, and all from within the comfort of your Emacs. It’ll work just fine in Eshell also if you don’t push it too hard. Eshell’s support for pipes and redirection is not as good as regular shells, but with a little bit of work it could be made to work there too, with or without the bash script. And of course you can use it from Terminals also: the ones you run from inside Emacs, and external ones also.</p><h2 id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases</h2><p>Here’s a few examples of how you can use the tool. It goes without saying that it’s a bit threadbare compared to <code>fzf</code>, but I think it’s easy enough to extend to suit your own needs. This is also a great way to get your hands dirty with elisp if you have never done any before.</p><p>I’m going to point out that <code>M-x helm-locate</code> already does this, but you can use GNU <code>locate</code> to track down files matching a regex pattern and then open them in <code>emacsclient</code>:</p><pre><code>$ <span>emacsclient</span> <span>$(</span><span>locate</span> -r <span>'[.]py$'</span> <span>|</span> <span>ezf</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>GNU <code>locate</code> works by querying a database that updates whenever you call <code>updatedb</code>. It’s probably the one of fastest cached file searchers available today. You can have multiple databases with different configurations (one for your home directory and another for the whole file system) to further speed it up. I highly recommend you look into using it if you regularly sweep your file system looking for files.</p><p>Finding and installing packages with <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt-cache</code>:</p><pre><code>$ <span>apt-get</span> install <span>$(</span><span>apt-cache</span> search <span>&lt;</span>term<span>&gt;</span> <span>|</span> <span>ezf</span> -f 1<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Change directories. Try playing around with the arguments to <code>find</code>, or use something simpler like <code>ls</code>:</p><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> <span>$(</span><span>find</span> . -maxdepth 3 -type d <span>|</span> <span>ezf</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>I think this is a pretty good example of how you can combine the power of Emacs and a little bit of gnarly shell script magic. And this is really just the beginning. You can take the shell script and hook it up to all manner of crazy Emacs stuff: <code>M-x dired</code>; sending stuff to a buffer for editing; and more.</p><p>You can also find it on Github here: <a href="https://github.com/mickeynp/ezf">EZF</a>.</p>

I started using Git super early, before GitHub existed. You may not believe me, but Git was the answer to all my prayers. All those previous systems had fundamental architectural flaws that made them a complete nightmare to use on a team for any serious work.</p><p>Git has no such problem. There’s nothing it can’t do. Instead, the only limitation is on the user being able to know how to get Git to do what they want it to do. Thankfully, that’s always solvable with a quick read of the documentation or web search.</p><p>I understand that people might want to make it easier, since the UI is complex, but that’s never going to work. If you abstract away the complexity of the UI, you will necessarily abstract away the power. If you abstract away the power, you are no longer solving all the problems that Git solved. People just don’t realize what problems are being solved because they never lived through those problems with the previous VCSes.</p><p>You know what’s easier than building a new VCS better than Git? You know what’s easier than using a different VCS from the rest of the world? You know what’s easier than designing a miraculous abstraction on top of Git?</p><p>Learning Git.</p><p>Whatever effort you are putting into seeking or building an alternative, instead put that effort towards becoming a Git expert. It will be a lot less effort with a lot more benefit. Trust me on this. It will be well worth it for your career and for your personal computing life as well.

The need for efficient version control systems is a constant and ongoing battle; you can pick the right data structures (for example, Git's issues with large files are more of a data structure problem than one of raw efficiency) but at the end of the day Python will often be behind on raw performance. Rust will hopefully let us embed the Jujutsu libraries inside other languages, something you can only achieve today in Git with something like libgit2. Finally, a lot of the infrastructure we get to use, like nextest and cargo-insta are simply fantastic even if I have my qualms about Cargo.<p>Most of the developers (some of them being former Mercurial and Git developers) including me generally seem to like it. Based on my own experience, I think it's a pretty excellent choice, but I'd be a bit biased as a die-hard Haskell/C programmer for something fast with types.

Git doesn’t exactly enforce them all though so maybe tighter integration would be a reason to change from git if it could not be adapted.

Then (depending on need), let's add multiple repositories on the same single server for the same single user.  Then add multiple servers (including a git remote server).  Then add multiple users ... etc ... of course the magic of git is you can unfold those needs in any sequence.  Often when I find I do not understand something (that I thought I understood), I go back in scope to an earlier unfolding, eliminating other factors.<p>I'm sure git can be improved, but I think the biggest improvement comes from the user being improved with their understanding of the scope of capabilities.  I have yet to see a good tutorial on this (among the plethora of git tutorials out there).  This reminds me of the (excellent) video where the "Harvard Professor Explains Algorithms in 5 Levels of Difficulty" [1]</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIvmfqX-t0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIvmfqX-t0</a></p><p>I would love to see a Channel where that is the entire theme - explaining everything in 5 levels of difficulty.</p><p>All this being said, at each of the "5 levels of difficulty" of git, are there improvements to be made.  I'm sure there are.  It would be good to focus the answer on each of those levels.

Of course the immediate consequence would be that you'd be able to roll back changes to branches but there'd be some more fundamental consequences as well. I'm pretty sure some of the problems with GUI's/wrappers around Git break down because there's no tracking of branches/tags.<p>Besides that it's pretty much endgame in my opinion if you consider only the functionality it's meant to solve. If another "better" VCS would ever become popular I feel it would have to be a drastic change to the way of working with VCS, even more drastic than SVN to Git was. There's some cruft in Git that could probably be taken away, and that would make Git better in a theoretical sense, but in the real world that would never happen (unless we get sideswiped by another industry or platform).

It's just something I've felt was missing from Git. If you're looking at the main branch of a repository, what was the previous version of that branch?<p>The way we work around that missing feature is by tagging commits so we don't forget what revision a release was made at for example. A sequence of release tags basically is a meta branch, a history of the release branch, but managed manually instead of through git.

Codeberg is run by a non-profit and are very much aligned with my ideals. They are also slowly adding nice features like their Woodpecker CI.</p><p>One that is growing in popularity and is a little less "GitHub-y" is SourceHut (which also has Mercurial support).</p><p>The main issue is that GitHub has really cornered the market. They give so much out for free that is difficult for others to compete with and it has become the de-facto place to host your project. This can mean that hosting anywhere other than GitHub will limit discoverability and contributions from people if they don't want to make an account or work out how to deal with whatever forge you are using.</p><p>However one thing that is coming that may help alleviate some of that is forge federation which will allow you to interact with various forges from your "home" forge - which hopefully prevents the need to make an account to make PRs or raise issues.</p><p>Edit: I see your other comment now, what could a better GitHub be that supports a better-than-git VCS. Well there did used to be places to host Darcs projects like the Darcs Hub but I don't know if some of the newers ones like Pijul or Jujutsu have any forge support yet.</p><p>Edit2: Oh it seems Pijul has "The Nest" for hosting.

Git it so flexible, even things that it handles terribly by default, it handles
fine with layers: e.g., large binary files via git-lfs (<a href="https://git-lfs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://git-lfs.com</a>) and merge conflicts in non-textual files by custom merge resolvers like Unity’s (<a href="https://flashg.github.io/GitMerge-for-Unity/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://flashg.github.io/GitMerge-for-Unity/</a>).</p><p>Perhaps in the future, almost everyone will keep using Git at the core, but have so many layers to make it more intuitive and provide better merges, that what they’re using barely resembles Git at all. This flexibility and the fact that nearly everything is designed for Git and integrates with Git, are why I doubt it’s ever going away.</p><p>Some alternatives for thought:</p><p>- pijul (<a href="https://pijul.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pijul.org</a>), a completely different VCS which allegedly has better merges/rebases. In beta, but I rarely hear about it nowadays and have heard more bad than good. I don’t think we can implement this alternate rebases in Git, but maybe we don’t need to; even after reading the website, I don’t understand why pijul’s merges are better, and in particular I can’t think of a concrete example nor does pijul provide one.</p><p>- Unison (<a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.unison-lang.org</a>). This isn’t a VCS, but a language with a radical approach to code representation: instead of code being text stored in files, code is ASTs referenced by hash and stored in essentially a database. Among other advantages, the main one is that you can rename symbols and they will automatically propagate to dependencies, because the symbols are referenced by their hash instead of their name. I believe this automatic renaming will be common in the future, whether it’s implemented by a layer on top of Git or alternate code representation like Unison (to be clear, Unison’s codebases are designed to work with Git, and the Unison project itself is stored in Git repos).</p><p>- SVN, the other widespread VCS. Google or ask ChatGPT “Git vs SVN” and you’ll get answers like this (<a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/svn-vs-git/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/svn-vs-git/</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/875" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/a/875</a>). Basically, SVN is easier to understand and handles large files better, Git is decentralized and more popular. But what about the differences which can’t be resolved by layers, like lazygit for intuition and git-lfs for large files? It seems to me like even companies with centralized private repositories use Git, meaning Git will probably win in the long term, but I don’t work at those companies so I don’t really know.</p><p>- Mercurial and Fossil, the other widespread VCSs. It seems these are more similar to Git and the main differences are in the low-level implementation (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/892688" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/a/892688</a>, <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki#:~:text=Both%20Fossil%20and%20Git%20store,emphasis%20on%20the%20entire%20DAG" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki#...</a>.). It actually seems like most people prefer Mercurial and Fossil over Git and would use them if they had the same popularity, or at least if they had Git’s popularity and Git had Mercury or Fossil’s. But again, these VCSs are so similar that with layers, you can probably create a Git experience which has their advantages and almost copies their UI.

Then the recursive merge of the two branches into each other cannot tell which AB pair in branch 2 the X from branch 1 should be inserted into, because it never sees the first commit of branch 2 which tells you that the "original" AB is the one after the G. `recursive` cannot distinguish between "AXBGAB" and "ABGAXB" as possibilities. A merge algorithm which looks at every commit can know that "ABGAXB" is more faithful to the actual sequence of events, because it knows which AB pair the X was inserted into on branch 1.<p>(Another plausibly correct answer of course would be "AXBGAXB", but again `recursive` doesn't know enough to guess this answer.)

Poor support for sparse/partial checkouts, stateful operations (e.g. git status still scans the whole repo every time on Linux), poor &amp; buggy support for submodules.</p><p>* Conflict resolution. It's about as basic as it can be. E.g. even zdiff3 doesn't give you quite enough information to resolve some conflicts (you want the diff for the change that introduced the conflict). The diff algorithms are all fast but dumb. Patch based VCS systems (Darcs, Pijul) are apparently better here.</p><p>IMO the most interesting projects that are trying to solve any of these (but not all of them sadly) are Jujitsu and Pijul.

Whether <i>I</i> will ever change my VCS, again, ever, that is an entirely different question. I've been through so many of them (RCS; a bit of CVS; a bit of Subversion which promised to be CVS-without-the-flaws, which it was not; Mercurial, because hey it was written in Python, so must be good, right? right?; <i>finally</i> Git; and of course the usual `report-v4-revision-good-one.doc` renaming game; plus a plethora of backup solutions, some really bad ones among them)—so <i>many</i> of them I'd be loathe to switch to yet another one, except <i>maybe</i> Fossil, which I almost did.</p><p>So yeah, I had totally forgotten about <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fossil-scm.org</a> ; the reason it didn't become my go-to solution is probably mainly the fault of github.com, which I find too good to be ignored, and I don't want an 'impedance mismatch' between my system and their system. But maybe it would be doable and maybe Fossil is good enough to be worth it; at any rate, go read their docs, especially where they compare themselves directly to Git and give lots of good reasons for their way of doing things. This is the same people who are doing SQLite, so I'd say a trustworthy source of reliably top quality software.</p><p>Other than that, my personal way of dealing with the complexities of Git is to avoid using parts that I don't need or don't know about well enough (i.e. almost all of it). I use it to check in changes, give one line of comment, and upload to github.com; then of course cloning and updating existing repos as well as setting up a new ones is within my skill set. Branching and merging not so much. So it's like `git` plus `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, that's all; also, I use Sublime Merge for part of these (reviewing changes, adding related changed chunks, commit) which I must recommend for the piece of fine software that it is.</p><p>I also at some point toyed with gitless (I think it was called) which promised to be Git, but simpler for the simple things and you can always fall back to Git proper where called for; this I find a good proposition that I like (Markdown: fall back to HTML; CoffeeScript: fall back to JavaScript) but somehow gitless didn't stick with me; I <i>guess</i> that's b/c I've already tempered down my usage of Git to a point near absolute zero, and command line history + Sublime Merge does the rest.

That’s absurd and the GitHub server should be able to apply ACLs based on the push identity.</p><p>There’s a couple more of these suggestions I can think of, but yeah, GitHub should do more in this space.

Facebook tried something similar with Sapling.<p>For a new versioning system we do not need twenty different choices. We need one  free, open, and solid solution that everybody uses.</p><p>What the main leaders of the industry should really is to found a groupo that defines that standard.

Hi

I'm filling this for visibility.

There might be a ext4 data corruption issue with the kernel released
in the 12.3 bookworm point release (which is addressed in 6.1.66
upstream already).

The report about the regression and some details:

<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/stable/20231205122122.dfhhoaswsfscuhc3@quack3/">https://lore.kernel.org/stable/20231205122122.dfhhoaswsfscuhc3@quack3/</a>

Regards,
Salvatore

<pre>Are there any guidelines for affected users who already updated before
they got the warning?

Interesting questions for affected users:
- Is it safe to assume that other filesystems (like BTRFS) are not
affected?
- Does this cause filesystem corruption or only file corruption?
- Does this affect metadata or only file contents?
- Is there a way to detect corrupted files?
- If metadata is not affected, is it safe to assume that all files with
a modification date older than the update are fine?
- Does it help to shut down services (such as Apache) or the whole
machine until the fix is available?

The bug appears to be triggered when an -&gt;end_io handler returns a non-
zero value to iomap after a direct IO write.

It looks like the ext4 handler is the only one that returns non-zero in
kernel 6.1.64, so for now one can assume that only ext4 filesystems are
affected.

The bug corrupts file data during a direct write operation, so I would
also assume that files last modified before 6.1.64 was installed will
not be corrupted.

As far as I can tell, the corruption only affects file data (not
metadata) but perhaps someone with more kernel experience than me can
confirm.

Best regards,
Dale Richards

<pre>Are there any guidelines for affected users who already updated before
they got the warning?

For example, is it fine to start with the previous kernel
6.1.0-13-amd64 (version 6.1.55-1) ?

<h2 id="privileges">Privileges</h2>

<p>Trippy normally requires elevated privileges due to the use of raw sockets. Enabling the required privileges for your
platform can be achieved in several ways, as outlined below. Trippy can also be used without elevated privileged on
certain platforms, with some limitations.</p>

<h3 id="unix">Unix</h3>

<p>1: Run as <code>root</code> user via <code>sudo</code>:</p>



<p>2: <code>chown</code> <code>trip</code> as the <code>root</code> user and set the <code>setuid</code> bit:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>sudo chown </span>root <span>$(</span>which trip<span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>sudo chmod</span> +s <span>$(</span>which trip<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>3: [Linux only] Set the <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> capability:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>setcap CAP_NET_RAW+p <span>$(</span>which trip<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]<br>
Trippy is a capability aware application and will add <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> to the effective set if it is present in the
allowed set. Trippy will drop all capabilities after creating the raw sockets.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>Trippy must be run with Administrator privileges on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="unprivileged-mode">Unprivileged mode</h3>

<p>Trippy allows running in an unprivileged mode for all tracing modes (<code>ICMP</code>, <code>UDP</code> and <code>TCP</code>) on platforms which support
that feature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Unprivileged mode is currently only supported on macOS. Linux support is possible and may be added in the future.
Unprivileged mode is not supported on NetBSD, FreeBSD or Windows as these platforms do not support
the <code>IPPROTO_ICMP</code> socket type. See <a href="https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/101">#101</a> for further information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The unprivileged mode can be enabled by adding the <code>--unprivileged</code> (<code>-u</code>) command line flag or by adding
the <code>unprivileged</code> entry in the <code>trippy</code> section of the <a href="#configuration-reference">configuration file</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[trippy]</span>
<span>unprivileged</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
The <code>paris</code> and <code>dublin</code> <code>ECMP</code> strategies are not supported in unprivileged mode as these require
manipulating the <code>UDP</code> and <code>IP</code> and headers which in turn requires the use of a raw socket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h2>

<p>Basic usage with default parameters:</p>



<p>Trace without requiring elevated privileges (supported platforms only, see <a href="#privileges">privileges</a>):</p>

<div><pre><code>trip example.com <span>--unprivileged</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Trace using the <code>udp</code> (or <code>tcp</code> or <code>icmp</code>) protocol (also aliases <code>--icmp</code>, <code>--udp</code> &amp; <code>--tcp</code>):</p>



<p>Trace to multiple targets simultaneously (<code>icmp</code> protocol only,
see <a href="https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/72">#72</a>):</p>

<div><pre><code>trip example.com google.com crates.io
</code></pre></div>

<p>Trace with a minimum round time of <code>250ms</code> and a grace period of <code>50ms</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>trip example.com <span>-i</span> 250ms <span>-g</span> 50ms
</code></pre></div>

<p>Trace with a custom first and maximum <code>time-to-live</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>trip example.com <span>--first-ttl</span> 2 <span>--max-ttl</span> 10
</code></pre></div>

<p>Use custom destination port <code>443</code> for <code>tcp</code> tracing:</p>

<p>When Trippy shows “Awaiting data…” it means that it has received zero responses for the probes sent in a trace. This
indicates that either probes are not being sent or, more typically, responses are not being received.</p>

<p>Check that local and network firewalls allow ICMP traffic and that the system <code>traceroute</code> (or <code>tracert.exe</code> on
Windows) works as expected. Note that on Windows, even if <code>tracert.exe</code> works as expected, you
<em>must</em> <a href="#how-do-i-allow-incoming-icmp-traffic-in-the-windows-defender-firewall">configure</a> the Windows Defender
firewall to allow incoming ICMP traffic.</p>

<p>For deeper diagnostics you can run tools such as https://www.wireshark.org and https://www.tcpdump.org to verify that

-- Introduction ----------------------------------------------------------------

Last fall, I was rereading Brian Raiter's article on tiny ELF programs [1], when
I decided to try the challenge myself and create the tiniest x86_64 ELF program
on Linux; I was unaware at the time of others' attempts to answer the question.
To avoid missing any edge cases that could help, I decided to work from first
principles, reading the source of the Linux kernel's ELF loader and deriving
the requirements from that. At first, after ruling out all smaller offsets of
the program header, I concluded that offset 0x18 was the smallest possible,
yielding an 80-byte program that returns 42:

00000000: 7f45 4c46 b0e7 40b7 2a0f 0500 0000 0000  .ELF..@.*.......
00000010: 0200 3e00 0000 0000 0100 0000 0100 0000  ..&gt;.............
00000020: 1800 0000 0000 0000 1800 0000 0100 0000  ................
00000030: 0000 0000 0000 3800 0100 0000 0000 0000  ......8.........
00000040: 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................

(This 80-byte size was already known by Brian Raiter and a few others [2],
though not widely publicized.) This summer, I found Nathan Otterness's 2021
article [3] concluding that 105 bytes is the minimum size, and to put the issue
to rest, I decided to write my own article with a full analysis of the 80-byte
minimum.

However, in the process of repeating my analysis, I remembered that I had only
considered executables of type ET_EXEC, and not ET_DYN. As it turned out, this
was a mistake: with ET_DYN, the program header can just barely be placed at
offset 0xc. Annoyingly, the entry point is fixed to the 'jg .+0x47' at the very
start of the file, so another jump has to be placed at offset 0x47, past the end
of the headers. Overall, this yields a 73-byte program that returns 42:

00000000: 7f45 4c46 b0e7 40b7 2a0f 0500 0100 0000  .ELF..@.*.......
00000010: 0300 3e00 0c00 0000 0000 0000 0c00 0000  ..&gt;.............
00000020: 0c00 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 3800  ..............8.
00000030: 0100 0000 0000 3800 0100 0000 0000 0000  ......8.........
00000040: 0000 0000 0000 00eb bb                   .........

Unless I made another mistake, this is the absolute minimum size for an ELF file
containing an x86_64 program, modulo the precise definition of a "program". I
plan to publish the full analysis later this year.

-- A Simple Challenge, and a Straightforward Solution --------------------------

But once I had established the minimum size, I was inspired by Otterness's
article to turn it into the tiniest x86_64 Hello World program. The natural
rules for this challenge are pretty simple: write the 14 bytes "Hello, world!\n"
to stdout, exit with code 0, and produce no other side effects. Of course, the
actual process of golfing the program is far from simple.

First, let's start with our 80-byte pattern, which doesn't include a mandatory
instruction at offset 0x47. This allows us to put our entire 14-byte string at
offset 0x48, immediately following phdr-&gt;p_memsz. To place our instructions so
that they won't interfere with the header fields, we can use a template that I
created in my analysis:

00000000: 7f45 4c46 **** **** **** **** **** ****  .ELF............
00000010: 0200 3e00 **** **** 0100 0000 pppp pp00  ..&gt;.............
00000020: 1800 0000 0000 0000 1800 0000 pppp pp00  ................
00000030: **** **** **** 3800 0100 qqqq qqqq qq00  ......8.........
00000040: 0100 qqqq qqqq qq00 **** **** **** ****  ................

Here, the p, q, and * characters are all placeholders. There are a couple extra
restrictions on their values for the program to be loadable. 0xpppppp must be
odd, so that phdr-&gt;p_flags includes PF_X. Also, if the system doesn't support
5-level paging, then 0xpppppp can't be larger than 0x007fff, and 0xqqqqqqqqqq
can't be larger than 0x007fffffff.

The template has enough space for us to write our program with a straightforward
instruction sequence, with no special tricks necessary, apart from using
'pop rdi' to set rdi to 1. The value comes from argc, as saved onto the initial
process stack by the kernel. Adapting this sequence to work when argc != 1 is
left as an exercise to the reader.

0x1:
  rex.RB rex.WR rex.RX  /* "ELF" in ELFMAG                 */
  mov al, 1             /* nr = 1 = __NR_write             */
  pop rdi               /* fd = argc = 1                   */
  lea rsi, [rip+0x3a]   /* buf = "Hello, world!\n"         */
  jmp 0x14
0x14:
  mov dl, 14            /* count = 14                      */
  jmp 0x30
0x30:
  syscall               /* write(1, "Hello, world!\n", 14) */
  mov al, 231           /* nr = 231 = __NR_exit_group      */
  jmp 0x3a
0x3a:
  xor edi, edi          /* error_code = 0                  */
  syscall               /* exit_group(0)                   */
0x48:
  .ascii "Hello, world!\n"

This yields an 86-byte Hello World program:

00000000: 7f45 4c46 b001 5f48 8d35 3a00 0000 eb04  .ELF.._H.5:.....
00000010: 0300 3e00 b20e eb18 0100 0000 0100 0000  ..&gt;.............
00000020: 1800 0000 0000 0000 1800 0000 0100 0000  ................
00000030: 0f05 b0e7 eb04 3800 0100 31ff 0f05 0000  ......8...1.....
00000040: 0100 31ff 0f05 0000 4865 6c6c 6f2c 2077  ..1.....Hello, w
00000050: 6f72 6c64 210a                           orld!.

Clearly, this is the tiniest program we can write while keeping the string in
one piece: the template doesn't let us put it any earlier in the file. Even our
offset-0xc pattern doesn't help: there are only 11 bytes of free space before
the mandatory jump instruction, so the 14-byte string would have to be placed
after it, at offset 0x49. If we want to make the program any tinier, we'll have
to divide the string into multiple chunks in the file, then reassemble them at
runtime.

-- Division and Reassembly -----------------------------------------------------

When we divide the string, it makes sense to use the offset-0xc pattern instead
of the longer offset-0x18 pattern. The template for this offset includes a long
block of 28 immutable header bytes after the initial free space:

00000000: 7f45 4c46 **** **** **** **** 0100 0000  .ELF............
00000010: 0300 3e00 0c00 0000 0000 0000 0c00 0000  ..&gt;.............
00000020: 0c00 0000 0000 0000 **** **** pppp pppp  ................
00000030: pppp pp00 qqqq 3800 0100 rr00 **** ****  ......8.........
00000040: **** ****                                ..

In this case, we have phdr-&gt;p_filesz = 0x00pppppppppppppp and phdr-&gt;p_memsz =
0x00rr00010038qqqq, with three different alternatives for their values. Either

1. the file size &lt;= phdr-&gt;p_filesz &lt;= 0xfff;
2. phdr-&gt;p_filesz == phdr-&gt;p_memsz; or
3. phdr-&gt;p_filesz &lt; phdr-&gt;p_memsz, and (phdr-&gt;p_filesz &amp; 0xfff) == 0xff4.

In practice, we'll be using the 3rd alternative, so that we can store additional
instructions within phdr-&gt;p_filesz. Once again, if the system doesn't support
5-level paging, then the two values must both be at most 0x00007fffffffffff (or
rather, a few megabytes less, to leave room for the process stack). Also, if the
system *does* support 5-level paging, and phdr-&gt;p_memsz is above that size, then
the vm.overcommit_memory sysctl must be set to 1 ("always overcommit"), to allow
the kernel to map enough terabytes of read-write memory.

When reassembling the string from two parts, we need to write it into a region
of writable memory. This leaves us a choice: should we push it onto the stack,
or should we write it into the program image, which is mapped as WX? The stack
can be written to very easily, using the family of 'push' instructions. But the
program image already contains one of the parts, leaving only the other part to
be written.

For now, let's start with an approach writing to the program image. We can
actually still join the two parts with a 'push' instruction, if we first use a
'pop rsp' to replace the stack pointer with a pointer into the image. To obtain
this pointer, we can replace a 'jmp rel8' with a 'call rel32', adding only 3
bytes to the instruction sequence, down from the 7 bytes required by a typical
'lea r64, [rip+disp32]'. Then, to minimize stack wrangling, we can place the
'call' directly before "orld!\n", so that 'pop rsp; push r64' is sufficient to
join the two parts. Finally, prior to the 'call', we can use an ordinary
'mov r64, imm64' to load the first part "Hello, w" into a register.

When fitting the instructions into the template, we must be careful to satisfy
the 0xff4 requirement on phdr-&gt;p_filesz: its first byte must be 0xf4, and its
second byte must be 0x0f, 0x1f, ..., or 0xff. Best utilizing these two bytes is
one of our main goals in arranging the sequence. The first byte can be either
skipped past with a dummy instruction like 'test al, 0xf4' (a8 f4), or used at
the end of a 3-byte encoding of 'mov rsi, rsp' (48 8b f4). Meanwhile, the second
byte can be used for 'syscall' (0f 05), 'pop rdi' (5f), or any of the multibyte
encodings of 'pop r/m64' (8f ...) or 'push r/m64' (ff ...).

Altogether, we have a somewhat twisty instruction sequence, starting with a
'jrcxz 0x3c' to jump to the first instruction of the trailing free space, and
using both 'mov rsi, rsp' and 'pop rdi' to cover the 0xff4 in phdr-&gt;p_filesz.
The resulting file takes 84 bytes.

Since phdr-&gt;p_memsz = 0x00d2000100380000, this program requires 5-level paging
to run. Luckily, even if you don't own a recent Intel Xeon processor that
supports it natively, you can emulate 5-level paging with QEMU and a guest that
enables CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL in its kernel. Personally, I use a premade Arch Linux
VM image [4], since it is small and quick to boot. Emulating 5-level paging in
QEMU just takes an extra argument to set the CPU model:

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu qemu64,la57 -m 512 Arch-Linux-x86_64-basic.qcow2

[arch@archlinux ~]$ sudo sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1
vm.overcommit_memory = 1
[arch@archlinux ~]$ ./program; echo $?
Hello, world!
0

At this point, our main bottleneck for improving the size is the big fat 5-byte
'call rel32' before the "orld!\n" part; it blocks us from moving that part any
earlier in the file. One approach to avoid the call is to use two imm64 operands
to load the two parts, but that would require placing the 'mov' instruction for
the "Hello, w" part at offset 0x49 or later, and ultimately it wouldn't end up
saving any bytes at all. If only we had some way to separate the strings from
the instructions, so as to use fewer bytes in the trailing free space...

-- The Almighty SYSCALL Instruction --------------------------------------------

The AMD64 psABI [5] has something curious to say about syscalls on Linux:

  A system-call is done via the syscall instruction. The kernel destroys
  registers %rcx and %r11.

This is pretty vague; what nefarious things could the kernel possibly be doing
with those registers!? The answer lies not in the psABI, but in the entry for
the SYSRET instruction in Intel's SDM (and its counterpart in AMD's manual):

  SYSRET is a companion instruction to the SYSCALL instruction. It returns
  from an OS system-call handler to user code at privilege level 3. It does so
  by loading RIP from RCX and loading RFLAGS from R11.

This means that rcx is effectively guaranteed to contain the return address on
return from a 'syscall' instruction. Thus, after running a syscall (even one
that has no external side effects), we have a pointer into the program image,
which we can use to push 8 bytes from anywhere in the file onto the stack, with
only a 3-byte 'push [rcx+disp8]'.

A no-op 'syscall' at the start of the instruction sequence costs us 2 extra
bytes, but we can make up for it by using only 4 basic blocks instead of 5,
saving a 2-byte jump instruction. We can use the conveniently-sized 8-byte space
at offset 0x4 to store the "Hello, w" part, and leave the "orld!\n" part at the
end of the file. Then, at runtime, we can push the two parts to the stack with a
pair of 'push' instructions.

Thus, by the power of the almighty SYSCALL instruction, we can make our code a
bit less twisty, and thereby shrink our file from 84 to 81 bytes.

(Note that as our no-op syscall, we attempt to read the stdin stream for 0
bytes. Could this be considered a side effect? If stdin is redirected to a
special file from some random driver or subsystem in the kernel, pretty much
anything could happen when it receives a 0-byte read request from userspace.
However, apart from FUSE, I am not aware of any driver that doesn't simply
discard or reject such a read request, so I wouldn't consider this a serious
issue.)

-- Ouroboros Programming -------------------------------------------------------

  ὁ &lt;δὲ&gt; κύκλος ἐπίπεδον σχῆμά ἐστιν ὑπὸ μιᾶς γραμμῆς περιεχόμενον, καὶ ταύτῃ
  κυκλικὸν ὀνομάζεται σχῆμα ἀφ' ἑαυτοῦ ἀρχόμενον καὶ εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἀναστρέφοντος
  καὶ μηδαμοῦ περατουμένου. ὅθεν καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι καθ' ἱερὸν λόγον δράκοντα
  οὐρηβόρον ταῖς πυραμίσιν ἐγγλύφουσιν. [6]

  Now, the circle is a plane figure bounded by a single line, and thus a shape
  that begins from itself and ends with itself is called "circular"--which is
  particularly [true of] time which returns into itself and is never
  terminated. Hence also the Egyptians, in accordance with a sacred discourse,
  carve a serpent eating its tail on their pyramids. [7]

So says John Lydus (translated by Mischa Hooker) regarding the symbol of the
ouroboros. Though our program is required to terminate, we can design it so that
it returns into itself, as the ouroboros does. At this point, our instruction
sequence both begins and ends with a 'syscall', and we are already forced to
jump from the end to the start. Thus, we can close the circle, letting the
instruction pointer advance once more into the initial 'syscall', so that we no
longer need the final 'syscall'. This allows us to save 2 bytes.

However, adapting the program in this way isn't entirely trivial, since we can't
use 'mov rsi, rsp' to cover the 0xf4 byte in phdr-&gt;p_filesz. (There's no way to
set rsp to its final value early enough in the code.) Instead, we can use that
byte to help us set rax to 1. First, we write 'cmp al, 0xf4' (3c f4), covering
the 0xf4 byte. Since al is 0 at this point, the comparison will always set the
carry flag. Then, at the end of phdr-&gt;p_filesz, we write 'adc al, 0x0' (14 00),
covering the 0x00 byte. As long as the carry flag is not cleard between the two
instructions, the latter will set al to 1, as desired.

However, there's a catch to this trick. It only works      .----.

must be a readable stream. Since lots of command-    / V /     .          \ P \
line applications can't cope with a missing or      ' O .      |\          . U '

When we remove the final 'syscall', rotate the       \ C \                / V /

-- Tightening the Loop ---------------------------------------------------------

Recall that the ouroboros begins from itself and ends with itself. In the art of
Ouroboros Programming, we must unify the beginning and the end, creating a whole
that encompasses both. Our program begins by setting the arguments for write(),
and ends by setting the arguments for exit_group(). How can we turn these two
sections into one, so that we only need a single 'syscall' instruction?

Since it has only one argument, exit_group() is pretty simple to call. We can
modify the logic of the larger part of the loop so that it sets rax = __NR_write
and rdi = 1 on the first iteration, then sets rax = __NR_exit_group and rdi = 0
on the second iteration. We can leave the rest of the logic unmodified, since it
only sets the value of rsi after pushing the two parts.

Setting rdi is trivial: since we already have 'pop rdi' early in the program to
set its value to argc = 1, we can push a 0 to the stack right before calling
write(), so it will be read by 'pop rdi'. Meanwhile, setting rax is trickier,
since we want it to have a large initial value only on the second iteration.
Luckily, we can do this with only 1 additional byte, by adding 'xchg ebx, eax'
to the start of the loop, and 'mov bl, 230' at the end of the loop. (The loop
increments al by 1, so by the end of the second iteration, rax will become
__NR_exit_group = 231.)

Finally, since there's no more room for the "orld!\n" part at the end of the
file, we can move it over to offset 0x3c, so that the jump can skip right past
it. Compared to the last program, we have added 1 byte to 'mov al, 231', and
removed 1 byte from 'xor edi, edi', so those balance out. We still save 2 bytes
from merging the two 'syscall' instructions, so our program is now 77 bytes.

This is the end of the line: I don't know of any trick, method, or strategy that
can make this program any tinier. I'm reluctant to say that this is the absolute
minimum size; after all, anything can happen with self-modifying code, and
there's too much free space to simulate every wild possibility of what it could
do. However, I doubt that this program could be made any smaller through
conventional means.

-- Hello World in the Real World -----------------------------------------------

The tinier versions of this program have all required 5-level paging, to get as
much use as possible out of phdr-&gt;p_filesz. It would be nice if we could have a
slightly longer program that anyone can run at home, outside of a VM. Adapting
our program in this way isn't actually all that difficult: the main difference
is that phdr-&gt;p_filesz has to end in four 0x00 bytes, so that it doesn't become
greater than phdr-&gt;p_memsz. We can reuse these bytes within an 'adc eax, 0x0'
(15 00 00 00 00) instruction, to set rax to 1.

Apart from that, adapting the program to 4-level paging just involves rotating
the instructions around. The version presented here is 81 bytes, but I'm not
quite so certain that a conventional 80-byte version isn't possible.

-- Conclusion ------------------------------------------------------------------

This entire task has perhaps been not very exciting from an ELF perspective;
we've merely golfed a short x86_64 program within the peculiar constraints set
out at the beginning. However, I think tasks like these provide partial answers
to the eternal question of Kolmogorov complexity: "What sorts of programs can be
expressed within an ELF file of a given length?" I've always been fascinated by
this, since clearly any given program has an optimal length, as a mathematical
property of the kernel and the processor. And as far as I know, the question for
ELF files hasn't been studied very thoroughly; since any programs has to work
around the headers, the format has been relatively unpopular for sizecoding. (Or
perhaps the unpopularity just stems from the lack of simple MMIO on Linux...)

Regardless, I hope that this can serve as a case study of the sort of "thinking
outside the box" that can be helpful when golfing binary programs. At many
points while writing this, I thought that I'd surely reached the limit of how
tiny I could make the program, only for that limit to be broken by a brand-new
technique different from what I'd previously been trying. Much of this, I think,
arises from the flexiblity of control flow in binary code: a jump is no larger
than any other instruction, so even with only a few basic blocks, there are
countless ways to thread the program execution between them.

This is particularly exemplified by my dramatically-named Ouroboros Programming
(for which I am sure a more appropriate name already exists). Most instructions
are general-purpose, so instead of thinking only in terms of an instruction's
immediate function, we can also consider all of its possible alternative
functions. Thus, a 'syscall' instruction isn't just some particular syscall, but
every single syscall in the kernel that we're able to set up the arguments for.
And a 'pop' instruction doesn't care whether we used a 'push' to store the data
behind [rsp]; it just cares that it ended up there one way or another.

It all raises the question, just how much code could we be reusing for multiple
purposes in our golfed programs, if only the opportunities weren't so difficult
to recognize? If my experience with this task is any lesson, it's more than we
would think.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>America is back to work. The productivity of U.S. workers grew 5.2% in the third quarter, according to the latest <a href="https://www.bls.gov/productivity/" target="_self" rel="">Bureau of Labor Statistics report</a>, released Wednesday. That’s the fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2020. Productivity also grew last quarter, by 2.4%, making these the first two consecutive quarters of productivity growth in nearly three years.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>That’s a welcome turn of fate after <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/remote-work-productivity-5-straight-quarters-decline-gregory-daco/" target="_self" rel="">five consecutive quarters</a> of declining productivity, the reasons for which have been up for plenty of debate. The dispute has been raging <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/remote-workers-less-productive-research/" target="_self" rel="">for years now</a> as executives and workers alike attempt to uncover what exactly leads to lowered output and morale. Many CEOs have <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/14/remote-work-productivity-goldman-sachs-nyu-total-factor-thomas-philippon/" target="_self" rel="">pointed fingers</a> at remote work, arguing that languishing on the couch has made it significantly easier for employees to extend less effort—which over time yanks total company production down. But the data <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/04/remote-work-productivity-second-quarter-gdp-growth-return-to-office/" target="_self" rel="">hasn’t borne that out</a>—offices have been no more full as productivity rose. And economists have <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/remote-work-productivity-5-straight-quarters-decline-gregory-daco/" target="_self" rel="">mainly chalked the decline up to</a> everything from sluggish economic activity to higher-than-usual job turnover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may be too soon to tell if last quarter’s productivity surge is a flash in the pan—or what exactly is fueling the growth—but it still might be worth getting excited about. The productivity boom is very encouraging, according to Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, the global strategy consulting segment of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/ey/" target="_blank" rel="">EY</a>, a Big Four consultancy firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve seen something that rarely occurs outside recessions: Productivity accelerated in a pro-cyclical manner, in line with the overall pace of economic activity, and positive growth in terms of the labor market,” he tells <em>Fortune.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Essentially, Daco adds, productivity has rebounded above its 2017-to-2019 norms, which he believes indicates that it’s “not just a quick bounceback,” but actually stronger than the prior trend—a positive development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s underpinned by four main factors unique to our current circumstances, Daco posits: Less turnover, more solid flexible arrangements, upped attention to costs, and more meticulous investing. Conspicuously missing from this list? A return to office, which Daco maintains has a negligible impact on productivity. (Future of work experts <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/wfh-rates-2026-nick-bloom/" target="_self" rel="">could have told you that</a> all along.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Big Four</strong></h2>



<p>When the U.S. reported its fifth straight quarter of productivity declines <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/remote-work-productivity-5-straight-quarters-decline-gregory-daco/" target="_self" rel="">back in May</a>—the longest such stretch since World War II—it followed two years of the <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/03/number-of-people-quitting-pre-pandemic-rates/" target="_self" rel="">Great Resignation</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/21/gen-z-millennial-employees-job-hopping/" target="_self" rel="">job hopping</a>. “When an employee that’s been there for a few months has to train someone who just joined—and that person may not necessarily stay for that long—that creates a massive productivity hit,” Daco says. “The person that’s been there for three months won’t be anywhere near as productive as the person there for multiple years.” Then the cycle repeats: Having them train someone else will mean the <em>next</em> person will be even <em>less</em> efficient.</p>



<p>But such worker churn has since fallen from its <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/19/ceo-departures-highest-level-on-record-great-resignation/" target="_self" rel="">fever pitch</a>—the quits rate has <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/03/number-of-people-quitting-pre-pandemic-rates/" target="_self" rel="">dropped back</a> to its 2019 rate. “Employees are staying longer with their employers, and attrition rates are much lower,” Daco explains, adding that this makes employees better trained and more efficient.</p>



<p>Another thing that’s changed—adapting to hybrid work. Earlier this year, many workers were still navigating this workplace compromise. Now, most office workers log on remotely just shy of 30% of the time, and that figure <a href="https://fortune.com/preview/2023/12/08/productivity-boom-ey-parthenon-reasons/" target="_self" rel="">hasn’t moved</a> in many months. That <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/12/hybrid-work-new-norm-return-to-office/" target="_self" rel="">hybrid work has become the norm</a> means fewer organizational changes, which means more time to actually focus on the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being in a “post-pandemic shock environment” is why we had five consecutive quarters of contraction in productivity, Daco says. “Now we’re getting more settled, and people are finding balance in their flexible arrangements, and that’s driving more productive outputs.”</p>



<p>The other two factors are more external. Last year, inflation <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/13/inflation-cools-may-cpi-consumer-price-index-report-economy-recession/" target="_self" rel="">hit a 40-year-high</a>. That left businesses paying extra attention to cost management, cutting back on expenses like <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/14/elon-musk-twitter-employee-free-meal-perks-cut/" target="_self" rel="">free lunch </a>and even resorting to <a href="http://layoffs.fyi/" target="_self" rel="">rounds of layoffs</a>. Now, the story in late 2023 into 2024 is one of cost fatigue, which Daco says is a bit of a departure from the inflation narrative that characterized the 2020s thus far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everyone is fatigued by the elevated costs of goods, services, labor, capital, interest rates, inventory—everything,” he says. “So bosses don’t want to let good talent go.” Instead, they’re having to find ways to improve productivity, such as investing in increased employee engagement and long-term retention and leveraging technological innovations like generative A.I.</p>



<p>And, in an environment where the cost of capital and interest rates <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/12/long-term-interest-rates-spiking-could-recessionor-us-economy-carlsson-szlezak-swartz/" target="_self" rel="">are spiking</a>, businesses scrutinize their decisions much more than they would otherwise in a strong economic climate. “You’re going to be much more careful with your investments,” Daco says. “That means that you’re going to focus on the investment decisions that bring the highest returns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words: No unnecessary spending or innovation—focus on the most lucrative business levers, and divert all the resources and productivity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Office attendance and work output? Not so black and white </strong></h2>



<p>Bolstered by Daco’s four-point explanation, the new BLS data puts to rest the idea that <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/wfh-rates-2026-nick-bloom/" target="_self" rel=""><em>where </em>work happens</a> is consequential in the productivity debate. Experts have <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/20/hybrid-work-problems-annie-dean-meta-atlassian/" target="_self" rel="">maintained that exact point</a> for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidence of productivity differences between remote and in-person work isn’t black and white, Daco says; there’s a “huge diffusion” of gains and losses. “I don’t know if return-to-office policies have had much of an effect one way or another, because the arguments are clear both ways,” he adds. “It really depends on the culture and the reasoning behind the [policies].”</p>



<p>Often when someone is forced to do something, they tend to be less efficient, he says. Once people feel more comfortable and stable in an arrangement, their productivity tends to recover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked point blank whether a move towards greater in-person attendance may definitively improve productivity, Daco demurs. “I’m not answering the question, because there isn’t any clear-cut evidence that [this year’s Labor Day mandates] really shifted things that much.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time many of those <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/06/remote-work-return-to-office-ceos-gamble-pandemic-hybrid-policy/" target="_self" rel="">Labor Day mandates</a> were instated, they were already in place to some degree, and the half-and-half in-person split wasn’t entirely new. And, running counter to remote work expert Nick Bloom’s prediction that remote work will eventually <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/31/ai-remote-workers-threat-nick-bloom-work-from-home/" target="_self" rel="">edge out office work</a> as the dominant format, Daco says he expects an increase in office work in coming years.</p>



<p>“We’ll never get back to—well, never say never—but we’re unlikely to get back to 100% office attendance,” he says. “But I wouldn’t be surprised if we still creep back up, especially if labor market conditions start to deteriorate and we see layoffs and more unemployment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that point, he says, the incentive will be greater for workers to be present instead of out of sight—which, they’d hope, would make their bosses <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/15/remote-work-makes-it-easier-to-fire-ken-griffin-citadel/" target="_self" rel="">hesitant to fire them first</a>. Though of course, bosses could also take the approach of assessing workers on their productivity rates. Which, conveniently, are doing pretty well these days.</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

(Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p id="8705">On the 4th of November 2010, a Qantas Airbus A380 was rocked by a catastrophic engine failure minutes after takeoff from Singapore, hurling fragments of a turbine disk through its wings and fuselage in multiple locations. The explosion damaged almost every major system on the airplane, from the flight controls and fuel tanks to hydraulics and pneumatics. Faced with a barrage of diverse failure warnings and an airplane of uncertain integrity, the flight crew worked together to make a series of critical decisions that would get their enormous airplane back on the ground. And in the end, despite one curveball after another — including landing gear problems, loss of braking power, and an engine that refused to shut down — they not only landed the plane, but did so without putting a scratch on any of the 469 passengers and crew.</p><p id="5ab9">The cause of the incident would ultimately be traced deep inside the number two engine to a single oil pipe that had been manufactured with a wall that was slightly too thin. How this seemingly tiny defect came about, and how it nearly brought down the world’s largest passenger plane, represent a story equally as fascinating as that of the flight itself, tracing back years to encompass questionable drawing board decisions, hidden flaws in the machining logic, and faulty assumptions about engine behavior. Time and time again, the problem slipped through the gaps in the system, tumbling down the long slope toward disaster — only to be stopped at the last moment, not only by the pilots themselves, but by a number of explicit protections built into the design of the A380, each of which played a crucial role in containing the fallout from a failure that exceeded the manufacturer’s worst expectations. The story of Qantas flight 32, as told herein, is therefore not only the tale of a dramatic emergency, but a testament to the safety of aviation today — a story that should make every reader feel a little less fearful of flight.</p><p id="1a65">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>A brand new Airbus A380 takes to the skies. (Pascal Le Segretain)</figcaption></figure><p id="dab4">Introduced to service in 2007, the double decker, four-engine A380 is by far the largest passenger aircraft in the world, exceeding the vaunted Boeing 747 in almost every measurement. Awesome to behold and pleasant to fly, there’s not much to dislike about the A380 — unless you’re an airline, in which case most major carriers dismissed the behemoth as too large for their operating models. Indeed, analysts’ assessment today is that the A380 was built for a market that had shrunk considerably by the time it actually entered service, and as a result, production ended in 2021 with only 254 built, some of which have already been scrapped. For an extraordinarily expensive aircraft equipped with some of the most advanced technology of any airliner, the collective result of immense effort and imagination, such a fate is unfortunate, but the reasons behind it, and the future of the type, are topics for a different article.</p><p id="5896">Despite the above, some airlines did find the A380 suitable for their operations, including Qantas, the flag carrier of Australia. Qantas ordered 10 A380s to be delivered in 2008, of which eight are still flying today. It was the very first of these, registered as VH-OQA and nicknamed Nancy-Bird Walton after the pioneering Australian aviator, that would come to be involved in the events of the 4th of November 2010.</p><figure><figcaption>VH-OQA, the aircraft involved in the accident. (Andrei Dimofte)</figcaption></figure><p id="5e90">On that date, VH-OQA arrived in Singapore for a scheduled stopover on a marathon London-to-Sydney trip, where it took on fuel, passengers, and a new flight crew for the last leg to Australia. The plane was essentially full, with 440 of 450 passenger seats filled, plus a massive complement of 29 crewmembers, including no less than five pilots. Although the A380 is normally flown by only two pilots, Qantas had also rostered a second officer as a relief crewmember; a check airman was conducting a line check on the captain; and another check airman was training the first check airman, so the cockpit was certainly crowded.</p><p id="ff17">In command, and under examination, was 53-year-old Captain Richard Champion de Crespigny, a veteran airman with over 15,000 hours of experience and 32 years in aviation. The other crewmembers consisted of First Officer Matt Hicks, Second Officer Mark Johnson, Check Captain Harry Wubben, and Senior Check Captain David Evans. The five crewmembers had a combined 140 years in aviation and 71,000 hours of flying experience, an incredible total that is rarely equaled.</p><p id="70ee">At 9:56 a.m. local time, with Captain de Crespigny at the controls, Qantas flight 32 departed Singapore and proceeded southeast across the strait toward Indonesia, passing over the densely populated island of Batam. All parameters still appeared normal as the A380 climbed through 7,000 feet, four minutes after takeoff. There was no indication that a catastrophic failure was in fact just seconds away.</p><p id="bece">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>A Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine with a man for scale. (Wikimedia user Tangopaso)</figcaption></figure><p id="4196">The Airbus A380 is powered by four massive Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 900-series high-bypass turbofan engines, each producing up to 84,000 lbf of thrust. Designed specifically for the A380, the Trent 900 was produced at several locations in the United Kingdom and was sold in competition with the American-built GP7200 jointly developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric.</p><p id="9d52">Understanding what happened aboard Qantas flight 32 requires that I subject you to a description of the structure of certain very specific parts of the engine.</p><p id="e805">Like all high-bypass jet engines, the Trent 900 consists of four main sections: the fan, the compressors, the combustion chamber, and the turbines. During normal operation, air is forced backward and pressurized by a series of increasingly powerful compressors before being fed into the combustion chamber, where it is mixed with fuel and ignited. The combustion creates mechanical energy that spins a series of turbines, which in turn power the compressors, as well as the fan at the front of the engine, which accelerates large quantities of so-called bypass air around the outside of the engine core to generate most of the thrust output.</p><figure><figcaption>Locations of turbines and compressors on the Trent 900. (FAA)</figcaption></figure><p id="dcf5">Most turbofan engines examined in my articles have a high pressure compressor and a low pressure compressor, which correspond to high- and low-pressure turbines. These turbines are connected to their respective compressor sections by concentric drive shafts. However, the Trent 900 differs from this layout slightly, because it also has an intermediate pressure compressor with a corresponding intermediate pressure turbine, in between the high and low pressure sections. It also differs in that the fan itself doubles as the low pressure compressor. (From now on, for brevity’s sake, the abbreviations LP, IP, and HP will be used for low pressure, intermediate pressure, and high pressure, respectively.)</p><figure><figcaption>In this cutaway diagram of the IP turbine area, I’ve drawn blue boxes around the components mentioned in the following paragraph. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="48a2">On the Trent 900, the HP and IP turbine sections at the rear of the engine each consist of a single-stage turbine disk. Blades around the circumference of each disk capture mechanical energy from hot combustion gases flowing through what is known as the “annulus gas path.” These gases spin the disk, which is attached by a drive arm to its associated drive shaft. The shaft then transfers the turbine’s rotational energy forward to the corresponding compressor at the front of the engine.</p><figure><figcaption>This clip from an FAA video helps visualize the cutaway of the HP/IP bearing assembly. Note the location of the bearing chamber, which is depicted full of oil, and the pipe leading into it. Watch the full video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYxVin_FFxQ" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYxVin_FFxQ</a></figcaption></figure><p id="dfc8">In order to support the turbine disks and shafts while still allowing them to rotate freely, the engine features a complex system of bearings. The HP and IP turbine sections have a common bearing assembly, called the HP/IP bearing hub, which encircles the drive shafts and holds them in place while allowing free rotation of the shafts within.</p><p id="d60c">To prevent wear on the bearings, the space inside the bearing hub, called the bearing chamber, is constantly filled with pressurized oil that keeps everything gliding smoothly. This oil is supplied primarily by an oil feed pipe that runs from the main engine oil supply, past the annulus gas path, and down into the HP/IP bearing hub, where it injects oil through a filter and into the bearing chamber.</p><p id="d009">The structure of the bearing hub consists of an inner and outer hub section, such that an empty buffer space exists between the bearing chamber and the rest of the engine. The oil feed pipe runs through both sections in order to reach the bearing chamber. The last segment of this pipe, a few centimeters in length, is welded in place during manufacture of the bearing hub, and the main portion of the pipe is fitted to it later. This fixed final segment that passes through the buffer space between the inner and outer sections of the HP/IP bearing hub is called the “stub pipe.”</p><p id="5d37">For reasons that will be examined in detail later, this tiny oil feed stub pipe triggered an escalating sequence of events within the space of mere seconds as Qantas flight 32 climbed away from Singapore.</p><p id="1540">Within the №2 engine, located in the inboard position on the left wing, a crack in the oil feed stub pipe caused it to begin leaking oil less than four minutes after takeoff. The leak was small, but the oil within the pipe was highly pressurized, resulting in an atomized spray into the buffer space between the inner and outer sections of the HP/IP bearing hub. The temperature inside this buffer space was likely between 365 and 375˚C, well above the 280-degree auto-ignition temperature of the engine oil, so the spray immediately ignited.</p><figure><figcaption>An FAA animation of the failure sequence leading up to the explosion aboard Qantas 32, annotated by me. This should be really helpful for visualizing the following paragraph. (FAA)</figcaption></figure><p id="eb6e">At the forward end of the bearing hub, a triple seal is attached to the hub structure to isolate the buffer space, which has a low internal pressure, from the area behind the high pressure turbine disk, where pressure is higher. But as the fire in the buffer space expanded, it impinged upon this seal, causing it to fail. With the low-pressure area no longer sealed off, highly pressurized air from the annulus gas path was drawn toward it, bursting down past the high pressure turbine disk and into the buffer space. This rush of air coming in through the forward end of the buffer space blasted the fire aft, propelling it like a blowtorch against the corresponding seal at the other end, which also failed. The burning oil “blowtorch” was then able to make direct contact with the drive arm connecting the IP turbine disk to its drive shaft, located directly behind the HP/IP bearing hub. Already under considerable stress as a result of normal engine operation, the drive arm failed under the withering heat within a matter of seconds.</p><p id="8614">This entire sequence, from the initiation of the oil leak to the failure of the drive arm, lasted considerably less than one minute.</p><figure><figcaption>The turbine disk disintegrates. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="66fa">Now, with the drive arm broken, the IP turbine disk was not directly connected to anything, which is (to use the technical jargon) a really big problem. A turbine disk is subjected to considerable mechanical energy from the annulus gas path, and that doesn’t go away when the drive arm breaks, but what does go away is any ability to transfer that energy somewhere other than the turbine disk itself. During normal operations, this energy is used to turn the intermediate compressors, which requires considerable force. But this load path only exists when the turbine disk is connected to the drive shaft, so when the drive arm broke, the only way for the disk to absorb all that energy was to spin faster… and faster… and faster…</p><p id="bea9">Within the space of four seconds, the energy from the annular gas flow accelerated the IP turbine past its critical speed, until centrifugal forces exceeded the ultimate strength of the nickel alloy disk. The red-hot, wildly spinning disk instantly fractured into several sections, which rocketed outward in multiple directions at incomprehensible speed.</p><figure><figcaption>The disk fragments neatly ripped out everything within the disk’s plane of rotation. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="60d0">Engine designers do their best to make sure that the engine structure can contain flying debris like individual fan and turbine blades, but the amount of energy contained within those types of projectiles is a fraction of that within a piece of a burst disk. For engineering purposes, disk fragments are assumed to have infinite energy at the moment of release; they will cut through any reasonable material and cannot be contained.</p><p id="c241">When the IP turbine disk on Qantas flight 32 suddenly burst, nothing could stop the resulting fragments, which cut through the engine case and cowling like butter, cleaving a neat circumferential fissure all the way around the engine within the plane where the disk used to be. Within a fraction of a second, one of these disk fragments exited the engine downward and to the left, propelled toward the distant ground, but several more traveled in the opposite direction. One fragment shot to the right, entered the belly area below the cargo hold, plowed through several structural stringers and wire bundles, then exited out the other side, never to be seen again. Two more fragments rocketed upward, carving paths of destruction through the interior of the left wing before emerging from its upper surface, at which point they too disappeared into space. Numerous smaller pieces, such as dislodged turbine blades and fragments of engine structure, also peppered various parts of the aircraft, including the wings and fuselage.</p><figure><figcaption>The trajectories of the various fragments. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="9749">On board the plane, the pilots and passengers heard two distinct bangs in very short succession, which were followed in the cockpit by a sudden, overwhelming cascade of warnings. The plane yawed slightly to the left and the autothrust system disconnected. Recognizing that a serious malfunction had occurred, Captain de Crespigny pressed the altitude hold button on the autopilot to level the plane, and then everyone’s attention turned to the ECAM.</p><p id="7051">The Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring system, or ECAM, presents the crew with warnings, cautions, and advisories related to the degradation or failure of a huge range of aircraft systems, along with the associated abnormal or emergency procedures. A feature of most modern airliners, ECAM displays have transformed the way pilots deal with in-flight emergencies, helping ensure swift and correct action in response to almost any conceivable mechanical failure. Today, this system would be put to the test.</p><p id="9357">The first message to appear on the ECAM screen was an ENG 2 TURBINE OVERHEAT warning, which was followed within the next 20 seconds by another 34 messages of varying alert levels. The highest priority messages, displayed at the top of the list, all indicated a major problem with the №2 engine, but strangely enough, not its outright failure, because the engine — minus the IP turbine disk and everything in line with it — was in fact still turning. Following the indicated ECAM actions, Captain de Crespigny reduced power to the damaged engine, but instead of correcting the problem, an “ENG 2 FIRE” warning flashed on the screen for one or two seconds, then disappeared.</p><figure><figcaption>A flight crewmember took this photo of the instrument panel during the flight, showing several messages, including a red “warning” level message, on the ECAM display. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="5ff0">As First Officer Hicks made a pan-pan call to air traffic control, one level short of “mayday,” the crew decided that the engine was likely severely damaged and elected to shut it down. As they moved to reduce power, an ENG 2 FAIL message finally appeared on the ECAM. The pilots also attempted to actuate both of the engine’s two built-in fire extinguishers, but only one of them actually fired, and neither of the confirmation lights illuminated. However, as they scrolled through the seemingly unending list of ECAM alerts, only one or two of which could be displayed at one time, it became clear that the engine and its fire extinguishers were hardly the only systems having issues.</p><p id="f41b">When the fragments of the IP turbine disk passed through the wing and belly of the A380, they caused considerable secondary damage along the way, not only to the №2 engine but also to the left wing fuel tank, which sprang a leak; the leading edge wing slat extension mechanism, which took a direct hit; and the aircraft’s electrical system. Additionally, two wire looms in the leading edge of the wing and in the belly area were completely severed, collectively affecting about 650 wires that carried critical information to and from almost every conceivable aircraft system. A brief and hardly exhaustive summary of the damage to the aircraft included impact damage to the left wing upper and lower skin, front spar, internal ribs, and wing-to-fuselage joint; loss of control over the green (left) hydraulic pumps; degradation of the yellow (right) hydraulic system; loss of AC electrical power from engines 1 and 2; loss of one of four AC power distribution systems; loss of functionality of all leading edge slats; partial loss of functionality of the spoilers and ailerons; degradation of control over all remaining engines, resulting in loss of the autothrust system; loss of functionality of the left wing landing gear brakes and anti-skid on the right wing gear brakes; severe disruption of the pneumatic system; loss of both the №1 and №2 low fuel pressure shutoff valves; degradation of the fuel quantity indicating system; reduction in fuel transfer capability; loss of the fuel jettison system; loss of fire protection capability on engines 1 and 2; and much more besides.</p><figure><figcaption>A map of operational flight controls surfaces [green] and inoperative surfaces [red]. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="3733">One of the most serious malfunctions was the loss of the green hydraulic system. Although the system itself was not breached, the severed wires stopped all the green hydraulic pumps, resulting in a loss of pressure that rendered inoperative all systems reliant upon it. Unlike some other wide body aircraft, the A380 has only two hydraulic systems — green and yellow — which mainly supply the left and right sides of the aircraft, respectively. Instead of more redundant hydraulic systems, the A380 has independent backup hydraulic actuators on each individual flight control surface, ensuring that even a total loss of both hydraulic systems will result in minimal flight control difficulties. Nevertheless, direct damage had degraded the plane’s roll control, eliminating the left middle aileron (the A380 has three on each wing) and left wing spoilers 4 and 6. The loss of green hydraulic pressure also caused the failure of the outboard ailerons on both wings, spoilers 2 and 8 on each wing, and spoiler 4 on the right wing. However, the built-in redundancy in the A380 was so great that the remaining spoiler and aileron panels were sufficient to maneuver the airplane despite what amounted to a 65% loss of roll control capability.</p><p id="2987">Initially, the hydraulic system indications confused the crew. Their initial impression was that the damage was confined to the left side of the airplane, so they were surprised to see an indication related to the yellow (right) hydraulic system mixed in with all the other ECAM messages, and they briefly considered whether the messages might be spurious. The same possibility was considered by Qantas technicians on the ground, who were receiving live telemetry data from the aircraft. But by accessing detailed electronic status pages for each aircraft system and cross-checking what was not working, the pilots were able to come to the conclusion that all the failures were most likely real.</p><figure><figcaption>A passenger took this photo in flight, showing turbine fragment exit holes in the upper surface of the wing. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="6f42">At that point the crew needed to make a decision: should they land immediately, or should they wait to action all of the abnormal procedures associated with the dozens of ECAM messages? Assessing that the aircraft was controllable with the autopilot both on and off, they eventually came to an agreement that it was safe to remain airborne, and that they would rather make sure all crewmembers had a complete understanding of the health of every aircraft system before coming in for a landing. The last thing they needed was a surprise on final approach that would force them to go around.</p><p id="4fbd">Having chosen this course of action, the crew requested clearance to enter a holding pattern, and ATC granted them permission to circle over the ocean northeast of Singapore. The crew estimated that it would take at least 30 minutes to work through all of the ECAM actions.</p><p id="5692">In the meantime, the cabin crew had been attempting to get the pilots’ attention using the emergency call button, but all the pilots were so focused on the failures that they initially didn’t notice. Only now did they send Second Officer Mark Johnson to assess the situation in the cabin, whereupon a Qantas pilot riding as a passenger in the upper deck drew his attention to the in-flight entertainment system, which featured a live view of the aircraft from a tail-mounted camera. The digital stream clearly showed a much more literal stream of fuel pouring from the left wing and into the aircraft’s wake, which was also visible with the naked eye from the lower deck. Johnson proceeded down to check for himself, at which point he also observed for the first time that there were two gaping holes in the top of the left wing, surrounded by jagged metal, where the turbine disk fragments had exited.</p><p id="4acc">According to Check Captain David Evans, the cabin crew were concerned that so many passengers were watching the live feed from the tail camera, but in a collective decision, the pilots elected not to turn it off because, in their view, the feed suddenly cutting out would probably be more alarming than anything that could be seen on it.</p><p id="ec59">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>Part of the turbine disk caused serious damage to a building. (ATSB/Posmetro newspaper)</figcaption></figure><p id="3a4e">Meanwhile on the ground, events were taking an unexpected turn. On Batam Island in Indonesia, debris from the №2 engine plunged into a populated area shortly after the failure, resulting in surprise and alarm. Among the debris was a large portion of the failed IP turbine disk, which fell with such force that it cleaved straight through a building, razing a brick wall. Thankfully, no one on Batam was hurt by the debris. However, photographs of locals holding airplane wreckage in what appeared to be Qantas livery were soon posted to Twitter, where they were taken as indications that a Qantas airplane had actually crashed somewhere over Batam. Qantas engineers already knew that the plane was still flying, but they were unable to contact the crew to find out more information. And outside that bubble, the news that a Qantas A380 had possibly gone down spread so quickly that even investors reacted while the plane was still in the air. In fact, the first time Qantas’s CEO learned of the situation was when he received a call asking why the company’s stock price was dropping.</p><figure><figcaption>People collect pieces of the fallen engine cowling on Batam. (Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p id="3597">Up in the air, such concerns were far from the minds of the crew. Working through one ECAM procedure after another, they slowly stabilized various disrupted systems, but as they did so, one problem in particular was getting worse: their fuel situation. With fuel leaking prodigiously from the left wing tank, an imbalance had developed between the left and right wings, prompting an ECAM alert instructing them to open the fuel transfer valves to equalize the fuel levels. However, with a leak clearly occurring and other ECAM messages indicating damage to the fuel transfer system, after a detailed discussion the pilots concluded that following the computer’s instructions would be inadvisable — a great example of why experience and judgment are still necessary even on an aircraft as highly automated as the A380.</p><p id="95dd">In the end, it took 55 minutes to clear all of the ECAM messages, an unprecedented length of time that was certainly far beyond anything any of the pilots had previously imagined. But even then, more considerations remained before they could land. Most notably, the airplane was still more than 40 tons over its maximum landing weight, and among the failures that had occurred was the loss of the fuel jettison system, so it would be impossible to reduce their weight by dumping fuel. The possibility of remaining in the air until they had burned the extra fuel was considered, but with an increasing fuel imbalance between the right and left wings and a 65% loss of roll control, the pilots determined that this would be irresponsible. Their conclusion was that they had to land soon, even if they were over the maximum weight. But would any of the runways at Singapore be long enough to accommodate a significantly overweight A380 with degraded brakes, several faulty spoilers, and no reverse thrust on engine 2? There was certainly reason to doubt.</p><figure><figcaption>The complete flight path of flight 32, including its extensive hold. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="0409">In order to find out for sure, Captain de Crespigny instructed the two Check Captains to determine their required landing distance using the Airbus performance software installed on laptop computers stored in the cockpit. The detailed software allowed them to enter various parameters including the weather, runway condition, and any systems failures, and then calculate whether it was possible to land. But when everything had been entered, the program spit out an unhelpful answer: “no result.”<br> When calculating the landing distance, the software applied a generic “operational coefficient” to account conservatively for variations in pilot techniques that could result in less efficient deceleration. The problem, as investigators would later discover, was that the software applied the coefficient again whenever another system failure was added. With so many system failures on the aircraft, the coefficient was applied a total of 9 times, resulting in a calculated landing distance considerably greater than the length of the available runway. However, Check Captain Evans was able to fix the problem by manually entering their actual landing weight, overriding the program’s assumption of a maximum landing weight. By specifying an landing weight in excess of the maximum, the system logic changed to apply the operational coefficient only once — for unrelated and obscure reasons — and lo and behold, when he ran the numbers this time, the computer said they could just barely land on any of the 4,000-meter runways at Singapore Changi Airport, with only 100 meters to spare. It wasn’t much, but with no better runways anywhere nearby, it would have to do.</p><figure><figcaption>Indonesian police pose with a fallen piece of the airplane. (AP)</figcaption></figure><p id="1b49">Finally ready to commit, Captain de Crespigny now removed the aircraft from its holding pattern and began maneuvering for approach. The crew requested fire trucks on landing due to the fuel leak, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for an on-ground emergency if they overran the runway. They aligned with the runway from considerably farther away than usual in order minimize maneuvering, since the controls felt rather sluggish — mainly the result of the degraded roll control. Captain de Crespigny subsequently carried out further manual control checks during the approach to make sure that the controllability characteristics remained consistent as First Officer Hicks progressively extended the flaps. The pilots also decided to leave engines 1 and 4 at a constant thrust level and adjust their airspeed using only engine 3, because that engine was least affected by the various electronic control system failures.</p><p id="4004">The problems only continued, however. Due to the failure of the green hydraulic system, the landing gear did not drop when the gear lever was selected “down,” forcing the pilots to use a backup system that gravity drops the gear instead. Fortunately, this was successful. Captain de Crespigny also had to maintain a very narrow airspeed band, because there was only a fine margin between the slowest safe speed in the air, below which they would stall, and the highest safe speed on touchdown, above which they would overrun the runway. De Crespigny later recalled that the safe band between these speeds was probably only three or four knots. At one point, the airplane even generated an automatic low energy alert, warning that their airspeed was dropping too low for their present configuration — so de Crespigny increased power slightly on engine 3, and the alert went away.</p><p id="3866">Nevertheless, with the help of the Airbus’s still operational fly-by-wire system and mostly undamaged controls, de Crespigny was able to thread the needle, greasing it onto runway 20C at Changi Airport at 11:46, just shy of two hours after the flight took off. A stall warning briefly sounded just before touchdown, but a split second later they were on the ground and the matter was moot. The pilots applied those brakes that were still working, activated reverse thrust on engine 3 — the A380 only has reversers on its inboard engines — and hoped that it would be enough. The deceleration was not exactly exuberant, but considering how much it takes to stop something the size of an A380 even on a good day, it was impressive enough. Nevertheless, it was not until fairly late in the rollout that the pilots felt certain that they would stop on the runway, and ultimately the performance software was not far off the mark: by the time the plane ground to a halt, only 150 meters remained of the 4,000-meter runway.</p><figure><figcaption>Firefighters spray foam on the airplane after its emergency landing. (Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p id="de92">And yet at that point, even if some of the passengers thought their ordeal was over, it turned out that there was more to come. As the pilots shut down the engines, they observed that the brake temperature on the left body gear brakes had risen alarmingly. These had been the only working brakes on the left side of the aircraft and were subject to considerable strain during the landing, causing them to overheat; the overheating in turn caused four tires to deflate. To make matters worse, fuel was still leaking from the wing, and there was genuine concern that a fire could erupt if spilled fuel contacted the hot brakes. And on top of that, when engines 3 and 4 were shut down, the plane lost electrical power, and when they tried to start the auxiliary power unit, it wouldn’t hook up the electrical system because of damage to the distribution infrastructure. Operating solely on emergency electrical power, the plane now had only one working VHF radio, and it took a few moments for the crew to figure out which one that was so that de Crespigny could contact the airport fire services.</p><figure><figcaption>People disembark from flight 32. (Richard de Crespigny)</figcaption></figure><p id="7d03">Upon making contact with the fire crew, de Crespigny urged them to cool down the brakes, but the firefighter in charge replied with surprising news: the №1 engine was still running, even though the crew had already carried out the shutdown procedure. Damage to systems in the wing had rendered the №1 fuel shutoff valves inoperative, preventing the crew from shutting the engine down by normal means. Both fire extinguisher bottles in engine №1 were also inoperative, preventing the crew from shutting it down by pulling the emergency fire handle. Unable to resolve the issue, de Crespigny instead urged firefighters to approach the brakes while staying as far as possible from the inlet and exhaust ends of the №1 engine. If firefighters got too close to the inlet, they could be sucked into the fan; alternatively, approaching too close behind would result in severe burns, not to mention the jet blast. Nevertheless, the fire crews managed to get close enough to douse the brakes with foam, averting a conflagration.</p><p id="5d18">Throughout this period, the crew also debated whether or not to evacuate the passengers. An evacuation is not always an easy call: statistics show that around 5 to 10% of passengers who evacuate by the emergency escape slides sustain serious injuries, and with 440 passengers on board, including elderly and disabled, that was potentially a rather large number of people. Considering that the fire risk had been tamped down, the crew ultimately agreed that the safest place for the passengers was on the plane — at least for the moment. The flight attendants were asked to move to their stations on the right side of the aircraft to be ready for an emergency evacuation, should the calculus suddenly change, while the pilots attempted to call for a set of stairs to be brought to the aircraft. But with the only working radio being used to liaison with the firefighters, the only other working communications systems aboard the powered-down airplane were the pilots’ cell phones. It took quite some time, and several abortive attempts, before they managed to get through to someone at Qantas who could call the airport services company at Changi Airport and tell them to send a set of boarding stairs.</p><figure><figcaption>Firefighters attempt to drown the still-running №1 engine. (Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p id="8955">After 50 minutes aboard the increasingly sweltering airplane — without power, there was no air conditioning — the stairs finally arrived, and the disembarkation began. It ultimately took an hour to get everyone off through a single exit in an orderly manner, but in the end, all 440 passengers walked away without a single injury.</p><p id="0740">As for the still-running №1 engine, Qantas engineers eventually concluded that the only way to shut it down was to drown it with firefighting foam. Firefighters then poured huge amounts of water and foam into the intake, which proved successful, as the engine finally spooled down and stopped at 14:53, more than three hours after the aircraft landed.</p><p id="e852">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>The crew of flight 32; from left to right: Mark Johnson, Matt Hicks, Richard de Crespigny, David Evans, and Harry Wubben. (Richard de Crespigny)</figcaption></figure><p id="a7ba">The news that the crippled Qantas A380 had landed safely in Singapore came as a great relief to all, especially those who were on board the airplane, who immediately heaped praise on the crew. Captain de Crespigny, in an exemplary act of professionalism, even handed out his personal phone number and stayed for two hours in the Qantas lounge in Singapore to answer passengers’ questions about the flight. He and his crew were hailed as heroes, and not without reason. The sheer number of failures aboard the A380 eclipsed almost any other incident, at least on an aircraft with modern failure monitoring technology. Levelheaded decision-making, teamwork, and crew resource management helped the crew collectively determine the course of action least likely to result in injury or loss of life, with perfect results.</p><p id="0e19">The aircraft itself, however, helped quite a lot. The design of the flight control system ensured that the impact on controllability was limited, even with serious damage to the ailerons and the loss of one of two hydraulic systems. Despite its size, the A380 is known to respond very gracefully to control inputs thanks to the design of its fly-by-wire system, which during the incident remained fully intact, allowing the pilots to focus primarily on decision-making rather than handling the airplane. The ECAM and the detailed systems pages also helped the pilots take full stock of the extent of the failures in a way that was not necessarily possible two decades earlier. Without minimizing the actions of the crew in any way, it’s also fair to say that the design of the A380 incorporated such redundancy and such high safety margins that the risk of a catastrophic crash was probably very low, even with so much damage to the airplane.</p><figure><figcaption>Dark colored residue inside the fuel tank near the breaches testified to a brief flash fire. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="4acb">However, there were a couple of places where the potential for worse damage existed. It goes without saying that if any of the turbine fragments had entered the passenger cabin, there would have been injuries, if not fatalities, even if the plane later landed safely. And perhaps even more worrying, investigators later found signs of a very brief flash fire inside the left wing fuel tank, which likely occurred when an extremely hot turbine fragment contacted fuel vapors in the tank ullage. Research conducted as part of the investigation into the 1996 crash of TWA flight 800, which was caused by an explosion of the center fuel tank, found that the wing tanks on commercial airliners contained flammable fuel-air mixtures around 7% of the time. However, on Qantas flight 32, the temperature in the tank was too low for the fuel-air mixture to reach a flammable concentration, and investigators determined that the brief ignition of vapors during passage of the turbine fragment likely failed to raise the temperature of the rest of the fuel sufficiently to sustain combustion. Had this fuel continued to burn, causing an explosion or sustained wing fire, then the outcome could have been very different.</p><figure><figcaption>Severed wires in the wing leading edge. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="b8cd">Even though these worst case scenarios didn’t happen, the level of damage was still far beyond anything Airbus or Rolls-Royce had anticipated, and both companies were keen to know why — as were investigators with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), who were charged with finding out. Initial efforts established that an oil leak caused an internal fire that led to the failure of the IP turbine disk drive arm, as described previously. But that didn’t answer one of the manufacturers’ most burning questions, which was why the disk was allowed to overspeed until it burst — because according to the engine’s design philosophy, this should never have happened.</p><p id="d712">The risk posed by a burst engine disk, whether it’s a fan, compressor, or turbine, is well known in the industry. Numerous catastrophic accidents have occurred as a result of burst disks, either due to overspeed or material defects. Demonstrated side effects of burst disks include severe flight control damage (<a rel="noopener" href="https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/fields-of-fortune-the-crash-of-united-airlines-flight-232-9cf65ae14c68">see United flight 232, Sioux City, Iowa, 1989,</a> in which fan disk debris resulted in the failure of all hydraulic systems, a loss of control on landing, and 111 deaths); direct fatal impacts to passengers (<a rel="noopener" href="https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/written-in-metal-the-story-of-delta-air-lines-flight-1288-1205599c1b55">see Delta flight 1288, Pensacola, Florida, 1996,</a> in which a compressor disk entered the passenger cabin on takeoff, killing two passengers); and in-flight fires (<a rel="noopener" href="https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/under-the-iron-curtain-the-crashes-of-lot-polish-airlines-flights-007-and-5055-f0f1c0ba4a64">see LOT Polish Airlines flight 5055, Warsaw, Poland, 1987,</a> which crashed after a fragment of a burst turbine disk started a fire in the baggage compartment, killing 183). Accidents such as these inform aircraft certification guidelines, which classify a disk failure as a “hazardous” event whose probability must be “extremely remote” (defined as one event or less per 100 million operating hours). And just in case such an event were to happen anyway, rules introduced following the United accident in Sioux City also require manufacturers to minimize the potential secondary failures that could occur as a result, which was part of why the A380 had individual backup hydraulics for all critical control surfaces.</p><figure><figcaption>Officials inspect the damaged №2 engine. (Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p id="31ed">In general, the accident aboard flight 32 demonstrated that the requirements for damage minimization were met, with the exception of the resultant inability to cut fuel to the №1 engine, which was explicitly defined in certification guidelines as undesirable. This success alone distinguished it from previous, fatal disk release accidents. But Rolls-Royce was concerned that the disk burst at all. During development of the Trent 900, the company calculated that in the event that the IP turbine disk became disconnected from the drive shaft, the disk would not accelerate fast enough to burst. Essentially, it was believed that without the turbine to drive it, the IP compressor would decelerate until air no longer flowed smoothly over its blades, causing a compressor stall that would subsequently spread to the HP compressor behind it. This should lead to an engine surge, in which the disruption of airflow through the compressor section allows pressurized air from the combustion chamber to surge forward toward the front of the engine. In theory, this would reduce the amount of air flowing rearward through the annulus gas path and over the IP turbine, relieving the load on the turbine and preventing it from accelerating beyond its critical speed.</p><p id="a052">A key assumption here was that the IP compressor stall would happen faster than the advanced electronic engine control system could detect the surge and reduce fuel flow, which would bring down the combustion chamber pressure to clear the surge and restore normal airflow. In the actual event, investigators found that although the IP compressor stalled and a surge occurred, the automatic reduction in fuel flow came swiftly enough to enable the partial recovery of the HP compressor, which resumed forcing pressurized air into the combustion chamber and thence over the turbine. This unexpectedly robust airflow provided the mechanical energy required to accelerate the IP turbine disk beyond its critical speed. Rolls-Royce engineers were unable to conclusively determine why this occurred. Nevertheless, to prevent it from happening again, the company developed an IP turbine overspeed function for the electronic engine control that directly monitors the IP turbine disk and instantly cuts fuel flow to the engine if the disk starts spinning too fast.</p><p id="3d9e">◊◊◊</p></div><div><p id="03b1">Of course, if you’ve gotten this far, then you’re probably aware that one critical question remains. This entire chain of events began when the oil feed stub pipe — remember that? — developed a leak. If you need a refresher, this was the short segment of pipe that passed through the outer and inner sections of the bearing hub to deliver oil to the bearing chamber. So why did this happen?</p><p id="14f4">The answer, as it turns out, was visible to the naked eye. When investigators removed the faulty pipe, they found that one wall of the pipe was simply too thin. Unable to withstand the stresses of normal operation, it began suffering from metal fatigue and failed after only 677 flights.</p><figure><figcaption>How the oil feed stub pipe and its fittings were constructed. (ATSB, annotations mine)</figcaption></figure><p id="014e">The oil feed stub pipe was designed to have a slightly wider inner diameter at the bottom end in order to accommodate a filter. This required widening the interior diameter of the pipe by drilling a “counter bore” in from one end, as shown above. The center of the counter bore should be aligned with the center of the main bore. But on the stub pipe recovered from the failed Qantas engine, the counter bore was displaced to one side by approximately half a millimeter, resulting in an irregular wall thickness that varied from 1.42 mm on one side to only 0.35 mm on the other. It was this extra thin part of the pipe wall that failed on flight 32.</p><p id="b98e">The story of how the counter bore became offset by half a millimeter has implications that far outstrip the physical size of the error. The following section is going to involve some fairly complex discussions of the design and manufacturing process, but I hope you’ll bear with me.</p><figure><figcaption>How the bores for the stub pipe were defined according to the design drawings. (ATSB, annotations mine)</figcaption></figure><p id="bafb">When the designs for the HP/IP bearing hub assembly were drawn up during the early 2000s, the design engineers followed standard practice by defining the position and dimensions of the oil feed stub pipe and associated features relative to a fixed point, referred to as a “datum.” This point, designated datum AA, was defined as the hole in the outer section of the bearing hub through which the oil feed stub pipe passes on its way to the bearing chamber. This hole will henceforth be known as the “outer clearance hole.” All other aspects of the stub pipe fitting were positioned with respect to the centerline of this hole.</p><p id="c311">In line with the outer clearance hole, the designs also called for an “interference bore” in the inner hub into which the bottom end of the stub pipe would fit. The interference bore was designed to be very slightly narrower than the stub pipe so that the pipe end, once tapped firmly into place within it, would be held inside by friction. This bore was required to be centered on datum AA so as to keep it perfectly aligned with the outer clearance hole.</p><p id="a407">Next, an “inner hub counter bore” would be drilled in from the inside of the inner hub, meeting in the middle with the interference bore. This was the hole through which the oil from the stub pipe would enter the bearing chamber.</p><p id="2407">Then, once these holes were machined, the oil feed stub pipe itself would be inserted through the outer clearance hole and into the interference bore, then welded in place.</p></div><div><p id="6465">Finally, working from the inside through the inner hub counter bore, the stub pipe counter bore would be drilled to a specified depth to accommodate the filter. (This was the bore that was later found to be offset by half a millimeter.) According to the design specifications, the stub pipe counter bore should be in line with datum AA, with a tolerance of Ø 0.10 mm. In plain English, that means that the center of the counter bore should lie within a 0.10-mm-diameter circle centered on datum AA. It does not mean that the bore can be 0.10 mm from the datum, but rather <em>that the bore can lie within 0.05 mm of the datum in any direction, for a total range of possible positions measuring 0.10 mm across.</em> (Hereinafter, the term “offset” refers to the distance of a given point from the datum, while the terms “tolerance” and “non-conformance,” indicated with the “Ø” symbol, refer to the diameter of a circle centered on the datum with its edge at the given point. As confusing as this may be for some readers, this is how tolerances are measured in real life engineering, so if engineers can deal with it, so can you (hopefully).)</p><figure><figcaption>How the stub pipe and its fittings were defined according to the manufacturing stage drawings. (ATSB, annotations mine)</figcaption></figure><p id="78a8">In any case, when it came time to plan the actual manufacture of the bearing hub assembly, some changes had to be made to this process. The basic problem was that once the oil feed stub pipe was inserted into the hub assembly, it would no longer be possible for the machining computer to find the location of datum AA, because the outer clearance hole by which it was defined would be too full of stub pipe. That meant that it would be impossible to determine exactly where the oil feed stub pipe counter bore should subsequently be drilled.</p><p id="bb4c">In order to fix this problem, Rolls-Royce manufacturing engineers decided to redefine the position of the stub pipe counter bore with relation to a new datum, named datum M, which corresponded to the center of the inner hub counter bore. At the same time, the tolerance for the stub pipe counter bore was changed from Ø 0.10 mm to Ø 0.20 mm for unknown reasons. But the bigger problem was that the position of the stub pipe itself was determined by the position of the interference bore, which was still defined by datum AA. Because the position of the inner hub counter bore did not have a specified tolerance relative to datum AA — in fact, in the original design plan, its position didn’t matter much at all — there was no direct assurance that datum M would line up with datum AA, and thus it could not be assured that the stub pipe would line up with its own counter bore either. At this point you might already be starting to see the problem.</p><figure><figcaption>How the series of bores was actually drilled. (ATSB, annotations mine)</figcaption></figure><p id="4890">The actual manufacturing process, based on the above specifications that were written into the manufacturing stage drawings, proceeded as follows. First, the basic hub assemblies were delivered to the Rolls-Royce machining plant in Hucknall, UK, with the outer clearance hole already drilled (and datum AA thus defined), but without the interference bore or the inner hub counter bore (datum M). Instead, a reference hole was drilled, with reference to datum AA, in the location that would later become the inner hub counter bore. A temporary timing pin was inserted into this reference hole, which was then used by the computerized machining equipment to orient the hub so that the machining arm aligned with datum AA. So far so good.</p><p id="4b4c">Subsequently, the interference bore was drilled, with reference to datum AA. Then came the most dastardly part: in order to drill the inner hub counter bore, the timing pin had to be removed, but the machine also needed to remember its location in order to know where to drill. Therefore, the machining computer used specialized probes to measure and record the position of the timing pin within three-dimensional space, allowing subsequent removal of the pin. At that point the only thing ensuring the correct alignment of the inner hub counter bore — and thus datum M, and thus the stub pipe counter bore — was the assumption that the recorded position of the timing pin remained accurate.</p><figure><figcaption>Can you see the offset in the drilled position of the inner hub counter bore? (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="b667">Unfortunately, that assumption proved incorrect. The problem was that while the interference bore had been drilled from the outside, the inner hub counter bore had to be drilled from the inside, which necessitated the reconfiguration of the clamps holding the hub assembly in place, in order to make room for the machining arm. During this process, the hub assembly sometimes — but not always — shifted imperceptibly.</p><p id="5634">If the hub shifted, then when the machining process resumed, the recorded location of the timing pin (and thus datum AA) would by slightly offset from its actual, new location, and the machine would subsequently drill the inner hub counter bore offset by an equal amount. That meant that datum M — again, defined as the center of the inner hub counter bore — would also be offset from datum AA by that amount.</p><p id="b4db">Subsequently, the stub pipe was inserted through the outer clearance hole and into the interference bore, where it was welded in place. The stub pipe counter bore was then drilled into the end of the pipe with reference to datum M, which, again, would be offset if the hub had shifted. In the case of the components involved in the accident, the hub presumably shifted by just under half a millimeter, resulting in an equal offset of both the inner hub counter bore and the stub pipe counter bore relative to the pipe itself. As a side effect, one wall of the pipe was too thin.</p><figure><figcaption>The final product is created with a thin stub pipe wall. The best way to notice this offset of the stub pipe counter bore is by measuring the position of the interference bore relative to datum M. Measuring the interference bore relative to datum AA will not reveal the error. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="5f50">In the original design, no stub pipe wall thickness was specified; instead, adequate wall thickness was ensured by the alignment of both the pipe (via the interference bore) and its counter bore with the same datum (AA). The fact that this assurance could be lost when using the reworked manufacturing process was not recognized at the time, nor were the subsequent inspections tailored to find such a defect.</p><p id="7fa8">In this regard, two inspections are of note, both of which involved the use of a computerized coordinate machine, or CMM. One of these, known as OP 230, involved only the measurement of the stub pipe counter bore position relative to datum M, which provided no useful information as to its position relative to the pipe itself. A visual inspection was also conducted at this stage, but it was not possible for an inspector to observe the stub pipe wall thickness at the counter bore because this end of the pipe was welded inside the interference bore, completely out of sight.</p><p id="6d6e">Another inspection, called OP 70, occurred prior to OP 230 and presented a better opportunity to notice the error. During this inspection, the CMM measured the position of the interference bore relative to datum M, even though it was machined with reference to datum AA. If datum M and datum AA were offset by more than the specified tolerance for the interference bore, this should have caused the CMM to report an error in the position of the interference bore. The tolerance for this bore was supposed to be Ø 0.05 mm according to the design drawings, but was changed to Ø 0.5 mm in the manufacturing drawings without explanation. Even so, the non-conformance on the accident hub was between Ø 0.90 and Ø 0.98 (an offset of 0.45–0.49 mm), which should have been flagged by the machine. The CMM records from the accident hub were not retained, so it was not possible for investigators to confirm that the error was actually registered. However, even if it was, a follow-up inspection might have concluded that the error was false — because the manufacturing drawings specified the position of the interference bore relative to datum AA, and inspectors were generally unaware that the CMM was actually measuring the position of the bore relative to datum M. Therefore, if inspectors saw that the position of the interference bore was flagged as out of tolerance, they could refer to the manufacturing drawings, check the bore’s position with reference to datum AA, find everything to be normal, and give the hub a clean bill of health.</p><figure><figcaption>A coordinate measuring machine used at the Hucknall facility. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="7b08">For the above reasons, numerous HP/IP bearing assembly hubs were released for service with oil feed stub pipe walls that may or may not have been too thin. No one was aware of this until 2009, after the accident hub was manufactured, when Hucknall Casings and Structures decided to change the datum for the oil feed stub pipe counter bore in order to simplify the manufacturing process. The change called for the use of datum AF, which was defined as the center of the pipe’s main bore, to position the pipe’s counter bore. Subsequently, two previously manufactured stub pipe counter bores were measured against this new datum and found to have a non-conformance of Ø 0.5 mm (or an offset of 0.25 mm, about half that of the accident pipe). As a reminder, the tolerance for the stub pipe counter bore was supposed to be Ø 0.20 (for a maximum permissible offset of 0.1 mm).</p><p id="8af6">This problem was soon called to the attention of a design engineer, who escalated it up the chain of command in order to figure out what to do about the approximately 100 oil feed stub pipes that had already been released for service. At issue was whether the error would have safety implications. If there were no safety implications, then the plant could issue what it termed a “retrospective concession,” allowing the improperly manufactured products to remain in service. But if there were safety implications, then there would need to be corrective actions, perhaps even a recall. In order to find out, a manufacturing engineer was assigned to conduct a statistical analysis of the likely distribution of oil stub pipe counter bore non-conformances based on measurements taken on nine previously manufactured hubs that were still at the facility. Using a statistical analysis program, the engineer found that the likely maximum non-conformance of any stub pipe counter bore was Ø 0.7 mm (an offset of 0.35 mm). Engineering calculations showed that the resulting wall thickness would not seriously alter the service life of the stub pipe, which meant that there was no safety implications.</p><figure><figcaption>The revised manufacturing datum was much more robust, but the implications for previously produced hub assemblies were not adequately appreciated. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="2b98">In reality, this statistical analysis was flawed because of the low number of data points, and the lack of assurance that the dataset of nine hubs was representative of hubs manufactured in previous years. Therefore, the result should really have been read as “a maximum likely non-conformance of Ø 0.7 mm plus or minus an uncertainty factor of unspecified magnitude.” However, the engineer was unfamiliar with the statistical analysis program and failed to clearly convey this uncertainty in the report that was submitted to the Non-Conformance Authority, the engineer empowered to make decisions about the acceptability of non-conformances. The Non-Conformance Authority took the report to mean that there were no safety implications, and signed off on the retroactive concession allowing the affected pipes, including the accident pipe, to remain in service.</p><p id="dd46">Investigators noted that according to Rolls-Royce’s internal procedures, a retrospective concession also required the signatures of the Business Quality Director and more importantly the Chief Engineer, who had the power to decide whether any fleet-wide actions were warranted. Neither of these signatures were obtained for the retrospective concession that was granted to the oil feed stub pipes. The ATSB observed that the Hucknall facility was using the same paperwork for retrospective concessions as it used for concessions on non-conforming parts that were caught in-house, which did not require these extra signatures, so no signature field for them was provided. There was also nothing on the paperwork to indicate whether a concession was retrospective or not. As such, the Non-Conformance Authority might have been unaware that they lacked the right to unilaterally approve the concession without the consent of a higher-ranking engineer.</p><p id="8d31">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>Another view of the damaged engine. (ATSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="d612">After the accident, measurements were taken on all in-service HP/IP bearing oil feed stub pipes to determine the alignment of their counter bores. The majority were outside the Ø 0.20 mm tolerance on the manufacturing drawings, and several of them had non-conformances greater than the Ø 0.7 mm predicted by the statistical analysis. Four of the stub pipes had non-conformances even greater than the accident pipe, and two were found to have a staggering non-conformance in the vicinity of Ø 1.2 mm. These pipes likely would have failed in service, potentially causing repeats of the Qantas incident, had they not been caught.</p><p id="41f7">Investigators also criticized the culture within the Hucknall facility that manufactured the HP/IP bearing hubs, identifying signs of complacency and widespread procedural non-compliance. A paperwork review showed that the required signatures were missing from 131 out of 138 retrospective concessions issued between 2009 and 2011, and a large number of minor non-conformances had not been properly handled through the normal chain of command. An internal review in 2007 had also previously found that the Hucknall facility lacked a “strong focus on quality within the business.” This appeared to extend to the creation of the original manufacturing drawings, which had been altered from the design drawings without the consent of the design engineers. Furthermore, initial inspections at the start of the production run were supposed to verify that the manufacturing process was creating products that satisfied the “design intent,” but the initial products were checked against the manufacturing drawings, not the design drawings. This verification was circular in nature and did nothing to ensure that the design intent was actually met. Had the design drawings been used, as procedures demanded, engineers likely would have been discovered that the process was not producing stub pipes with the required tolerances.</p><p id="b31e">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>Another passenger view of the upper wing surface damage.

And second, I will speculate that everything you’ve read thus far has probably left a positive impression of modern aviation safety. The sequence of events required to merely wound, not kill, this Airbus A380 was absurdly long, passing numerous gates at which the progress toward disaster could have been stopped. And yet the system still held its ground. According to the swiss cheese model of safety, an accident happens when the holes in the stacked swiss cheese slices align, allowing a hazard to pass straight through unhindered. The hazard in this case penetrated countless swiss cheese slices, from the drawing board to the manufacturing floor to the inspection room and beyond. But the industry has put up so many slices of cheese that even this impressive run was insufficient to put a scratch on so much as a single passenger. Even the airplane itself ultimately survived: after a marathon repair that lasted 535 days and cost $139 million, the A380 Nancy-Bird Walton triumphantly returned to the skies in 2012.</p><p id="0a27">A number of intangible lessons can be drawn from both the successes and failures along the road to Qantas 32, from the continued importance of experience and judgment in the cockpit, to the negative consequences of believing that a tiny non-conformance couldn’t possibly be consequential. The fact remains that a deviation of less than half a millimeter nearly brought down the world’s largest passenger airliner. Aviation is, and has always been, unforgiving of even the smallest flaws. The devices, designs, and decisions that kept Qantas flight 32 in the air didn’t appear from nothing, but are rather the collective result of rules, regulations, and forward-thinking policies imposed by people upon that unforgiving substrate. In that sense, the upshot of the drama aboard flight 32 is that at the end of the day, the system is working.</p><p id="883e">_______________________________________________________________</p><p id="2f3b"><em>Don’t forget to listen to Controlled Pod Into Terrain, my new podcast (with slides!), where I discuss aerospace disasters with my cohosts Ariadne and J! </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ControlledPodIntoTerrain" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Check out our channel here</em></a><em>, and </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEEuyZ4_qHo" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>listen to our latest episode, in which we break down the incredibly poor decision-making aboard Pinnacle Airlines flight 3701. </em></a><em>Alternatively, download audio-only versions via </em><a href="https://rss.com/podcasts/cpit/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>RSS.com</em></a><em>, or look us up on Spotify!</em></p><p id="7809">_______________________________________________________________</p><p id="52c0"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/18eg22j/2010_the_near_crash_of_qantas_flight_32_an_engine/?" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Join the discussion of this article on Reddit</a></p><p id="5f25"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/Admiral_Cloudberg" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Support me on Patreon</a> (Note: I do not earn money from views on Medium!)</p><p id="af1f"><a href="https://twitter.com/KyraCloudy" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Follow me on Twitter</a></p><p id="c488">Visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AdmiralCloudberg/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">r/admiralcloudberg</a> to read and discuss over 250 similar articles</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick Start</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation instructions</h3>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to install Gooey is via <code>pip</code></p>

<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can install Gooey by cloning the project to your local directory</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey.git"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey.git
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">run <code>setup.py</code></p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h3>
<p dir="auto">Gooey is attached to your code via a simple decorator on whichever method has your <code>argparse</code> declarations (usually <code>main</code>).</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from gooey import Gooey

@Gooey      <--- all it takes! :)
def main():
  parser = ArgumentParser(...)
  # rest of code"><pre><code>from gooey import Gooey

@Gooey      &lt;--- all it takes! :)
def main():
  parser = ArgumentParser(...)
  # rest of code
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Different styling and functionality can be configured by passing arguments into the decorator.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# options
@Gooey(advanced=Boolean,          # toggle whether to show advanced config or not 
       language=language_string,  # Translations configurable via json
       auto_start=True,           # skip config screens all together
       target=executable_cmd,     # Explicitly set the subprocess executable arguments
       program_name='name',       # Defaults to script name
       program_description,       # Defaults to ArgParse Description
       default_size=(610, 530),   # starting size of the GUI
       required_cols=1,           # number of columns in the &quot;Required&quot; section
       optional_cols=2,           # number of columns in the &quot;Optional&quot; section
       dump_build_config=False,   # Dump the JSON Gooey uses to configure itself
       load_build_config=None,    # Loads a JSON Gooey-generated configuration
       monospace_display=False)   # Uses a mono-spaced font in the output screen
)
def main():
  parser = ArgumentParser(...)
  # rest of code"><pre><code># options
@Gooey(advanced=Boolean,          # toggle whether to show advanced config or not 
       language=language_string,  # Translations configurable via json
       auto_start=True,           # skip config screens all together
       target=executable_cmd,     # Explicitly set the subprocess executable arguments
       program_name='name',       # Defaults to script name
       program_description,       # Defaults to ArgParse Description
       default_size=(610, 530),   # starting size of the GUI
       required_cols=1,           # number of columns in the "Required" section

       dump_build_config=False,   # Dump the JSON Gooey uses to configure itself
       load_build_config=None,    # Loads a JSON Gooey-generated configuration
       monospace_display=False)   # Uses a mono-spaced font in the output screen
)
def main():
  parser = ArgumentParser(...)
  # rest of code
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">See: <a href="#how-does-it-work">How does it Work</a> section for details on each option.</p>
<p dir="auto">Gooey will do its best to choose sensible widget defaults to display in the GUI. However, if more fine tuning is desired, you can use the drop-in replacement <code>GooeyParser</code> in place of <code>ArgumentParser</code>. This lets you control which widget displays in the GUI. See: <a href="#gooeyparser">GooeyParser</a></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from gooey import Gooey, GooeyParser

@Gooey
def main():
  parser = GooeyParser(description=&quot;My Cool GUI Program!&quot;) 
  parser.add_argument('Filename', widget=&quot;FileChooser&quot;)
  parser.add_argument('Date', widget=&quot;DateChooser&quot;)
  ..."><pre><code>from gooey import Gooey, GooeyParser

@Gooey
def main():
  parser = GooeyParser(description="My Cool GUI Program!") 
  parser.add_argument('Filename', widget="FileChooser")
  parser.add_argument('Date', widget="DateChooser")
  ...
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h3>
<p dir="auto">Gooey downloaded and installed? Great! Wanna see it in action? Head over the the <a href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples">Examples Repository</a> to download a few ready-to-go example scripts. They'll give you a quick tour of all Gooey's various layouts, widgets, and features.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples/archive/master.zip">Direct Download</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is it?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Gooey converts your Console Applications into end-user-friendly GUI applications. It lets you focus on building robust, configurable programs in a familiar way, all without having to worry about how it will be presented to and interacted with by your average user.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Because as much as we love the command prompt, the rest of the world looks at it like an ugly relic from the early '80s. On top of that, more often than not programs need to do more than just one thing, and that means giving options, which previously meant either building a GUI, or trying to explain how to supply arguments to a Console Application. Gooey was made to (hopefully) solve those problems. It makes programs easy to use, and pretty to look at!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who is this for?</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you're building utilities for yourself, other programmers, or something which produces a result that you want to capture and pipe over to another console application (e.g. *nix philosophy utils), Gooey probably isn't the tool for you. However, if you're building 'run and done,' around-the-office-style scripts, things that shovel bits from point A to point B, or simply something that's targeted at a non-programmer, Gooey is the perfect tool for the job. It lets you build as complex of an application as your heart desires all while getting the GUI side for free.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Gooey is attached to your code via a simple decorator on whichever method has your <code>argparse</code> declarations.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Gooey
def my_run_func():
  parser = ArgumentParser(...)
  # rest of code"><pre><code>@Gooey
def my_run_func():
  parser = ArgumentParser(...)
  # rest of code
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">At run-time, it parses your Python script for all references to <code>ArgumentParser</code>. (The older <code>optparse</code> is currently not supported.) These references are then extracted, assigned a <code>component type</code> based on the <code>'action'</code> they provide, and finally used to assemble the GUI.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mappings:</h4>
<p dir="auto">Gooey does its best to choose sensible defaults based on the options it finds. Currently, <code>ArgumentParser._actions</code> are mapped to the following <code>WX</code> components.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GooeyParser</h3>
<p dir="auto">If the above defaults aren't cutting it, you can control the exact widget type by using the drop-in <code>ArgumentParser</code> replacement <code>GooeyParser</code>. This gives you the additional keyword argument <code>widget</code>, to which you can supply the name of the component you want to display. Best part? You don't have to change any of your <code>argparse</code> code to use it. Drop it in, and you're good to go.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from argparse import ArgumentParser
....

def main(): 
    parser = ArgumentParser(description=&quot;My Cool Gooey App!&quot;)
    parser.add_argument('filename', help=&quot;name of the file to process&quot;) "><pre><code>from argparse import ArgumentParser
....

def main(): 
    parser = ArgumentParser(description="My Cool Gooey App!")
    parser.add_argument('filename', help="name of the file to process") 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Given then above, Gooey would select a normal <code>TextField</code> as the widget type like this:</p>
<p dir="auto">
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/f5393e20-07c5-11e5-88e9-c153fc3ecfaa.PNG"><img src="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/f5393e20-07c5-11e5-88e9-c153fc3ecfaa.PNG"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">However, by dropping in <code>GooeyParser</code> and supplying a <code>widget</code> name, you can display a much more user friendly <code>FileChooser</code></p>

    parser = GooeyParser(description=&quot;My Cool Gooey App!&quot;)

<p dir="auto">Gooey is international ready and easily ported to your host language. Languages are controlled via an argument to the <code>Gooey</code> decorator.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Gooey(language='russian')

    ... "><pre><code>@Gooey(language='russian')
def main():

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">All program text is stored externally in <code>json</code> files. So adding new language support is as easy as pasting a few key/value pairs in the <code>gooey/languages/</code> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to some awesome <a href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey/graphs/contributors">contributors</a>, Gooey currently comes pre-stocked with over 18 different translations!</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Grouping Inputs</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">By default, if you're using Argparse with Gooey, your inputs will be split into two buckets: <code>positional</code> and <code>optional</code>. However, these aren't always the most descriptive groups to present to your user. You can arbitrarily bucket inputs into logic groups and customize the layout of each.</p>
<p dir="auto">With <code>argparse</code> this is done via <code>add_argument_group()</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/35487956-a4c9915e-0436-11e8-8a11-fd21528aedf0.png"><img src="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/35487956-a4c9915e-0436-11e8-8a11-fd21528aedf0.png" width="410"></a></p>

search_group = parser.add_argument_group(

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can add arguments to the group as normal</p>

<p dir="auto">Which will display them as part of the group within the UI.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Run Modes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Gooey has a handful of presentation modes so you can tailor its layout to your content type and user's level or experience.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Advanced</h3>
<p dir="auto">The default view is the "full" or "advanced" configuration screen. It has two different layouts depending on the type of command line interface it's wrapping. For most applications, the flat layout will be the one to go with, as its layout matches best to the familiar CLI schema of a primary command followed by many options (e.g. Curl, FFMPEG).</p>
<p dir="auto">On the other side is the Column Layout. This one is best suited for CLIs that have multiple paths or are made up of multiple little tools each with their own arguments and options (think: git). It displays the primary paths along the left column, and their corresponding arguments in the right. This is a great way to package a lot of varied functionality into a single app.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/f06a36cc-08ad-11e5-843e-9322df96d4d6.png"><img src="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/f06a36cc-08ad-11e5-843e-9322df96d4d6.png"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Both views present each action in the <code>Argument Parser</code> as a unique GUI component. It makes it ideal for presenting the program to users which are unfamiliar with command line options and/or Console Programs in general. Help messages are displayed along side each component to make it as clear as possible which each widget does.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Setting the layout style:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, the layouts can't be explicitly specified via a parameter (on the TODO!). The layouts are built depending on whether or not there are <code>subparsers</code> used in your code base. So, if you want to trigger the <code>Column Layout</code>, you'll need to add a <code>subparser</code> to your <code>argparse</code> code.</p>
<p dir="auto">It can be toggled via the <code>advanced</code> parameter in the <code>Gooey</code> decorator.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@gooey(advanced=True)
def main():
    # rest of code   "><pre><code>@gooey(advanced=True)
def main():
    # rest of code   
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic</h3>
<p dir="auto">The basic view is best for times when the user is familiar with Console Applications, but you still want to present something a little more polished than a simple terminal. The basic display is accessed by setting the <code>advanced</code> parameter in the <code>gooey</code> decorator to <code>False</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@gooey(advanced=False)
def main():
    # rest of code  "><pre><code>@gooey(advanced=False)
def main():
    # rest of code

<hr>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">No Config</h3>
<p dir="auto">No Config pretty much does what you'd expect: it doesn't show a configuration screen. It hops right to the <code>display</code> section and begins execution of the host program. This is the one for improving the appearance of little one-off scripts.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use this mode, set <code>auto_start=True</code> in the Gooey decorator.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Gooey(auto_start=True)

<p dir="auto">Before passing the user's inputs to your program, Gooey can optionally run a special pre-flight validation to check that all arguments pass your specified validations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Gooey piggy backs on the <code>type</code> parameter available to most Argparse Argument types.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>How to enable the pre-flight validation</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">By default, Gooey won't run the validation. Why? This feature is fairly experimental and does a lot of intense Monkey Patching behind the scenes. As such, it's currently opt-in.</p>

<p dir="auto">Giving visual progress feedback with Gooey is easy! If you're already displaying textual progress updates, you can tell Gooey to hook into that existing output in order to power its Progress Bar.</p>
<p dir="auto">For simple cases, output strings which resolve to a numeric representation of the completion percentage (e.g. <code>Progress 83%</code>) can be pattern matched and turned into a progress bar status with a simple regular expression (e.g. <code>@Gooey(progress_regex=r"^progress: (\d+)%$")</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For more complicated outputs, you can pass in a custom evaluation expression (<code>progress_expr</code>) to transform regular expression matches as needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Output strings which satisfy the regular expression can be hidden from the console via the <code>hide_progress_msg</code> parameter (e.g. <code>@Gooey(progress_regex=r"^progress: (\d+)%$", hide_progress_msg=True)</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Regex and Processing Expression</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Gooey(progress_regex=r&quot;^progress: (?P<current>\d+)/(?P<total>\d+)$&quot;,

<p dir="auto">There are lots of options for telling Gooey about progress as your program is running. Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples">Gooey Examples</a> repository for more detailed usage and examples!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Elapsed / Remaining Time</h3>
<p dir="auto">Gooey also supports tracking elapsed / remaining time when progress is used! This is done in a similar manner to that of the project <a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm">tqdm</a>. This can be enabled with <code>timing_options</code>, the <code>timing_options</code> argument takes in a dictionary with the keys <code>show_time_remaining</code> and <code>hide_time_remaining_on_complete</code>. The default behavior is True for <code>show_time_remaining</code> and False for <code>hide_time_remaining_on_complete</code>. This will only work when <code>progress_regex</code> and <code>progress_expr</code> are used.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Gooey(progress_regex=r&quot;^progress: (?P<current>\d+)/(?P<total>\d+)$&quot;,

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Customizing Icons</h2>
<p dir="auto">Gooey comes with a set of six default icons. These can be overridden with your own custom images/icons by telling Gooey to search additional directories when initializing. This is done via the <code>image_dir</code> argument to the <code>Gooey</code> decorator.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Gooey(program_name='Custom icon demo', image_dir='/path/to/my/image/directory')
def main():
    # rest of program"><pre><code>@Gooey(program_name='Custom icon demo', image_dir='/path/to/my/image/directory')
def main():
    # rest of program
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Images are discovered by Gooey based on their <em>filenames</em>. So, for example, in order to supply a custom configuration icon, simply place an image with the filename <code>config_icon.png</code> in your images directory. These are the filenames which can be overridden:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>program_icon.png</li>
<li>success_icon.png</li>
<li>running_icon.png</li>
<li>loading_icon.gif</li>
<li>config_icon.png</li>
<li>error_icon.png</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The tl;dr <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller">pyinstaller</a> version is to drop this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriskiehl/Gooey/master/docs/packaging/build-win.spec" rel="nofollow">build.spec</a> into the root directory of your application. Edit its contents so that the <code>APPPNAME</code> and <code>name</code> are relevant to your project and the <code>pathex</code> value points to your applications root, then execute <code>pyinstaller -F --windowed build.spec</code> to bundle your app into a ready-to-go executable.</p>
