<p dir="auto">Mathesar is a web application that makes working with PostgreSQL databases both simple and powerful. It empowers users of all technical skill levels to view, edit, query, and collaborate on data with a familiar spreadsheet-like interface—no code needed. It’s self hosted, can be deployed in minutes, and works directly with PostgreSQL databases, schemas, and tables without extra abstractions. The project is 100% open source and maintained by Mathesar Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mathesar is as scalable as Postgres and supports any size or complexity of data, making it ideal for workflows involving production databases. It requires minimal setup, and integrates into your existing infrastructure. Because Mathesar is self-hosted, your data never leaves your servers, and access control based on Postgres roles and privileges keeps your database secure without adding unnecessary risk.</p>

<p dir="auto">Using databases shouldn't require technical expertise or expensive, closed-off tools. Databases are incredibly powerful, but they're often trapped behind complex interfaces that are hard to use or limit how people can access and share their data. We want to change that by building user-friendly tools that unlock the power of existing databases without sacrificing accessibility, portability, or extensibility.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mathesar is our answer: an open-source platform designed to unlock the full potential of PostgreSQL, one of the most powerful and trusted open-source databases. Mathesar is easy to use, interoperable, and extensible, while also giving you complete control over your data. As a nonprofit, we're committed to keeping Mathesar 100% open source and available to everyone—because better ways to work with data mean better decisions, and better decisions lead to a better world.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wiz Research has identified a publicly accessible ClickHouse database belonging to DeepSeek, which allows full control over database operations, including the ability to access internal data. The exposure includes over a million lines of log streams containing chat history, secret keys, backend details, and other highly sensitive information. The Wiz Research team immediately and responsibly disclosed the issue to DeepSeek, which promptly secured the exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>In this blog post, we will detail our discovery and also consider the broader implications for the industry at large.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="executive-summary-2"></a><strong>Executive Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has recently garnered significant media attention due to its groundbreaking AI models, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model. This model rivals leading AI systems like OpenAI’s o1 in performance and stands out for its cost-effectiveness and efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>As DeepSeek made waves in the AI space, the Wiz Research team set out to assess its external security posture and identify any potential vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Within minutes, we found a publicly accessible ClickHouse database linked to DeepSeek, completely open and unauthenticated, exposing sensitive data. It was hosted at oauth2callback.deepseek.com:9000 and dev.deepseek.com:9000.&nbsp;</p><p>This database contained a significant volume of chat history, backend data and sensitive information, including log streams, API Secrets, and operational details. &nbsp;</p><p>More critically, the exposure allowed for full database control and potential <a href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/privilege-escalation">privilege escalation</a> within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><h2><a id="exposure-walkthrough-10"></a><strong>Exposure Walkthrough</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Our reconnaissance began with assessing DeepSeek’s publicly accessible domains. By mapping the external attack surface with straightforward reconnaissance techniques (passive and active discovery of subdomains), we identified around 30 internet-facing subdomains. Most appeared benign, hosting elements like the chatbot interface, status page, and API documentation—none of which initially suggested a high-risk exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as we expanded our search beyond standard HTTP ports (80/443), we detected two <strong>unusual, open ports (8123 &amp; 9000)</strong> associated with the following hosts:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://oauth2callback.deepseek.com:8123/"><u>http://oauth2callback.deepseek.com:8123</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dev.deepseek.com:8123/"><u>http://dev.deepseek.com:8123</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://oauth2callback.deepseek.com:9000/"><u>http://oauth2callback.deepseek.com:9000</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dev.deepseek.com:9000/"><u>http://dev.deepseek.com:9000</u></a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Upon further investigation, these ports led to a <strong>publicly exposed ClickHouse database</strong>, accessible without any authentication at all – immediately raising red flags. &nbsp;</p><p>ClickHouse is an open-source, columnar database management system designed for fast analytical queries on large datasets. It was developed by Yandex and is widely used for real-time data processing, log storage, and big data analytics, which indicates such exposure as a very valuable and sensitive discovery.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>By leveraging ClickHouse’s HTTP interface, we accessed the /play path, which <strong>allowed direct execution of arbitrary SQL queries</strong> via the browser. Running a simple SHOW TABLES; query returned a full list of accessible datasets.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tables output from ClickHouse Web UI</figcaption></figure><p>Among them, one table stood out: log_stream, which contained extensive logs with <strong>highly sensitive data</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The log_stream table contained <strong>over 1 million log entries</strong>, with particularly revealing columns:&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><ul><li><p>timestamp – Logs dating from <strong>January 6, 2025</strong>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>span_name – References to various internal <strong>DeepSeek API endpoints</strong>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>string.values – <strong>Plaintext logs</strong>, including <strong>Chat History</strong>, <strong>API Keys, backend details, and operational metadata</strong>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>_service – Indicating which <strong>DeepSeek service</strong> generated the logs&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>_source – Exposing the <strong>origin of log requests</strong>, containing <strong>Chat History, API Keys, directory structures, and chatbot metadata logs</strong>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><figure></figure><p>This level of access posed a critical risk to DeepSeek’s own security and for its end-users. Not only an attacker could retrieve sensitive logs and actual plain-text chat msgs, but they could also potentially <strong>exfiltrate plaintext passwords and local files</strong> along <strong>propriety information</strong> directly from the server using queries like: SELECT LOAD_FILE(‘{FileName}‘);&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Note: We did not execute intrusive queries beyond enumeration to preserve ethical research practices.)</em>&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="key-takeaways-26"></a><strong>Key Takeaways&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The rapid adoption of AI services without corresponding security is inherently risky. This exposure underscores the fact that the immediate <a href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/ai-security-risks">security risks for AI applications</a> stem from the infrastructure and tools supporting them.&nbsp;</p><p>While much of the attention around AI security is focused on futuristic threats, the real dangers often come from basic risks—like accidental external exposure of databases. These risks, which are fundamental to security, should remain a top priority for security teams.&nbsp;</p><p>As organizations rush to adopt AI tools and services from a growing number of startups and providers, it’s essential to remember that by doing so, we’re entrusting these companies with sensitive data. The rapid pace of adoption often leads to overlooking security, but protecting customer data must remain the top priority. It’s crucial that security teams work closely with AI engineers to ensure visibility into the architecture, tooling, and models being used, so we can safeguard data and prevent exposure.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="conclusion-30"></a>Conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The world has never seen a piece of technology adopted at the pace of AI. Many AI companies have rapidly grown into critical infrastructure providers without the security frameworks that typically accompany such widespread adoptions. As AI becomes deeply integrated into businesses worldwide, the industry must recognize the risks of handling sensitive data and enforce security practices on par with those required for public cloud providers and major infrastructure providers.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here's the thing about PDFs - they're complex beasts that require quite a bit of thinking to properly parse - they come in all shapes and sizes, and they can contain a lot of different types of data and formatting. 90% of the time, we just want to extract the text from the file, but that's not always easy - for the remaining 10%, well we won't be covering that in this blog post.</p>
<p>If you've been in the Elixir world for long enough, you'll probably have tried to parse a PDF file and realised that it's not as easy as it seems. A quick look on the <a href="https://elixirforum.com/t/parsing-pdf-file/23287">Elixir Forum</a> will quickly show you that there is no simple way to do it.</p>
<p>Most people will tell you to upload the file to S3 and use a Lambda to handle the contents. Offloading to AWS Lambda might seem elegant at first ("Look, Ma, no dependencies!"), but it comes with its own baggage:</p>
<ul>
<li><span></span>You're adding network latency to what should be a simple operation</li>
<li><span></span>AWS costs can spiral if you're processing lots of PDFs</li>
<li><span></span>You're now dependent on external services for core functionality</li>
<li><span></span>Debugging becomes a distributed systems problem</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't ideal solutions - and software engineering is already made more complicated than it needs to be at times - we don't need to add more complexity to the mix.</p>
<p>We need a robust, native solution that plays nicely with the BEAM. So how do we do that?</p>
<h2>Enter the crabs!</h2>
<p>Elixir is my favourite language, but it can't do everything - web services, background jobs, and more are easy but sometimes we need a little help from our friends closer to the hardware for some of the tasks Elixir doesn't have a native solution for. That's where Rust and NIFs come in!</p>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that is fast, safe, and easy to use. It's a great language for writing code that needs to be performant and reliable.</p>
<p>But Rust isn't just fast - it's "zero-cost abstractions" fast. What does that mean? You get high-level, ergonomic code that compiles down to something as efficient as hand-written C. For PDF parsing, where you're dealing with complex file formats and potentially large documents, this performance is a game-changer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a NIF?
A NIF (Native Implemented Function) is a way to call Rust code from Elixir - it's the BEAMs method of allowing processes to directly call native functions. It allows you to write code in Rust that can be called directly from Elixir, giving you the performance benefits of Rust without sacrificing the ease of use of Elixir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this blog post, we're going to be using the <a href="https://github.com/yobix-ai/extractous">Extractous library</a> which provides fast and efficient unstructured data extraction in Rust. This combined with the NIFs in Elixir gives us a powerful combination for parsing PDFs.</p>
<h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>First things first, ensure you have Elixir and Rust installed on your machine.</p>
<p>Let's begin by creating a new LiveView Elixir application that will allow users to upload a PDF file and see a breakdown of the contents. We won't be needing any database functionality for this so we can use the <code>--no-ecto</code> flag to skip the database setup.</p>
<pre><code>mix phx<span>.</span>new elixir_pdf <span>--</span>no<span>-</span>ecto
</code></pre>
<p>We'll also need to add the <code>rustler</code> dependency to our <code>mix.exs</code> file so we can call Rust code from Elixir.</p>
<pre><code><span>defp</span> deps <span>do</span>
  <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span><span>:rustler</span><span>,</span> <span>"~&gt; 0.27.0"</span><span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Once we pull down our dependencies using <code>mix deps.get</code>, we can use <code>mix rustler.new</code> to generate our new Rust project in our code.</p>
<p>If you head to <code>lib/elixir_pdf/&lt;name_of_your_rust_project&gt;.ex</code>, you'll see that it's already generated a basic NIF for us. A default NIF implementation is provided for us, but we'll be implementing our own in the next step. I've named my Rust project <code>rustreader</code> for this example.</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>RustReader</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Rustler</span><span>,</span> <span>otp_app:</span> <span>:elixir_pdf</span><span>,</span> <span>crate:</span> <span>"rustreader"</span>

  <span># Define the function that will be implemented in Rust</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>extract_pdf</span><span>(</span>_path<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>do:</span> <span>:erlang</span><span>.</span><span>nif_error</span><span>(</span><span>:nif_not_loaded</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's grab the <code>extractous</code> library and add it to our <code>native/rustreader/Cargo.toml</code> file - this will allow us to use the <code>extractous</code> library in our Rust code.</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span>dependencies<span>]</span>
rustler <span>=</span> <span>"0.36.0"</span>
extractous <span>=</span> <span>"0.2.0"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With this in place, we can run <code>cargo build</code> to build our Rust code - this will also pull down the <code>extractous</code> library and any other dependencies.</p>
<h2>The fun part - writing some code</h2>
<p>Next we need to actually write some Rust code to implement the <code>extract_pdf</code> function in our <code>native/rustreader/src/lib.rs</code> file.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> <span>extractous<span>::</span></span><span>Extractor</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>rustler<span>::</span></span><span>{</span><span>Encoder</span><span>,</span> <span>Env</span><span>,</span> <span>NifResult</span><span>,</span> <span>Term</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>rustler<span>::</span></span><span>init!</span><span>(</span><span>"Elixir.RustReader"</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>extract_pdf<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This code will define a new instance of the <code>Extractor</code> struct and use it to extract the contents of the PDF file. We'll then return the contents and the metadata as a tuple.</p>
<p>The magic of the <code>rustler::init!</code> macro is that it will automatically generate the necessary code to call the Rust function from Elixir.</p>
<p>Astute observers will note our use of the <code>DirtyCpu</code> schedule. This ingenious feature instructs Rustler and the BEAM to automatically schedule our task in a manner that prevents global blocking during execution. This functionality, known as a DirtyNif, significantly simplifies our work compared to the complexities of manual implementation in C.</p>

<p>Now we need to write a some simple LiveView Elixir code to allow users to upload a PDF file and then call our Rust function from the server.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>So we can upload a PDF file - but let's call our Rust function and see what it returns.</p>
<p>In our handle_event function, we can call our Rust function as simply as this:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>@impl</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>handle_event</span><span>(</span><span>"save"</span><span>,</span> _params<span>,</span> socket<span>)</span> <span>do</span>

        <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>cp!</span><span>(</span>path<span>,</span> dest<span>)</span>
        <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> dest<span>}</span>
      <span>end</span><span>)</span>

    pdf_document <span>=</span>
      uploaded_files
      <span>|&gt;</span> <span>hd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>|&gt;</span> <span>RustReader</span><span>.</span><span>extract_pdf</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>## This is where the magic happens!</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span>
     socket
     <span>|&gt;</span> <span>assign</span><span>(</span><span>:pdf_document</span><span>,</span> pdf_document<span>)</span>
     <span>|&gt;</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>:uploaded_files</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;1</span> <span>++</span> uploaded_files<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We're grabbing the first uploaded file and calling our Rust function. The result is a tuple containing the contents of the PDF and the metadata.</p>
<p>Let's try it out with the <a href="https://liveviewcookbook.com/">LiveView Cookbook PDF</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dpyzduq.png" alt="Unstructured"></p>
<p>Success! We've now got a PDF parser that's fast, efficient, and written in Rust.</p>
<p>But that's quite hard to read so we're not done yet, let's make this a little nicer to work with.</p>
<p>Let's create a new module to handle the Jason encoding of the metadata.</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>ElixirPdf</span><span>.</span><span>PdfDocument</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@derive</span> <span>{</span><span>Jason</span><span>.</span><span>Encoder</span><span>,</span> <span>only:</span> <span>[</span><span>:content</span><span>,</span> <span>:metadata</span><span>]</span><span>}</span>
  <span>defstruct</span> <span>[</span><span>:content</span><span>,</span> <span>:metadata</span><span>]</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>from_rustler</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>content<span>,</span> metadata_json<span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    with <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> metadata<span>}</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Jason</span><span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>metadata_json<span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>%</span>__MODULE__<span>{</span>
        <span>content:</span> <span>String</span><span>.</span><span>trim</span><span>(</span>content<span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>metadata:</span> metadata
      <span>}</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will allow us to encode the metadata to JSON and decode it back to a struct in Elixir to make it easier to work with.</p>
<p>All we have to do is pipe the result of our Rust function through this module and we're done!</p>
<pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>RustReader</span><span>.</span><span>extract_pdf</span><span>(</span><span>@pdf_document</span><span>)</span>
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>ElixirPdf</span><span>.</span><span>PdfDocument</span><span>.</span><span>from_rustler</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we upload a PDF file, we'll see the metadata results in a much more readable format.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QvG2QUV.png" alt="Structured"></p>
<p>Much better!</p>
<p>This approach is simple and effective - it's fast, efficient, and leverages the strengths of both Elixir and Rust to provide a robust solution for PDF parsing.</p>
<p>We're only talking about PDF files here but extractous supports a <a href="https://github.com/yobix-ai/extractous?tab=readme-ov-file#-supported-file-formats">wide range of file types</a> - so keep that in mind if you need to extract data from other file types.</p>
<h2>What about deployment?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a native extension and so you'll need to build the Rust code before deploying your application. This can be done in a CI/CD pipeline or manually.</p>
<p>If you're using Docker, you can update the <code>Dockerfile</code> to build the Rust code as part of the build process and update <code>config/prod.exs</code> to tell Rustler to skip compilation and load the compiled NIF from where it was built in the Docker image.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://fly.io/phoenix-files/elixir-and-rust-is-a-good-mix/">Fly.io blog post</a> for more information on how to deploy an Elixir application with Rust NIFs.</p>
<h2>Shoutouts</h2>
<p>Some shoutouts are in order - firstly this blog post from <a href="https://fly.io/phoenix-files/elixir-and-rust-is-a-good-mix/">Fly.io's Phoenix Files</a> outlining how to use Rust with NIFs in Elixir. It was a key inspiration for this approach and gave me the idea to use Rust in the first place. Also check out Fly in general for some great Elixir hosting options - I use them for all my Elixir applications.</p>
<p>Also a shoutout for the excellent <a href="https://github.com/yobix-ai/extractous">Extractous library</a> which provides fast and efficient unstructured data extraction in Rust - it's also 25x faster than the very popular unstructured-io library.</p>
<p>Finally, a shoutout to the <a href="https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler">Rustler</a> library for providing a simple way to call Rust code from Elixir!</p>

<p>All the code for this blog post can be <a href="https://github.com/chrisgreg/elixir_pdf_tutorial">found here on my Github</a> if anyone wants to clone it and run it yourselves!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<h2>What if we say it's not like the others?</h2>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/pipeline.svg"></p><p>Airflow is <strong>different</strong> We're not cutting any corners. This is <em>not yet another FFmpeg wrapper</em> like you might have seen elsewhere. Don't get us wrong, we love FFmpeg and use many of its parts under the hood, but our custom built video processing pipeline goes way beyond wrapping FFmpeg and calling it a day. We've been working on it for years it and <strong>it lets us do things that other similar software <span id="what_container">simply can't</span></strong>.</p>


<h2>...with a very particular set of skills...</h2>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/device.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/device@2x.png 2x"></p><p>Airflow is a razor sharp focused software. It supports specific set of devices and it will pull every trick in the book to get the best possible results on these devices. It may not stream video to your smart fridge, but it will gladly <em>push your Chromecast, Apple TV and AirPlay 2 TVs to their limits</em>.</p>
<p>And yes, Airflow can handle pretty much <strong>any video format and codec you throw at it</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Pixels, pixels everywhere!</h2>
<p>Airflow can stream full <strong>4K HDR</strong> HEVC files to Chromecast Ultra, Built-in, Apple TV 4K and AirPlay 2 enabled TVs. It will go out of its way not to touch the original video stream unless absolutely needed for compatibility reasons, ensuring <strong>best possible video quality</strong> with <strong>lowest CPU load</strong> (your computer fans will thank you). As far as we can tell, Airflow is still <em>the only desktop software that can natively stream HEVC videos to Apple TV and AirPlay 2 TVs</em>.</p>
<p>And for those pesky videos that are incompatible with your device - Airflow will handle that tranparently, with <em>hardware accelerated transcoding</em> if your computer supports it.</p>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/settings.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/settings@2x.png 2x">
</p></div>
<div>
<h2>Audio pipeline that goes to eleven</h2>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/audio-delay.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/audio-delay@2x.png 2x"></p><p>Full <strong>multichannel support</strong> including DD+ passthrough with Dolby Atmos? Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced adaptive volume booster + limiter</strong> for late night watching when you don't want to disturb your neighbours with loud scenes but still want to hear the dialogue clearly? Check.</p>
<p><em>Spatial headphone downmix</em> for surround sound videos? Also check.</p>
<p>Detailed <em>A/V sync adjustment</em> where you can compensate for the delay of individual devices like bluetooth headphones? Airflow has it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>And subtitle support to match it</h2>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/subtitle-menu.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/subtitle-menu@2x.png 2x"></p><p>For both <strong>embedded and external subtitles</strong>. It's a bit of a secret that pretty much every other streaming software needs to extract embedded subtitle tracks before playing the video. That involves reading the entire file upfront! Crazy, right? <em>Airflow needs no such crude tricks</em>. Embedded or external, for our playback pipeline it's all the same. All widely used subtitle formats are supported, now including vobsub. Integrated <strong>opensubtitles.org</strong> search is a cherry on top.</p>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/sub-search.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/sub-search@2x.png 2x"></p><h2>...with real time text recognition</h2>
<p>Some subtitles (DVD, Vobsub, Bluray) are stored as pictures. This means that the only way to render them when streaming is to burn them in the video. That's inconvenient to say the least. It massively increases CPU load (think fan noise and heat) and it's completely infeasible to do for 4K videos.</p>
<p>Enter our new <em>realtime subtitle text recognition (OCR)</em>. During playback Airflow will transparently extract the text from picture subtitles and render it on target device just like it would with regular text subtitles.</p>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/vobsub.png">
<img src="https://airflow.app/images/down-arrow.svg"></p><p>
    We'll be in <i>bigger trouble</i><br>
    if the thief has it.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>But wait, there's more!</h2>
<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/speed-test.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/speed-test@2x.png 2x"></p><p>The "small" things, like the <strong>scrubbing preview</strong>, <em>beautiful polished user interface</em>, multiple playlists support, meticulous last position tracking, or the integrated <strong>Speed Test for Chromecast</strong>, which is invaluable when dealing with network connection issues. The list goes on.</p>

<p><img src="https://airflow.app/images/screenshot-remote-app.png" srcset="https://airflow.app/images/screenshot-remote-app@2x.png 2x"></p><p>Did we mention the <strong>remote control companion app</strong> for Android and iPhone? No? Well, it's pretty cool. It lets you control all Airflow features from the comfort of your couch. And it's completely free!</p>

<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>Is Airflow a subscription of any kind?</h3>
<p>Nope. One time payment only. Airflow license does not expire.</p>
<h3>What if I have multiple computers? Do you I need multiple licenses?</h3>
<p>You only need one license. You can activate Airflow on all computers that you own using single license.</p>
<h3>I lost my license key</h3>
<p>No worries. You can always retreive your license <a href="https://license.airflow.app/my">here</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><span>Iodized salt is so commonplace in the U.S. today that you may never have given the additive a second thought. But new research finds that humble iodine has played a substantial role in cognitive improvements seen across the American population in the 20th century.</span></p><p><span>Iodine is a critical micronutrient in the human diet — that is, something our bodies can’t synthesize that we have to rely on food to obtain — and it’s been added to salt (in the form of potassium iodide) since 1924. Originally, iodization was adopted to reduce the incidence of goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland. But research since then has found that iodine also plays a crucial role in brain development, especially during gestation.</span></p><p><span>Iodine deficiency&nbsp;today is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation in the world. It’s estimated that nearly one-third of the world’s population has a diet with too little iodine in it, and the problem isn’t limited to developing countries — perhaps&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/VMNIS_Iodine_deficiency_in_Europe.pdf" color="accent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>one-fifth of those cases are in Europe</span></a><span>&nbsp;(pdf), where iodized salt is still not the norm.</span></p><p id="iodines-natural-experiment"><h2><span>Iodine’s Natural Experiment</span></h2></p><p><span>With this background, then, a group of economists saw a natural experiment: comparing the intelligence of children born just before 1924 — the year iodization began — and those born just after. James Freyer, David Weil and Dimitra Politi used military data from the early 1900s&nbsp;1920s, when World War II drove millions of men and women to enlist.</span></p><p><span>Recruits all took a standardized intelligence test as part of their enlistment. Researchers didn’t have access to the test scores themselves, but they had a clever substitute: smarter recruits were assigned to the Air Forces while the less bright ones went to the Ground Forces. This allowed the researchers to infer test scores depending on which branch a recruit was selected for.</span></p><p><span>Intelligence data were paired with birthdate and hometown, since iodine levels in the soil and water vary significantly from place to place. To estimate which regions were naturally high-iodine and which were low, the researchers referred to nationwide statistics&nbsp;collected after World War I on the prevalence of goiter.</span></p><p><span>In all, researchers had sufficient data on about 2 million male recruits born between 1921 and 1927.</span></p><p id="stark-improvements"><h2><span>Stark Improvements</span></h2></p><p><span>The economists found that in the lowest-iodine areas — the bottom quarter of the study population — the introduction of iodized salt had stark effects. Men from these regions born in 1924 or later were significantly more likely to get into the Air Force and had an average IQ that was 15 points higher than their predecessors.</span></p><p><span>Nationwide, that averages out to a 3.5-point rise in IQ because of iodization, the researchers </span><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19233" color="accent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>report</span></a><span> in a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research.</span></p><p><span>The initiative wasn’t without its drawbacks — sudden iodine supplementation among people who are deficient can cause thyroid-related deaths. The researchers estimate that 10,000 deaths in the decades after 1924 were caused by salt iodization.</span></p><p><span>But on the positive side, iodine deficiency and its symptoms were vanquished almost overnight. And iodine’s mental benefits may even help explain the Flynn Effect, which observes that IQ rose about 3 points per decade in developed countries throughout the 20th century. It’s been thought that improved health and nutrition were the driving forces of the Flynn Effect. Now, it appears that iodine alone was responsible for roughly one decade of that remarkable climb. All the more reason, then, for the rest of the world to follow suit and relegate iodine deficiency to the history books.</span></p></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Hello! Today we are releasing one of our biggest updates for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/games/no-mans-sky/">No Man’s Sky</a>. We can’t wait for you to see what we’ve been working on.</p>



<p>Last year, we released No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I (5.0) for PS4, PS5, and PS VR2 players, and it was one of our most successful to date. We’ve been planning the changes in Worlds Part II for a long time, and the wait is finally over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons people play No Man’s Sky is for that sense of adventure and discovery, that feeling of flying to a planet, and landing to explore, knowing no one has ever been there before. With Worlds Part II, we added billions of new star systems and trillions of new planets to the universe. This allows us to push the boundaries of our engine and technology without changing the things people love about the game already. If you settled on your home planet with a beautiful base that you lovingly crafted, that is safe – but now there are new worlds to explore with a level of variety no one has seen before.</p>



<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54291870269_4e4f33a4a1_h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54291870269_4e4f33a4a1_h.jpg" alt=""></a></p><p>Going to these new systems travelers will notice new terrain, new biomes, new flora, and new fauna. There’s a new terrain system that I’ve been working on for a while now. There are huge mountains to climb, oceans that are kilometers deep to discover, and caverns and canyons at a scale that wasn’t possible before.</p>



<p>In these systems you may even find enormous Gas Giants. These huge worlds can be ten times bigger than any other planet you have explored previously. Gas Giants and deep oceans both require high-level technology to explore. Gas storms, deep sea pressure, and anomalies bring new hazards and challenges to No Man’s Sky.</p>



<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54291632791_a3101e4947_h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54291632791_a3101e4947_h.jpg" alt=""></a></p><p>Water gameplay has much added depth too, including improvements to our submarine, The Nautilus, as well as improvements to fishing and deep sea diving systems. New ocean tech allows water to react physically to the world around it. Dimples appear when it rains and wake appears as ships fly over the surface, and creatures and players can wade through creating waves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our lighting system has been completely rewritten. Shadows show more details, sunlight and ambient occlusion are sharper, and sunlight sparkling through leaves and metals looks crisp and beautiful. Starry night skies and wispy clouds reflect in the water of lakes and oceans.</p>



<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54292060960_3f430425a6_h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54292060960_3f430425a6_h.jpg" alt=""></a></p><p>A lot of this new technology comes from learnings and hard work on our next big fantasy game, Light No Fire, which is keeping our small team incredibly busy.</p>



<p>As well as new solar systems and new technology Worlds Part II brings a lot of new adventures. This update introduces a large strand of new quests and lore connecting up some of the storylines and mysteries we have been building to for a long time. Those who relish unearthing the collective knowledge of the No Man’s Sky universe have a lot to dig into.</p>



<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54291632746_6d99f45fd4_h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54291632746_6d99f45fd4_h.jpg" alt=""></a></p><p>There is also a whole new expedition to accompany this major update which deliberately serves as a guided tour to some of the best new additions to Worlds Part II. The rewards for completing this awe-inspiring journey are really special too. Not least is a brand new spacecraft which is a cross between a living ship and a jet fighter. It’s pretty wild!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Worlds Part II update is a signal to the PlayStation community that 2025 is going to be a very exciting year for No Man’s Sky. Whether you play on PS5, PS4, or PS VR2, there’s a lot to look forward to from this tiny but still energised team. We’re so thrilled to be able to keep working on this game we all love so much.</p>



<p>Our journey continues.</p>

<p>When Apple began to build its own processors for iPhones and iPads in 2009 – 2010, it initially used Samsung Foundry, but after custom silicon became a key advantage of iPhones over rivals in the early 2010s, the company began to explore other makers as Samsung was Apple's primary rival at the time. The company considered using Intel Custom Foundry (ICF) and Texas Instruments but quickly realized the ICF was not tailored for external customers at all, while TI did not have advanced process technologies. As a result, it chose TSMC as its exclusive supplier, according to Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, who spoke to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZItbr4ZJnc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZItbr4ZJnc" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Acquired</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"The [CEO] of Intel has approached Tim Cook and has asked Tim Cook to consider Intel, and at this time, Intel was the major supplier for Apple's Mac line," Chang reminisced. "I knew a lot of Intel's customer customers in Taiwan […] none of them liked Intel [as it] always acted like they were the the only guy [with] microprocessors. […] The Foundry business where TSMC […] does not compete with customers and even if Intel is trying to do business in good faith they do have the conflict [of interests."&nbsp;</p><p>When Intel's CEO Paul Otellini approached Tim Cook in early 2011, offering to manufacture Apple's chips, Apple paused discussions with TSMC for two months to evaluate the proposal.</p><p>Morris Chang, concerned about this pause, traveled to Apple's headquarters to check on the situation. In a private meeting, Tim Cook reassured Chang that Apple would not choose Intel.&nbsp;</p><p>"Intel just does not know how to be a foundry," Tom Cook reportedly told Chang.&nbsp;</p><p>The implication was that Intel lacked the customer-centric mindset required for a foundry business. Unlike TSMC, which tailors its process technologies to meet customer needs, Intel was used to designing and producing its own chips and struggled to adapt to servicing external clients. By contrast, Apple valued TSMC's ability to listen and respond to specific demands, something Intel historically did not do.&nbsp;</p><p>"When the customer asks a lot of things, we have learned to respond to every request," Chang said. "Some of them were crazy, some of them were irrational, [but] we respond to each request courteously. […] Intel has never done that, I knew a lot of customers of Intel's here in Taiwan and all [of them] wished that there were another supplier."&nbsp;</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6S8ZwAVeqjYYXmY7mXf9rB"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>However, it is notable that Intel has worked to defray those concerns with its now-revamped Intel Foundry, which also now offers support for industry-standard design tools, a notable area it lacked with its first Intel Custom Foundry foray in the past.</p><p>Indeed, the very first encounter with Apple disrupted TSMC's roadmap. TSMC planned to move from 28nm planar to 16nm FinFET, but Apple wanted a custom 20nm-class planar node instead. At the time, TSMC did not have enough R&amp;D teams to develop two process technologies at once, so the company had to divert people working on CLN16FF to CLN20SOC to meet Apple's needs in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Apple dual-sourced its A8 and A9 processors at 20nm and 16nm-class process technologies from Samsung and TSMC, Apple eventually committed to TSMC for all future processors. The Apple Silicon strategy cemented TSMC's position as the exclusive supplier, as the company's system-on-chips for different applications share quite a lot of IP.</p><p>The decision to meet Apple's demands was critical in TSMC surpassing Intel as the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturer. Apple's business gave TSMC predictable high-volume orders, helping justify massive CapEx and R&amp;D investments. As a result, TSMC has consistently outpaced Intel by introducing leading-edge nodes.</p>

<p>ARC Prize Foundation’s goal is to define, measure, and inspire new ideas towards AGI. To this end, we strive to create the strongest global innovation environment possible.</p>

<p>We do not have AGI yet and are still innovation constrained – scaling up pure LLM pretraining is not the path, despite this being the dominant AI industry narrative and mainstream public view as of last summer.</p>

<p>The reason narratives are important is they end up driving economic activity, like investment, research focus, funding, geopolitics, trade, etc. For example, in 2023-24 there was ~$20B invested into new LLM startups compared to only ~$200M into new AGI startups.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/launch">launched ARC Prize 2024 last June</a> to grow awareness of limits of scaling LLMs and promote a useful benchmark, ARC-AGI-1, towards a new direction that requires AI systems to adapt to novel, unseen problems instead of being able to rely strictly on memorization.</p>

<p>Last week, DeepSeek <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948">published</a> their new R1-Zero and R1 “reasoner” systems that is <a href="https://x.com/arcprize/status/1881761987090325517">competitive with OpenAI’s o1 system</a> on ARC-AGI-1. R1-Zero, R1, and o1 (low compute) all score around 15-20% – in contrast to <code>GPT-4o</code>’s 5%, the pinnacle of years of pure LLM scaling. Based on this week’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/">US market reaction</a>, the public is starting to understand the limits of scaling pure LLMs too. However, there is still broad public ignorance about impending inference demand.</p>

<p>In December 2024, OpenAI announced a <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">new breakthrough o3 system that we verified</a>. It scored 76% in a low compute mode and 88% in a high compute mode. The o3 system demonstrates the first practical, general implementation of a computer adapting to novel unseen problems.</p>

<p>Despite being <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/241220/h2200">huge tech news</a>, o3 beating ARC-AGI-1 <a href="https://x.com/benspringwater/status/1881507009184530449">went largely unnoticed and unreported</a> by mainstream press.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly important moment for the field of AI and for computer science and these systems demand study. But due to the closed nature of o1/o3, we’re forced to rely on speculation. Thanks to ARC-AGI-1 and now (nearly) open source R1-Zero and R1, we can add to our understanding. In particular, R1-Zero is significantly more important than R1.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/openai-o1-results-arc-prize">o1</a> and <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">o3 analysis</a>, we speculated how these reasoning systems work. The key ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate chains-of-thought (CoT) for a problem domain.</li>
  <li>Label the intermediary CoT steps using a combination of human experts (“supervised fine tuning” or SFT) and automated machines (“reinforcement learning” or RL).</li>
  <li>Train base model using (2).</li>
  <li>At test time, iteratively inference from the process model.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><em>Note: ARC-AGI-1 semi-private score shown.</em></p>

<p>With DeepSeek’s new published research, we can better inform our speculation. The key insight is that higher degrees of novelty adaptation (and reliability) for LLM reasoning systems are achieved along three dimensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adding human labels aka SFT to CoT process model training</li>
  <li>CoT search instead of linear inference (parallel per-step CoT inference)</li>
  <li>Whole CoT sampling (parallel trajectory inference)</li>
</ol>

<p>Item (1) is bottlenecked by human data generation and constrains which domains these reasoning systems benefit most. For example, the <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">MMLU professional law category</a> is surprisingly much lower than the math and logic on o1.</p>

<p>Items (2) and (3) are bottlenecked by efficiency. o1 and o3 both <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">show logarithmic improvement</a> in benchmark accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 as they spend more inference compute at test time, while the different ways to spend that compute adjust the x-axis of the curve.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most interesting thing DeepSeek has done is to publish R1-Zero separately. R1-Zero is a model which does not use SFT, the (1) item. Instead it relies purely on reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>R1-Zero and R1 show strong score agreement on  ARC-AGI-1, scoring 14% and 15% respectively. DeepSeeks’s own reported benchmark scores also show strong agreement between R1-Zero and R1, eg. on MATH AIME 2024 scores are 71% and 76% respectively (up from ~40% on the base DeepSeek V3).</p>

<p>In the paper, R1-Zero authors say “DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing” and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i765q0/r1zero_pure_rl_creates_a_mind_we_cant_decodeis/">has been corroborated online</a>. However in our testing, we found little to no evidence of incoherence when testing R1-Zero on ARC-AGI-1 which is similar to the math and coding domains the system was RL’d on.</p>

<p>Taken together, these findings suggest:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SFT (eg. human expert labeling) is not necessary for accurate and legible CoT reasoning in domains with strong verification.</li>
  <li>The R1-Zero training process is capable of creating its own internal domain specific language (“DSL”) in token space via RL optimization.</li>
  <li>SFT is necessary for increasing CoT reasoning domain generality.</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes intuitive sense, as language itself is effectively a reasoning DSL. The exact same “words” can be learned in one domain and applied in another, like a program. The pure RL approach can not yet discover a broad shared vocabulary and I expect this will be a strong focus for future research.</p>

<p>Ultimately, R1-Zero demonstrates the prototype of a potential scaling regime with zero human bottlenecks – even in the training data acquisition itself.</p>

<p>Almost certainly DeepSeek has set its sights on OpenAI’s o3 system. It is important to watch whether SFT ends up being a requirement to add CoT search and sampling, or whether a hypothetical “R2-Zero” could exist along the same logarithmic accuracy vs inference scaling curve. Based on R1-Zero results, I believe SFT will not be required to beat ARC-AGI-1 in this hypothetical scaled up version.</p>

<h2 id="dollars-for-reliability">Dollars for reliability</h2>

<p>There are two major shifts happening in AI, economically speaking:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can now spend more $ to get higher accuracy and reliability</li>
  <li>Training $ is moving to inference $</li>
</ol>

<p>Both are going to drive a massive amount of demand for inference and neither will curtail the demand for more compute. In fact, they will increase the demand for compute.</p>

<p>AI reasoning systems promise much greater returns than simply higher accuracy on benchmarks. The number one issue preventing more AI automation use (e.g. inference demand) is reliability. I’ve spoken with hundreds of Zapier’s customers trying to deploy AI agents in their businesses and the feedback is strongly consistent: “I don’t trust them yet because they don’t work reliably”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/the-arc-prize-efficiency-intuition-and-agi-with-mike-knoop-co-founder-of-zapier/">Previously</a> I’ve argued that progress towards ARC-AGI would result in higher reliability. The challenge with LLM agents is they need strong local domain steering to work reliability. Stronger generalization capability requires the ability to adapt to unseen situations. We’re now starting to <a href="https://x.com/woj_zaremba/status/1882290021778313272">see evidence</a> this view is correct. And so it’s no surprise several companies are now introducing agents (Anthropic, OpenAI, Apple, …)</p>

<p>Agents will drive significant near-term demand inference due the reliability needs. More broadly, developers can choose to spend more compute to increase user trust in the system. More reliability does not mean 100% accuracy though – but you’d expect to be more <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Statistical_bias_and_statistical_noise_illustration.png">consistently inaccurate</a>. This is okay because users and developers can now more confidently steer behavior via prompting when accuracy is low.</p>

<p>Problems that were impossible for computers previously now have dollar amounts attached to them. And as efficiency climbs, those dollar amounts will go down.</p>

<h2 id="inference-as-training">Inference as training</h2>

<p>The other major shift occurring is in the provenance of data going into LLM systems for pretraining. Previously, most data was either purchased, scraped, or synthetically generated from an existing LLM (eg. distilling or augmenting).</p>

<p>These reasoning systems offer a new option which is to generate “real” data as opposed to “synthetic”. The AI industry uses the term synthetic to identify low quality data that is typically recycled through an LLM to boost the overall amount of training data – with diminishing returns.</p>

<p>But now with reasoning systems and verifiers, we can create brand new legitimate data to train on. This can either be done offline where the developer pays to create the data or at inference time where the end user pays!</p>

<p>This is a fascinating shift in economics and suggests there could be a runaway power concentrating moment for AI system developers who have the largest number of paying customers. Those customers are footing the bill to create new high quality data … which improves the model … which becomes better and more preferred by users … you get the idea.</p>

<p>If we can break through the human expert CoT barrier and create an extremely efficient system to create new data via search/synthesis and verification, then we should expect a massive influx of compute to go into these inference systems as they quite literally get better just by inputting dollars and raw data. Eventually this type of AI training will eclipse pretraining on human generated data altogether.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We will continue to see market corrections as increased inference demand becomes clear. AI system efficiency is only going to drive more usage, not just due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons Paradox</a> but because new regimes of training are unlocked as efficiency increases.</p>

<p>With R1 being open and reproducible, more people and teams will be pushing CoT and search to the limits. This will more quickly tell us where the frontier actually lies and will fuel a wave of innovation that increases the chance of reaching AGI quickly.</p>

<p>Several people have already told me they plan to use R1-style systems for <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/arc-prize-2025">ARC Prize 2025</a> and I’m excited to see the results.</p>

<p>The fact that R1 is open is a great thing for the world. DeepSeek has pushed the frontier of science forward.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/pg_upgrade">https://www.instantdb.com/essays/pg_upgrade</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867657">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
We’re Instant, a modern Firebase. <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/tutorial">Try out the demo</a>, you can spin up a database and make queries within a minute — no login required.
</p>

<p>Right before Christmas we discovered that our Aurora Postgres instance needed a major version upgrade. We found a great essay by the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/postgres-aurora-db-major-version-upgrade-with-minimal-downtime-4e26178f07a0">Lyft team</a>, showing how they ran their upgrade with about 7 minutes of downtime.</p>
<p>We started with Lyft’s checklist but made some changes, particularly with how we switched masters. <strong>In our process we got to 0 seconds of downtime.</strong></p>
<p>Doing a major version upgrade is stressful, and reading other’s reports definitely helped us along the way. So we wanted to write an experience report of our own, in the hopes that it’s as useful to you as reading others were for us.</p>
<p>In this write-up we’ll share the path we took — from false starts, to gotchas, to the steps that ultimately worked. Fair warning, our system runs at a modest scale. We have less than a terabyte of data, we read about 1.8 million tuples per second, and write about 500 tuples per second as of this writing. If you run at a much higher scale, this may be less relevant to you.</p>
<p>With all that said, let’s get into the story!</p>
<h2 id="state-of-affairs">State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a brief outline of our system:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/the_system.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Browsers connect to sync servers. Sync servers keep track of active queries. Sync servers also listen to Postgres’ write-ahead log; they take transactions, find affected queries, and send novelty back to browsers. <sup id="marked-fnref-1"><a href="#marked-fn-1">[1]</a></sup> Crucially, all Instant databases are hosted under one Aurora Postgres instance. <sup id="marked-fnref-2"><a href="#marked-fn-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="trouble-erupts">Trouble Erupts</h2>
<p>After our open source launch in August <sup id="marked-fnref-3"><a href="#marked-fn-3">[3]</a></sup>, we experienced about a 100x increase in throughput. For the first 2 months, whenever we saw perf issues they usually lived in our Client SDK or the Sync Server. When we hit a new high in December though, our Aurora Postgres instance started to spike in CPU and stumble.</p>
<p>To give us breathing room, we kept upgrading the size of the machine, until we reached db.r6g.16xlarge. <sup id="marked-fnref-4"><a href="#marked-fn-4">[4]</a></sup> We had to do something about the queries we were writing.</p>
<h2 id="sometimes-new-is-better-than-old">Sometimes, new is better than old</h2>
<p>We started to reproduce slow queries locally and began to optimize them. Within the first hour we noticed something strange: one teammate constantly reported faster query results then the rest of us.</p>
<p>Turns out this teammate was running Postgres 16, while most of us (and our production instance) were running Postgres 13.</p>
<p>We did some more backtesting and realized that Postgres 16 improved many of the egregious queries by 30% or more. Not bad. There came our first learning: sometimes, just upgrading Postgres is a great way to improve perf. <sup id="marked-fnref-5"><a href="#marked-fn-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>So we thought, let’s upgrade to Postgres 16. Now how do we go about it?</p>
<h2 id="false-starts">False Starts</h2>
<p>We were a team of 4 and we were in a crunch. If we could find a quick option we’d have been happy to take it. Here’s what we tried:</p>

<h2 id="1-in-place-upgradesbut-they-take-15-minutes">1) In-Place Upgrades...but they take 15 minutes</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/in_place.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The easiest choice would have been to run an in-place upgrade. Put the database in maintenance mode, upgrade major versions, then turn it back on again. In RDS console you can do this with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.MajorVersion.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.Manual:~:text=the%20RDS%20API.-,Console,-To%20upgrade%20the">few button clicks</a>.</p>
<p>The big problem is the downtime. Your DB is in maintenance mode for the entirety of the upgrade. The Lyft team said an in-place upgrade would have caused them a <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/postgres-aurora-db-major-version-upgrade-with-minimal-downtime-4e26178f07a0#4831">30 minute</a> outage.</p>
<p>We wanted to test this for ourselves though, in a case smaller database upgraded more quickly. So we cloned our production database and tested an in-place upgrade. Even with our smaller size, it took about 15 minutes for the clone to come back online.</p>
<p>Crunch or not, a 15-minute outage was off the table for us. Since launch we had folks sign up across the U.S, Europe and Asia; traffic ebbed and flowed, but there wasn’t a period where 15 minutes of downtime felt tolerable.</p>

<h2 id="2-blue-green-deploymentsbut-you-cant-have-active-replication-slots">2) Blue-Green Deployments...but you can’t have active replication slots</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/blue_green.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, Aurora Postgres also has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/blue-green-deployments-overview.html">blue-green deployments</a>. AWS spins up an upgraded replica for you, and you can switch masters with a button click. They promise about a minute of downtime.</p>
<p>With such little operational effort, a minute of downtime sounded like a great option for us.</p>
<p>So we cloned our DB and tested a blue-green deployment. Yup, the connection came back in a minute! It looked like we were done. Until we tried a full rehearsal.</p>
<p>We spun up a complete staging environment, this time with active sync servers and connected clients. Now the blue-green deployment would go on for 30 minutes, and then break with a configuration error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creation of blue/green deployment failed due to incompatible parameter settings. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/blue-green-deployments-creating.html#blue-green-deployments-creating-preparing-postgres">link</a> to help resolve the issues, then delete and recreate the blue/green deployment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next few hours was frustrating: we would change a setting, start again, wait 30 minutes, and invariably end up with the same error.</p>
<p>Once we exhausted the suggestions from in error message, we began a process of elimination: when did the upgrade work, and what change made it fail? Eliminating the sync servers revealed the issue: active replication slots.</p>
<p>Remember how our sync servers listen to Postgres’ write-ahead log? To do this, we opened <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html#LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS">replication slots</a>. We couldn’t create a blue-green deployment when the master DB had active replication slots. The AWS docs did not mention this. <sup id="marked-fnref-6"><a href="#marked-fn-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>At least this experience highlighted a learning: <em>always</em> run a rehearsal that’s as close to production as possible, you never know what you’ll find.</p>
<p>In order to stop using replication slots we’d have to disconnect our sync servers. But then we would lose reactivity, potentially for 30 minutes. Apps would appear broken if we queries were out of sync that long; blue-green deployments were off the table too.</p>
<h2 id="a-plan-for-going-manual">A Plan for Going Manual</h2>
<p>When the managed options don’t work, it’s time to go manual. We knew that a manual upgrade would have to involve three steps:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/going_manual.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, we would stand up a new replica running Postgres 16 — Let’s call this machine "16". Once 16 was running, we could get our sync servers to subscribe to 16. The remaining step would be to switch writes "all in one go" (what this meant TBD) to 16. When that was done, migration done.</p>
<p>Now to figure out the steps</p>
<h2 id="1-replicate-to-16">1) Replicate to 16</h2>
<p>The first problem was to create our replica running Postgres 16.</p>
<h2 id="a-clone-upgrade-replicate-led-tolost-data">a) Clone-Upgrade-Replicate led to...lost data</h2>
<p>Lyft had a great <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/postgres-aurora-db-major-version-upgrade-with-minimal-downtime-4e26178f07a0#a7df">series of steps</a> to create a replica, so we tried to follow it. There were three stages:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/clone_upgrade_replicate.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, we clone our database, then we upgrade our clone, and then we start replication. By the end, our clone would have become a replica running Postgres 16.</p>
<p>Steps 1 (clone) &amp; 2 (upgrade) worked great. The trouble started with step 3 (replicate).</p>
<h3 id="lost-pg-functions">Lost PG functions</h3>
<p>When we turned on replication, we saw this error:</p>
<pre><code><span>:ERROR: function is_jsonb_valid_timestamp(jsonb) does not exist at character 1</span>
</code></pre><p>That’s weird. We <em>did</em> have a custom Postgres function called <code>is_jsonb_valid_timestamp</code>. And the function existed on both machines; if we logged in with PSQL, we could write queries:</p>
<pre><code><span>select</span><span> is_jsonb_valid_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>'1724344362000'</span><span>::jsonb</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span> is_jsonb_valid_timestamp</span>
<span>--------------------------</span>
<span> t</span>
</code></pre><p>We thought maybe there was an error with our WAL level, or maybe some input worked in 13, but stopped working in 16.</p>

<h3 id="search-paths">Search paths</h3>
<p>So we went down a rabbit hole investigating and searching in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/D2B9F2A20670C84685EF7D183F2949E2373D64%40gigant.nidsa.net#8132cc2fa455dd1f1bb02c63cdd04678">PG’s mailing list.</a> Finally, we discovered the problem was <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PATH">search paths</a>. <sup id="marked-fnref-7"><a href="#marked-fn-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code><span>show</span><span> search_path</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>   search_path</span>
<span>-----------------</span>
<span> "$user", public</span>
</code></pre><p>Postgres stores custom functions in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PUBLIC">schema</a>. When you write a function in your query, PG uses a <code>search_path</code> to decide which schema to look into. During replication, Postgres was having trouble finding our function. To get around this issue, we <a href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant/pull/593">wrote a PR</a> to add the <code>public</code> prefix explicitly in all our function definitions:</p>
<pre><code><span>-- Before:</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>replace</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> is_jsonb_valid_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span> jsonb</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>-- After:                   👇</span><span></span>

<p>With PG functions working, 3) replicate ran smoothly! Or so we thought.</p>

<h3 id="missing-data">Missing data</h3>
<p>For all intents and purposes, our new clone looked like a functioning replica. But we wanted to absolutely make sure that we didn’t lose any data.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we had a special <code>transactions</code> table — it’s an immutable table we use internally <sup id="marked-fnref-9"><a href="#marked-fn-9">[9]</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code><span>instant=&gt; \d transactions;</span>
<!-- -->
<span>   Column   |            Type             | -- ... </span>
<span>------------+-----------------------------+</span>
<span> id         | bigint                      |</span>
<span> app_id     | uuid                        |</span>
<span> created_at | timestamp without time zone |</span>
</code></pre><p>Since we never modify rows, we could also use the <code>transactions</code> table for quick sanity checks — was there any data lost in the table? Here’s the query we ran to do that:</p>
<pre><code><span>-- On 13</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>transactions</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>transactions</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> id </span><span>&lt;</span><span> :max</span><span>-</span><span>id</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<!-- -->
<span></span><span>-- Wait for :max-id to replicate ...</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>-- On 16</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>transactions</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> id </span><span>&lt;</span><span> :max</span><span>-</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>To our surprise...we found 13 missing transactions! That definitely stumped us. We weren’t quite sure where the data loss came from <sup id="marked-fnref-10"><a href="#marked-fn-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="b-create-replicateworked-great">b) Create, Replicate...worked great!</h2>
<p>So we went back to the drawing board. One problem with our replica checklist was that it had about 13 steps in it. If we could remove the number of steps, perhaps we could kill whatever caused this data loss.</p>
<p>So we cooked up an alternate approach:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/create_replicate.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of creating, cloning, and then upgrading, we would start with a fresh database running Postgres 16, and replicate from scratch. Lyft chose to clone their DB, because they had over 30TB of data and could leverage <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Clone.html#Aurora.Clone.Overview">Aurora Cloning</a>. But we had less than a terabyte of data; starting replication from scratch wasn’t a big a deal for us. <sup id="marked-fnref-11"><a href="#marked-fn-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>So we created a checklist and ended up with 7 steps:</p>

<p>We ran step 6 with bated breath...and it all turned out well! <sup id="marked-fnref-12"><a href="#marked-fn-12">[12]</a></sup> Now we had a replica running Postgres 16.</p>
<h2 id="2-switching-subscriptions">2) Switching Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Next step, to switch subscriptions. Let’s remind ourselves what we’re looking to do:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/switch_subs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We’d need to get our sync servers to create replication slots in 16, rather than 13.</p>
<p>To do this, we added a <code>next-database-url</code> variable to our sync servers. During startup, if <code>next-database-url</code> was set, sync servers would subscribe from from there:</p>
<pre><code><span>;; invalidator.clj</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>;; `start` runs when the machine boots up</span><span></span>
<span></span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> start</span>
<span>  </span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>process-id</span><span>]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>; ...</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>(</span><span>wal/start-worker</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:conn-config</span><span></span>
<span>                      </span><span>(</span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>config/get-next-aurora-config</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>                          </span><span>;; Use the next db so that we don't</span><span></span>
<span>                          </span><span>;; have to worry about restarting the</span><span></span>
<span>                          </span><span>;; invalidator when failing over to a</span><span></span>
<span>                          </span><span>;; new db.</span><span></span>
<span>                          </span><span>(</span><span>config/get-aurora-config</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>; ...</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>Once we deployed this change, sync servers replicated from 16. Phew, this was at least one step in the story that didn’t feel nerve-wracking!</p>
<h2 id="3-switching-writes">3) Switching Writes</h2>
<p>Now to worry about writes:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/switch_writes.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ultimately, we needed to click some button and trigger a switch. To make the switch work, we’d need to follow two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>16 must be caught up</strong></p>
<p> If there are <em>any</em> writes in 13 that haven’t replicated to 16 yet, we can’t turn on writes to 16. Otherwise transactions would come in the wrong order</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Once caught up, all new writes must go to 16</strong></p>
<p> If <em>any</em> write accidentally goes to 13, we could lose data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how could we follow these rules?</p>
<h2 id="we-could-stop-the-worldbut-thats-downtime">We could stop the world...but that’s downtime</h2>
<p>The simplest way to switch writes would have been to stop the world:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off all writes.</li>
<li>Wait for 16 to catch up</li>
<li>Enable writes again — this time they all go to 16</li>
</ol>
<p>If we went with the ‘stop the world approach’, we’d have about the same kind of downtime as blue-green deployments: a minute or so.</p>
<p>We were okay with a minute of downtime. But we had already spent a day setting up our manual method, could we do better?</p>
<p>Since we were switching manually we had finer control over our connections. We realized that with just a little bit more work...we could have no downtime at all!</p>

<h2 id="or-we-could-write-an-algorithm-with-zero-downtime">Or we could write an algorithm with zero downtime!</h2>
<p>Our co-author Daniel shared an algorithm he used at his previous startup:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.instantdb.com/posts/pg_upgrade/no_downtime.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, we pause all new transactions. Then, we wait for active transactions to complete and for 16 to catch up. Finally we unpause all transactions and have them go to 16. If we did this right, we could switch major versions without any downtime at all!</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits-of-being-small">The benefits of being small</h3>
<p>Sounds good in theory, but it can be hard to pull off. Unless of course you run at a modest scale.</p>
<p>Our switching algorithm hinges on being able to control all active connections. If you have tons of machines, how could you control all active connections?</p>
<p>Well, since our throughput was still modest, we could temporarily scale our sync servers down to just one giant machine. Clojure and java came handy here too. We had threads and the JVM is efficient, so we could take full advantage of the <a href="https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/m6a.16xlarge?region=us-east-1&amp;os=linux&amp;cost_duration=monthly&amp;reserved_term=Standard.noUpfront">m6a.16xlarge</a> sync server we moved to for the switch.</p>
<h3 id="writing-out-a-failover-function">Writing out a failover function</h3>
<p>So we went forward and translated our zero-downtime algorithm into code. Here’s how it looked:</p>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> do-failover-to-new-db </span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span></span>

</code></pre><p>We spun up staging again, ran our failover function...buut transactions failed again. We were getting unique constraint violations on our transactions table.</p>
<h3 id="dont-forget-sequences">Don’t forget sequences</h3>
<p>This time the fix was easy to catch: sequences. Postgres does not <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html">replicate sequence</a> data. This meant that when a new <code>transaction</code> row was created, we were using ids that already existed.</p>
<p>To fix it, we incremented our sequences in the failover function:</p>
<pre><code><span>-</span><span>           (println "we are caught up!")</span>
<span></span><span>+</span><span>           (sql/execute! next-pool</span>
<span></span><span>+</span><span>                         ["select setval('transactions_id_seq', ?::bigint, true)"</span>
<span></span><span>+</span><span>                         (+ (:id row) 1000)])</span>
</code></pre><p>This time we ran the failover function...and it worked great!</p>
<p>If you’re curious, here’s how the actual failover <a href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant/blob/main/server/src/instant/jdbc/failover.clj#L25-L87">function</a> looked for production.</p>
<h3 id="running-in-prod">Running in Prod</h3>
<p>Now that we had a good practice run, we got ourselves ready, had our sparkling waters in hand, and began to ran our steps in production. </p>
<p>After about a 3.5 second pause <sup id="marked-fnref-13"><a href="#marked-fn-13">[13]</a></sup>, the failover function completed smoothly! We had a new Postgres instance serving requests, and best of all, nobody noticed. <sup id="marked-fnref-14"><a href="#marked-fn-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Our <code>do-failover-to-new-db</code> worked at our scale, but will probably fail us in a few months. There are two improvements we plan to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>We paused <em>both</em> writes and reads. But technically we don’t need to pause reads. Daniel pushed <a href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant/pull/743">up a PR</a> to be explicit about read-only connections. In the future we can skip pausing them.</li>
<li>In December we were able to scale down to one big machine. We’re approaching the limits to one big machine today. <sup id="marked-fnref-15"><a href="#marked-fn-15">[15]</a></sup> We’re going to try to evolve this into a kind of <code>two-phase-commit</code>, where each machine reports their stage, and a coordinator progresses when all machines hit the same stage.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>Aand that’s our story of how did our major version upgrade. We wanted to finish up with a summary of learnings, in the hopes that’s easier for you to get back to this essay when you’re considering an upgrade. Here’s what we wish we knew when we started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes, newer Postgres versions improve perf. Make sure to check this if you face perf issues.</li>
<li>If you need to upgrade<ol>
<li>Pick a buddy if you can, it’s a lot more fun (and less nerve-racking) to do this with a partner.</li>
<li>Before you do anything in production, do a full rehearsal. Use a staging environment that mimics production as closely as possible</li>
<li>If you are okay with 15 minutes of downtime, do an <a href="#in-place-upgrade">in-place upgrade</a></li>
<li>If you don’t have active replication slots and are okay with a minute of downtime, try a <a href="#blue-green-deployment">blue-green deployment</a></li>
<li>When you need to do a manual upgrade:<ol>
<li>If you can, skip cloning and create a replica from scratch. There are only <a href="#replica-checklist">7 steps</a></li>
<li>If you wrote custom pg functions, make sure to check your <a href="#search-paths">search_path</a></li>
<li>Do some sanity checks to make sure you don’t <a href="#missing-data">lose data</a></li>
<li>If you can get writes down to one machine, try our <a href="#zero-downtime-algo">algorithm for zero downtime</a></li>

<p><a id="marked-fn-1" href="#marked-fnref-1">[1]</a>  Our sync strategy was inspired by Figma’s LiveGraph and Asana’s Luna. The LiveGraph team wrote a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/livegraph-real-time-data-fetching-at-figma/">great essay</a> that explains the sync strategy. You can read our original <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/next_firebase">design essay</a> to learn more about Instant</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-2" href="#marked-fnref-2">[2]</a>  You may be wondering: how do we host multiple "Instant databases", under one "Aurora database"? The short answer is that we wrote a query engine on top of Postgres. This lets us create a multi-tenant system., where we can "spin up" dbs on demand. I hope to share more about this in a separate essay.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-3" href="#marked-fnref-3">[3]</a>  All of the code (including this blog) is open sourced <a href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant">here</a>.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-4" href="#marked-fnref-4">[4]</a>  <a href="https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/rds/db.r6g.16xlarge">db.r6g.16xlarge</a> would cost us north of 6K per month. That was out of the question for the kind of traffic we were handling.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-5" href="#marked-fnref-5">[5]</a>  In case you were wondering, we also looked to optimize the queries. After we upgraded (took about a day and a half), we added a partial index that improved perf another 50% or so.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-6" href="#marked-fnref-6">[6]</a>  We did see a note about replication in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/blue-green-deployments-switching.html#blue-green-deployments-switching-guardrails">"Switchover Guardrails"</a>, but this note is about the second step: after 1) creating a green deployment, we 2) run the switch.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-7" href="#marked-fnref-7">[7]</a>  The key to discovering this issue was our co-author Daniel’s sleuthing. He planned test upgrades locally: going from 13 → 14 → 15 → 16, to see where things broke. When Daniel tried 13 → 14, it failed. To sanity check things, he then tried a migration from 13 → 13…and that failed too! From there we knew something had to be up with our process.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-8" href="#marked-fnref-8">[8]</a>  An alternative would have been to enhance the dump file with the search path. We like the idea of being more explicit in our definitions though; especially if we can find a good linter.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-9" href="#marked-fnref-9">[9]</a>  Why do we have it? We use the transaction’s id column for record-keeping inside sync servers.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-10" href="#marked-fnref-10">[10]</a>  If you are curious, you can look at a slice of the checklist we used <a href="https://gist.github.com/stopachka/f05d3682223e206ed6465cafe3ec9f2a">here</a>. If you have a hunch where the data loss could have come from, let us know</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-11" href="#marked-fnref-11">[11]</a>  Though even with 30TB, it would only take a week to transfer at a modest 50 mb/second.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-12" href="#marked-fnref-12">[12]</a>  You may be wondering — sure, the transactions table was okay, but what if there was data loss in other tables? We wrote a <a href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant/blob/main/server/src/instant/jdbc/failover.clj#L258">more involved script</a> to check for every table too. We really wanted to make sure there was no data loss.</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-13" href="#marked-fnref-13">[13]</a>  About 2.5 seconds to let active queries complete, and about 1 second for the replica to catch up</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-14" href="#marked-fnref-14">[14]</a>  You may be wondering, how did we run the function? Where’s the feature flag? That’s one more Clojure win: we could SSH into production, and execute this function in our REPL!</p>
<p><a id="marked-fn-15" href="#marked-fnref-15">[15]</a>  The big bottleneck is all the active websocket connections on one machine — it slows down the sync engine too much. If we improve perf, perhaps we can get to one big machine again!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog/deepseek-open-source">https://www.getlago.com/blog/deepseek-open-source</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42866201">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog"><p>Blog</p></a><p>Why DeepSeek had to be open-source (and why it won't defeat OpenAI)</p></div><div><p>By now, you’ve heard of DeepSeek. It’s the Chinese AI lab that trained R1, an open-source reasoning model as good as OpenAI’s o1, but trained on inferior hardware for a fraction of the price. </p><p>‍</p><p>They achieved this with novel training methods that are more efficient than the ones OpenAI, Anthropic and other well-funded competitors use to train their proprietary models. But why would they open-source it? </p><p>‍</p><p>On the surface, it goes against every business textbook you’ve read: If you innovate to build a market-leading product at a fraction of the cost, you should exploit that advantage. Coca-Cola doesn’t open-source its recipe, right? </p><p>‍</p><p>Not in the world of LLMs. I believe DeepSeek almost had to open-source its models—and that open-source models will become more and more dominant as time goes on. </p><h3>‍<br>Why DeepSeek had to go open-source</h3><p>‍<br>DeepSeek is in a unique position. It’s a Chinese company, which probably makes businesses feel uneasy about building with them, especially when you start to deal with customer data—and even more so when you want to be HIPAA compliant or SOC2-certified. </p><p>‍</p><p>A Chinese AI API would likely receive skepticism in the West. But an open-source model instantly builds trust. You have full control if you self-host or use an AI vendor like Together AI. </p><p>‍</p><p>To gain a foothold in Western markets, DeepSeek had to open-source its models. But that’s not just an economic decision. But it’s not just a political decision. I recently heard the quote that “Open-source is not just a technological behavior, it’s also a cultural one”. </p><p>‍</p><p>And open-source companies (at least in the beginning) have to do more with less. It’s precisely because DeepSeek has to deal with export control on cutting-edge chips like Nvidia H100s and GB10s that they had to find more efficient ways of training models. </p><p>‍</p><p>OpenAI, Meta, Google etc. have billions of dollars, massive compute resources and world-class distribution. They don’t need to find a more efficient way to train models when their expensive solution is the only one. In fact, making it easier and cheaper to build LLMs would erode their advantages!</p><p>‍</p><p>Now that has changed. </p><h3>‍<br>Models are getting commoditized</h3><p>‍<br>It feels like a new GPT-4-level LLM gets released every week. In the AI apps I use, I can’t tell if I’m using LLaMa, GPT, Claude or Mistral models. They’re pretty equal in performance both in my personal experience and in benchmarks. </p><p>‍</p><p>OpenAI is still the leader. They were the first to release a reasoning model and the first to release GPT-4. But models are getting commoditized—and it’s worth asking whether it’s worth paying the premium the OpenAI API charges compared to open-source models. </p><p>‍</p><p>DeepSeek might be the starkest example of this. Compare $60 per million output tokens for OpenAI o1 to $7 per million output tokens on Together AI for DeepSeek R1. </p><p>‍</p><p>If your end user doesn’t know the difference, why would you pay that much more? This is especially important in infrastructure.</p><h3>‍<br>In infrastructure, open-source wins (eventually)</h3><p>‍<br>There’s often a tradeoff with using open-source and proprietary software: Open-source is cheaper and more customizable, but ties up more resources (and requires technical knowledge) because you have to maintain it yourself. Proprietary costs more, but offers a smoother (if more rigid) experience.</p><p>For many product categories, this tradeoff is not worth making for most companies. You don’t want to lose your knowledge base because your self-hosted Notion alternative made an error. </p><p>‍</p><p>But infrastructure is always custom. It always requires work from you. Even a proprietary Oracle database requires a ton of work to set up and maintain. This is why open-source databases are more and more popular. </p><p>‍</p><p>The advantage of proprietary software (No maintenance, no technical knowledge required, etc.) is much lower for infrastructure. It’s actually the opposite: The more technical a product, the better it is for the user (engineers) to work with open-source because they can audit the codebase.</p><p>‍</p><p>This is also why we’re building Lago as an open-source company. We know billing gets complex whether you build your own or use a vendor, so the engineers prefer to work with Lago.</p><p>‍</p><p>The same is true for LLMs. To build any useful product, you’ll be doing a lot of custom prompting and engineering anyway, so you may as well use DeepSeek’s R1 over OpenAI’s o1. </p><p>‍</p><p>This is why there are a lot of successful open-source infrastructure companies and almost no successful open source consumer companies. </p><p>‍</p><p>Does that mean proprietary AI is done? No. </p><h3>‍<br>OpenAI is far from over</h3><p>‍<br>There’s a lot of talk about how OpenAI will be obsolete because of DeepSeek R1 or other open-source models. But that’s not true. First, OpenAI has always been first to market, both with LLMs like GPT-4 and reasoning models like o1. </p><p>‍</p><p>Without OpenAI’s models, DeepSeek R1 and many other models wouldn’t exist (because of LLM distillation). This does beg the question of whether it’s still worth it to build new frontier models if you provide the breakthrough and someone else ships something similar for much cheaper. </p><p>‍</p><p>But R1 might also wake up the well-funded incumbents and force them to find more efficient methods—and who knows what they can build when they have both efficiency and all the resources in the world.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I tried to click on it to make it go away but instead it changed the entire email because apparently it was saying that it needed to “polish” my email because I guess I’m too unsophisticated to use words:</p>

<p>There is no way in hell anyone who knows me would get that email and not think I’d been abducted so I deleted the suggested rewrite and updated my email:</p>

<p>But after I added the update gmail was like, “YOU’RE STILL DOING IT WRONG, IDIOT?” and the polish thing came up <em><strong>again</strong></em> and I was like, “Are you trying to AI fix a paragraph where I say how much I don’t want AI to fix shit?”  And turns out, yeah, that exactly what it meant because it gave me this:</p>

<p><strong>Jesus.</strong> Y’all, if you get an email from me it will be signed with HUGS, LOVE, FIGHT THE PATRIARCHY, DOWN WITH POWDERED GRAVY or SORRY I SUCK SO MUCH. It will be filled with typos and rambling parentheticals and apologies for answering several months too late. This is how you know it’s me and not a robot. My only hope is that my constant declining of the suggestions will make the AI learn from me and spread my terrible etiquette throughout the world.</p>



<p>Also, I just realized when I tried to insert these pictures into this blog about how much I hate AI my blog was suddenly like, “HEY I KNOW YOU JUST CLICKED A BUTTOM SAYING YOU WANT TO ADD A SPECIFIC PICTURE BUT HOW ABOUT WE JUST MAKE AI IMAGES FOR YOU INSTEAD?”  <strong><em>AM I ON CANDID CAMERA?</em></strong>  It’s like my whole computer is a toddler screaming “LET ME DO IT!” every time I try to create something.</p>

<p>And as much as I hate AI, I had to see what the program thought it could do so much better than me so I gave it the prompt “please stop giving me AI” and…all apologies.  Clearly I <strong><em>did</em></strong> need help because…fucking wow.  Nailed it:</p>

<div id="article-body">
<p>German outlet Heise.de says it may have uncovered fraud after hearing from many of its readers who bought supposedly new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/seagate" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/seagate">Seagate</a> hard drives, which turned out to be very much used.</p><p>Last week, the publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.heise.de/news/Gebrauchte-Seagate-Festplatten-als-Neuware-im-Umlauf-10254276.html" data-url="https://www.heise.de/news/Gebrauchte-Seagate-Festplatten-als-Neuware-im-Umlauf-10254276.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">relayed</a> the experience of one of Heise.de’s readers, who said he had bought a couple of 14TB Seagate Exos HDDs that seemed a little strange. The drives had some minor signs of wear on the outside, but after a quick look at the SMART stats, everything appeared normal. Later, though, the reader did a more thorough Field Accessible Reliability Metrics (FARM) test and discovered that one drive had already been used for 10,000 hours, and the other 15,000 hours.</p><p>Naturally, he returned the drives to the store he bought them from, an official Seagate retailer, and decided to replace them with two 16TB Exos HDDs purchased from a different store. These drives also turned out to be heavily used: 22,000 hours logged on each one.</p><p>Although both HDD sellers, neither of which Heise.de identified, claimed the Exos drives were simply brand-new retail models, Seagate told the publication that all four drives were actually OEM models. This meant that the normal five-year warranty did not apply like it would to typical drives bought at retail.</p><p>The initial retailer eventually stopped selling the 14TB and 16TB HDDs at some point and even canceled an order that Heise.de had anonymously placed. According to the report, Seagate is looking into how this happened, especially as one of the retailers has the storage corporation’s endorsement as an official retailer.</p><p>After this report was published, the floodgates opened, and over fifty other Heise.de readers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.heise.de/news/Betrug-mit-Seagate-Festplatten-Dutzende-Leser-melden-Verdachtsfaelle-10258657.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.heise.de/news/Betrug-mit-Seagate-Festplatten-Dutzende-Leser-melden-Verdachtsfaelle-10258657.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">said</a> they experienced the exact same thing after buying apparently new Seagate HDDs. While 50 is a small sample size, the issue might be widespread since they bought their drives at a dozen different retailers, some of which are on Seagate’s official “where-to-buy” list. Some of the impacted retailers are quite large, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> and Mindfactory.</p><p>Most readers report having 16TB Exos drives, but others have the 12TB model, and a few have non-Exos HDDs ranging from 4 to 18TB. The time used ranges from 15,000 to 36,000 hours except for two 4TB HDDs, which were both used for about 50,000 hours. Heise.de checked a few drives at random to see when their warranties expired, and most of them were for 2026. Assuming a five-year warranty, that means they were first made and sold in 2021. All of the readers who reported receiving a used Seagate drive had bought it in the past few weeks, meaning the issue is relatively recent.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-yuaCUcXynTznQQrKVaUXa7"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>It’s hard to imagine this is just a simple mixup, not just because so many retailers are apparently involved but also because they’ve all had their SMART stats reset, which would be very useful to someone trying to pretend a used drive is new. Although it’s not entirely clear if actual fraud is happening here, something has definitely gone very wrong.</p><p>We reached out to Seagate for comment but haven’t received a reply yet.</p><p>Seagate does have a direct relationship with used hard drives. Nearly a year ago, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagate-opens-an-ebay-store-to-sell-refurbished-hard-drives" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagate-opens-an-ebay-store-to-sell-refurbished-hard-drives">launched an official eBay store that sells refurbished drives. It</a> also has a Hard Drive Circularity Program to find as many refurbish-worthy drives as possible, including Exos models. However, this store only sells in the US, so it doesn’t seem likely that it has anything to do with the current situation.</p>
