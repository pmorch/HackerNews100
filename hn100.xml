<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Software vendors keen to monetize AI should tread cautiously, since they risk inflating costs for their customers without delivering any promised benefits such as reducing employee head count.</p>
<p>The latest report from McKinsey &amp; Company mulls what software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors need to do to navigate the minefield of hype that surrounds AI and successfully fold such capabilities into their offerings.</p>
<p>According to the consultancy, there are three main challenges it identifies as holding back broader growth in AI software monetization in the report "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/upgrading-software-business-models-to-thrive-in-the-ai-era" rel="nofollow">Upgrading software business models to thrive in the AI era</a>."</p>

    

<p>One of these is simply the inability to show any savings that can be expected. Many software firms trumpet potential use cases for AI, but only 30 percent have published quantifiable return on investment from real customer deployments.</p>

        


        

<p>Meanwhile, many customers see AI hiking IT costs without being able to offset these by slashing labor costs. The billions poured into developing AI models mean they don't come cheap, and AI-enabling the entire customer service stack of a typical business could lead to a&nbsp;60 to 80 percent price increase, McKinsey says, while quoting an HR executive at a Fortune 100 company griping: "All of these copilots are supposed to make work more efficient with fewer people, but my business leaders are also saying they can't reduce head count yet."</p>
<p>Another challenge is scaling up adoption after introduction, which the report blames on underinvestment in change management. It says that for every $1 spent on model development, firms should expect to have to spend $3 on change management, which means user training and performance monitoring.</p>

        

<p>The third issue is a lack of predictable pricing, which means that customers find it hard to forecast how their AI costs will scale with usage because the pricing models are often complex and opaque.</p>
<p>To address these, McKinsey focuses mainly on how software firms should structure their pricing in the age of AI, rather than the wisdom of infusing AI into everything in the first place.</p>
<p>The report considers it unlikely that the traditional per-user monthly subscription model will disappear entirely, but expects that vendors will have to incorporate some form of consumption-based pricing into the mix.</p>

        

<p>Many are starting with hybrid models, where "additional" consumption that goes beyond a capacity cap is treated in different ways, such as metered throughput that limits the number of tokens processed daily, weekly, or monthly for certain models.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/gartner_ai_agents/">AI agent hypefest crashing up against cautious leaders, Gartner finds</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/gartner_ai_spending/">AI in your toaster: Analyst predicts $1.5T global spend in 2025</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/14/datacenter_investment/">Amazon's $100B DC spend similar to entire Costa Rica GDP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, firms with hybrid models will need to revisit their choices frequently, it warns, as the rapid pace of AI evolution means that capabilities that are cutting-edge at launch can quickly become table stakes.</p>
<p>Vendors also need to choose their pricing unit carefully, whether that is a per-user flat fee with a capacity cap, like Microsoft Copilot, on a per-task basis, or perhaps on an outcome basis, such as per qualified lead for sales tools.</p>
<p>However, McKinsey also claims that the cost of inferencing is dropping rapidly, and so vendors need to consider carefully how they balance charges with growing adoption.&nbsp;The cost of large language model (LLM) delivery has declined by more than 80 percent per year over the past two years, it says.</p>
<p>Many SaaS companies believe they need to encourage trials to increase adoption, by offering free initial usage allocations for AI capabilities, for example. Once customers adopt and see value, the thinking goes, the firm can then look to upsell to a higher allocation for additional use cases. The problem with that, of course, is that one MIT study found that many enterprise organizations have so far <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/generative_ai_zero_return_95_percent/">seen zero return</a> from their AI efforts.</p>
<p>Buyers are also changing, McKinsey believes. It says purchasing decisions are shifting from the IT department to line-of-business units. These leaders are increasingly making budget trade-offs between head count investment and AI deployment, and expect vendors to engage them on value and outcomes, not just features.</p>
<p>That could be a tricky sell, when trials of AI tools such as Microsoft's Copilot by a UK government department reveal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/04/m365_copilot_uk_government/">no discernible boost in productivity</a>. Still, the AI firms have to recoup all those billions they've already invested somehow, don't they? ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>It’s unfortunately not uncommon for pedestrians to be killed by cars in the US. More than 7,300 pedestrians were killed in motor vehicle accidents in the US in 2023, around 18% of all motor vehicle deaths that year. Until around 2009, pedestrian deaths in the US had been falling, declining from 7,516 deaths in 1975 to just 4,109 in 2009 (in per capita terms, this decline would be even larger.) But since 2009, pedestrian deaths have surged.</p><p>Motor vehicle deaths overall are up, but not nearly to the same degree. From 2009 to 2023, non-pedestrian motor vehicle deaths in the US increased by around 13%, compared to a 78% increase in pedestrian deaths. (The low point in non-pedestrian motor vehicle deaths is actually 2014; deaths are up 20% since then.)</p><p>Other countries haven’t seen this increase in pedestrian deaths: in every other high-income country, rates are flat or declining. Whatever’s causing the problem seems to be limited to the US.</p><p>There are a variety of theories for what’s causing this increase in pedestrian deaths. Perhaps the most common theory is that as trucks and SUVs have become both more popular and larger (in height and overall size), pedestrian collisions have become more frequent and more deadly. Another theory (one that’s harder to square with the “US only” nature of the phenomenon) is that drivers are increasingly distracted by smartphones, leading to more accidents. And of course, it could be something else entirely, such as drivers becoming more reckless for some reason.</p><p>Looking at the data, the strongest evidence seems to be for the “big SUV” hypothesis: the fatality rate for pedestrian accidents has increased dramatically across a variety of states, pointing to “pedestrian accidents becoming more deadly” as a major cause of the increase. But the case for it isn’t open and shut, as pedestrian deaths involving sedans and compacts have also increased. And while there isn’t much evidence for the “distracted by phones” hypothesis, it’s also hard to rule it out completely.</p><p><span>To investigate US pedestrian fatalities, we can use </span><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars" rel="">NHTSA Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data</a><span>, which collects information on motor vehicle fatalities going back to 1975. FARS data is very thorough (it includes vehicle identification numbers, or VINs, the time of accident down to the minute, and the exact coordinates of the crash), making it possible to investigate a variety of possible explanations for the fatality increase. To start, let’s get a sense of where these pedestrian deaths are happening. The map below shows every pedestrian death in the continental US in 2023: each dot is a pedestrian death.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png" width="1359" height="730" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:730,&quot;width&quot;:1359,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This is one of those maps that’s also a </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/1138/" rel="">population map</a><span> — pedestrian deaths tend to be concentrated in major metro areas, where there’s the most people and the most driving. If we look at pedestrian deaths by state, we see the same pattern, though it’s also clear some states are punching above and below their weight.

But New York, the 4th most populous state, has fewer pedestrian deaths than Georgia, the 8th most populous state.</span></p><p>If we look at pedestrian deaths per capita, we see that deaths are much more frequent in the West and the South, and less frequent in the Northeast and the Midwest. This does not appear to be due to larger amounts of driving in the South and the West. There’s little correlation between the number of vehicle miles traveled and the pedestrian death rate.</p><p>These numbers are all from 2023. If we look at the change in pedestrian deaths over time, we can see that the rise in pedestrian deaths is worse in the South, but besides a handful of states (Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, West Virginia, New Jersey, and Vermont), every state has seen substantial increases in pedestrian deaths.

So the problem isn’t reckless young drivers.</p><p>What about trends in drug and alcohol use? According to FARS data, deaths that involved drivers drinking are up modestly, but are a very small fraction of overall pedestrian deaths. The increase in driver drug use is up by a much greater fraction (more than doubling since 2009), but it’s still a small percentage of pedestrian deaths.</p><p>Interestingly, driver drug and alcohol use in pedestrian fatalities is greatly exceeded by pedestrian alcohol and drug use. (Pedestrian drug use in particular has more than tripled since 2009, while alcohol use is only up modestly.) It’s not enough to explain all of the huge increase in pedestrian deaths, but it’s notable.</p><p>An obvious possible factor in increased deaths is people increasingly distracted by their phones. Unfortunately, FARS data doesn’t give us much to go on here. Since 2010 FARS has tracked whether drivers are distracted (by phones or anything else), but in the vast majority (94%) of cases, drivers are marked “not distracted,” “not reported,” or “unknown.”</p><p>Relatedly, in the majority of pedestrian deaths, the pedestrian is blamed for the accident. In 66% of cases, pedestrians are described as “failing to yield right of way,” “jaywalking,” or “in roadway improperly.” In 87% of cases, the driver is not charged with anything following the accident. (This doesn’t necessarily mean the pedestrian was at fault — it could simply indicate that in a pedestrian death we only get one side of the story, which makes it hard to charge the driver with a crime.) About 75% of the time, fatal pedestrian accidents occur outside an intersection (a rate which has been steady since 2010), suggesting pedestrians are most often struck outside of a crosswalk.</p><p>One limitation of the FARS data is that it only tracks pedestrian fatalities: it doesn’t give us any information or trends in non-fatal pedestrian accidents. Many states, however, do track this information.

Oregon went from deaths in 6% of accidents in 2014 to 14% of accidents in 2023. Illinois went from 2.3% of pedestrian accidents being deadly in 2008 to 4.3% in 203. New Mexico went from 8.4% in 2008 to 16.8% in 2023. In many cases, overall pedestrian accidents were flat or even down (Illinois went from 5,877 accidents in 2008 to 4,533 accidents in 2023), even as the number of pedestrian fatalities went up.</p><p><span>Pedestrian accidents getting more deadly seems like fairly strong evidence for the theory that the rise in large SUVs is behind the uptick in pedestrian deaths: it’s not that more pedestrians are getting hit by vehicles, it’s that the ones that are getting hit are more likely to die. There’s other evidence that points to this theory. A </span><a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">study</a><span> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety analyzed 17,897 pedestrian accidents across seven states, and found pedestrians were substantially more likely to be killed when struck by tall vehicles and vehicles with blunt front ends.</span></p><p>However, there’s also some muddying evidence here. If the increase of size and frequency of trucks and SUVs was behind the increase in pedestrian deaths, we wouldn’t expect to see an increase in the frequency of pedestrians killed by sedans or compact cars. However, if we look at pedestrian deaths by model of car, we see that pedestrian deaths involving popular sedans have increased as well. Pedestrian deaths involving Honda Civics and Accords, Toyota Corollas and Camrys, and Nissan Altimas have all increased substantially.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png" width="416" height="287" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:287,&quot;width&quot;:416,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This does not seem to be because these cars suddenly got more popular.

In some states (such as Texas) the frequency of driver inattention as a factor has increased dramatically over time. But in other states it’s either flat (South Carolina, Kentucky), or has decreased substantially (Arizona, California). This doesn’t necessarily disconfirm the phone theory, as drivers may not be reporting that they were distracted (North Carolina’s annual car crash reports, </span><a href="https://connect.ncdot.gov/business/DMV/Pages/Crash-Facts.aspx" rel="">for instance</a><span>, note that “Driver Distraction is a self-reporting contributing circumstance. Therefore, the data collected may not reflect the severity of this issue.” But it’s some evidence against it.</span></p><p>Similarly, if being distracted by phones was a driver of pedestrian deaths, I’d expect there to be more frequent collisions overall. But the state-level data similarly doesn’t show any consistent trend. In some states (Texas, South Carolina) collisions are up substantially, though the rate of increase is less than for pedestrian deaths. But in California and Georgia, among others, they’re down.</p><p>To recap, here’s what we know about pedestrian deaths.</p><ul><li><p>Pedestrian deaths have risen substantially in the US since 2009, by nearly 80%. This increase is seen across the US, though not in every single state. The increase is highest in states in the West and South. There has not been a similar increase in other types of motor vehicle deaths, or in pedestrian deaths in other countries.</p></li><li><p>The increase has happened almost entirely on urban roads: pedestrian deaths on rural roads have remained roughly constant.</p></li><li><p>There has not been much change in what time of day, day of week, or time of year pedestrian deaths are occurring.</p></li><li><p>The 30-39 and 60-79 age brackets have seen the largest increase in victims. Pedestrian deaths of children and teenagers are down over this period. In terms of drivers, the increase has also been largest in the 30-39 and 60-79 age brackets.</p></li><li><p>It’s hard to pin the increase to any specific driver behavior on the road (including mobile phone use). Drivers are rarely charged with a motor vehicle violation following a pedestrian death, and are rarely categorized as “distracted” (by a phone or anything else). State-level data on frequency of driver inattention shows no consistent trends. Rates of driver drinking are only up modestly; rates of driver drug use have risen greatly in percentage terms, but remain a very small fraction of overall pedestrian death accidents. There doesn’t seem to be a clear trend in rates of collisions overall. Drivers don’t seem to be speeding more.</p></li><li><p>In terms of pedestrian behavior, the number of killed pedestrians believed to be using drugs has risen substantially over the period in question, but is still a small fraction of overall pedestrian deaths. Rates of alcohol use by pedestrians have increased modestly. In roughly 2/3rds of pedestrian deaths, the pedestrian is described as “failing to properly yield,” “jaywalking,” or as otherwise improperly in the roadway.</p></li><li><p>In terms of changes in the nature of vehicles, the fatality rate of pedestrian accidents (the proportion of accidents where a pedestrian is killed) has increased dramatically across many different states, suggesting pedestrian accidents are getting more deadly. The frequency of pedestrian deaths in both trucks/SUVs and sedans/compacts has risen substantially.</p></li></ul><p><span>Unfortunately, this doesn’t all add up to a clear cause. The strongest evidence seems to be for the “Big SUV hypothesis” — it’s hard to see what else could be causing the increase in deadliness of pedestrian accidents, and </span><em>not</em><span> cause a similar increase in other things. The Big SUV hypothesis also seems like something that could be limited to the US. But this on its own isn’t completely satisfying: if its big SUVs, why are pedestrian deaths for sedans increasing too? Why aren’t deaths increasing on rural roads? There are still unanswered questions here.</span></p><p>The evidence does not strongly support the “distracted drivers on cell phones” hypothesis, but neither does it totally disconfirm it. The fact that drivers are rarely charged with anything, and are rarely classified as having been driving distracted, could simply be due to the fact that we rarely get more than the driver’s side of the story in pedestrian fatalities. The fact that there’s not a general trend in more auto collisions, or more pedestrian non-fatal collisions, does push against this theory though.</p><p>Beyond these hypotheses, there’s also some evidence that increased drug use (both in drivers and pedestrians) is a factor in increased deaths, though almost certainly not the main one. We also can’t rule out that increased recklessness or distractedness on the part of pedestrians is playing a role.</p><p>One avenue to try and better understand this problem is to look at the level of individual cities, and to try to figure out why places like Boston and Seattle have so few pedestrian deaths compared to other cities.</p></div></div>]]></description>

			</div><div><p>LOS ANGELES – Building on California’s long-standing leadership to protect children’s health and set higher nutrition standards — from his signature on laws <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-28/newsom-signs-bill-to-expel-six-food-dyes-from-california-public-schools" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-28/newsom-signs-bill-to-expel-six-food-dyes-from-california-public-schools">banning</a> dangerous food dyes and chemicals to implementing <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/27/budget/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/27/budget/">universal school meals </a>— Governor Gavin Newsom today signed AB 1264 by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel (D-San Fernando Valley), a bipartisan, first-in-the-nation law providing a statutory definition of ultra-processed foods (UPF). This landmark law will phase out the most concerning ultra-processed foods from school meals in California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The law is based on a simple, common-sense idea: schools should not serve students products that can harm their health or interfere with their ability to learn.</p></div><div><p>California has never waited for Washington or anyone else to lead on kids’ health — we’ve been out front for years, removing harmful additives and improving school nutrition. This first-in-the-nation law builds on that work to make sure every California student has access to healthy, delicious meals that help them thrive.</p>
<p><small>Governor Gavin Newsom</small></p>
<p>For too many students, the meals they receive at school are the only ones they can count on in a day, which makes the quality of that food all the more important. By removing the most concerning ultra-processed foods, we’re helping children stay nourished, focused, and ready to learn. AB 1264 is the first law of its kind in the nation and builds on California’s long record of leading with children’s health and well-being at the forefront. While Washington debates how to ‘make America healthy again,’ they need not look any further than California.</p>
<p><small>First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom </small></p></div><p><span><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Governor-Newsom-Signs-Legislation-Phasing-Out-Ultra-Processed-Foods-from-School-Meals-PRESS-RELEASE-GIF.gif" alt="" title=""></span>
			</p><div><p>“With Governor Newsom’s signature on AB 1264, California has taken a historic step toward protecting our children from harmful ultra-processed foods and chemical additives,” <strong>said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel</strong>. “While Washington DC is paralyzed by inaction, California is once again leading the nation with a bipartisan, commonsense, science-based approach. Here in the Golden State, Democrats and Republicans are joining forces to ensure that students are receiving healthy, nutritious meals that are made from real foods, not harmful chemical additives. I applaud Governor Newsom for his continued leadership on food safety and I am grateful to the dedicated advocates from around the country who worked tirelessly to help us pass this important new law.”</p>
<p>California’s work to promote healthier school food long predates the national “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Since taking office, Governor Newsom and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom have advanced a series of first-in-the-nation reforms to eliminate toxic additives, strengthen nutrition standards, and expand healthy food access in schools statewide.</p></div><p><span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-scaled.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-980x653.jpg 980w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2560px, 100vw"></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p><span>Meta open-sourced React over a decade ago to help developers build better user experiences. Since then, React has grown into one of the world’s most popular open source projects,</span><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/React"> <span>powering over 50 million websites</span></a><span> and products built by</span><a href="https://reactnative.dev/showcase"> <span>companies such as Microsoft, Shopify, Bloomberg, Discord, Coinbase, the NFL, and many others</span></a><span>. With React Native, React has expanded to support platforms beyond the web, including mobile, tablets, desktops, TVs, gaming consoles, and even mixed reality devices.</span></p>
<p><span>This incredible growth is thanks to the thousands of educators, companies, and projects that have contributed to the development of React. The community is the heart of React, and we’re proud to play a part in the cycle of open source innovation throughout the ecosystem that benefits everyone. We’re pleased to give a seat at the table to the people and companies that have made React what it is today.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we are excited to announce the next step for React. Several projects within the React ecosystem, including React and React Native, as well as supporting projects such as JSX, will transition to the React Foundation. The React Foundation’s mission is to help the React community and its members. The React Foundation will maintain React’s infrastructure, organize</span><a href="https://conf.react.dev/"> <span>React Conf</span></a><span>, and create initiatives to support the React ecosystem. The React Foundation will be part of the Linux Foundation, which has long fostered a vendor-neutral environment for open source projects.</span></p>
<h2>Formalizing Governance</h2>
<p><span>The React Foundation’s governing board will consist of representatives from Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel, with the intention to expand further over time.</span></p>
<p><span>There will be a clear separation between the business and technical governance of React. Releases, features, and technical direction will be governed by a new structure driven by the maintainers and contributors of React. This new technical governance structure will be independent of the React Foundation. The React team is actively working on this new technical governance structure and will share more details in a future post on </span><a href="https://react.dev/blog"><span>the React blog</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2>Meta and the React Foundation</h2>
<p><span>Meta is committing to a five-year partnership with the React Foundation, including over $3 million in funding and dedicated engineering support. This investment will ensure React’s smooth transition to independent governance while maintaining the stability and innovation the community expects. Meta will continue to invest in React and use it as our primary tool for building UI on the web and across many of Meta’s apps. Meta will also continue to have a dedicated team of engineers working full-time on React and React Native.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe the best of React is yet to come. The React Foundation will unlock new opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth that will benefit the entire ecosystem. We’re excited to see what the community will build together under this new model. With strengthened governance, broader industry participation, and continued technical excellence, React is positioned to tackle the next generation of challenges in UI development.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5885">
	

	<div>
			
<p>On June 30, 2025, Mark Brittenham and Susan Hermiller uploaded a preprint to the arXiv called  “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24088">Unknotting number is not additive under connected sum</a>” (and an updated version on September 15, 2025). In it, they surprised the mathematical community by giving a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture in knot theory. The story was picked up by publications like <em><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-knot-theory-discovery-overturns-long-held-mathematical-assumption/">Scientific American</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-simple-way-to-measure-knots-has-come-unraveled-20250922/">Quanta</a></em> and by math YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx7f-nGohVc">Matt Parker</a>.</p>



<p>The conjecture is easy to understand, although we need a few definitions first. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory">(Mathematical) knot</a></strong>: We can think of a mathematical knot as a loop of string sitting in three-dimensional space. In other words, if we took a piece of string, tied a knot, and then glued the two ends together, we’d get a mathematical knot.</p>



<p><strong>Knot projection:</strong> Given any mathematical knot, we draw a two-dimensional version of it in the plane. It is like the shadow of the knot, but with breaks in the knot to indicate which strand is on top and which is on the bottom.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknotting_number">Unknotting number</a>:</strong> If we have the projection of a knot, we can change some crossings (change which strand is over and which is under) to make it unknotted (called the unknot). To compute the unknotting number of a knot <em>K</em>, <em>u</em>(<em>K</em>), we look at all possible projections and find the fewest number of crossing changes we must make to obtain the unknot.</p>



<p><strong>Connected sum:</strong> Given two knots, <em>J</em> and <em>K</em>, we can cut each knot at one point and join the cut ends to form a new, larger knot, <em>J</em>#<em>K</em>. This is called the connected sum of the knots.</p>



<p>Below, we see a knot called the (2,7) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot">torus knot</a> and its mirror image (left), and their connected sum on the right.</p>



<figure><a href="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5893" data-permalink="https://divisbyzero.com/1-2/" data-orig-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg" data-orig-size="917,1017" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg?w=271" data-large-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg?w=917" width="917" height="1017" src="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Although unknotting numbers are notoriously difficult to compute, we know that the unknotting number of a (<em>p,q</em>) torus knot is (p-1)(q-1)/2. So, the (2,7) torus knots above have unknotting number (2&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)(7&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. It is not difficult to check that by changing three crossings of the projections shown above, the (2,7) torus knot becomes the unknot. It turns out that changing two crossings does not suffice in this projection or any projection.</p>



<p>Likewise, changing 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 crossings of the connected sum will yield the unknot. In fact, it will always be the case that <em>u</em>(<em>J</em>#<em>K</em>)&nbsp;≤<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>J</em>)&nbsp;+<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>K</em>). The question is: are these equal? An “old” conjecture (which was implicit in an article 88 years ago), states:</p>



<p><strong>Conjecture: </strong>If <em>J</em> and <em>K</em> are knots, then <em>u</em>(<em>J</em>#<em>K</em>)&nbsp;=<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>J</em>)&nbsp;+<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>K</em>). </p>



<p>In their preprint, Brittenham and Hermiller disprove the conjecture by giving a counterexample! Moreover, the counterexample is precisely the one I’ve shown above! The connected sum of the torus knot with its mirror image has unknotting number 5, which is clearly less than&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3. </p>



<p>That said, we can’t simply change the five crossings in the above projection to obtain the unknot. We must produce a different projection first. But what is it?</p>



<p>I looked for the answer online and found this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14265">arXiv preprint</a> by Chao Wang and Yimu Zhang, which gives the details. They provide the projection and the crossings that must be changed. However, the projection has 56 crossings (far more than the original 14!). They assert, but do not show, that the resulting knot—after the five crossings are changed—is the unknot. They end by writing, “We prefer to leave it to the readers as an interesting game.”</p>



<p>Never good at resisting a good <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniping</a>, I decided to take them up on the challenge. I’m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to confirm their work, but I did it. Here is my redrawn version of the knot projection—the connected sum of the (2,7) torus knot and its mirror image. The circled crossings are the five that must be changed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-e1759968088408.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5889" data-permalink="https://divisbyzero.com/1/" data-orig-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-e1759968088408.jpg" data-orig-size="748,1017" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="0" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-e1759968088408.jpg?w=221" data-large-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-e1759968088408.jpg?w=748" width="748" height="1017" src="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-e1759968088408.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>After having done so, here’s the resulting projection. Wang and Zhang claim that it is the unknot!</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are my drawings. This first sequence shows how I get from the usual projection of the connected sum to the projection in which the crossings must be made. The red strands show the part of the projection that has changed from the previous projection.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p> California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed a bill which requires web browsers to make it easier for Californians to opt-out of allowing third parties to sell their data. </p><p> The California Consumer Privacy Act, signed in 2018, gave Californians the right to send opt-out signals, but major browsers have not had to make opt-outs simple to use. The bill signed Wednesday would require them to set up an easy-to-find mechanism that lets Californians opt-out with the push of a button, instead of having to do so repeatedly when visiting individual websites. </p><p> Privacy and consumer rights activists have been nervously waiting for Newsom to sign the bill, which <a href="https://therecord.media/california-legislature-passes-bill-data-sharing-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> the California legislature on September 11 and is the first law in the country of its kind. The governor had vetoed a similar but broader bill last year which also applied to mobile operating systems. </p><p> “These signals are going to be available to millions more people and it's going to be much easier for them to opt out,” said Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports. </p><p> Until now, Schwartz said, individuals who want to use a universal opt out have had to download third party browser extensions or use a privacy protective browser. </p><p> Other bills signed by Newsom on Wednesday also give Californians important data privacy rights.&nbsp; </p><p> One of them requires social media companies to make it easy to cancel accounts and mandates that cancellation lead to full deletion of consumers’ data. A second bolsters the state’s Data Broker Registration Law by giving consumers more information about what personal data is collected by data brokers and who can obtain it. </p></span></p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This is the first in a series of blog posts describing my experience developing a low latency 10G Ethernet core for FPGA. I decided to do this as a personal project to develop expertise in low latency FPGA design and high-speed Ethernet, as well as to experiment with tools and techniques that I could use full-time. As a small spoiler, the design has less than <strong>60ns loopback latency</strong>, which is comparable to commercial offerings.</p>

<p>These posts will focus on the things that are likely different to a ‘standard’ design, as I believe this will be more interesting to the reader. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use of <a href="https://www.cocotb.org/">cocotb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyuvm/pyuvm">pyuvm</a> for verification</li>
  <li>The techniques implemented to reduce packet processing latency</li>
  <li>Analysis of commercially available low latency and ‘ultra’-low latency cores</li>
  <li>Latency measurement results and comparison</li>
  <li>Other techniques not implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you decide to start a coding bootcamp. Your background is in pedagogy and you love teaching. Your parents were teachers.</p>



<p>You find a co-founder, raise a bit of money, and pour your soul into your company.</p>



<p>The first couple of years, students<em> love</em> your program. Positive feedback, extraordinary student outcomes, employees love the mission. You are quite literally changing lives.</p>



<p>Your business grows. One day, you realize you’ve grown to 70 employees.</p>



<p>And then…</p>



<p>A competitor gets control of the main subreddit for your industry by becoming a Reddit Moderator.</p>



<p>That watering hole becomes their megaphone. They are not shy about using it. An all-out attack on your brand begins. The barrage of accusations and harassment are relentless. The attacks happen daily. You become a neurotic fixation of the moderator. Every little thing you do represents your failings as a company.</p>



<p>You get compared to a sex cult. One of your employees is accused of nepotism. The mod starts joining your company information sessions for prospective students, slinging conspiracy theories at every turn under a pseudonym. You avoid outright bans to avoid appearing biased yourself. Your own employees start wondering if these accusations have merit, some leave.</p>



<p>Even worse, confidential information from your company starts leaking out. There’s a mole. Or at least your team suspects it. No one knows who to trust. Your carefully built company culture? Eviscerated from the inside out.</p>



<p>Any time you attempt to defend yourself in the main subreddit, posts get deleted. Or you’re accused of running a Reddit bot army.</p>



<p>This goes on for years.</p>



<p>Every day, another attack. Every fucking day.</p>



<p>Student applications drop. First a little… then a lot.</p>



<p>Combined with a market downtown, your revenue collapses by 80%.</p>



<p>You go through 2 layoffs just to keep the lights on. A bunch of other folks move on. You’re down to 15 employees now.</p>



<p>The attacks don’t stop. If anything, they escalate.</p>



<p>And you begin to wonder, as the CEO and founder of your company… “Maybe I’m the problem? Maybe I <em>am</em> doing something wrong? Or somehow encouraging these attacks on my company?”</p>



<p>You make a decision to leave.</p>



<p>You step down, walk away from everything you built, and start anew.</p>



<p>But even then, the attacks don’t stop. Nothing can stop this nightmare.</p>



<p>This is the story of Will Sentance and his company, Codesmith.</p>



<p>It can happen to your business too.</p>



<h2>The Codesmith Reputation Attack via Google</h2>



<p>For many businesses, the first page of Google for their brand name is the single most important asset for managing their reputation.</p>



<p>Let’s say I’m considering a bootcamp, I hear about “Codesmith,” and pop it into Google.</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2034" height="1674" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png 2034w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-300x247.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1024x843.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-768x632.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1536x1264.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me that’s bad. This is the number 2 result right after the company website.</p>



<ul>
<li>“Codesmith is an enormous waste of money”</li>



<li>“Do Not Go To Codesmith”</li>
</ul>



<p>I don’t even have to click, Google is serving that stuff up right under the company’s website. God damn.</p>



<p>That top Reddit thread has been ranking highly for Codesmith brand terms since Sept 2024. That’s a year’s worth of brand carnage.</p>



<p><strong>Pay close attention to the subreddit all those threads are from: r/codingbootcamp. That’s the key to all this.</strong></p>



<h2>Are LLMs Also a Reputation Attack Vector on Codesmith?</h2>



<p>Yup.</p>



<p>My prompt in ChatGPT was “is codesmith a good bootcamp?”.</p>



<p>The intro has a bunch of standard stuff, and then there was this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="608" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-300x178.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-768x456.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1536x911.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Same Reddit threads are featured, same brand-destroying quotes.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.cirr.org/">CIRR</a> is a nonprofit in the bootcamp industry that collects graduation data across the industry. It’s a neutral third-party with the goal of providing transparency on student outcomes across coding bootcamps. If your graduation rates are solid, wouldn’t it make sense for a competitor to call that data into question? ChatGPT is regurgitating those same doubts here.</p>



<p>At this point, I’ve done a quick brand search and asked ChatGPT if Codesmith is any good. I already have a TON of doubts as a prospect.</p>



<p>I don’t believe this is an accident. Or a result of Codesmith’s actual quality as a bootcamp.</p>



<p>I believe this brand attack is the result of one person’s actions.</p>



<p>When I’ve researched Codesmith’s brand, every Reddit thread I’ve seen in Google and various LLMs have all been from a single subreddit: r/codingbootcamp. That subreddit is controlled by the Reddit Moderator Michael Novati.</p>



<h2>Who is Michael Novati?</h2>



<p>For the best recap of Michael, listen to <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta">this interview from Pragmatic Engineer Gergely Orosz</a>.</p>



<p>The highlights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael joined Facebook early in 2009.</li>



<li>As he tells it, went through a bunch of promotions quickly and made it to Principal Software Engineer (E7).</li>



<li>Left Facebook in 2017.</li>



<li>In 2019, co-founded his dev bootcamp, Formation, with his wife, Sophie Novati. His wife is the CEO, Michael took the CTO title.</li>
</ul>



<p>In that interview, Michael tells a story about playing Risk (the board game) with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>“<em>The way we became friends, he [Zuckerberg] used to play Risk, the board game. I think it was once a week that people would get together. Like 4 or 5 people. He would show up often and I really liked Risk. I would always play Risk as a kid for whatever reason, I don’t even know why.</em></p>



<p><em>And one day, we’re down to the final three people. And it was me, him, and I was losing. Mark was in second place, the leader was taking over.</em></p>



<p><em>I did a really.. uhhh.. let’s say delicate, strategic maneuver. Where I made an alliance with him to share resources and go after the first place person. So he went all in on the first place person.</em></p>



<p><em>My turn’s next. I did not go all in against the first place person, I took over Mark’s remaining resources. He just dwindled going after the first place person. He accepted my friendship request [on Facebook] very shortly that evening.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s weird, I basically backstabbed him in the game, really bad. Blatantly to his face. But it’s the game, that’s what Risk is. It’s a strategy game. I think he appreciated the strategy I had. It made him feel more like he could trust me. Even though I backstabbed him, he knows where my strategic thinking is coming from.</em>“</p>



<p>Now, is this just a funny anecdote about an early Facebook backstabbing Mark Zuckerberg and then becoming friends? Maybe.</p>



<p>For me, it tells me a lot about how Michael Novati plays competitive games. In my experience, people tend to run businesses the same way they compete at anything. Maybe Michael is the exception.</p>



<p>I do have to admit, it takes some real cojones to fuck over your boss that hard in a board game. Especially when that boss is Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>One last note: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/software-engineer-training-platform-formation-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Formation raised a $4M seed round in 2021, led by Andreessen Horowitz.</a></p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Control Over the Coding Bootcamp Industry</h2>



<p>Michael Novati’s power over the coding bootcamp industry comes from one place: being a moderator on the subreddit r/codingbootcamp.</p>



<p>He is, by far, the most active moderator for the subreddit. You’ll bump into him immediately just by visiting the subreddit:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="586" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-300x172.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-768x440.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1536x879.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-2048x1172.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>What about the other mods?</p>



<ul>
<li>u/samabuna hasn’t posted in about 8 years.</li>



<li>u/dowcet/ is still active on Reddit but rarely posts in r/codingbootcamp. When I checked, I only found one comment in the preceeding 1-2 months.</li>
</ul>



<p>So the subreddit is Michael Novati’s show. Full stop.</p>



<p>We have to remember that Reddit isn’t just Reddit anymore. The powers that be have decided that Reddit is infallible, a reliable set of training data for LLMs, and should be featured fucking everywhere.</p>



<p>Before we get to what Michael has actually done, let’s lay out the potential power for anyone that gets control of a key subreddit in their industry:</p>



<ul>
<li>If the subreddit is greenlit by Google, threads in your subreddit can easily pop to the top of Google searches that are extremely valuable to your business. Brand terms, review terms, product categories, major how-to topics, all of it.</li>



<li>LLMs prioritize Reddit heavily. If you want to spin conspiracy theories, those conspiracies will start to become part of the zeitgeist as every LLM regurgitates them.</li>



<li>Skew the narrative for long enough and it’ll be impossible for ANY prospect to not stumble across your skewed narrative when they’re researching products or services.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You can delete posts and comments at will. Want to tip the narrative in your favor? Just delete some of the positive posts of your competitors. To cover your tracks, make up claims about a bot army that’s run by your competitor. You’re fighting the good fight and keeping the barbarians at bay! You don’t even need to actively post negative stuff (but you can if you want to dial up the torture). Just removing positive stuff skews the narrative nicely.</li>



<li>You can ban users at will. Got some troublesome competitors fighting back? Just delete the little shits.</li>



<li>You can pin posts in the subreddit and comments within posts. Great tactic for pushing a narrative when you really need to.</li>
</ul>



<p>What about recourse from your competitors? Can they do anything to stop you?</p>



<p>You can only lose your moderator slot in a few instances:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Reddit Admis get involved, actual Reddit employees. Stuff has to get pretty egregious for that.</li>



<li>Moderators further up the mod list can kick you out. But if you get on good terms with them, or they don’t care, you have free reign.</li>



<li>If there are other mods below you AND you go inactive, you can get kicked by them too. So don’t let any new mods in. And always stay active. Simple.</li>
</ul>



<p>No one else across the industry can do a damn thing. You get to act with impunity.</p>



<p>To be clear, any moderator of an industry subreddit has this power. That’s not a subjective opinion, it’s a fact. That’s how our online platforms currently work.</p>



<p>Michael Novati has this power over the bootcamp industry. Did he wield it benevolently? If he did, I wouldn’t be writing this fucking post.</p>



<h2>How Michael Distorts Narratives on Reddit</h2>



<p>At first, I was going to go through a bunch of Michael Novati’s claims and debunk them.</p>



<p>Then I realized I was missing the entire point.</p>



<p>This isn’t a normal debate where there are two sides of the truth and we need to sort through it to get to the real answer.</p>



<p>It’s about one side torching the truth with a firehose of chaos and distortion.</p>



<p>Prospects in the bootcamp space are evaluating whether or not to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. It’s the price of a goddamn car. It doesn’t take much to get someone to pause and redirect their purchase journey.</p>



<p>So let’s go through a few of the worst examples.</p>



<h3>Compare Your Competitor to a Sex Cult (Loosely for Deniability)</h3>



<p>Here’s a fucked up one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Reddit user, with a first-time post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/12r57se/as_a_former_codesmith_employee_codesmith_is_an/">posts a major takedown of Codesmith</a>, claiming to be a former employee. Tons of allegations about mismanagement, poor curriculum, and backroom dealing with CIRR. I personally think these allegations are bullshit but that’s not the most fucked up part in this thread.</p>



<p>u/rosiebeir joins the conversation and gives a measured take on their experience as a student in Codesmith:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="317" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-300x93.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-768x238.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png 1428w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the comment is about different aspects of the Codesmith program that could be improved. It all feels genuine to me. Further down, they say this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="206" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-300x60.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-768x155.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png 1320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Wow, that’s a helluva endorsement.</p>



<p>This is where Michael jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="932" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-300x273.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-768x699.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png 1312w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>If you’re not familiar with NXIVM (Michael got the spelling wrong), go watch The Vow on HBO. Short story: NXIVM was a sex cult disguised as a self-improvement group and the founder went to prison.</p>



<p>Did Michael just compare Codemith to a goddamn sex cult? Yes he did folks.</p>



<p>Let’s put aside the subject matter for a second. Michael’s use of rhetoric is a master class on how to destroy someone’s reputation without technically saying the horrible thing you’re actually saying.</p>



<p>Michael takes an incredible testimonial from a student (“Codesmith changed my life”), and associates that comment with the sort of things he hears from sex cults. He doesn’t technically call Codesmith a sex cult, he merely makes the association. He also wraps it with other positive comments to look more measured: “something I hear very often” and “I love that Codesmith changed your life.” But these aren’t good things, they’re red flags! Sex cults do the same thing! Someone could get taken advantage of!</p>



<p>Oh so innocent aren’t we Michael?</p>



<p>Now any time a bootcamp prospect wanders into this thread:</p>



<ul>
<li>They see the genuine, positive review from a former student.</li>



<li>A supposed figure of authority (a Reddit moderator), plants a seed questioning that testimonial.</li>



<li>The same mod connects Codesmith to a sex cult in a way that also offers complete deniability.</li>



<li>To top it all off, most folks won’t realize that the Reddit mod is a cofounder of a competing company.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bravo Michael, brav-fucking-o.</p>



<h3>From Reddit Troll to LinkedIn Stalker: The Unhinged Escalation</h3>



<p>This one might piss me off the most.</p>



<p>Michael doesn’t just go after employees, he goes after their <em>kids</em>.</p>



<p>This is a Reddit post about a defunct Codesmith program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="357" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-300x104.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-768x267.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1536x535.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png 1608w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Somehow, as these threads often do, the conversation turns into an all-out attack on Codesmith. This time, Michael goes after Eric Kirsten, a Senior Advisor at Codesmith. Eric spends a good chunk of his time mentoring Codesmith students and helping prepare them for the job hunt.</p>



<p>Here’s Michael’s post:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-1024x768.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-300x225.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-768x576.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post.png 1408w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I do not know what the original comment in this thread was (very convenient). But I do have the original comment from Michael before he edited it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="583" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-300x171.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-768x437.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I talked with Eric myself, here’s the real story:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eric’s wife did a one-time contract project with Codesmith for 9 months.</li>



<li>His son joined as a Codesmith student and had a great outcome. They paid the full program cost and his son went through the normal application process just like everyone else.</li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p>



<p>Michael also decided to email multiple executives at Codesmith about Eric’s son:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="394" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-300x116.jpeg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-768x296.jpeg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1536x591.jpeg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg 1714w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I’ve redacted the son’s name and details because WHY THE FUCK WOULD WE BRING SOMEONE’S KID INTO THIS?</p>



<p>I don’t think I could possibly swear enough in order to convey how utterly insane all this is.</p>



<p>Just imagine this happening at your own company:</p>



<ul>
<li>A cofounder of your competitor, starts attacking one of your employees on Reddit.</li>



<li>Then that cofounder starts LOOKING UP THEIR KIDS ON LINKEDIN</li>



<li>They post weird mentions on Reddit about that kid, accusing your company of nepotism.</li>



<li>THEN EMAILS you and other executives, accusing the kid of falsifying their LinkedIn, threatening to keep calling it out in public.</li>
</ul>



<p>WHAT.</p>



<p>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</p>



<p>What would you do in this situation?</p>



<p>I’m not sure what I would do. But there is no world where this is normal or okay.</p>



<h3>The Great OSP Conspiracy for Manufactured Outrage</h3>



<p>Another favorite tactic of Michael is to take something obscure, and allude to some grand conspiracy behind it.</p>



<p>Like OSPs.</p>



<p>OSP stands for open-source product. It’s a built-in part of the Codesmith program, the capstone project. Here’s how Codesmith explains it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="389" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-300x114.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-768x292.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png 1378w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>This seems incredibly boring, how the hell could someone possibly turn this into a controversy?</p>



<p>If you’re asking that question, you’ve severely underestimated Michael.</p>



<p>A since-deleted Reddit account posted this thread (convenient that it’s a deleted user huh?):</p>

<p>They claim Codesmith students are using OSPs to inflate their resumes to get jobs faster. And that this is endemic at Codesmith.</p>



<p>The comments are a dumpster fire. Michael has posted 11 of the comments, almost a third of the entire conversation.</p>



<p>A former Codesmith student jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="261" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-300x76.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-768x196.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png 1524w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s some back an forth between u/peppimenti and other Reddit users, then Michael responds:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="782" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-300x229.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-768x586.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png 1326w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me, that’s a lot to take in.</p>



<p>Quick tangent: this is another one of Michael’s tactics. Make accusations faster than anyone can possibly fact check them or even process them. I still haven’t figured out what that Phil Troutman reference is.</p>



<p>To summarize, Michael claims he has evidence that Codesmith is aware of the lying on resumes, alludes to a conspiracy with OSLabs, and he believes Codesmith helped verify some of this lying.</p>



<p>Then he associates all of this with “conspiring to commit fraud” and that it’s a “jail-able crime.”</p>



<p>We’ve gone from “Codesmith students complete an OSP during their program” to a shadowy conspiracy and fraud via student resumes. God damn did that escalate.</p>



<p>So I got a hold of the exact SOP that is given by Codesmith to students on how to write their resume. Here’s the section on OSPs:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-300x158.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-768x404.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png 1206w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Codesmith is telling students explicitly not to misrepresent their experience with OSPs as a role at a company. They advocate for transparency, as they should. What students do with that is up to them. And even if some students stretch the truth, no hiring manager is getting fooled by that. End of story.</p>



<p>What about the OSLabs stuff?</p>



<p>When I chatted with Alina (the current CEO of Codesmith), here’s what she had to say on how Codesmith students interact with <a href="https://www.opensourcelabs.io/">OSLabs</a>:</p>



<p>“<em>They [students] get a chance to work on it [projects]. Once those are ready, they submit to OSLabs who keeps the repository and manages the repository. There’s no kind of financial exchange or anything like that. They just hold the repository of the open source dev tools.</em>“</p>



<p>OSLabs is just a nonprofit that manages student repos. That’s it.</p>



<p>Maybe you think there are problems with Codesmith’s guidance. Real quick, why don’t we check some of Michael’s own students from his bootcamp company, Formation?</p>



<p>There’s tons of students on his site. Some of them get featured heavily, like here:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png 702w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-206x300.png 206w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-768x1120.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-1053x1536.png 1053w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png 1316w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></a></figure>



<p>Here’s Carlitos’ LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="807" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-300x236.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-768x605.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1536x1211.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png 1644w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Carlitos is listing his time at Michael’s bootcamp/training company in his experience section. The exact same thing that Michael RAILS on Codesmith for.</p>



<p>To be clear: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this. Carlitos, all the Codesmith students, or ANY student from ANY bootcamp have done nothing wrong by putting stuff like this on their resumes. If Formation students list their time like this, I don’t see anything wrong with that either.</p>



<p>In the thousands of resumes I’ve reviewed, I’ve never had any trouble differentiating between full-time roles, part-time, freelance, training, or any other random item on a resume. Any hiring manager will sniff this stuff from a mile away. No one is fooling anyone.</p>



<p>But Michael has now turned this into a story of fraud facilitated by Codesmith. And here I am writing hundreds of words about this nonsense. There’s nothing here beyond what Michael has conjured into the ether of Reddit.</p>



<p>You might disagree with some of the guidance that Codesmith gives its graduates but no one is doing anything wrong. It sure as fuck aint fraud.</p>



<p>And that’s what Michael is so damn good at, turning innocuous little things into grand conspiracies that take hours of research to untangle.</p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Nonstop Attack Campaign Against Codesmith</h2>



<p>Think I’m cherry picking examples of Michael’s posts?</p>



<p>Let’s zoom out.</p>



<p>My team and I looked at every Reddit post and comment made by Michael Novati over the past 3 months.</p>



<p>We then catalogued the posts that mentioned Codesmith or were referencing Codesmith based on context. Next we categorized those posts based on if the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative towards Codesmith.</p>



<p>Here’s all the days that had negative comments along with their frequency over the past few months:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="939" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-300x275.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-768x704.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fucking relentless.</p>



<p>It’s easier to highlight days where Michael DOESN’T talk about Codesmith. Dude, get a fucking hobby.</p>



<p>What if the past few months don’t adequately reflect Michael’s posting history? What if recent events have just been a negative phase of the bootcamp space? Can we really make any claims using just the last few months?</p>



<p>Fine, let’s go further.</p>



<p>I went to my team and said “fuck it, let’s go back as far as possible.” So we went through all of Michael’s posts since June 2024. That’s when Reddit stops making it easy to pull up comments. Yes, we looked at every post and comment from over a year. No fast and dirty AI analysis here, we did it by hand.</p>



<p>Here’s the timeline of negative posts and comments since June 2024:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="878" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png 878w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-257x300.png 257w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-768x896.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></a></figure>



<p>What. The. Fuck.</p>



<p>Who has the time for this?</p>



<p>In order to adequately show how often Michael posts negative comments about Codesmith, we had to use HABIT TRACKER VISUALIZATIONS.</p>



<p>It’s relentless, it’s nonstop, and in my opinion, completely unhinged. At least Michael slows down a tad during the holidays. Otherwise, he’s all gas, no breaks.</p>



<p>Well, alright, MAYBE Michael was posting in such absurd volume that the positive mentions outweigh the negative? Maybe I’m selectively pulling data?</p>



<p>NOPE.</p>



<p>The comments about Codesmith are severely overweighted on the negative side. In aggregate, here’s how the sentiment breaks down:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-300x200.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-768x512.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Is it just me or is there a weeeee bit of bias in this posting?</p>



<p>Yes, yes, there fucking is.</p>



<p>Alright, fine, MAYBE all this negative attention is deserved. Maybe Codesmith is the villain that Michael claims. Let’s find out.</p>



<h2>Other Bootcamp Competitors Hold Codesmith in High Regard</h2>



<p>I interviewed 10 different folks. Including students, multiple Codesmith employees from the leadership team, and founders of competing coding bootcamps. I dug through countless docs, many of them internal, and probably annoyed some of these folks with my endless requests for screenshots to verify stories.</p>



<p>Overall, I found everyone at Codesmith to be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extremely responsive and on top of their shit. They made promises and kept them.</li>



<li>Transparent to an absurd degree.</li>



<li>Humble, honest, and self-aware.</li>



<li>A desire to do the right thing even at their detriment. These folks don’t know how to play offense, they assume good intent from everyone.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, these are good folks. Faultless? Of course not, everyone makes mistakes.</p>



<p>But I do believe that the world is better with Codesmith in it.</p>



<p>Which makes this whole situation all the more tragic.</p>



<p>Michael isn’t waging some war against another competitor hellbent on profit-seeking. These are folks that are helping people transition their careers. They are quite literally helping people change their lives. And they’re doing it for the right reasons in my opinion.</p>



<p>Don’t take my word for it.</p>



<p>I spoke with Anthony Hughes, a co-founder of <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>, another bootcamp. Here’s what he had to say about Codesmith: “The folks at Codesmith were competitors of Tech Elevator. Especially as everyone went online, we competed directly. I never minded losing to Codesmith. Either choice by students was a good one, both our programs vetted students heavily and would get students great outcomes. If we ever lost to Codesmith, we could accept that because we knew the student would get the outcome they wanted. Not like the lower-quality major programs.”</p>



<p>I also heard the same from Kush Patel, a co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a> “Codesmith is one of the best players in the space. They run their programs in a way that we benchmarked against. There are plenty of other schools that are questionable and are not getting any scrutiny from Michael.”</p>



<p>We have two co-founders of competing bootcamps saying that Codesmith is <em>one of the good ones</em>. Are there shady bootcamps out there? Absolutely. But Codesmith isn’t one of them.</p>



<h2>The Tactics Michael Uses to Wage His PR Nightmare Campaign</h2>



<p>After reading hundreds of Michael’s posts, a few patterns emerge on how he attacks Codesmith.</p>



<p>To be honest, it’s a masterclass on how to gut your opponent via PR. If every move is intentional by Michael, I gotta hand it to him becasue he’s exceptionally good at this.</p>



<p>Here are the most prominent tactics I saw:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Relentless volume.</strong> It’s not enough to post a few days. If you want to destroy someone’s reputation, you gotta hammer the shit outta that drum. Over a 487 day period, we counted 425 negative posts on Codesmith. That’s an average of 0.87 negative posts per day. A negative post almost every fucking day.</li>



<li><strong>Reference multiple conspiracies at the same time.</strong> If you only mention one conspiracy, folks have a straightforward path to getting to the truth. But if you mention 3-4 at the same time? Only the true masochistics like myself will even attempt to pull it apart.</li>



<li><strong>Rarely, if ever, state your full accusation.</strong> For any single conspiracy, always allude to it. Don’t make a full, comprehensive case that allows someone to see the full picture. Let your audience sit with the uncertainty. You don’t need to win the argument, you only need to sow doubt and fear.</li>



<li><strong>Cherry-pick data.</strong> As the saying goes: “there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” For any industry data you can get your hands on, find the slice that skews the narrative in your favor. Don’t worry about anyone fact-checking, they never do.</li>



<li><strong>Attack every misstep, no matter how obscure.</strong> Sooner or later, your victim will make mistakes. When they do, attack. No matter how small or obscure, blow it up into a major drama. Hype, distort, and magnify.</li>



<li><strong>Take down third-party arbitrators.</strong> If your industry has some sort of credential, certification, or regulator, attack that body just as much as your competitor. If your competitor has optimized for this transparency, you’ll turn their strength into a weakness. Even better, accuse both parties of conspiring together.</li>



<li><strong>Blame the victim.</strong> Whenever someone mentions that you’re going too hard, say that your competitor is forcing your hand. “You’d love to move on! You don’t want to spend your time on all this! If ONLY your competitor would do the right thing, then all this would stop!” But we all know it’ll never stop.</li>



<li><strong>Delete comments and posts.</strong> Delete comments and posts to skew the narrative in your favor. You don’t need to delete everything, just enough to make the conversation messy and difficult to follow. And a few key deletions tilts the scales in your favor.</li>



<li><strong>Make your claims squishy.</strong> Don’t ever say your competitor is a cult or committing fraud. Say that things look like it, or remind you of it. You’ll have deniability while the association still gets planted in the minds of your audience.</li>
</ul>



<p>A sign of the times.</p>



<h2>The Impact on Codesmith</h2>



<p>Has all this had a material impact on Codesmith?</p>



<p>I spoke to both Will Sentence (former CEO and co-founder) and Alina Vasile (the current CEO). When I asked them how much revenue has declined at Codesmith since their peak, they both told me about 80%.</p>



<p>Then I asked how much of that was due to everything on Reddit. They said about half of the decline, so a 40% drop came from the negative PR on Reddit. And the other 40% is from a slowdown in the bootcamp market.</p>



<p>Will told me that Codesmith reached a high of $23.5M in revenue. A 40% hit from Reddit means a revenue drop of $9.4M.</p>



<p>What about the emotional toll?</p>



<p>I asked Will Sentance how it all impacted him “It made me doubt how I can start anything after. Michael Novati is still going at it by commenting on my fellowship at Oxford. And Reddit is so visible in Google – at a meeting last week in the UK, the person used ChatGPT to look up Codesmith and it referenced all those Reddit posts. I have genuine caution about launching new stuff.”</p>



<p>Even after leaving Codesmith, the Reddit harassment still impacts Will.</p>



<p>Students also feel deeply uncomfortable with Michael’s actions.</p>



<p>I spoke with a former employee from Codesmith who told me “I was a teacher at Codesmith and the primary reason for moving away from teaching was MIchael Novati. I signed up to help a team of great people help people achieve their goals like I did, I didn’t sign up to be targeted and attacked by a Reddit troll. It took a toll on my mental health and I decided to step back to focus on my day job at Microsoft.”</p>



<p>Here’s another instance of a student calling Michael out on LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="752" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-752x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-752x1024.png 752w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-220x300.png 220w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-768x1046.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted.png 1088w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px"></a></figure>



<p>And another student that reached out to Will Sentence:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="2560" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png 604w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-71x300.png 71w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-483x2048.png 483w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a></figure>



<p>My sources also told me:</p>



<ul>
<li>An executive was threatened after moving to another company, accusations were going to be raised over IP conflicts. These accusations appear meritless and ridiculous to me.</li>



<li>The morale at Codesmith has sharply declined.</li>



<li>Some employees have had mental health difficulties, some left Codesmith.</li>



<li>One contractor ended their working relationship with Codesmith because of a fear of being dragged into all this.</li>



<li>An employee was doxxed after posting in the /r/codingbootcamp subreddit.</li>



<li>Prospective students have pulled applications.</li>



<li>Students that had amazing outcomes are afraid to post about their experiences.</li>



<li>After graduating, some students began questioning their own experience and considered going back to their old careers.</li>
</ul>



<p>As much as I wanted to detail these stories, I had a lot of requests from sources to remain anonymous. Even when folks went through some heinous shit from all this, they specifically requested not to be included.</p>



<p>It is difficult to understate the impact that Michael’s actions have had on Codesmith.</p>



<h2>Is Michael Novati Breaking the Moderator Code of Conduct on Reddit?</h2>



<p>I think so. But it’s not my call.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct">Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct</a> says this:</p>

<p>So what counts as compensation?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="784" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-300x230.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-768x588.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png 1364w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Basically, Reddit Moderators can’t receive compensation for doing basic moderator tasks. Good rule, the point is to prevent companies and third-parties from paying Reddit mods off.</p>



<p>Now here’s the tricky part.</p>



<p>What if that Reddit Moderator is a co-founder of a competitor? What if they spend YEARS shit talking you and destroying your reputation? What if they’re not technically receiving new stock but the value in their startup equity goes up after they destroy you on Reddit? Doesn’t that count as financial compensation and a violation of Reddit’s own rule to “Moderate with Integrity”?</p>



<p>I believe it does.</p>



<p>And I believe that’s why Michael is doing what he’s doing. He wins when Codesmith loses.</p>



<p>Shit like this is why Reddit has become extremely untrustworthy.</p>



<h2>What Drives the Crazy Student Outcomes at Codesmith</h2>



<p>If you dig around, you will find stories from Codesmith students and placement data that seem <em>too</em> good to be true. Is Codesmith actually that good?</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, it’s all real.</p>



<p>So how has Codesmith managed it? I found two forces that have driven these outcomes.</p>



<h3>1. Codesmith Has an Intense Application Process</h3>



<p>Not just anyone can join Codesmith. They screen folks OUT of their program. If you’re a line cook, kinda think a software engineer job sounds fun, have never spent even 5 minutes figuring out what that looks like, and apply, you won’t get in.</p>



<p>Codesmith only accepts folks that they think have a good chance of succeeding.</p>



<p>They filter the front of their student pipeline which keeps the outcome rates really high on the backend. That’s how they get their placement numbers as high as they are. That’s the “trick” to juicing the student outcomes.</p>



<p>Now, if you have some software engineering experience, you’ll likely find the application to be absurdly easy. That’s the point.</p>



<p>To me, Codesmith isn’t a true zero to one program. The students that thrive have already put a lot of self-study hours into their career transition. They’re motivated, have learned the basics, and are ready to dial up the intensity. These are folks that are also likely to succeed during the job application process after they graduate.</p>



<p>This is also one of the easiest ways to spot the shitty bootcamps. If they take anyone and everyone, that’s an enormous red flag. Stay away.</p>



<h3>2. The Hiring Market Was Extremely Strong from 2019-2022</h3>



<p>I spoke to one student that went through Codesmith in 2020, they reported that every single one of the folks in their cohort landed a software engineering job within about 6 months. That’s nuts.</p>



<p>Another graduate from the 2019 era told me that 80-90% of the students from their cohort, the cohort before, and the cohort after, landed software engineering jobs within a few months of graduating.</p>



<p>How were the placements that high? I believe the Codesmith program had something to do with it. But that was also a period where the tech market was exceptionally hot. Across all levels and functions, it was much easier to switch jobs, get promotions, and change careers in tech. I saw that myself.</p>



<p>I’ve also personally seen things tighten a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>How do Codesmiths placement rates look now?</p>



<p>Even if we look at more recent cohorts, the placements are still pretty damn strong for the full-time program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="998" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png 998w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-292x300.png 292w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-768x788.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png 1384w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px"></a></figure>



<p>That’s <a href="https://www.cirr.org/schooldata">one of the reports issued by CIRR on Codesmith</a>. It’s the full report so I’m not cherry picking.</p>



<p>Even during 2023-2024, a pretty shitty period to try to start a career as a software engineer, 70% of folks are still landing in-field jobs within a year of graduating Codesmith. With a median salary of $110,000. Even if you only count full-time employment, it’s still 62%.  I personally think that’s remarkable.</p>



<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z0FzVPHJ5qJLZ2T4Q_1EHaKo64TJpxm/view">The part-time program is only slightly worse at 60%</a>.</p>



<p>Again, this is during a hiring market when entry-level software engineering jobs are brutally hard to get. And the placement rates are still in the 60-70% range.</p>



<p>I’m also hearing that students have to work a lot harder now to land that job. And it can take a solid year. That’s that state of tech hiring at the moment.</p>



<p>So if you see old placement data of 80-100%, that was when the market was hot. Now it’s come back down to earth which is to be expected.</p>



<h2>The Future of Codesmith</h2>



<p>To me the future of Codesmith looks quite bright. Alina (the CEO) is very much in control, the team is excited about the future, and the student outcomes still look impressive to me. I’ve been told that there are no plans at Codesmith to shut down.</p>



<p>Especially with all the changes to software development from AI, there’s a lot of training that everyone is going to have to go through in tech. Good time to be in the education space.</p>



<p>If Michael could take his boot off Codesmith’s throat for just half a minute, they’d do a lot of good for a lot people.</p>



<h2>My Recommendations for Anyone Considering Joining a Developer Bootcamp</h2>



<p>I cannot tell you which bootcamp to attend. Or whether a bootcamp is worth it at all.</p>



<p>I’ve hired well over a hundred folks in my career, interviewed countless others. Including engineers and data scientists.</p>



<p>At no point did I ever place any value in a bootcamp. I also never considered it a detractor. It’s neutral to me, never really signaling anything. Neither good nor bad.</p>



<p>If you think it’ll get you your first job (which is all that really matters), and the price/time makes sense for you, go for it. But there are plenty of other paths. It’s not required by any means. I know plenty of self-taught devs that have worked at prestigious startups and big tech.</p>



<p>As for which bootcamp, that’s also up to you.</p>



<p>What I can say is this.</p>



<p>As I’ve gone through Michael Novati’s Reddit account, I’ve been appalled. I’ve never seen anything like this in my entire career. And I’ve played in some fucked up corners of the internet. That last thing I’d EVER want is to have my name or career associated with anything that Michael Novati has touched. That includes his startup, Formation.</p>



<p>You’ll have to make your own choice. But I know what mine would be.</p>



<p>At the very least, when doing research on bootcamps, I would consider anything on r/codingbootcamp/ to be completely contaminated. Whatever the real truth is, that subreddit is Michael’s personal fiefdom. He can do and say whatever he wants. And he has one helluva conflict of interest: he’s a co-founder and CTO of a leading bootcamp (even if he tries to claim that he doesn’t run a bootcamp).</p>



<p>If I was looking for unbiased reviews, I’d only factor in content from a community that Michael (or any other bootcamp founder) did not control. Make sure you know who your subreddit Mods are.</p>



<h2>Every Company is Now Vulnerable to These Types of Reputation Attacks</h2>



<p>For me, the craziest part of this story is that it’s not an edge case.</p>



<p>Anyone can use this exact same method to tear down their competitors.</p>



<p>You only need to complete one step: become a Reddit mod in one of the main subreddits for your industry. If you do that and the original mods of the subreddit don’t care what you do, you can completely fuck up your whole industry. Sow lies, fear, and misery at will.</p>



<p>Which means <em>anyone can do this to you</em>.</p>



<p>Reddit has become THE reputation attack vector.</p>



<p>And since Reddit is considered the default source of all human knowledge now, Reddit threads pop to the top of Google. Anyone searching for your brand will stumble into this madness. LLMs also prioritize Reddit so that narrative gets corrupted too. Getting control of one channel allows you to corrupt three major channels all at once. Most people don’t check receipts, they don’t dig for truth, they accept what’s put in front of them.</p>



<p>Reddit mods now control our search information ecosystem. Unpaid, corruptible Reddit mods.</p>



<p>I know there are good Reddit mods out there. But all it takes is one to fuck up your own business.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>Claim: The judge was “his judge” and should have ruled differently.</h3>
      <p>Reality: Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — issued the original orders blocking deployment. Today, a Ninth Circuit panel partially stayed her ruling so that Oregon’s Guard can stay federalized, but it <b>did not</b> permit deployment to Portland.</p>
      
    </article>

    <!-- Claim 3 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: Title 10 allows federal troop deployment here as used.</h3>
      <p>Reality: The Ninth Circuit’s stay lifts only the block on federalizing Oregon’s Guard, **not** on deploying any Guard units to Portland. The broader restraining order barring deployments from any state remains in force.</p>

    <!-- Claim 4 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: California Guard can still be sent into Portland.</h3>

<p>We know. Our Twitter got owned. We knew within moments of it happening. We know exactly how it happened. Nothing was at risk other than our Twitter account (and one Fly.io employee’s self-esteem).  Also: for fuck’s sake.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: Kurt Mackey, our intrepid CEO, got phished.</p>
<p>Had this been an impactful attack, we would not be this flippant about it. For this, though, any other tone on our part would be false.</p><h2 id="how-they-got-kurt"><a href="#how-they-got-kurt" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>How They Got Kurt</span></h2>
<p>Two reasons: one, it was a pretty good phishing attack, and two, Twitter fell outside the “things we take seriously” boundary.</p>

<p>The phishing attack was effective because it exploited a deep psychological vulnerability in our management team: we are old and out of touch with the youths of today.</p>

<p>For many months now, we’ve had an contractor/intern-type-person Boosting Our Brand on Twitter by posting dank developer memes (I think that’s what they’re called). The thing about this dankery is that we don’t really understand it. I mean, hold on, we know what the memes mean technically. We just don’t get why they’re funny.</p>

<p>However, in pushing back on them, we’re up against two powerful forces:</p>

<ol>
<li>The dank memes appear to perform better than the stuff we ourselves write on Twitter.
</li><li>We are reliably informed by our zoomer children that we are too cringe to be trusted on these matters.
</li></ol>

<p>Here’s the phish Kurt got:</p>

<p><img alt="A pretty-plausible Twitter alert" src="https://fly.io/blog/kurt-got-got/assets/phish.png?2/3&amp;center"></p>

<p>Diabolical. Like a scalpel expertly wielded against Kurt’s deepest <a href="https://theonion.com/cool-dad-raising-daughter-on-media-that-will-put-her-en-1819572981/" title="">middle-aged-dude</a> insecurity. Our ruthless attackers clinically designed this email to trigger an autonomic Kurt response: “oh, what the fuck is this, and why did we post it?”</p>
<p>ATO is cool-kid for “got owned”</p>
<p>I’m getting a little ahead of the story here. We knew our X.com account had suffered an ATO because a bunch of us simultaneously got another email saying that the <a href="https://twitter.com/flydotio" title="">@flydotio</a> account’s email address now pointed to <code>achilles19969@gmail.com</code>. Our immediate response was to audit all accesses to the login information in <a href="https://1password.com/" title="">1Password</a>, to cut all access for anybody who’d recently pulled it; your worst-case assumption in a situation like this is that someone’s endpoint has been owned up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, nobody lost access for very long. I called Kurt to let him know why he was being locked out, and 5 seconds later, he’d <a href="https://archive.is/6rVqf" title="">realized what had happened.</a> <strong>Don’t click anything there.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-it-worked"><a href="#why-it-worked" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Why It Worked</span></h2>
<p>That’s the right question to ask, isn’t it? How could this have been possible in the first place?</p>

<p>Contrary to one popular opinion, you don’t defeat phishing by training people not to click on things. I mean, tell them not to, sure! But eventually, under continued pressure, everybody clicks. <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/papers/oakland2025_phishing-training.pdf" title="">There’s science on this</a>. The cool kids haven’t done phishing simulation training in years.</p>

<p>What you’re supposed to do instead is use phishing-resistant authentication. This is almost the whole backstory for <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/tourofwebauthn/tourofwebauthn.html" title="">U2F,  FIDO2</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195" title="">Passkeys</a>.</p>

<p>Phishing-resistant authentication works by mutual authentication (or, if you’re a stickler, by origin- and channel-binding). Phishes are malicious proxies for credentials. Modern MFA schemes like FIDO2 break that proxy flow; your browser won’t send real credentials to the fake site.</p>
<p>there’s more to it than this, but, broad strokes.</p>
<p>This is, in fact, how all of our infrastructure is secured at Fly.io; specifically, we get <a href="https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/#what-soc2-made-us-do" title="">everything behind an IdP</a> (in our case: Google’s) and have it require phishing-proof MFA. You’re unlikely to phish your way to viewing logs here, or to refunding a customer bill at Stripe, or to viewing infra metrics, because all these things require an SSO login through Google.</p>

<p>Twitter, on the other hand. Yeah, so, about that. You may have heard that, a few years back, there were some goings-on involving Twitter. Many of us at Fly.io <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@flydotio" title="">decamped for Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:j7herf6n4xiig2yg7fqdmkci" title="">later to Bluesky.</a> There was a window of time in 2023-2024 where it looked as if Twitter might not be a long term thing for us at all.</p>
<p>† (to whom I sincerely apologize for having assumed they had been owned up and were the proximate cause of the hack)</p>
<p>As a result, Twitter had been a sort of legacy shared account for us, with credentials managed in 1Password and shared with our zoomer contractor†.</p>

<p>Which is why Kurt was in a position to pull credentials from 1Password and log in to members-x.com in response to an email from alerts-x.com.</p>
<p>Still: we could have dodged this attack with hygiene: Kurt complains that “x.com” is an extremely phishable domain, and, sure, but also: the 1Password browser plugin would have noticed that “members-x.com” wasn’t an “x.com” host.</p><h2 id="what-took-so-long"><a href="#what-took-so-long" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Took So Long</span></h2>
<p>The attacker immediately revoked all tokens and set up new 2FA, so while we were quickly able to reset our password, we couldn’t lock them out of our account without an intervention from X.com, which took something like 1 5 hours to set up.</p>

<p>(That’s not a knock on X.com; 15 hours for a 2FA reset isn’t outside industry norms).</p>

<p>We’re obviously making a lot of noise about this now, but we were pretty quiet during the incident itself (beyond just “We know. We knew 45 seconds after it happened. We know exactly how it happened. It’s just a Twitter thing.”)</p>

<p>That’s because, in the grand scheme of things, the attack was pretty chill: <a href="https://archive.is/PTO2M" title="">a not-very-plausible crypto scam</a> that presumably generated $0 for the attackers, 15+ hours of <code>brand damage</code>, and extra security engineering cycles burnt on watchful waiting. Our users weren’t under attack, and the account wasn’t being used to further intercept customer accounts. At one point, the attackers apparently deleted our whole Twitter history, which, like, don’t threaten us with a good time. So we let it roll, until we got our account recovered the next morning.</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story-is"><a href="#the-moral-of-the-story-is" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>The Moral Of The Story Is</span></h2><p>“Really the biggest takeaway for me is that Kurt reads his email.”</p>
<p>Obviously Kurt loses his commit access. The time comes in the life of every CEO, and now it comes for him. </p>

<p>Also, we’ll finally have a population sample for “incident response” in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/" title="">our next SOC2</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ll post more on Twitter. Or maybe we’ll double down on Zoomer memes. I don’t know. Social media is really weird right now. Either way: our Twitter access is Passkeys now.</p>
<p>seriously don’t click anything on that page</p>
<p>If you were inclined to take us up on an “airdrop” to “claim a share” of the “token” powering Fly.io, the site is <a href="https://archive.is/PTO2M" title="">still up</a>. You can connect your wallet it it! You’ll lose all your money. But if we’d actually done an ICO, you’d have lost all your money anyways.</p>

<p>Somebody involved in pulling this attack off had to come up with “own a piece of the sky!”, and I think that’s punishment enough for them.</p>

<p>Whatever you’re operating that isn’t behind phishing-resistant MFA, or, better yet, an SSO IdP that requires phishing-resistant MFA: that thing is eventually going to get phished. Dance around the clown-fire of our misfortune if you must, but let us be a lesson to you as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>In the last two weeks I spent over a dozen hours playing poker, primarily online at <a href="https://www.pokerstarsmi.com/poker/?ref=blog.rchase.com" rel="noreferrer">pokerstarsmi.com</a>, and live at a <a href="https://www.soaringeaglecasino.com/casino/poker.html?ref=blog.rchase.com" rel="noreferrer">local casino</a>. </p><p>You can view the last 1,000 hands I played here: <a href="https://poker.rchase.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">https://poker.rchase.com</a></p><p>I spent at least as much time reviewing my hands with a desktop app called <a href="https://www.pokertracker.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">PokerTracker 4</a>, I read 6 books, studied strategy, and journaled about it in my Apple Notes.</p><p>Then I started building my own <a href="https://github.com/reillychase/pokerstars-api?ref=blog.rchase.com">Python script automations</a> to export my hand history from PokerStars, import it into PokerTracker 4, check my balance, stuff like that.</p><p>That led me to getting help writing code from <a href="https://grok.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">Grok</a>, then <a href="https://cursor.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">Cursor</a>, and then building <a href="https://poker.rchase.com/?ref=blog.rchase.com">a full blown Laravel MVP for a web app similar to the PokerTracker 4 desktop app</a>.</p><h3 id="why-poker">Why poker?</h3><p>Without getting too philosophical, it's not about the money won or lost - I'm playing low stakes right now because I'm a beginner.</p><p>I just want to learn the game.</p><p>Maybe someday I'll play some tournaments or high stakes.</p><p>But right now, more importantly, I'm learning about myself.</p><ul><li><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> becoming aware of emotions in myself and others</li><li><strong>Self-regulation</strong> trying to control my emotions and not let them influence my actions</li><li><strong>Resilience</strong> not giving up because of downswings</li><li><strong>Humility </strong>learning to not get overconfident after a big win</li></ul><p>I also have enjoyed the lessons from the bankroll side of the game: </p><ul><li>Managing risk, taking profits, cutting losses</li><li>Developing the discipline to scale down my buy-ins when losing to keep a max of 10% of bankroll in play so I don't blow my entire bankroll on a bad day</li></ul><p>Whether I won or lost money in a given day isn't important, what's important is whether I followed my plan or not.</p><p>If I let emotions guide my actions, or I maintained self-control.</p><p>Success is if I made good decisions given the information I had at the time, even if it didn't lead to a good outcome.</p><p>The analogies to life and business lessons are endless... but in this blog post I mainly wanted to write about my experience building this web app with AI which was completely mind blowing!</p><h3

I tell it - hey there's a 500 error. It checks the logs, finds the bug, fixes the bug, ships the new code, I refresh the page and it's working... but it's not the color I wanted or whatever and I tell it to fix that and it goes and does it. On and on this goes for hours into the night.</p><p>With humans, normally I outline something I want built whether it's a feature or a new page for the website or a entire new app. Then the developer and I will kind of go back and forth over the details of the MVP version of it and what we should cut out considering the time/value trade off.</p><p>Then the developer will build it, but not the entire thing. We want to set milestones. That way I can see it as it gets built and give feedback which leads to many iterations, usually days or weeks apart, of each milestone until completion.</p><p>I learned how to build software like this the hard way...</p><p>By wasting a ton of time and money because I used to:</p><ul><li>Not work directly with the end developers</li><li>Not clearly communicate what I needed</li><li>Not consider time/value tradeoffs to cut the project or feature down to MVP</li><li>Wait until the entire project was completed before giving feedback and iterating</li></ul><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">- The feedback loop was too slow, I needed to work directly with the developer through complicated issues but we didn't have access to each other and had to communicate through a PM most of the time</p>— Reilly Chase (@_rchase_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_rchase_/status/1448502093518712835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.rchase.com">October 14, 2021</a></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you search online, you’ll find countless benchmarks claiming to compare the
performance of various JavaScript frameworks with each other. More often than
not, the benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to reflect real-world
scenarios. In other cases, they compare apples and oranges, for instance by
pitting a fully fledged framework against a lightweight library that cover only
a small subset of the framework’s functionality.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m at that point in my career again where I am starting development
on a new web application and need to choose the “right” JavaScript framework.
This time, I decided to look for academic studies on the performance of
JavaScript frameworks and sadly, didn’t find as many as I had hoped. I did come
across one particular study that compares Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor
with each other. Its main drawback is that the comparison was done in 2021 – a
lifetime ago in tech terms – but I think it’s still worth reading.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the summary, I want to share something I found mildly amusing.
The paper is published in the Journal of Web Engineering, and if you visit its
website, you’ll notice it includes <code>/index.php/</code> in the URL. I’m not sure why.
Is it a deliberate choice? Or is it a sign of questionable web engineering?</p>

<p>It is estimated that up to 97% of websites today use JavaScript, with more than
80% also relying on a library or framework. JavaScript is often used to manage
UI state changes within single page applications, allowing users to interact
without reloading the entire page. While this can be done manually via the DOM
API, it’s often error prone.</p>
<div><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p><span><a href="#theory" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>Modern web frameworks wrap the DOM API and provide a custom declarative syntax.
This means that application code can simply describe the desired UI state, and
the framework automatically generates the necessary DOM API calls to reflect
that state in the browser.</p>
<p>When using the DOM API directly, the amount of script execution required to
update the UI scales linearly with the complexity of the change. However, when
DOM API calls are generated dynamically by a framework, the framework must first
determine exactly which updates are necessary, introducing additional overhead.
Furthermore, the chosen rendering strategy can greatly affect the number of DOM
API calls made. A bad strategy may result in noticeable delays even for small
updates, which is why it makes sense to compare the strategies used by major
JavaScript frameworks.</p>
<div><h3 id="javascript-versus-webassembly">JavaScript versus WebAssembly</h3><p><span><a href="#javascript-versus-webassembly" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>The study looks at five popular frameworks: Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, and
Blazor. All are JavaScript-based except for Blazor, which uses WebAssembly.
Blazor applications are written in C# and run in a .NET runtime compiled to
WebAssembly. Because WebAssembly modules lack direct access to the DOM, they
rely on an additional JavaScript interoperability layer, which can introduce
extra overhead.</p>

<p>All five frameworks follow some variant of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
pattern. In MVVM, developers define components that bind an application’s data
sources to views, so that changes in the data are automatically reflected in the
UI.</p>
<p>Each framework continuously tries to keep the state of the DOM tree synchronised
with the state of the component tree defined in application code. This is done
using two distinct methods.</p>
<p>The first method, known as virtual DOM (vDOM)-based rendering, is used in React,
Vue, and Blazor. It works by comparing the two trees and calculating the minimum
set of changes needed to transform one into the other. This generally has a time
complexity of <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n^3)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but can often be simplified to <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> by making
assumptions that usually apply in browser applications.</p>
<p>The second method is used by Angular and Svelte. Here, there is no separate step
for calculating all required changes to the DOM. Instead, each component
directly updates its corresponding section of the DOM by tracking the values of
its data bindings.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, using a virtual DOM can introduce overhead not
present in a binding-based rendering strategy.</p>
<div><h3 id="creating-versus-updating">Creating versus updating</h3><p><span><a href="#creating-versus-updating" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>All of the reviewed frameworks perform DOM updates within a render loop that
walks through the component tree. The cost of this render loop depends on the
size of the input and fixed costs.</p>
<p>A render loop involves two types of work: creating new elements and updating
existing ones. Creating elements is generally straightforward and costs the same
for each framework, regardless of rendering strategy.</p>
<p>Updating existing elements is where the rendering strategy makes a noticeable
difference. Angular, for example, always walks through the entire component tree,
resulting in a lot of unnecessary work when only a small part of the tree needs
updating. React and Blazor walk only through the subtree of the component that
initiates the render loop, which is usually more efficient but may still require
some unnecessary work for descendants whose output has not changed. Vue and
Svelte, on the other hand, process only “dirty” components whose output has
changed. This requires the framework to track which components are dirty. Vue
does this at runtime, Svelte handles it at compile time.</p>
<p>Finally, component output can be classified as either static or dynamic content,
with static content remaining unchanged after the component’s initial render.
Frameworks that can optimise for static content may have a performance advantage
over those that cannot.</p>

<p>Several benchmarks were conducted using Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor.
The authors found significant differences in performance between the frameworks,
especially as input size increased.
<label><span>Svelte emerges as the clear winner</span><span> (side note: </span><span>For the record, I have never used
Svelte myself, but based on these results I might just finally give it a
try.</span><span>)</span></label>, outperforming the others across literally every benchmark.</p>

<p>Overall, the results are in line with what would be expected given the
characteristics of each rendering strategy.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly-based Blazor shows significantly worse performance than its
JavaScript-based competitors. However, from these benchmarks alone it’s
impossible to determine whether this is due to Blazor itself or a fundamental
limitation of using WebAssembly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Svelte demonstrates three key characteristics that likely contribute
most to improved performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of a reactivity system to automatically detect dirty components</li>

<h2 id="new_--trim_feature"><a href="#new_--trim_feature">New <code>--trim</code> feature</a></h2>
<p><em>Jeff Bezanson</em>, <em>Cody Tapscott</em>, <em>Gabriel Baraldi</em></p>
<p><code>julia</code> now has a new experimental<code>--trim</code> feature, when compiling a system image with this mode julia will trim statically unreachable code leading to significantly better compile times and binary sizes. To use it you also need to pass the <code>--experimental</code> flag when building the system image. </p>
<p>In order to use it, any code that is reachable from the entrypoints must not have any dynamic dispatches otherwise the trimming will be unsafe and it will error during compilation.</p>
<p>The expected way of using it is via the <code>JuliaC.jl</code> package, which provides a CLI and a programmatic API. </p>
<p>For example a simple package with an <code>@main</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span> AppProject

<span>function</span> <span>@main</span>(<span>ARGS</span>)
    println(Core.<span>stdout</span>, <span>"Hello World!"</span>)
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>juliac --output-exe app_test_exe --bundle build --trim=safe --experimental ./AppProject</code></pre>
<pre><code>./build/bin/app_test_exe
Hello World!

<span>ls</span> -lh build/bin/app_test_exe
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 gabrielbaraldi  staff   1.1M Oct  6 17:22 ./build/bin/app_test_exe*</code></pre>
<h2 id="redefinition_of_constants_structs"><a href="#redefinition_of_constants_structs">Redefinition of constants (structs)</a></h2>
<p><em>Keno Fischer</em>, <em>Tim Holy</em></p>
<p>Bindings now participate in the "world age" mechanism previously used for methods. This has the effect that constants and structs can be properly redefined. As an example:</p>
<pre><code><span># Define a struct and a method on that struct:</span>
julia&gt; <span>struct</span> Foo
          a::<span>Int</span>
       <span>end</span>

julia&gt; g(f::Foo) = f.a^<span>2</span>
g (generic <span>function</span> with <span>1</span> method)

julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>2</span>))
<span>4</span>

<span># Redefine the struct (julia pre-1.12 would error here)</span>
julia&gt; <span>struct</span> Foo
          a::<span>Int</span>
          b::<span>Int</span>
       <span>end</span>

<span># Note that functions need to be redefined to work on the new `Foo`</span>
julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>))
ERROR: <span>MethodError</span>: no method matching g(::Foo)
The <span>function</span> <span>`g`</span> exists, but no method is defined <span>for</span> this combination of argument types.

Closest candidates are:
  g(::<span>@world</span>(Foo, <span>39296</span>:<span>39300</span>)) <span># &lt;- This is syntax for accessing the binding in an older "world"</span>
   @ Main REPL[<span>2</span>]:<span>1</span>

julia&gt; g(f::Foo) = f.a^<span>2</span> + f.b^<span>2</span>
g (generic <span>function</span> with <span>2</span> methods)

julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>))
<span>13</span></code></pre>
<p>There is also work in progress in Revise.jl to automatically redefine functions on replaced bindings. This should significantly reduce the number of times you have to restart Julia while iterating on some piece of code.</p>
<h2 id="new_tracing_flags_and_macros_for_inspecting_what_julia_compiles"><a href="#new_tracing_flags_and_macros_for_inspecting_what_julia_compiles">New tracing flags and macros for inspecting what Julia compiles</a></h2>
<p><em>Ian Butterworth</em>, <em>Nathan Daly</em></p>
<p><code>--trace-compile-timing</code> is a new command-line flag that augments <code>--trace-compile</code> by printing how long each compiled method took (in milliseconds) before the corresponding <code>precompile(...)</code> line. This makes it easier to spot costly compilations.</p>
<p>In addition, two macros for ad-hoc tracing without restarting Julia have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>@trace_compile expr</code> runs <code>expr</code> with <code>--trace-compile=stderr --trace-compile-timing</code> enabled, emitting timed <code>precompile(...)</code> entries only for that call.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>@trace_dispatch expr</code> runs <code>expr</code> with <code>--trace-dispatch=stderr</code> enabled, reporting methods that are dynamically dispatched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; <span>@trace_compile</span> <span>@eval</span> rand(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>) * rand(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>)

<h2 id="new_multi-threading_features"><a href="#new_multi-threading_features">New multi-threading features</a></h2>
<h3 id="one_interactive_thread_by_default"><a href="#one_interactive_thread_by_default">One interactive thread by default</a></h3>
<p><em>Gabriel Baraldi</em>, <em>Ian Butterworth</em></p>
<p>Julia now starts with one interactive thread by default (in addition to the default thread). This means that by default Julia runs with the threading configuration of 1 default thread, 1 interactive thread.</p>
<p>The interactive thread pool is where the REPL and other interactive operations run. By separating these from the default thread pool (where <code>@spawn</code> and <code>@threads</code> schedule work when no threadpool is specified), the REPL can perform operations like autocomplete queries in parallel with user code execution, leading to a more responsive interactive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Key behaviors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Default</strong>: Julia starts with <code>-t1,1</code> (1 default + 1 interactive thread)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit <code>-t1</code></strong>: If you explicitly request 1 thread with <code>-t1</code>, Julia will give you exactly that—no additional interactive thread will be added (resulting in <code>-t1,0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple threads</strong>: <code>-t2</code> or <code>-tauto</code> will give you the requested default threads plus 1 interactive thread</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manual control</strong>: You can always specify both pools explicitly, e.g., <code>-t4,2</code> for 4 default and 2 interactive threads</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This change improves the out-of-the-box experience while maintaining backwards compatibility for users who explicitly request single-threaded execution.</p>
<h3 id="threads_settings_respect_cpu_affinity"><a href="#threads_settings_respect_cpu_affinity">Threads settings respect CPU affinity</a></h3>
<p><em>Mosè Giordano</em></p>
<p>Julia now respects CPU affinity settings, such as those set via <code>cpuset</code>/<code>taskset</code>/<code>cgroups</code>, etc. The same also applies to the default number of BLAS threads, which now follows the same logic. This can also be observed when running Julia inside Docker. Currently, you have</p>
<pre><code><span>$ </span><span>docker run --cpus=4 --<span>rm</span> -ti julia:1.11 julia --threads=auto -e <span>'@show Threads.nthreads(); using LinearAlgebra; @show BLAS.get_num_threads()'</span></span>
Threads.nthreads() = 22
BLAS.get_num_threads() = 11</code></pre>
<p>When starting Julia with <code>--threads=auto</code>, <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/#Base.Threads.nthreads"><code>Threads.nthreads()</code></a> is equal to the total number of CPUs on the system instead of the only 4 CPUs reserved by Docker. Likewise, the number of BLAS threads, which can be obtained with <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.BLAS.get_num_threads"><code>BLAS.get_num_threads()</code></a> and on x86-64 systems is by default half the number of available cores, is 11 instead of 2. With Julia v1.12 this is fixed, and the number of both Julia and BLAS threads will respect the number of CPUs reserved by Docker:</p>
<pre><code><span>% </span><span>docker run --cpus=4 --<span>rm</span> -ti julia:1.12 julia --threads=auto -e <span>'@show Threads.nthreads(); using LinearAlgebra; @show BLAS.get_num_threads()'</span></span>
Threads.nthreads() = 4
BLAS.get_num_threads() = 2</code></pre>
<p>The new behavior is also important to avoid oversubscription out-of-the-box when running Julia on HPC systems where schedulers set CPU affinity when using shared resources.</p>
<h3 id="onceperx"><a href="#onceperx"><code>OncePerX</code></a></h3>
<p><em>Jameson Nash</em></p>
<p>Certain initialization patterns need to run only once, depending on scope: per process, per thread, or per task. To make this easier and safer, Julia now provides three built-in types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OncePerProcess{T}</code>: runs an initializer exactly once per process, returning the same value for all future calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerThread{T}</code>: runs an initializer once for each thread ID. Subsequent calls on the same thread return the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerTask{T}</code>: runs an initializer once per task, reusing the same value within that task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These replace common hand-rolled solutions such as using <code>__init__</code>, <code>nthreads()</code>, or <code>task_local_storage()</code> directly.</p>
<p>A simple example of <code>OncePerProcess</code>:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; <span>const</span> global_state = Base.OncePerProcess{<span>Vector</span>{<span>UInt32</span>}}() <span>do</span>
           println(<span>"Making lazy global value...done."</span>)
           <span>return</span> [Libc.rand()]
       <span>end</span>;

julia&gt; a = global_state();
Making lazy <span>global</span> value...done.

julia&gt; a === global_state()
<span>true</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OncePerProcess</code>: caches, global constants, or initialization that should happen once per Julia process (even across precompilation).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerThread</code>: per-thread state needed for interoperability with C libraries or specialized threading models.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerTask</code>: lightweight task-local state without manually managing <code>task_local_storage</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These types provide a safer, composable way to express “initialize once” semantics in concurrent Julia code.</p>

<p><em>Zentrik</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt">BOLT</a> is a post-link optimizer from LLVM that improves runtime performance by reordering functions and basic blocks, splitting hot and cold code, and folding identical functions. Julia now supports building BOLT-optimized versions of <strong>libLLVM</strong>, <strong>libjulia-internal</strong>, and <strong>libjulia-codegen</strong>.</p>
<p>These optimizations reduce compilation and execution time in common workloads. For example, the all-inference benchmarks improve by about <strong>10%</strong>, an LLVM-heavy workload shows a similar <strong>~10%</strong> gain, and building <code>corecompiler.ji</code> improves by <strong>13–16%</strong> with BOLT. When combined with PGO and LTO, total improvements of up to <strong>~23%</strong> have been observed.</p>
<p>To build a BOLT-optimized Julia, run the following commands from <code>contrib/bolt/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make stage1
make copy_originals
make bolt_instrument
make finish_stage1
make merge_data
make bolt</code></pre>
<p>The optimized binaries will be available in the <code>optimized.build</code> directory. An analogous workflow exists in <code>contrib/pgo-lto-bolt/</code> for combining BOLT with PGO+LTO.</p>
<p>BOLT currently works only on Linux <strong>x86_64</strong> and <strong>aarch64</strong>, and the resulting <code>.so</code> files must not be stripped. Some <code>readelf</code> warnings may appear during testing but are considered harmless.</p>
<h2 id="the_atomic_macro_family_now_supports_reference_assignment_syntax"><a href="#the_atomic_macro_family_now_supports_reference_assignment_syntax">The <code>@atomic</code> macro family now supports reference assignment syntax</a></h2>
<p><em>Marek Kaluba</em></p>
<p>The <code>@atomic</code> macro family now supports <strong>indexing</strong> (e.g. <code>m[i]</code>, <code>m[i,j]</code>) in addition to field access. This makes it possible to perform atomic fetch, set, modify, swap, compare-and-swap, and set-once directly on array-like references. The macros expand to new APIs: <code>getindex_atomic</code>, <code>setindex_atomic!</code>, <code>modifyindex_atomic!</code>, <code>swapindex_atomic!</code>, <code>replaceindex_atomic!</code>, and <code>setindexonce_atomic!</code>. Vararg and <code>CartesianIndex</code> indexing are supported.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>mem = AtomicMemory{<span>Int</span>}(<span>undef</span>, <span>2</span>)

<span>@atomic</span> mem[<span>1</span>] = <span>2</span>                 <span># atomic set</span>
x = <span>@atomic</span> mem[<span>1</span>]                 <span># atomic fetch</span>
<span>@atomic</span> :monotonic mem[<span>1</span>] += <span>1</span>     <span># atomic modify with order</span>
old = <span>@atomicswap</span> mem[<span>1</span>] = <span>4</span>       <span># atomic swap (returns old)</span>
res = <span>@atomicreplace</span> mem[<span>1</span>] <span>4</span> =&gt; <span>10</span>  <span># (old=4, success=true)</span>
ok  = <span>@atomiconce</span> mem[<span>2</span>] = <span>7</span>         <span># set once (Bool)</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="new_option_task-metricsyes_to_enable_the_collection_of_per-task_timing_information"><a href="#new_option_task-metricsyes_to_enable_the_collection_of_per-task_timing_information">New option –task-metrics=yes to enable the collection of per-task timing information</a></h2>
<p>Two new per-task metrics can be enabled by starting Julia with <code>--task-metrics=yes</code> or by calling <code>Base.Experimental.task_metrics(true)</code>. Enabling or disabling task metrics with <code>Base.Experimental.task_metrics</code> only affects new tasks, not existing ones. The metrics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Base.Experimental.task_running_time_ns(t::Task)</code>: the time for which <code>t</code> was actually running. This is currently inclusive of GC time, compilation time, and any spin time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Base.Experimental.task_wall_time_ns(t::Task)</code>: the time from the scheduler becoming aware of <code>t</code> until <code>t</code> is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new_pkg_features"><a href="#new_pkg_features">New Pkg features</a></h2>
<p><em>Kristoffer Carlsson</em></p>
<h3 id="workspace"><a href="#workspace">Workspace</a></h3>
<p>A workspace is a set of project files that all share the same manifest. Each project in a workspace can include its own dependencies, compatibility information, and even function as a full package.</p>
<p>When the package manager resolves dependencies, it considers the requirements and compatibility of all the projects in the workspace. The compatible versions identified during this process are recorded in a single manifest file.</p>
<p>A workspace is defined in the base project by giving a list of the projects in it:</p>
<pre><code><span>[workspace]</span>
<span>projects</span> = [<span>"test"</span>, <span>"docs"</span>, <span>"benchmarks"</span>, <span>"PrivatePackage"</span>]</code></pre>
<p>This structure is particularly beneficial for developers using a monorepo approach, where a large number of unregistered packages may be involved. It is also useful for adding documentation or benchmarks to a package by including additional dependencies beyond those of the package itself. Test-specific dependencies are now recommended to be specified using the workspace approach (a project file in the <code>test</code> directory that is part of the workspace defined by the package project file).</p>
<p>Workspaces can also be nested: a project that itself defines a workspace can also be part of another workspace. In this case, the workspaces are “merged,” with a single manifest being stored alongside the “root project” (the project that is not included in another workspace).</p>
<h3 id="apps"><a href="#apps">Apps</a></h3>
<p>An app is a Julia package that can be run directly from the terminal, similar to a standalone program. Each app provides an entry point via <code>@main</code> and can define its own default Julia flags and executable name.</p>
<p>When an app is installed, it gets put into <code>.julia/bin</code> and by adding that to your <code>PATH</code> it allows you to launch it by name together with any arguments or options.</p>
<p>A Julia app is defined in the <code>Project.toml</code> file using an <code>[apps]</code> section:</p>
<pre><code><span>[apps]</span>
<span>reverse</span> = {} <span># empty dictionary is for additional metadata</span></code></pre>
<p>with a corresponding entry point in the package module:</p>
<pre><code><span># src/MyReverseApp.jl</span>
<span>module</span> MyReverseApp

<span>function</span> (<span>@main</span>)(<span>ARGS</span>)
    <span>for</span> arg <span>in</span> <span>ARGS</span>
        print(<span>stdout</span>, reverse(arg), <span>" "</span>)
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span> <span># module</span></code></pre>
<p>After installation, the app can be run directly in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ reverse some input string
emos tupni gnirts</code></pre>
<p>This makes apps useful for building CLI tools or packaging Julia functionality as user-facing executables. Multiple apps can be defined per package by using submodules, and each app can specify default Julia flags (e.g. <code>--threads=4</code>) for performance or debugging.</p>
<p>See the full documentation for more information: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/apps/</p>
<h3 id="status_highlights_when_dependencies_have_different_loaded_versions"><a href="#status_highlights_when_dependencies_have_different_loaded_versions">Status highlights when dependencies have different loaded versions</a></h3>
<p><code>Pkg.status()</code> now highlights when a dependency's loaded version differs from what the current environment would load. This helps identify situations where you may be running code against an outdated or mismatched version of a package—particularly useful when switching between environments or after modifying dependencies.</p>
<p>When a package is already loaded from a different version or path than what the current environment specifies, Pkg will display a yellow <code>[loaded: vX.Y.Z]</code> indicator next to the package name:</p>
<p><img src="https://julialang.org/assets/blog/2025-1.12-highlights/pkg-status-loaded-version.png" alt="Pkg.status showing loaded version highlight"></p>
<p>This visual cue makes it easier to spot when you need to restart Julia to pick up the correct package versions, reducing debugging time and confusion in iterative development workflows.</p>
<h2 id="generated_llvm_ir_now_uses_pointer_types_instead_of_passing_pointers_as_integers"><a href="#generated_llvm_ir_now_uses_pointer_types_instead_of_passing_pointers_as_integers">Generated LLVM IR now uses pointer types instead of passing pointers as integers</a></h2>
<p><em>Tim Besard</em></p>
<p><code>Ptr{T}</code> now lowers to <strong>actual LLVM pointer types</strong> in generated IR (i.e. <code>ptr</code> with opaque pointers, or <code>i8*</code>), instead of integers like <code>i64</code>. This simplifies low-level interop: <code>llvmcall</code> no longer needs <code>ptrtoint</code>/<code>inttoptr</code> shims, and many intrinsics can be called via <code>ccall</code> using <code>Ptr</code> directly.</p>
<p><strong>What changes for you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inline LLVM (<code>llvmcall</code>)</strong>: update IR to use <code>ptr</code>/<code>i8*</code> for pointer arguments/returns, and remove redundant <code>ptrtoint</code>/<code>inttoptr</code> casts. Old IR that treats pointers as integers is still accepted but emits a <strong>deprecation warning</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pointer arithmetic</strong>: <code>add_ptr</code> / <code>sub_ptr</code> now operate on real pointers: <code>add_ptr(::Ptr{T}, ::UInt)</code> and <code>sub_ptr(::Ptr{T}, ::UInt)</code> (lowered to GEP).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>ccall</code> convenience</strong>: passing/returning <code>Ptr{T}</code> maps to LLVM pointer types directly, enabling more intrinsic calls without custom <code>llvmcall</code> glue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example (before → after)</strong></p>
<pre><code>; BEFORE (deprecated): integer pointer
define i64 <span>@f</span>(i64 %p) {
  %q = inttoptr i64 %p to i8*
  ; ...
  %r = ptrtoint i8* %q to i64
  ret i64 %r
}

; AFTER: real pointer
define ptr <span>@f</span>(ptr %p) {
  ; ...
  ret ptr %p

<h2 id="reproducing_rng_state_in_testsets"><a href="#reproducing_rng_state_in_testsets">Reproducing RNG state in testsets</a></h2>
<p><em>Mosè Giordano</em></p>
<p>Many developers may have experience with occasional failures when running tests of their packages which were observed only on remote machines, and wished to be able to reproduce the same run, for debugging purposes. The GitHub Actions workflow <a href="https://github.com/julia-actions/julia-runtest"><code>julia-actions/julia-runtest</code></a> recently started printing to the log the full options used to invoke the Julia process which runs the tests, which lets developers use the same compiler options (e.g. bounds checking, code coverage, deprecation warnings, etc.) as the CI runs. However there are occasional failures which don't depend on compiler options, but may depend on the state of the global random number generator (RNG), if for example the input data of the tests is generated with functions like <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Base.rand"><code>rand</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Base.randn"><code>randn</code></a>, without passing an explicit RNG object, instead relying on the global one. The <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/#Test.@testset"><code>Test.@testset</code></a> macro has had for a long time the feature of automatically controlling the global RNG, but until now its state was never displayed. Starting from Julia v1.12, a failure inside a <code>@testset</code> causes the RNG of the outermost test set to be printed to screen, which then you can also set in a new test set to exactly reproduce the same run.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following test which would fail with a 0.1% probability:</p>
<pre><code><span>julia&gt;</span><span> <span>using</span> Test
</span>
<span>julia&gt;</span><span> <span>@testset</span> <span>begin</span>
           <span>@test</span> rand() &gt; <span>0.001</span>
       <span>end</span>;
</span>test set: Test Failed at REPL[2]:2

								<p>The death of competition spells doom for regulation. Competition is an essential component of effective regulation, for two reasons: First, competition keeps the companies within a sector from all telling the same lie to its regulators. Second, competition erodes companies’ profits and thus starves them of the capital they need to overpower or outmaneuver their regulators.</p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p>While not all regulation is wise or helpful, a world without regulation is a catastrophe. That’s because, in a highly technological world, your ability to do well (or even to live out the day) requires that you correctly navigate innumerable highly technical questions that you can’t possibly answer.</p>
<p>You need to know whether you can trust the software in your car’s antilock braking system, whether you should heed your doctor’s advice to get vaccinated, whether the joists over your head at home are sufficient to keep the ceiling from falling in and killing you, and whether your kids’ schooling is adequate or likely to turn them into ignoramuses.</p>
<p>Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law.</p>
<p>It’s not that you lack the intellect and discernment to answer each of these questions. You’re a smart cookie. Given enough time, you could get a PhD’s worth of education in software engineering, cell biology, material science, structural engineering, and pedagogy; investigate each of the offerings before you in each of these categories; and make an intelligent choice that reflects your priorities and the trade-offs you’re willing to make.</p>
<p>The problem is that it would take you several lifetimes to acquire all that knowledge, and long before you could do so, you’d be killed by food poisoning because you guessed wrong about whether you could trust the hygiene policies at your local diner.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_1 -->
</div>
<p>It would be nice if you could let markets take care of these questions for you, but many of the consequences of wrong answers don’t manifest fast enough to steer your decision-making. Sure, if a private school turns one of your kids into an ignoramus, you can demand your money back and refuse to send your other kids to that school—but your kid is <em>still</em> an ignoramus. Likewise, you can punish a restaurant that gives you food poisoning by withholding your future custom, but if that’s a <em>lethal</em> poisoning, the fact that you don’t eat at that restaurant anymore isn’t quite the moral victory you might be hoping for.</p>
<p>To navigate all of these technical minefields, you need the help of a third party. In a modern society, that third party is an expert regulator who investigates or anticipates problems in their area of expertise and then makes rules designed to solve these problems.</p>
<p>To make these rules, the regulator convenes a truth-seeking exercise, in which all affected parties submit evidence about what the best rule should be and then get a chance to read what everyone else wrote and rebut their claims. Sometimes, there are in-person hearings, or successive rounds of comment and counter-comment, but that’s the basic shape of things.</p>
<p>Once all the evidence is in, the regulator—who is a neutral expert, required to recuse themselves if they have conflicts—makes a rule, citing the evidence on which the rule is based. This whole system is backstopped by courts, which can order the process to begin anew if the new rule isn’t supported by the evidence created while the regulator was developing the record.</p>
<p>This kind of adversarial process—something between a court case and scientific peer review—has a good track record of producing high-quality regulations. You can thank a process like this for the fact that you weren’t killed today by critters in your tap water or a high-voltage shock from one of your home’s electrical outlets.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_2 -->
</div>
<p>One key advantage of the process is that it relies on competitors to counter one another’s claims. The reinforced steel joist manufacturer that claims that only its products are suitable for use in high-rise apartment buildings will have to defend those claims against competitors who submit their own structural engineering and material science evidence. Regulators don’t need to look for holes in the arguments advanced by interested parties; they only need to assess the quality of the criticisms raised by other commenters who submit to the docket.</p>
<p>This process isn’t just a way to prevent corporate executives from cheating the public by knowingly overpromising about their own products or denigrating their rivals’; it’s also a way to stop firms that have tricked <em>themselves</em> from fooling the rest of us, too. As with the scientific method, the safeguards of peer review help us catch grubby attempts at both deception and <em>self</em>-deception, because it’s <em>very</em> easy to talk yourself into a sincere belief that you are right and everyone else is wrong.</p>
<p>This process works well on “disorganized” sectors composed of many firms that compete hard with one another. When hundreds of companies are all at one another’s throats, they suffer from a collective action problem—the same force that keeps users from leaving services like Facebook.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies find it impossible to agree on almost <em>anything</em>, including where to have a meeting in which they could discuss what line they are going to feed their regulator. They probably can’t even agree on how to cater that meeting.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies are a disorganized rabble. They can’t come to accord, and even if they could, a truly competitive sector produces smaller profits for each company (since one of the best ways to compete is by lowering prices to attract new customers and raising wages to attract the best workers). That leaves very little surplus capital with which to pursue regulatory adventures.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_3 -->
</div>
<p>But when a sector dwindles to five companies—or four, or three, or two, or just one—the collective action problem is annihilated by the inevitable coziness among the executives of the incestuous industries.</p>
<p>After all, the executives in an industry dominated by a handful of firms are apt to have worked at most or all of the companies in the sector. They know one another, came up together, and are part of one another’s social milieu.</p>
<p>Not only do concentrated industries find it easier to converge on a set of policy priorities and maintain message discipline while bargaining with their regulators, they also have a lot to bargain <em>with</em>. Concentrated sectors tend to have Mafia-style demarcations of turf. (Think of Pope Alexander VI dividing up the “New World” in 1494, of cable companies carving up the map of the United States into exclusive fiefdoms, or of Apple taking an annual $20 billion-plus payment from Google in exchange for not making its own search engine.)</p>
<p>This prevents “wasteful competition” and allows these companies to amass gigantic war chests that they can mobilize to win their policy priorities.</p>
<p>A hundred companies are a mob, a rabble. Five companies are a cartel.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_4 -->
</div>
<p>“Regulatory capture”—when a company suborns its regulator and teams up with it to screw over customers, rivals, and suppliers—starts with a regulator that is weaker than the company it is supposed to be watchdogging. The pro-monopoly policies of the past forty years have produced <em>gigantic</em> companies that find it easy to unite against their regulators, even as the deregulatory policies over the same period have starved regulators of the resources they need to fight back. The inevitable result is regulatory capture.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Regulatory capture has two faces: On the one hand, a captured industry is able to flout regulations that are meant to prevent it from harming the public, its employees and other stakeholders, and the environment. On the other hand, regulatory capture creates a <em>coalition</em> between the regulated industry and its regulators. They form a team and work together to enforce rules against other industries, startups, foreign adversaries, and so on. Regulatory capture isn’t the same as <em>underregulation</em>; rather, it is the combination of <em>underregulation</em> (for the industry that has effected the capture) and <em>overregulation</em> (against that industry’s enemies).</p>
<p>Tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.”</p>
<p>The most common tactic used to flout regulation is to break the law with an app and then insist that the law hasn’t been broken at all, because the crime was committed with an app.</p>
<p>Sometimes literally (as Uber does when it argues that it’s not an employer because it directs its workers with an app) and sometimes figuratively. Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law. (“It’s not an illegal unregulated hotel, it’s an Airbnb!”)</p>
<p>Riley Quinn, showrunner for the excellent <em>Trashfuture</em> podcast, says that whenever you hear the word <em>fintech</em> (financial technology), you should mentally substitute <em>unregulated bank</em>.</p>
<p>App-based lending platforms ignore usury law and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app. Cryptocurrency hustlers illegally trade in unregistered securities and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app.</p>
<p>When Uber entered the taxi market without securing taxi licenses or extending the workforce protections required under law, it said the move didn’t count because it did it with an app.</p>
<p>The McDonald’s-backed company Plexure sells surveillance data on you to vendors, who use it to raise the price of items when they think you’ll pay more. In its promotional materials, Plexure uses the example of charging extra for your breakfast sandwich on payday. It says that such practices are not a rip-off because they’re done with an app.</p>
<p>RealPage gives “recommendations” to landlords about the minimum rents they should charge for all the apartments in your neighborhood, raising rents and worsening the housing crisis. The company says it’s not price-fixing because it’s done with an app.</p>
<p>On the subject of the housing crisis, Airbnb is racing to convert all the rental stock in your city into an unlicensed hotel room, but it says the conversion doesn’t count because it’s done with an app.</p>
<p>The legal regime for apps really <em>is</em> different from the rules governing web pages. Thanks to intellectual property laws that ban “circumvention,” companies that embed undesirable anti-features in apps can use the law to destroy rivals that disenshittify their offerings.</p>
<p>In other words, tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.”</p>

						<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
					</div><div lang="en" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text"><p>The <b>Ortega hypothesis</b> holds that average or mediocre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientists" title="Scientists">scientists</a> contribute substantially to the advancement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hess_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hess-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>The Ortega hypothesis is widely held,<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> but a number of systematic studies of scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citations" title="Citations">citations</a> have favored the opposing "Newton hypothesis", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s statement that he "stood on the shoulders of giants").<sup id="cite_ref-Hess_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Hess-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>  Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology" title="Criminology">criminology</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Oromaner_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Oromaner-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data.<sup id="cite_ref-MacRoberts_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-MacRoberts-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics.<sup id="cite_ref-Kretschmer_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kretschmer-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoerman_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hoerman-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results.<sup id="cite_ref-Goudsmit_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Goudsmit-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-eponym_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-eponym-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results.<sup id="cite_ref-Goudsmit_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-Goudsmit-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>The name of the hypothesis refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset" title="José Ortega y Gasset">José Ortega y Gasset</a>, who wrote in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolt_of_the_Masses" title="The Revolt of the Masses">The Revolt of the Masses</a></i> that "astoundingly mediocre" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science.<sup id="cite_ref-Ortega_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ortega-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geniuses" title="Geniuses">geniuses</a> create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> drew upon the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" title="Ernst Mach">Ernst Mach</a> to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone.<sup id="cite_ref-Szava_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Szava-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The "Ortega hypothesis" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as "mechanical work of the mind" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it.<sup id="cite_ref-Szava_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-Szava-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RSS feeds and, in one form or another, feed readers, have existed for more than 20 years. Their main purpose is enabling their users to consume content from various sources in one place. And especially in recent years, also helping users deal with content overload.</p>
<p>Back then there were only a handful of relevant products. Today it's different, there are products for many different situations and use-cases. When first getting into RSS and feed readers, it can be difficult to find out which of this wide range of products are the right ones to use.</p>
<p>This article describes the landscape so you can find out which product fits best for your use-case.</p>
<p>Side-note: I'm using RSS as a synonym for all web feed standards (Atom, JSON Feed)</p>
<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>I attempted a classification of feed readers based on 2 axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment model</strong>: local (phone or PC), browser extension, self-hosted, hosted</li>
<li><strong>Business model</strong>: free, one-time payment, SAAS</li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment model is based on where data is stored and feed fetching happens. Some products have a web app and mobile apps, but feed fetching happens on the server. In this case it's classified as <code>hosted</code>.</p>
<p>The business model categorization is based on the cheapest option that gives access to the full feature set of the product. A self-hostable product with a hosted option is categorized into <code>free</code>. A freemium SAAS product is categorized as <code>paid (SAAS)</code>.</p>

<p>Feed readers deployed as browser extensions can be installed through the respective stores of the browsers, usually either the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/">Chrome Web Store</a> or the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox Add-ons</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Setup typically only requires installing the extension, not even an account is needed. There is no maintenance required beyond the occasional update, which usually happens automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Data is stored locally, with browser storage functionality (local storage or IndexedDB). How much data can be stored depends on the storage of the device. Browser extensions can only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#unlimited_storage">store</a> as much data as the browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/local">allows itself to use</a>. But for most users this is easily enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the device itself. Because the extension only runs if the browser runs, feeds are only fetched if the browser is open. This can lead to missed posts, depending on the publishing frequency of the feed and how often the browser is active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Since all data is stored on the device, by default it's available only on the device where the extension is installed. If users enable it, the extension supports it, and the user is signed in, browsers can sync data to other devices that have the extension. Storing all data on the device also means that it is accessible offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Extensions can integrate deeply with the browser, and offer features like automatic feed finding of visited websites. Extensions can also provide a comprehensive feature set. Their only limitations are more compute-intensive features (e.g. requiring machine learning), or features that require special infrastructure to run (e.g. emails).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products (free)</h4>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Free</th>
<th>Paid (one-time)</th>
<th>Paid (SAAS)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li><a href="https://nodetics.com/feedbro/">Feedbro</a></li></ul></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>In this category I only found one product. <a href="https://github.com/SmartRSS/Smart-RSS">Smart-RSS</a> was another one, but was discontinued in February.</p>
<h3>On-device</h3>
<p>On-device products are separate applications and installed on the device you want to use them. Either on your iOS or Android phone or tablet, or on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. They fetch feeds and store data on that device.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: In general setup is done by installing the application. Some products may require an account, but that is not the norm. Maintenance is similar to browser extensions, the occasional updates. Some applications require manual update installations, others do that automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Data is stored locally on the device, which gives total control over the data. The maximum amount of feeds and articles stored only depend on the available storage of the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the device. For that to happen the application must be running. Some products may implement a background fetching service, in that case only the device must be turned on. Similar to browser extensions, this limitation may lead to missed posts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Typically the data of on-device feed readers are only available on the device where it's installed. Data sync would need to be done manually or via operating system specific mechanisms (e.g. iCloud), which not all products support. Since data is stored on the device, it's also available offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: On-device products can use the full computing power of the device. Combined with the comparatively small storage requirements of one user, it means that some features can be significantly faster than other categories. The exact features depend on the application, and mobile apps are typically less powerful than desktop apps. Limitations are only features that require multiple users (e.g. recommendations) or specific infrastructure (e.g. newsletter subscriptions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<h3>Self-hosted</h3>
<p>Self-hosted products all fall into the open-source and free category. They are designed to be installed on a server to run continuously, though it is possible to install them on a PC as well. They fetch feeds and store data on the server, and make it available through a web interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Setup requires a server, installing the application, and depending on how it should be accessible, possibly also domain and reverse proxy setup. This needs significantly more technical knowledge than the other options, but with ChatGPT (or others) it should be possible also for fairly non-technical people. This setup is generally more complex with more failure points than the other options, but with a correct setup failures happen rarely, if at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: The application stores data on the server it runs on. Since users control their server, they also have total control over the data stored on it. Applications typically use well-established databases, which allows users to inspect and change data with common tools. The amount of data that can be stored is only limited by the available storage on the server. Most servers start at 20 GB, which is enough for most feed reading use-cases. Often, storage can be dynamically extended if more space is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the server. Since it runs continuously, there is no break in feed fetching, and even high frequency feeds are no problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: The application and all its data is accessible from any device with a web browser by navigating to the server's URL. Data is stored on the server, therefore automatically synced between all devices that use it, but also require internet access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: On average self-hosted products have a wider feature set than browser extension or on-device feed readers. There is no theoretical limit on the feature set, but typically they keep the infrastructure as simple as possible, to keep setup and maintenance straightforward. This makes them slightly less powerful than hosted alternatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<p>Self-hosted products are all open-source and free. The only costs are for the server, and the cheapest VPS plans start at ~2$/month.</p>
<h3>Hosted</h3>
<p>Hosted feed readers are managed services. It's required to create an account to get access to them. All of them are paid SAAS products, and most offer a free plan.</p>
<p>On average they have the most polished user experience and most comprehensive feature sets, since they're backed by companies that invest in continuous development.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Beyond creating an account, no setup is required. The same for maintenance. Service providers make sure the products work as intended, and deal with everything required to keep the service running, including infrastructure setup, monitoring, backups, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Since data is stored on the servers and databases of the company running the product, users don't have direct control. But through laws like GDPR users have the right to export all their data, or request deletion. Storage is essentially unlimited, though most products have limits to avoid abuse. These limits are mentioned on their pricing page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Similar to self-hosted products, feeds are fetched on the server, which runs continuously and ensures that even high-frequency feeds don't pose a problem. The fetching interval is usually dynamic, based on the popularity of a feed and the publishing frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Hosted products are primarily available as web application, and some offer native apps as well. Since data is stored on the server, it's natively synced between devices. Some hosted feed readers also offer offline support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Hosted feed readers serve many customers at the same time, which makes it necessary to have more complex infrastructure setups. This also enables features that other types of products cannot do, like email receiving, recommendations, or historic feed contents. Consequently hosted options are generally more powerful than other categories, though the specific feature set depends on the product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<p>All hosted products are SAAS products and charge monthly. <code>Folo</code> is an outlier, they currently don't have any paid features, but the terms of service indicate that this will come in the future. At that point it will join the others in the <code>Paid (SAAS)</code> category.</p>
<h2>App support and offline access for products that don't offer it natively</h2>
<p>Many of the self-hosted or hosted products don't provide apps or offline access by themselves. However, with the right setup, it's still possible to access the articles offline.</p>
<p>Most of these products provide APIs. This can be a proprietary API, or an API based on the old Google Reader API.</p>
<p>Mobile apps, for example ReadKit or Fiery Feeds, can not only subscribe to feeds, but also connect to other products through their APIs. They download contents, store them locally, and sync changes back to the connected products.</p>
<p>These apps make it possible to use a native mobile app for products that don't provide an app themselves, and get offline access at the same time.</p>
<p>FreshRSS, for example, has a <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/blob/edge/README.md#apis--native-apps">list of native apps</a> that support it.</p>
<h2>A note on newsletters</h2>
<p>Newsletters are a growing mechanism for delivering (blog) content. Some, but not all, hosted feed readers support newsletters out of the box. But on-device products can't do that at all because of their infrastructure limitations.</p>
<p>Even if a feed reader doesn't support newsletters by itself, it's still possible to get newsletters into the feed reader, through services that convert newsletters into RSS feeds.</p>
<p>These services generate an email address and give you a corresponding feed URL. Emails to the generated address are added to the feed as new entry. So after signing up to the newsletter and adding the feed URL, the newsletter is added to the feed reader even without native email support.</p>
<p>Services that do this are <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a> and the <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/newsletter-to-rss">Lighthouse Newsletter to RSS tool</a>. Both are free.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<p>The descriptions highlight the defining and unique aspects of the products, for the full feature list please go to their respective websites. Where available I used the screenshots for their websites, to represent the products as best as possible (test account screenshots wouldn't be as good).</p>
<h3>NetNewsWire (on-device, free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> is a free, on-device feed reader for Mac and iOS. By default it stores data on the device itself, but can sync via iCloud and using other products as storage. And it provides a Safari extension for easy feed-adding. Notably, it supports AppleScript, which makes it possible to automate certain workflows.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="2880" height="1800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fnetnewswire.509b6535.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fnetnewswire.509b6535.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from netnewswire.com</p>
<h3>Fiery Feeds (on device, paid SAAS)</h3>
<p>Fiery feeds is a Mac and iOS app. The download is free, and to get the premium features it costs ~15$/year (varies by region). By default it stores data on the device itself, but can sync via iCloud and using the API of other products (e.g. FreshRSS). The main distinguishing features are the customization options of the app, like custom themes.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="6" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="783" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from voidstern.net/fiery-feeds</p>
<h3>Reeder (on-device, SAAS)</h3>
<p>The current version of <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> is a Mac and iOS app. The download is free, and to get the premium features it costs ~10$/year. The previous version of Reeder, now called <a href="https://reederapp.com/classic/">Reeder Classic</a>, is still available as one-time purchase. It also stores data on-device, and can sync via iCloud.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature is the unified timeline, which includes RSS, podcasts, social media, and more.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1604" height="968" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from App Store Reeder page</p>
<h3>FreshRSS (self-hosted, free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a> is a self-hosted feed reader and once set up, it's available as a web app. It is quite powerful, and in addition to normal feed subscriptions offers WebSub as well. It's possible to customize it with themes and extensions, and it's translated into more than 15 languages.</p>
<p>Together with Miniflux they're the most-recommended self-hosted options.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="2454" height="1251" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffreshrss.f7bbd93e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffreshrss.f7bbd93e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from freshrss.org</p>
<h3>Miniflux</h3>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> is a self-hosted feed reader as well, and available as web app after setup. It's focus is on staying simple and fast instead of adding fancy features. It also offers a hosted version, which is 15$/year and has a 15 day trial period.</p>
<p>Together with FreshRSS they're the most-recommended self-hosted options.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="756" height="483" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from miniflux.app</p>
<h3>Folo (hosted, free)</h3>
<p>Folo is a relatively new product developed by the creators of RSS Hub. It's a free hosted feed reader, with apps available for every major platform. Their <a href="https://folo.is/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> suggest that at some point they will charge a monthly fee for some premium features, but at the time of writing there were no paid features.</p>
<p>Folo is also open-source and therefore theoretically self-hostable, but I haven't found documentation for it.</p>
<p>It has a huge feature set, including newsletter support, transforming websites into feeds, AI summaries, and much more.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1287" height="686" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><h3>Feedly (hosted, SAAS)</h3>
<p><a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader">Feedly</a> is the most widely-known product and has the most users of all feed readers. It has a comprehensive features set, and offers a free plan as well. For the past couple of years, it seems that Feedly has focused more on AI features and enterprise customers, but their core product remains solid.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1427" height="775" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from feedly.com/news-reader</p>
<h3>Inoreader</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> is the second most widely-known product, after Feedly. It too offers a free plan. Their feature list is impressive, with social media support for subscriptions, automation and AI features, public API and integrations. And of course much more.</p>
<p>What stands out on Reddit are complaints about price hikes. Though Inoreader probably has tens or hundreds of thousands of users who don't have issues and think the product is great.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1519" height="855" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finoreader.28b7d07f.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finoreader.28b7d07f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finoreader.28b7d07f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from inoreader.com</p>
<h3>Readwise Reader</h3>
<p><a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> is a relatively new product, from the creators of the original <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>. It's a great feed reader, though were it really shines is the reading experience. They also have reading views for PDFs, eBooks, and more.</p>
<p>The website mentions that it's in beta, but it has been in beta for years now and at this point is a stable product, and has been for awhile.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1205" height="807" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from readwise.io/read</p>
<h3>Tiny Tiny RSS</h3>
<p>Tiny Tiny RSS deserves an honorable mention in this list. It was, and still is, used by many, and has been for a long time, and was often recommended on the RSS subreddit.</p>
<p>On October 3rd the maintainer <a href="https://community.tt-rss.org/t/the-end-of-tt-rss-org/7164">announced</a> that he's going to stop working on it, and will remove all infrastructure on November 1st. Forks of the project with other maintainers may pop up, but at the moment it's too soon to tell what the future of Tiny Tiny RSS will be.</p>
<h3>Lighthouse</h3>
<p><a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/">Lighthouse</a> is also a relatively new product. It's in beta, which refers to the fact that it doesn't yet have all features necessary to fulfill its vision, which goes beyond simple feed reading.</p>
<p>The main differentiator is that it focuses on articles over feeds, and has a separate view for curating articles (the inbox). It's focused on finding high-value content.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="686" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><h2>Similar product categories</h2>
<p>Feed readers are powerful products, which require manual setup to make them work well. Subscribing to feeds is mandatory, adding tags, filtered views, and rules can make them work even better. But for some use-cases, other product categories are simpler and might work better.</p>
<h3>News aggregators</h3>
<p>News aggregators automatically collect and curate news from a large variety of sources. They usually provide some customization options, but focus on news and don't allow arbitrary feed subscriptions like feed readers do.</p>
<p>They focus on providing an overview of the most relevant news stories.</p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://kite.kagi.com/">Kagi News,</a> <a href="https://ground.news/">Ground News</a>, and <a href="https://www.smartnews.com/">SmartNews</a>.</p>
<h3>Reading lists</h3>
<p>Reading lists, also called read-it-later apps, are for saving and organizing links you found somewhere on the web. Many feed readers can do the same, but reading lists are optimized for that purpose.</p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a>. <a href="https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep">Karakeep</a> is a self-hosted option.</p>
<h2>How to choose</h2>
<p>For most people, going with one of the hosted products is the best option. They're generally the most polished and most powerful products, owing to the fact that they have companies behind them with full-time engineers. They generally also offer a free plan, so if you stay within the limits of those, they will even be free to use.</p>
<p>For more specific requirements, products of the other categories can work better. They have different characteristics, and can work better in some situations. For example, if you want total control over your data, self-hosted options are the way to go.</p>
<p>It's probably easiest to first decide on the category, and then check out multiple products, or maybe even try them out. Virtually all products support OPML import and export, so moving feed subscriptions from one product to the next is almost zero effort.</p></div></div>]]></description>

And it's coming late in the day Sunday — apologies! But patience pays off!!</p><p>This issue's main story has been cookin' for a minute: last month the news landed that MAME had finally properly cracked Hyper Neo Geo 64 support, but the celebration was a little bit premature. The arcade system was playable in MAME, yes, but sound was in really shoddy shape — it wasn't yet a particularly good experience. </p><p>Over the last month or so that's been changing, and changing fast, with frequent improvements checked in by a pair of regular MAME contributors. So <em>now</em> is the time to talk about it, and <em><strong>soon</strong> </em>(with the very next MAME release!) it will be time to actually play it. Considering there are only seven Hyper Neo Geo 64 games, well, that's a week's worth of evenings sorted.</p><p>As with every trip to Tokyo I took a few hours to stop by Akihabara this time, but its pull has certainly lessened over the years as retro prices have skyrocketed from where they were a decade ago and the selection has gotten thinner and thinner. Still, browsing the stores is a fun time and there are great finds to be found as long as you're not looking for anything too in-demand. I picked up one game: Kamiwaza, a PS2 "stealth" game where you play as a thief in feudal Japan stealing hella stuff.</p><p>As you might guess, it's more silly than stealthy.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFLNxNU-54E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Kamiwaza PS2 Gameplay HD (PCSX2 v1.7.0)"></iframe></figure><p>Shout out to my shopping partner in crime, Paradise Killer's Oli Clarke Smith, for the recommendation. I've got a feature on the way in the coming weeks over at PC Gamer based on some of the games we picked up and how they speak to the "identity" of particular retro consoles. I'm hoping it'll be a fun read! </p><p>For now, let's hop into MAME; then stick around for an update on Pioneer LaserActive emulation!</p><div><p>💸</p><p><i><em>If you enjoy </em></i><i><b><strong>ROM</strong></b></i><i><em>, I'd love it if you'd consider </em></i><a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/#/portal/support"><i><b><strong>a small tip</strong></b></i></a><i><em> to help me cover my monthly costs.

"When I started looking at the system back in 2004 MAME didn't really do much 3D stuff at all, even things like the MIPS (main CPU) core were in a much rougher shape, there were no dumps of the I/O MCU at all (happened only a few years ago) and the PC I had at the time barely had enough memory to load and decode even the 2D graphics," he says. </p><p>"It was also pre-YouTube, and even in the early days of YouTube you didn't really get much in the way of good reference material. Kinda crazy to think that a lot of people who are probably interested in the emulation of the platform now as younger adults weren't even born when emulation work first started on it!"</p><p>A few weeks ago, two decades after he started looking into the system, Haywood finally promoted it to "working" status in MAME. But that move was a bit of a formality, or a bit sneaky, depending on how you look at it. Though the promotion got some buzz, it wasn't truly finished: proper sound emulation was still missing. Haywood actually hadn't worked on the core since 2023, and decided, well, people had been playing the games for long enough without sound, he might as well slap the "working" label on. It turned out to be the final push other MAME contributors needed to take a crack at tuning up the sound.</p><p>What's the Hyper Neo Geo's whole deal, anyway? Well, it makes some sense that the system would be more a curiosity for younger folks to discover than an object of intense nostalgia like some of MAME's more high-profile cores or the original Neo Geo; it was only active in arcades for two years from 1997 to 1999 during the awkward transitional period to 3D, with just seven games released for it:</p><ul><li>Road's Edge</li><li>Samurai Shodown 64</li><li>Xtreme Rally</li><li>Beat Busters: Second Nightmare</li><li>Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage</li><li>Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition</li><li>Buriki One</li></ul><p>Here's a nice write-up of the system from Nicole Express that delves into the hardware: </p><figure><a href="https://nicole.express/2021/ultra-mega-hyper-neo-geo-64.html?ref=readonlymemo.com"><div><p>The failed heir: The Hyper Neo Geo 64!</p><p>In 1982, Commodore International introduced the technology world to the concept of 64.

Haywood's initial investigation into it predated even MAME's high profile support of Capcom's CPS3 boards, for instance, but once that platform was decrypted support was added quite quickly because hell yeah people wanted to play Street Fighter III. By comparison, "Hyper64 has been a 21 year on-and-off slog," he says.</p><p>It's a perfect representation one of the eternal frustrations of emulation development: People often ask why no one's working on something when they actually are. Just invisibly.</p><blockquote>"The sheer number of times I picked up the Hyper64 driver and pumped weeks of work in it only to not be able to make any progress at all was frustrating at the best of times. Just trying to gain an understanding of it all, but ending up not making any headway at all.  That's something I don't think people really appreciate when it comes to emulation, the amount of time that you have to put in which often yields no positive results at all, where all you can really conclude is it doesn't work the way you were hoping it would work." </blockquote><p>A few years ago, Haywood finally made substantial progress: Someone dumped the I/O microcontroller, and he was able to write a CPU core to emulate it. "The inputs finally started working in a bunch of the games, which allowed me to explore them further and make video improvements," he said. </p><p>"Other components improving in MAME over the years has really helped too.  When I started MAME didn't have a CPU core for the V53 either (which is a V33 CPU with variolus peripherals) and is the CPU driving the sound DSP.  At some point in MAME's history the V53 support got fleshed out (for other systems) which has really come in handy now, as proper sound emulation requires that to be running properly."</p><p>When Haywood marked the platform as working, it caught the attention of another longtime MAME contributor: R. Belmont. For the last month or so, Belmont, as well as two other devs, Happy and O. Galibert, have been chipping away at making the games sound like they're supposed to. </p><p>"Haze marking them working did provide a push, and Happy had done a detailed disassembly of the sound CPU program which was quite useful," Belmont recently posted on Reddit. Belmont and Galibert have both been working on synthesizer support in MAME, and the Hyper Neo Geo 64's sound chip happens to be used it one, providing them with some convenient overlap in interest/speciality. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVrXnV33cjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Hyper NeoGeo 64 Sound Improvements for MAME 0.282 (from O.Galibert &amp; R.Belmont)"></iframe></figure><p>The current MAME release, 0.281, includes a series of rapid-fire improvements as documented by Belmont in a few videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKrXtzndXmw&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">on YouTube</a>:</p><ul><li>"Very early work in progress on better audio for the Hyper Neo Geo 64 system.  There is a loooong way to go, this is just some very basic fixes so far."</li><li>"Since the first video we've got the basic sample starts and stops working the actual correct way they're supposed to and added a preliminary support for volume envelopes, which also helps the audio balance.  Still a lot of work to go though."</li><li>"More progress today!  I figured out how the volume envelopes really work, and that made Buriki One's intro mostly awesome."</li><li>"Barring any last minute adjustments, this is what HNG64 audio will sound like in MAME 0.281. Since the last video, the per-voice low pass filter was added, which cleans up some of the high frequency 'hash' audible previously and makes the sound a bit cleaner."</li></ul><p>It was a ton of progress for a month, taking Hyper Neo Geo 64 sound support from messy and inaccurate to, at least, broadly playable without assaulting your ears. But the real refinements have been coming in just the last few days since 0.281's release in late September.</p><p>But the next build is gonna be the big one. October's upcoming MAME 0.282 release will notably fix up the audio issues in one of the the trickiest games, Xtreme Rally, while really polishing up the rest. Here's what Belmont's noted in update notes for 0.282 so far: </p><ul><li>"Olivier Galibert figured out how they squeezed 12 bits of dynamic range into 8 bits (presumably this is the format from Roger Linn's original MPC60 design) and replaced the biquad low-pass filter with a more likely Chamberlin one that fits the parameters better. Also there were some improvements to the filter envelope. All this results in much clearer and higher-fidelity sound."</li><li>"This time we've figured out how looping samples actually work, fixed the final mixdown to not introduce any distortion, and fixed the filter envelope. The result? A dramatic improvement to Beast Busters Second Nightmare's intro."</li><li>"So the previous fixes seem to have solved Samurai Shodown 64 and SS64 2, but Xtreme Rally (aka Off Beat Racer) was still extremely broken. The engine sound barely worked, sounds were missing, and some sounds would stick looping forever. This time the problem wasn't actually in the sound emulation itself; Xtreme Rally has unique code among the 7 HNG64 games that tries to push sound commands to the sound CPU as quickly as possible. This resulted in as many as 2/3rds of the commands getting dropped on the floor. I have fixed that issue so that all of the commands make it, and Xtreme Rally now sounds great."</li></ul><p>Since Belmont made that post he dialed in a few more improvements where the wrong sounds were playing in certain instances in the game. Here's a video from Haywood showing off the vastly improved audio (though he notes "some graphical issues, such as the fog in the tunnel still need addressing eventually.")</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9P8_u6lRIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Hyper NeoGeo 64 &quot;Xtreme Rally&quot; Sound Improvements for MAME 0.282 (from R.Belmont)"></iframe></figure><p>Once MAME 0.282 releases, the Hyper Neo Geo 64 will well and truly be worthy of the "working" label. Turns out it just needed that last little push.</p><p>In a perfect encapsulation of how these sorts of collaborative projects come together, Galibert noted on Reddit that despite their contributions to the core stemming from an interest in emulating synthesizers, "amusingly, the synth itself (MPC3000) is not working at all yet." Some parts of the synthesizer remain undumped and undocumented, just as parts of the Hyper Neo Geo once were; sometimes while you're waiting for all the pieces to fall into place, it turns out one of the pieces you do have happens to fit into another puzzle entirely.</p><p>"It's just been a long slow process," Haywood said. "Things have inched forward a little bit over the years, and the surrounding code in MAME has become better / more capable, allowing for more progress to be made, step by step."</p><hr><h3 id="2-cant-stop-pioneering-nec-support-and-big-laseractive-performance-improvements-arrive-in-the-latest-ares-nightlies">2.

It took less than three weeks. While you can grab the <a href="https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/releases/download/nightly/ares-windows-x64.zip?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">nightly build</a> anytime, when the next stable build of Ares releases, it'll be all official-like.</p><p>Considering the bulky size of the LaserActive game rips — they can take up dozens of gigabytes — some performance optimizations Nemesis has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/pull/2241?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">in the last few days</a> are almost as exciting as the second console support. Because now you should be able to run the images off a decent HDD without performance issues. Here's the breakdown on Github:</p><blockquote>"This change brings speed enhancements to LaserActive games. The linear resampling coefficient precalculation reduces overall CPU overhead by approximately 30%, making slower CPUs much more likely to achieve full framerate. Additionally, frame prefetch using a background thread makes games much more tolerant of IO latency, making it possible to play games back from platter drives over SATA3.<p>This should be sufficient to make emulation performance acceptable on 95%+ of systems, and I don't have any further optimizations planned at this stage."</p></blockquote><p>So then — LaserActive support is more or less feature complete. What can you play? What <em>should</em> you play?
