<p>Social media has become a reminder of something precious we are losing in the age of LLMs: <strong>unique voices</strong>.</p>
<p>Over time, it has become obvious just how many posts are being generated by an LLM. The tell is the voice. Every post sounds like it was posted by the same social media manager.</p>
<p>If you rely on an LLM to write all your posts, you are making a mistake.</p>
<p>Your voice is an asset. Not just what you want to say, but how you say it.</p>
<p>Your voice is unique. It is formed from your lifetime of lived experiences. No one's voice will be exactly like yours.</p>
<p>Your voice becomes recognizable. Over many posts it becomes something people subconsciously connect with, recognize, trust, and look forward to.</p>
<p>Your voice provides the framework for the impression you leave in a job interview, while networking at a meet-up, or with a co-worker.</p>
<p>Years ago I got a job thanks to my blog posts. A manager wanted my voice influencing their organization. Your voice is an asset.</p>
<p>Your voice matures and becomes even more unique with time and practice.</p>
<p>LLMs can rob you of that voice, and the rest of us lose something precious in the process.</p>
<p>Having an LLM write "in your voice" is not the same. Your voice is not static. It changes with the tides of your life and state of mind. Your most impactful message may come because it was the right moment and you were in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p>Let your voice grow with use. Let it be unique.</p>
<p>Do not let one of your greatest assets fade into atrophy, wilted by cognitive laziness.</p>
<p>Write in <em>your</em> voice.</p>
<p>I do not care what the linguistic remix machine juggles into being.</p>
<p>I care what you have to say.</p>

Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load.</p><p>At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare.</p><p><span>This sparked a new project. Google decided to do something rare for a software company: build its own custom silicon. The goal was to create an </span><strong>ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)</strong><span> designed for one job only: running TensorFlow neural networks.</span></p><p>Key Historical Milestones:</p><ul><li><p><span>2013-2014:</span><strong> </strong><span>The project moved really fast as Google both hired a very capable team and, to be honest, had some luck in their first steps. The team went from design concept to deploying silicon in data centers in just 15 months—a very short cycle for hardware engineering.</span></p></li><li><p><span>2015:</span><strong> </strong><span>Before the world knew they existed, TPUs were already powering Google’s most popular products. They were silently accelerating Google Maps navigation, Google Photos, and Google Translate.</span></p></li><li><p><span>2016</span><strong>:</strong><span> Google officially unveiled the TPU at Google I/O 2016.</span></p></li></ul><p>This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects.</p><p><strong>The difference between a TPU and a GPU?</strong></p><p>To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture.</p><p>The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads.</p><p>A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array.</p><p>The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck).</p><p>In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”).</p><ol><li><p>It loads data (weights) once.</p></li><li><p>It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers.</p></li><li><p>The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory.</p></li></ol><p>What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data.</p><p>Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking:</p><ul><li><p>They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs)</p></li><li><p>It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip.</p></li><li><p>Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks.</p></li></ul><p>The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule.</p><p>For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do.</p><p><strong>Performance numbers TPU vs GPU?</strong></p><p>As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways.</p><p>The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data:</p><ul><li><p>TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5p</p></li><li><p>TPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GB</p></li><li><p>TPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5p</p></li></ul><p>We can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7.</p><p>Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA &amp; others), the summary of the results is as follows.</p><p>Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho.</p><p>A Former Google Cloud employee:</p><div><p>»If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome.</p><p>The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.«</p><p><span>source: </span><a href="https://www.alpha-sense.com/uncoveralpha/" rel="">AlphaSense</a></p></div><p>Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs:</p><p>»TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%«</p><p>This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7.</p><p>Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads).</p><p>There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail:</p><div><p>»If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage.</p><div><p><span>In the long run, if I am thinking I need to write a new code base, I need to do a lot more work, then it depends on how long I’m going to train. I would say there is still some, for example, of the workload we have already done on TPUs that in the future because as Google will add newer generation of TPU, they make older ones much cheaper.</span></p><p><span>For example, when they came out with v4, I remember the price of v2 came down so low that it was practically free to use compared to any NVIDIA GPUs.</span></p></div><p>Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.«</p><p><span>source: </span><a href="https://www.alpha-sense.com/uncoveralpha/" rel="">AlphaSense</a></p></div><p>Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs:</p><p>»I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.«</p><p>We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment:</p><p>»When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.«</p><p>What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU.</p><p>A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia:</p><p>»The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia«</p><p>In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium).</p><p>Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely.</p><p>Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs?</p><p><strong>Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs</strong></p><p><span>The main problem for TPUs adoption is the ecosystem. Nvidia’s CUDA is engraved in the minds of most AI engineers, as they have been learning CUDA in universities.</span><strong> </strong><span>Google has developed its ecosystem internally but not externally, as it has used TPUs only for its internal workloads until now. TPUs use a combination of JAX and TensorFlow, while the industry skews to CUDA and PyTorch (although TPUs also support PyTorch now). While Google is working hard to make its ecosystem more supportive and convertible with other stacks, it is also a matter of libraries and ecosystem formation that takes years to develop.</span></p><p>It is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example).</p><p>The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well:</p><div><p>»Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies.</p><p>Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in.</p><p>I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there.</p><p>With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.«</p><p><span>source: </span><a href="https://www.alpha-sense.com/uncoveralpha/" rel="">AlphaSense</a></p></div><p>These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible.</p><p>A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization.</p><p><strong>Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years</strong></p><p>The most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC.</p><p>The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future).</p><p>While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part.</p><p>Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs.</p><p>As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it.

<p>When GitHub Copilot was launched in 2021, the fact that its training data included a vast amount of Open Source code publicly available on GitHub attracted significant attention, sparking lively debates regarding licensing. While there were issues concerning conditions such as attribution required by most licenses, there was a particularly high volume of discourse suggesting that the conditions of copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), would propagate to the model itself, necessitating that the entire model be released under the same license. The propagation of the GPL is a concept that many modern software engineers have naturally accepted; thus, for an engineer with a straightforward sensibility, it is a perfectly natural progression to think that if GPL code is included in some form, copyleft applies and the license propagates.</p>



<p>However, as of 2025, the theory that the license of the source code propagates to AI models trained on Open Source code is not seen as frequently as it was back then. Although some ardent believers in software freedom still advocate for such theories, it appears they are being overwhelmed by the benefits of AI coding, which has overwhelmingly permeated the programming field. Amidst this trend, even I sometimes succumb to the illusion that such a theory never existed in the first place.</p>



<p>Has the theory that the license of training code propagates to such AI models been completely refuted?</p>



<p>Actually, it has not. This issue remains an indeterminate problem where lawsuits are still ongoing and the judgments of major national governments have not been made clear. In this article, I will explain the current situation of this license propagation theory, namely “GPL propagates to AI models trained on GPL code,” and connect it to points of discussion such as the legal positioning of models and the nature of the freedom we pursue in the AI domain.</p>

<h2 id="the-current-standing-in-two-lawsuits">The Current Standing in Two Lawsuits</h2>



<p>First, let us organize what the “GPL propagation theory to AI models” entails. This is the idea that when an AI model ingests GPL code as training data, the model itself constitutes a derivative work (derivative) of the GPL code; therefore, when distributing the model, the copyleft conditions of the GPL, such as the obligation to disclose source code, apply. In other words, it is not a question of whether the output of the model is similar to the GPL code, but a theory that “since the model itself is a derivative containing GPL code, the GPL extends to the model.” While there were many voices supporting this theory around 2021, as mentioned earlier, it is no longer the mainstream of the discussion today. However, two major ongoing lawsuits can be cited as grounds that this theory has not been completely denied. These are <em>Doe v. GitHub</em> (the Copilot class action) filed in the United States and <em>GEMA v. OpenAI</em> filed in Germany. I will explain the history and current status of each lawsuit below.</p>



<h3 id="doe-v-github-copilot-class-action-the-persisting-claim-of-open-source-license-violation">Doe v. GitHub (Copilot Class Action): The Persisting Claim of Open Source License Violation</h3>



<p>In the Copilot class action filed at the end of 2022 in relation to GitHub Copilot, anonymous developers became plaintiffs and argued that GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI trained their models on source code from public repositories without permission, inviting massive license violations through Copilot. Specifically, they viewed it as problematic that when Copilot reproduces part of the code that served as the training source in its output, it does not perform the author attribution or copyright notice required by licenses such as MIT or Apache-2.0 at all, and furthermore, it indiscriminately trains on and outputs code under licenses that impose copyleft conditions like the GPL, thereby trampling on license clauses. The plaintiffs claimed this was a contractual violation of open source licenses and also sought damages and injunctions, asserting that it constituted a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) under copyright law.</p>



<p>In this case, several decisions have already been handed down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and many of the plaintiffs’ claims have been dismissed. What were dismissed were mainly peripheral claims such as DMCA clause violations, privacy policy violations, unjust enrichment, and torts, but some DMCA violations and the claim of “violation of open source licenses” (breach of contract) are still alive. Regarding the latter specifically, the argument is that despite the plaintiffs’ code being published under licenses like GPL or MIT, the defendants failed to comply with the author attribution or the obligation to publish derivatives under the same license, which constitutes a contractual violation. Although the court did not recognize claims for monetary damages because the plaintiffs could not demonstrate a specific amount of damage, it determined that there were sufficient grounds for the claim for injunctive relief against the license violation itself. As a result, the plaintiffs are permitted to continue the lawsuit seeking an order prohibiting the act of Copilot reproducing others’ code without appropriate license indications.</p>



<p>As is clear from the above history, “violation of open source licenses in training data” is still being contested in court in the Copilot litigation, and this is one of the reasons why the theory of license propagation to models has not been completely denied. The plaintiffs’ claim in this lawsuit does not directly demand the release of the model itself under the GPL, but it legally pursues the point that license conditions were ignored in the process of training and output; consequently, it suggests that “if the handling does not follow the license of the training data, the act of providing the model could be illegal.” Furthermore, the court has not clearly rejected this logic at this stage and has indicated a judgment that the use of open source code is accompanied by license obligations, and providing tools that ignore this could constitute a tort subject to injunction.</p>



<p>However, it is necessary to note that the claims in the Copilot litigation are legally framed as breach of contract (license) or DMCA violation, and are not a direct copyright argument that “the model is a derivative work of GPL code.” No judgment has been shown stepping so far as to mandate the disclosure of the entire model under the GPL license. The actual judgment is conservative, stating “monetary damages have not been shown, but there is room for future injunctive relief,” and does not mention the obligation to disclose the model itself. In other words, at present, there is no judicial precedent directly addressing the “GPL propagation theory to models,” and the situation is one where the issue raised regarding license violation of the source code remains alive in the judicial arena.</p>



<h3 id="gema-v-openai-the-theory-treating-memory-in-models-as-legal-reproduction">GEMA v. OpenAI: The Theory Treating “Memory” in Models as Legal Reproduction</h3>



<p>Another important lawsuit is the case where the German music copyright collective GEMA sued OpenAI. This is a copyright lawsuit concerning the unauthorized training and output of lyrics by an AI model, not AI code generation, but it carries significant theoretical implications related to “license propagation to models” even if not directly related to GPL.</p>



<p>In November 2025, the Munich I Regional Court handed down a judgment on this lawsuit, indicating regarding the matter where the ChatGPT model had memorized and reproduced the lyrics of 9 famous German songs, that the act of “memory” inside the model itself falls under the act of reproduction under copyright law. According to the judgment, the lyrics under the plaintiff’s management were “fixed” in the models of ChatGPT’s GPT-4 and 4o, and the situation was such that the lyrics were output almost verbatim just by the user giving a simple prompt. Based on this, the court determined that the model contains “parameters that memorized the work” internally, and if it is possible to reproduce an expression substantially identical to the original work for a human by means of an appropriate prompt, that memory itself falls under “reproduction” in Article 16 of the German Copyright Act. Furthermore, it determined that the act of actually outputting lyrics in response to a prompt is also a separate act of reproduction, and providing lyrics to the user falls under the act of making available to the public (public transmission). Also, it ruled that since all of these are done without the permission of the rights holder, they deviate from the scope justified by the TDM (Text and Data Mining) exception in the EU DSM Copyright Directive.</p>



<p>The important point of this judgment is that it clearly acknowledged that “if a work is recorded inside the model in a reproducible form, that state itself can constitute copyright infringement.” The court cited the text of the EU InfoSoc Directive that “reproduction includes copies in any form or manner, and does not need to be directly perceptible to humans,” and stated that in the spirit of this, even if the lyrics are encoded within the model’s parameters, it amounts to the creation of a reproduction. It went as far as to mention that “encoding in the form of probabilistic weights does not prevent it from being considered a copy,” showing a strong recognition that differences in technical formats cannot avoid the nature of reproduction under copyright law. Also, since the fact that the model could output the lyrics was not coincidental but highly consistent, it was factually found that “the direct incorporation of the essential part of the training data” occurred rather than the result of statistical learning. As a result, the Munich District Court recognized OpenAI’s liability for injunction and damages regarding the output act of the lyrics in question, and further ordered the provision of information regarding training data and output content for the future. However, this judgment is the first instance, and since OpenAI has indicated an intention to appeal, it is expected to be a continuing dispute.</p>



<p>The noteworthy theory shown by this GEMA judgment is the extension of the concept of reproduction under copyright law to the interior of the model. That is, if the work used as training data remains within the model and can be reproduced with a simple operation, it means the model already contains a reproduction of that work. This theory is groundbreaking in that it deems “the model contains the source work,” and indeed, in a commentary by Osborne Clarke, it is evaluated that “in contrast to the judgment of the English High Court in the <em>Getty v. Stability AI</em> case, the Munich District Court explicitly recognized the possibility that the AI model contains copies of the training material.” Standing on this view, the model is not merely a result of analysis, but depending on the case, can be evaluated as an aggregate of the training data itself.</p>



<p>However, it is necessary to keep in mind that this judgment is based on an extreme case where a complete match output was obtained with short text such as lyrics. The court itself stated, “Normally, temporary reproduction for learning remains within the purpose of analysis and does not infringe on the rights holder’s market, but in this case, the model holds the work in a restorable form and exceeds the scope of analysis,” emphasizing that the judgment is limited to “cases where the model performs complete reproduction.” Also, as the UK case shows, judicial decisions vary by country, and a legal consensus on this issue has not yet been formed.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the judgment this time, which declared that the recording of a work inside a model is a reproduction, can become a major basis supporting the license propagation theory. This is because, while the premise for discussing GPL propagation is “whether the model can be said to be a reproduction or derivative work of the GPL code,” the logic of the Munich District Court legally certified exactly that “a model can be a reproduction of training data”.</p>



<h3 id="possibilities-derived-from-the-current-status-of-the-two-lawsuits">Possibilities Derived from the Current Status of the Two Lawsuits</h3>



<p>From the two lawsuits above, we can consider the path through which the theory of license propagation to AI models might be recognized in the future.</p>



<p>Let us assume the worst-case scenario from the perspective of AI operators, where these lawsuits are finalized with the plaintiffs winning. In the Copilot litigation, the judgment that “model providers must comply with the license conditions of the training source code” would be established, and in the GEMA litigation, the legal principle that “the model encompasses reproductions of the work” would be established. When these two intersect, the conclusion that “since an AI model containing GPL code is a reproduction or derivative work of the GPL code, the conditions of the GPL directly apply to its provision” is theoretically derived. That is, the possibility emerges that the theory of GPL propagation to models is effectively ratified by the judiciary.</p>



<p>Specifically, if the model memorizes and contains GPL code fragments internally, the act of distributing or providing that model to a third party may be regarded as the distribution of a reproduction of GPL code; in that case, the act of distribution under conditions other than GPL would be evaluated as a GPL license violation. If a GPL violation is established, there would be room to argue for remedies such as injunctions and claims for damages, as well as forced GPL compliance demanding the disclosure of the entire model under the same license, just as in the case of ordinary software. In fact, the remedies GEMA sought from OpenAI included disclosure regarding training data and output content, and although this is in the context of musical works, this can be said to be a type of disclosure request to make transparent “what the model learned and contains.” In the case of a GPL violation as well, the possibility cannot be denied that demands such as “disclosure of the GPL code parts contained inside the model” or “source disclosure in a form that allows reconstruction of the model” would emerge in seeking license compliance.</p>



<p>Even if not reaching such an extreme conclusion, an intermediate scenario could involve imposing certain restrictions on model providers. For example, the Copilot litigation might be settled or judged by taking measures such as “attaching a license and author attribution at the time of output if existing code of a certain length or more is included in the generated code,” or technically mandating the implementation of filters so that GPL code fragments are not extracted or reproduced from the model. In fact, GitHub, the developer of Copilot, has already introduced an optional feature that “excludes from suggestions if the candidate code matches existing code on large-scale repositories,” attempting to reduce litigation risk. Also regarding OpenAI, there are reports that it strengthened filters so that ChatGPT does not output copyrighted lyrics as they are, in response to the GEMA judgment.</p>



<p>While these are not license propagation itself legally, in practice, they indicate that the industry is steering in the direction of “ensuring the model does not potentially infringe license conditions.” In the future, there is a possibility that guidelines for excluding data with specific license terms like GPL at the model training stage, or mechanisms and systems to guarantee that there is no license-infringing output by conducting output inspections after training, will be established.</p>



<p>In any case, until these two lawsuits are completely settled and the subsequent legislative response is determined, the “theory of GPL propagation to models” has not completely disappeared. It is a scenario that could suddenly become realistic depending on future judgments, and even if the plaintiffs lose in the lawsuits, there is a possibility that support for this theory will reignite within the open source community. It is necessary to note that while it is currently an “undetermined theory not shouted as loudly as before,” that does not mean it has been legally completely denied and resolved. As our community, we need to carefully consider countermeasures while observing these trends and taking into account the legal systems of each country and opposing arguments described in the latter half of this article.</p>



<h3 id="treatment-under-japanese-law">Treatment under Japanese Law</h3>



<p>Based on the trends of the overseas lawsuits mentioned above, I will also organize the relationship between AI models, copyrighted works, and licenses under Japanese law. In Japan, Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, introduced by the 2018 amendment, exists as a provision that comprehensively legalizes reproduction acts associated with machine learning. Furthermore, in March 2024, the Copyright Division of the Council for Cultural Affairs of the Agency for Cultural Affairs published a guideline-like document titled “Thought on AI and Copyright” (hereinafter “the Thought”), presenting a legal organization divided into the development/training stage and the generation/utilization stage of generative AI.</p>



<p>According to “the Thought,” reproduction performed basically for the purpose of AI training is legal as long as it satisfies “information analysis not for the purpose of enjoying the thoughts or sentiments expressed in the work” as defined in Article 30-4. Therefore, acts of collecting and reproducing a wide range of data from the internet to create a training dataset for research and development purposes can be done without the permission of the rights holders in principle. However, what is important is whether an “purpose of enjoyment” is mixed into that training act. “The Thought” states that if training is conducted with the purpose of “intentionally reproducing all or part of the creative expression of a specific work in the training data as the output of generative AI,” it is evaluated as having a concurrent purpose of enjoying the work rather than mere information analysis, and thus lacks the application of Article 30-4. As a typical example of this, “overfitting” is cited, and acts such as making a model memorize specific groups of works through additional training to cause it to output something similar to those works are judged to have a purpose of enjoyment.</p>



<p>Furthermore, “the Thought” also mentions the legal treatment of trained models, stating first that “trained models created by AI training cannot be said to be reproductions of the works used for training in many cases.” This is the view that since the model can generate outputs unrelated to the original in response to various inputs in a general-purpose manner, the model itself is not a copy of any specific work.</p>



<p>However, “the Thought” simultaneously acknowledges the possibility that, exceptionally, in cases where “the trained model is in a state of generating products with similarity to the work that was training data with high frequency,” the creative expression of the original work remains in the model, and it may be evaluated as a reproduction. It also points out that in such cases, the model is positioned as a machine for copyright infringement, and a claim for injunction may be recognized. In short, usually the model is merely statistical data and not the work itself, but if it has turned into a device for spewing out specific works almost as they are, it can be treated as an infringing item; this thinking shares parts with the content of the GEMA judgment.</p>



<p>It is necessary to note that the above organization is strictly a discussion of the scope of application of rights limitation provisions (exception provisions) under the Copyright Act, and does not touch upon the validity of contracts or license clauses. The Agency for Cultural Affairs document discusses from the perspective of “whether it is copyright infringement or not,” and does not deny that even if the training act is legal, contractual liability may arise if it violates terms of service or open source licenses separately. Also, no in-depth view has been shown regarding the propagation of copyleft clauses like the GPL. In Japan’s Copyright Act, there is no override provision where rights limitation provisions like Article 30-4 take precedence over contract conditions, and the “Contract Guidelines on Utilization of AI and Data” by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry suggests the possibility that if there is a contract prohibiting data use between parties, that contract takes precedence.</p>



<p>Therefore, if the license is regarded as a valid contract, even if “training is legal” under Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, the risk remains that it becomes a “violation of license conditions” under contract law, and it can be said that at least there is no official view organizing the theory of GPL propagation to models. In other words, currently, while the legality of model training acts is recognized quite broadly under the Copyright Act, license violation is left to general civil theory, and there is no clear guideline on, for example, “whether the act of publicly distributing a model trained on GPL code constitutes a GPL license violation.” Overall, the legal organization in Japan is in a situation of “safe in principle at the copyright layer, but blank at the contract layer.” Hence, the discussion in Japan regarding the theory of GPL propagation to models relies on future judicial judgments and legislative trends, and at present, there is no choice but to consider operational guidelines carefully following the organization by the Agency for Cultural Affairs.</p>

<h2 id="arguments-negating-the-theory-of-license-propagation-to-models">Arguments Negating the Theory of License Propagation to Models</h2>



<p>As seen in the previous sections, the theory of GPL propagation to models is not legally zero. However, many legal experts and engineers point out that this theory has serious detrimental effects. Here, I present representative arguments negating the theory of license propagation to models from the layers of copyright law, GPL text, technology, and practical policy.</p>



<h3 id="arguments-for-negation-at-the-copyright-law-layer">Arguments for Negation at the Copyright Law Layer</h3>



<p>First, under copyright law, it is unreasonable to regard an AI model as a “derivative work” or “reproduction” of the training source works. In many cases, the expressions of specific works are not stored inside the model in a form recognizable to humans. The model merely holds statistical abstractions where text and code have been converted into weight parameters, and that itself is not a creative expression to humans at all. A “derivative work” under copyright law refers to a creation that incorporates the essential features of the expression of the original work in a form that can be directly perceived, but one cannot directly perceive the creativity of the original code from the model’s weights. In other words, the model does not show the nature of a work directly enough to be evaluated as encompassing the original code. For example, the High Court of Justice in the UK stated in the judgment of the <em>Getty v. Stability AI</em> case that “the Stable Diffusion model itself is not an infringing copy of the training images,” showing a negative view on regarding the model itself as a reproduction of works. Thus, there are many cautious positions internationally regarding regarding the model itself as an accumulation of works or a compilation work.</p>



<p>Also, the output generated by the model involves probabilistic and statistical transformations, and in many cases, things that do not resemble the training source at all are output. Even if a match or similarity occurs by chance, it is difficult to prove whether it is a reproduction relying on the original or an accidental similarity. It is not realistic to conduct the certification of reliance and similarity required to discuss copyright infringement for the entire model. Ultimately, in the framework of copyright law, there is no choice but to judge “whether the model relies on a specific work” on a work-by-work basis, and recognizing uniform copyrightability or infringing nature for the model itself is a large leap. As organized in Japanese law where the model is not considered a reproduction in most cases, the schematic of model equals work is considered unreasonable under copyright law.</p>



<h3 id="arguments-for-negation-at-the-gpl-text-layer">Arguments for Negation at the GPL Text Layer</h3>



<p>Next, looking at the license text and intent of the GPL itself, doubts are cast on the interpretation that GPL propagates to AI models. For example, in the text of GPLv2, the target of copyleft is limited to “derivative works” of the original code provided under GPL and “works that contain the Program.” Typically, this has been interpreted as software created by modifying or incorporating GPL code, or software combined (linked) with GPL code. In the case of an AI model, it is extremely unclear which part of the original GPL code the model “contains.” Even if the model could memorize fragments of the GPL code used for training, it is a tiny fraction when viewed from the entire model, and most parts are occupied by parameters unrelated to the GPL code. There is no clear assumption shown by the GPL drafters as to whether a statistical model that may partially encapsulate information derived from GPL code can be said to be “a work containing the Program”.</p>



<p>Furthermore, GPLv3 requires the provision of software source code in a “preferred form for modification.” If an AI model is a GPL derivative, the problem arises as to what that preferred form for modification would be. The model weights themselves have low readability and editability for humans, and are hard to call a “preferred form for modification.” If we ask whether the training data is the source code, the original trained GPL code itself cannot be said to be the source of the model, nor is it clear if it refers to the entire vast and heterogeneous training dataset. It is difficult to define what should be disclosed to redistribute the model under GPL compliance, and it could lead to an extreme conclusion that all code and data used for model training must be disclosed. While this is what some freedom believers aim for, it can only be said to be unrealistic in reality, and it deviates from the point of the GPL’s intent to enable users to modify and build from source. Thus, existing GPL provisions are not designed to directly cover products like AI models, and forcing their application causes discrepancies in both text and operation.</p>



<p>In fact, in the “Open Source AI Definition” compiled by the OSI (Open Source Initiative) in 2023, regarding “information necessary for modification” of the model, it stopped at stating that sufficiently detailed information about the training data should be disclosed, and did not require the provision of the training data itself in its entirety. Also, it states that model weights and training code should be published under OSI-approved licenses.</p>



<p>In addition, the FSF (Free Software Foundation) itself does not believe that the current GPL interpretation alone can guarantee freedom in the AI domain, and announced in 2024 that it has started formulating “conditions for machine learning applications to be free.” There, the directionality is shown that “the four freedoms should be guaranteed to users including not only software but also raw training data and model parameters,” but this conversely is a recognition that this is not guaranteed under current licenses. The FSF also points out that “since model parameters cannot be said to be source comprehensible to humans, modification through retraining is more realistic than direct editing,” and can be said to be cautious about treating models on the extension of existing GPL. Overall, claiming GPL propagation univocally to AI models that fall outside the wording and assumptions of GPL provisions is unreasonable from the perspective of interpretation.</p>



<h3 id="arguments-for-negation-at-the-technical-layer">Arguments for Negation at the Technical Layer</h3>



<p>There are also strong counterarguments from a technical perspective against the theory of GPL propagation to models. AI models, particularly those called large language models, basically hold huge statistical trends internally and do not store the original code or text as they are like a database. Returning a specific output for a specific input is merely generation according to a probability distribution, and it is not guaranteed that the same output as the training data is always obtained. If the model does not perform verbatim reproduction of training data except for a very small number of exceptional cases, evaluating it as “containing GPL code” within the model does not fit the technical reality. In fact, the OpenAI side argued in the GEMA lawsuit that “the model does not memorize individual training data, but merely reflects knowledge learned from the entire dataset in parameters.” This argument was not accepted by the Munich District Court, but that was because there was a clear example of lyric reproduction; conversely, unless there is a clear example of reproduction, the view would be that “the model is a lump of statistical knowledge”.</p>



<p>Furthermore, although it has been confirmed that models can output fragments of training data, that proportion is considered extremely limited when viewed from the whole. Regarding the whole as a reproduction based on the existence of partial memory is like claiming the whole is a reproduction of a photograph just because it contains a tiny mosaic-like fragment in an image, which is an excessive generalization. Technically, it is difficult to quantitatively measure how far specific parameters of the model retain the influence of the original data, and the correspondence between the model and training data remains statistical and difficult to draw a line. Therefore, criteria such as “how similar must it be for GPL to propagate?” cannot be established in the first place. The judgment of infringement or not has to be done on an individual output basis, and this would not be consistent with the idea of applying a single license to the entire model. From the technical aspect, since the model is basically a statistical transformation and the majority is unrelated to GPL code, applying GPL collectively can be said to be irrational.</p>



<h3 id="practical-and-policy-arguments-for-negation">Practical and Policy Arguments for Negation</h3>



<p>Finally, major demerits can be pointed out regarding the theory of license propagation to models from practical and policy perspectives. What would happen if this GPL propagation theory were legally recognized? As an extreme example, if 1 million code repositories were used for training a certain large-scale model, all the various licenses contained in them (GPL, MIT, Apache, proprietary, etc.) would “propagate” to the model, and the model provider would have to distribute the model in a form that complies with all 1 million license clauses. As a practical matter, there would be combinations where conditions contradict, such as GPLv2 and Apache-2.0, and attaching and managing a huge collection of copyright notices for one model is nothing but unrealistic. Applying all licenses to an AI model created from training data with mixed licenses is practically bankrupt, and eventually, the only thing that can be done to avoid it would be to exclude code with copyleft licenses like GPL from the training data from the start.</p>



<p>Is such a situation really desirable for our community? The spirit of the GPL is to promote the free sharing and development of software. However, if asserting excessive propagation to AI models causes companies to avoid using GPL code, and as a result, the value held by GPL software is not utilized in the AI era, it would be putting the cart before the horse. In the field of software development, many companies take a policy of not mixing GPL code into their own products, but similarly, if it becomes “do not include GPL in our AI training data,” GPL projects could lose value as data sources. Furthermore, the current legal battles surrounding AI are leaning more towards monetary compensation and regulatory rule-making, and the reality is that they are proceeding in a different vector from the direction of code sharing idealized by GPL. If only the theory of GPL propagation to models walks alone, in reality, only data exclusion and closing off to avoid litigation risks will progress, and there is a fear that it will not lead to the expansion of free software culture.</p>



<p>Policy-wise as well, governments of each country are carefully considering the use of copyrighted works in AI, but at present, there is no example establishing an explicit rule that “license violation of training data generates legal liability for the model.” Even in the EU AI Act, while there are provisions regarding the quality and transparency of training data, it does not demand compliance with open source licenses. Rather, from the perspective of promoting open science and innovation, the movement to allow text and data mining under rights limitations is strong. In Japan as well, as mentioned earlier, the direction is to broadly recognize information analysis use under Article 30-4, and the policy of forcibly applying licenses to AI models is not mainstream in current international discussions.</p>



<p>Based on the above, the theory of license propagation to models is highly likely to cause disadvantages to open source on both practical and policy fronts, and can be said not to be a realistic solution. What is important is how to realize the “freedom of software,” which is the philosophy of open source, in the AI era; the opinion that this should be attempted through realistic means such as ensuring transparency and promoting open model development rather than extreme legal interpretations is potent, and this is something I have consistently argued as well.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="the-stance-of-osi-and-fsf">The Stance of OSI and FSF</h2>



<p>I will also organize what stance major organizations in the open source (and free software) community are currently taking in relation to the theory of GPL propagation to AI models. Representative organizations are the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF); while they share the goal of software freedom, they do not necessarily take the same approach regarding AI models and training data.</p>



<p>First, the OSI formulated the “Open Source AI Definition” (OSAID) in 2024, defining the requirements for an AI system to be called open source. This definition states that the four freedoms (use, study, modify, redistribute) similar to software should be guaranteed for AI systems as well, and defines requirements regarding “forms necessary for modification” to realize that, requiring the disclosure of the following three elements.</p>



<ul>
<li>Data Information: Provide sufficiently detailed information about the data used for training so that a skilled person can reconstruct an equivalent model.
<ul>
<li>This does not make publishing the training data itself in its entirety mandatory, but requires disclosing the origin, scope, nature, and acquisition method if there is data that cannot be published, listing data that can be published, and providing information on data available from third parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Code: Publish the complete set of source code for training and running the model under an OSI-approved license.</li>



<li>Parameters: Publish the model weights (parameters) under OSI-approved conditions.</li>
</ul>



<p>It should be noted that while OSI states that information regarding the code used for training and training data is indispensable in addition to model weights to realize “Open Source AI,” it does not require the complete disclosure of the training data itself. This is a flexible stance that, for example, if raw data cannot be published due to privacy or confidentiality, explaining the nature of the data by clarifying that fact can substitute. Also, the legal mechanism to ensure free use of model parameters is an issue to be clarified in the future, and at present, no conclusion has been reached on legal rights control (e.g., presence or absence of copyrightability) over parameters either.</p>



<p>As can be read from these, the OSI promotes opening up AI models at the level of the open source definition in principle, but keeps the handling of training data to requirements at the information disclosure level. Thereby, it can be said that the OSI avoids adopting the theory of license propagation to models to demand training data disclosure, and is exploring a realistic solution that first guarantees transparency and reproducibility. In principle, it could be said that the OSI denied the GPL propagation theory at the time of publishing the OSAID definition. Note that I am probably the one who sealed the mandatory argument for training data in the final stage of this definition’s formulation process, and I believe this was the correct judgment.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the FSF and FSF Europe (FSFE) take a stance more faithful to fundamental principles. FSFE declared as of 2021 that “for an AI application to be free, both its training code and training data must be published under a free software license.” That is, to modify or verify the model, one must be able to obtain it including the training data, and therefore both must be free. Also, the FSF itself stated in a 2024 statement, “Under current understanding, for an ML application to be called free, all training data and the scripts processing it must satisfy the four freedoms,” trying to extend the requirements of freedom to data. Thus, FSF/FSFE stands on the position that a model with undisclosed training data is unfree as a whole even if the software part is free.</p>



<p>However, the FSF simultaneously states to the effect that “whether a non-free machine learning application is ethically unjust depends on the case,” mentioning that there can be “legitimate moral reasons” for not being able to publish training data (personal information) of a medical diagnosis AI, for example. In that case, it implies that although that AI is non-free, its use might be ethically permitted due to social utility. One can see an attitude of seeking a compromise between the FSF’s ideal and reality here, but in any case, there is no mistake that the FSF ultimately aims for freedom including training data.</p>



<p>So, does the FSF support the theory of GPL propagation to AI models? Not necessarily. Their claim is closer to an ethical standard or ideal image rather than legal enforceability, and they are not arguing that it applies to models as an interpretation of the current GPL license. Rather, as mentioned before, they are at the stage of trying to create new standards and agreements. Even in the white paper on the Copilot issue funded by the FSF, while legal points such as copyright and license violation are discussed, substantially it has a strong aspect of being told as a GPL compliance problem for users (downstream developers) concerned that they bear the risk of GPL violation if Copilot’s output contains GPL code fragments. This is a caution to developers using AI coding tools rather than GPL application to the model itself, and is different from an approach forcing GPL compliance directly on model providers.</p>



<p>The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) naturally has a strong interest in this issue but is also cautious in some respects. The SFC started the protest campaign “Give Up GitHub” against GitHub in 2022, condemning Copilot’s methods as contrary to the philosophy of open source, and is also involved in the Copilot class action. However, in an SFC blog post, regarding this lawsuit, it showed concern about “the risk of interpretations deviating from the principles of the open source community being brought in,” and called on the plaintiffs’ side to comply with community-led GPL enforcement principles as well. The SFC also states that Copilot’s act is an “unprecedented license violation,” and while not fully denying the GPL propagation theory, it can be interpreted as fearing that a judicial precedent undesirable for the community might be created depending on the result of the legal battle. The SFC might be said to be carefully balancing between the aspect of pursuing GPL propagation and the risk of entrusting it to the judiciary.</p>



<p>Finally, what is concerned as the free software camp is that excessive propagation of licenses might conversely invite results that impair freedom. Both OSI and FSF ultimately want to make AI something open that anyone can utilize, but they are carefully assessing whether increasing the purity of legal theory in demands for full data disclosure really leads to achieving the objective. Considering the demerits such as the avoidance of open data due to excessive propagation interpretation or the atrophy effect due to a flurry of lawsuits, I feel that the major organizations share a commonality in that it is essential not to lose sight of the big picture of spreading freedom. Rather than inciting GPL application to models, the pursuit of realistic solutions such as how to make models and data open and which parts should be relaxed in line with reality will likely continue in the future.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>



<p>I have looked at the current state of the theory of GPL propagation to AI models above, and as a conclusion, this theory is in a halfway position where “it is not touted as loudly as before, but it has not completely disappeared.” As a result of points such as license violation of training data and reproduction within the model beginning to be scrutinized in lawsuits like the Copilot class action and <em>GEMA v. OpenAI</em>, it even appears that the hurdle for infringement certification is lowering. In fact, the Munich District Court’s judgment deemed model memory as reproduction, and the claim of open source license violation survives in the Copilot litigation.</p>



<p>However, on the other hand, the hurdle for the propagation of licenses like GPL remains high. There is a large gap between infringement being recognized and the conclusion that the entire model must be disclosed under GPL etc. immediately. What the current lawsuits are seeking is also injunctions and damages, not the forced GPL-ization of the model. There are zero examples where the judiciary supported the theory of GPL propagation to models itself, and it is a legally uncharted territory. Even if that claim were attempted somewhere in the future, it would face the legal, technical, and practical counterarguments mentioned earlier.</p>



<p>However, the situation has fluid parts, and there is a possibility that the line will shift depending on the policies of each country and the trends of the community. For example, if pressure from rights holder groups strengthens in Europe, there is a possibility that guidelines including license compliance will be formulated. Also, if a consensus is formed within the community regarding the state of copyleft in the AI era, a new license might appear. If such changes occur, a phase where the theory of propagation to models is re-evaluated will also arrive.</p>



<p>To offer my personal opinion, what is important at this moment is the perspective of how to balance software freedom and freedom in the AI domain. Instead of blindly trying to apply the philosophy of copyleft to AI, it is necessary to think about what is best to maximize freedom while considering the technical nature and industrial structure peculiar to AI. Fortunately, solutions to practical problems such as the open publication of large-scale AI models, dataset cleaning methods, and automated attachment of license notices are already being explored by the open source community. Promoting such voluntary efforts and supporting them with legal frameworks as necessary will likely be the key to balancing freedom and development.</p>



<p>The theory of GPL propagation to models is a point where judgment is divided on whether it is an ideal to be pursued or a nightmare to be avoided. However, as stated in this article, seeing the situation in the current year of 2025, it is not a situation where it will become reality immediately, and the majority of the community is likely maintaining a cautious stance. Although it is speculated that trial and error will continue in the judicial, legislative, and technical aspects in the future, as our community, we need to continue exploring the point of compatibility between technological innovation and software freedom without jumping to hasty conclusions. That process itself can be said to be a new challenge in the AI era on the extension of the free software spirit.</p>

<p>Arthur Conan Doyle was not just one of the world’s best crime fiction writers. He was a progressive wordsmith who brought light to controversial and taboo subjects. One of those taboo subjects was male vulnerability and mental health problems – a topic of personal significance to the author.</p>



<p>Doyle was a <a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/children-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerable child</a>. His father, Charles, <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/artists/charles-altamont-doyle#:%7E:text=Doyle%20did%2C%20however%2C%20suffer%20from,the%20creator%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was an alcoholic</a>, which led to financial troubles in the family. Charles was admitted to an asylum in 1881 and spent the next 12 years in various <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/arthur-conan-doyle-the-many-faces-of-sherlock-holmes/3AEE8A3782A8F420740219E88A34FE53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental care establishments</a>. So began Doyle’s interest in male vulnerability and mental health.</p>



<p>The character of Sherlock Holmes is a true expression of male vulnerability that does not equate it with weakness. Doyle does not represent Holmes as infallible, but as a man others can relate to – he battles with drug addiction, loneliness and depression. His genius thrives in part because of these vulnerabilities, not despite them.</p>




<p>Many of Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories examine male characters facing emotional catastrophe, betrayal or moral dilemmas. In works such as <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/15793/9781913603380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Man with the Twisted Lip</a> (1891), <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/15793/9781913603403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb</a> (1892) and <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/15793/9781782266594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Stockbroker’s Clerk</a> (1894), Holmes’s male clients approach him with problems layered with emotional turmoil, fear and failure.</p>



<p>In The Man with the Twisted Lip, for example, a man named Neville St Clair hides his double life. He tells his family that he is a respectable entrepreneur going to London on business. In reality he is begging on the city streets. He lives this double life due to fear and shame over the inability to pay off his debts. “It was a long fight between my pride and the money,” he explains, “but the dollars won at last.”</p>

<p>“I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children,” St Clair says. In having his character consider execution to protect his and his family’s reputation, Doyle explored the societal expectations of Victorian masculinity and how men struggled with such pressures.</p>




<p>The Stockbroker’s Clerk also examines male suicide, as well as economic and professional anxieties. When Holmes reveals the crimes of Harry Pinner, the man attempts suicide rather than face prison.</p>



<p>In The Engineer’s Thumb, hydraulic engineer Victor is treated physically by Watson and mentally by Holmes. As Doyle writes: “Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.”</p>



<p>The physical injury marks Victor as a victim of physical violence. Watson suggests that Victor is using all his mental capabilities to keep calm about his severe pain. Holmes treats Victor’s mind as he listens to his story: “Pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.”</p>

<p>Holmes is a protector, a confidante and a comforter in this scene. He provides Victor with breakfast, induces him to lie down and offers him a stimulant (more than likely brandy).</p>



<p>The extremity of violence that Victor has endured has escalated to mental trauma. In having Holmes treat Victor’s mental trauma while Watson treats his physical pain, Doyle showed the importance psychological support for men of the age.</p>



<p>Holmes was a highly popular character. To contemporary readers, his drug use and dysfunctional clients were seen as markers of his genius rather than a reflection of the significant social issues that men faced during this period. But today, they offer a window into the mental struggles of Victorian men, and a point of connection between readers of the past and present.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I tweeted a video of a toy graphics project (below). It’s not done, but a lot of people liked it which was surprising and fun! A few people asked how it works, so that’s what this post is about.</p>



<p>Under the hood it uses something called a distance field. A distance field is an image like the one below that tells you how far each pixel is from your shape. Light grey pixels are close to the shape and dark grey pixels are far from it.</p>

<img src="https://www.rykap.com/images/ray-marching/distance-field.png">

<p>When the demo starts up, it draws some text on a 2D canvas and generates a distance field of it. It uses <a href="https://github.com/ryankaplan/gpu-distance-field">a library I wrote</a> that generates distance fields really quickly. If you’re curious how the library works, I wrote about that <a href="http://rykap.com/graphics/skew/2016/02/25/voronoi-diagrams/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Our lighting scheme works like this: when processing a particular pixel we consider a ray from it to the light, like so…</p>

<img src="https://www.rykap.com/images/ray-marching/ray-march-1.png">

<p>If the ray intersects a glyph, the pixel we’re shading must be in shadow because there’s something between it and the light.</p>

<p>The simplest way to check this would be to move along the ray in 1px increments, starting from the pixel we’re shading and ending at the light, repeatedly asking the distance field if we’re distance 0 from a shape. This would work, but it’d be really slow.</p>

<p>We could pick some specific length like 30px and move in increments of that size, but then we risk jumping over glyphs that are smaller than 30px. We might think we’re not in shadow when we should be.</p>

<p><strong>Ray marching’s core idea is this: the distance field tells you how far you are from the closest glyph. You can safely advance along your ray by that distance without skipping over any glyphs.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s walk through an example. We start as pictured above and ask the distance field how far we are from any glyph. Turns out in this case that the answer is 95px (pictured left). This means that we can move 95px along our ray without skipping over anything!</p>

<img src="https://www.rykap.com/images/ray-marching/ray-march-2.png">

<p>Now we’re a little closer to the light. We repeat the process until we hit the ascender of the b! If the b glyph weren’t there, we’d have kept going until we hit the light.</p>

<p>Below is a demo that shows the ray marching steps for a given pixel. The red box is the pixel we’re shading, and each circle along the ray represents a ray marching step and the distance from the scene at that step.</p>

<p>Try dragging the light and the pixel around to build an intuition for it.</p>



<p>Below is GLSL to implement this technique. It assumes you’ve defined a function <code>getDistance</code> that samples the distance field.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>vec2</span> <span>rayOrigin</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>
<span>vec2</span> <span>rayDirection</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>

<span>float</span> <span>rayProgress</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>rayProgress</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>distance</span><span>(</span><span>rayOrigin</span><span>,</span> <span>lightPosition</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// We hit the light! This pixel is not in shadow.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>.;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>float</span> <span>sceneDist</span> <span>=</span> <span>getDistance</span><span>(</span>
    <span>rayOrigin</span> <span>+</span> <span>rayProgress</span> <span>*</span> <span>rayDirection</span><span>);</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>sceneDist</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>.)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// We hit a shape! This pixel is in shadow.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>.;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>rayProgress</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sceneDist</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It turns out that some pixels are really expensive to process. So in practice we use a for-loop instead of a while loop – that way we bail out if we’ve done too many steps. A common “slow case” in ray marching is when a ray is parallel to the edge of a shape in the scene…</p>



<p>The approach I’ve described so far will get you a scene that looks like the one below.</p>



<p>It’s cool, but the shadows are sharp which doesn’t look very good. The shadows in the demo look more like this…</p>

<img src="https://www.rykap.com/images/ray-marching/desired-shadows.png">

<p>One big disclaimer is that they’re not physically realistic! Real shadows look like hard shadows where the edges have been fuzzed. This approach does something slightly different: all pixels that were previously in shadow are still fully in shadow. We’ve just added a penumbra of partially shaded pixels around them.</p>

<p>The upside is that they’re pretty and fast to compute, and that’s what I care about! There are three “rules” involved in computing them.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> The closer a ray gets to intersecting a shape, the more its pixel should be shadowed. In the image below there are two similar rays (their distances to the shape pictured in yellow and green). We want the one that gets closer to touching the corner to be more shadowed.</p>

<img src="https://www.rykap.com/images/ray-marching/rule-1.png">

<p>This is cheap to compute because the variable <code>sceneDist</code> tells us how far we are from the closest shape at each ray marching step. So the smallest value of <code>sceneDist</code> across all steps is a good approximation for the yellow and green lines in the image above.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> if the pixel we’re shading is far from the point where it almost intersects a shape, we want the shadow to spread out more.</p>

<img src="https://www.rykap.com/images/ray-marching/rule-2.png">

<p>Consider two pixels along the ray above. One is closer to the almost-intersection and is lighter (its distance is the green line). The other is farther and darker (its distance is the yellow line). In general: the further a pixel is from its almost intersection, the more “in shadow” we should make it.</p>

<p>This is cheap to compute because the variable <code>rayProgress</code> is the length of the green and yellow lines in the image above.</p>

<p>So: we previously returned <code>1.0</code> for pixels that weren’t in shadow. To implement rules 1 and 2, we compute <code>sceneDist / rayProgress</code> on each ray marching step, keep track of its minimum value, and return that instead.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>vec2</span> <span>rayOrigin</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>
<span>vec2</span> <span>rayDirection</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>

    <span>// We hit a shape! This pixel is in shadow.</span>

    <span>lightContribution</span><span>,</span>

  <span>);</span>

  <span>rayProgress</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sceneDist</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Ray-marching took more than 64 steps!</span>
<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>.;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This ratio feels kind of magical to me because it doesn’t correspond to any physical value. So let’s build some intuition for it by thinking through why it might take on particular values…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If <code>sceneDist / rayProgress &gt;= 1</code>, then either <code>sceneDist</code> is big or <code>rayProgress</code> is small (relative to each other). In the former case we’re far from any shapes and we shouldn’t be in shadow, so a light value of <code>1</code> makes sense. In the latter case, the pixel we’re shadowing is really close to an object casting a shadow and the shadow isn’t fuzzy yet, so a light value of <code>1</code> makes sense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ratio is <code>0</code> only when <code>sceneDist</code> is <code>0</code>. This corresponds to rays that intersect an object and whose pixels are in shadow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s a demo of what we have so far…</p>



<p><strong>Rule #3</strong> is the most straightforward one: light gets weaker the further you get from it.</p>

<p>Instead of returning the minimum value of <code>sceneDist / rayProgress</code> verbatim, we multiply it by a <code>distanceFactor</code> which is <code>1</code> right next to the light, <code>0</code> far away from it, and gets quadratically smaller as you move away from it.</p>

<p>All together, the code for the approach so far looks like this…</p>

<div><pre><code><span>vec2</span> <span>rayOrigin</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>
<span>vec2</span> <span>rayDirection</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>// Ray-marching took more than 64 steps!</span>
<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>.;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I forget where I found this soft-shadow technique, but I definitely didn’t invent it. Inigo Quilez <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/rmshadows/rmshadows.htm">has a great post on it</a> where he talks about using it in 3D.</p>

<p>Inigo’s post also talks about a gotcha with this approach that you might have noticed in the demos above: it causes banding artifacts. This is because Rule 1 assumes that the smallest value of <code>sceneDist</code> across all steps is a good approximation for the distance from a ray to the scene. This is not always true because we sometimes take very few ray marching steps.</p>

<p>So in my demo I use an improved approximation that Inigo writes about in his post. I also use another trick that is more effective but less performant: instead of advancing by <code>sceneDist</code> on each ray marching step, I advance by something like <code>sceneDist * randomJitter</code> where <code>randomJitter</code> is between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>This improves the approximation because we’re adding more steps to our ray march. But we could do that by advancing by <code>sceneDist * .3</code>. The random jitter ensures that pixels next to each other don’t end up in the same band. This makes the result a little grainy which isn’t great. But I think looks better than banding… This is an aspect of the demo that I’m still not satisfied with, so if you have ideas for how to improve it please tell me!</p>

<p>Overall my demo has a few extra tweaks that I might write about in future but this is the core of it. Thanks for reading! If you have questions or comments, let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjkaplan">on Twitter</a>.</p>

<div><p>Seems weird to say, but I've been posting here for seventeen years now. And in that time, can I say that the quality of the discourse has slipped some? Well... if I'm being honest, probably yeah. A little. But at the same time, I can still honestly say that HN is still easily the best community of this sort on the 'net, at least that I'm aware of. OK, Lobste.rs has some merit, but the problem there is that  the community there is arguably still a little too small, and you just don't get the variety and volume of interesting discussion you get here. But the level of discourse is high there as well.</p><p>Anyway, I find HN to be a wonderful refuge from a lot of the absurdity that's "out there" and I will happily throw in my own "Thanks, guys!" to dang and tomhow.

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.</p><p>That, at least, is what a <a target="_blank" href="https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111">new peer-reviewed study</a> from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.</p><p>The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, "clear-headed" recovery.</p><p>To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.</p><p>"Our aim is early discharge after surgery," says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. "Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed." </p><p>Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Indian surgeons medical team performing surgery in operation theater at hospital"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional "blocks" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. </p><p>"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm," says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. "We've been doing this for decades."</p><p>But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.</p><p>The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.</p><p>To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.</p><p>"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia," says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.</p><p>"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones."</p><p>To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083">Michael Jackson's death</a> but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. "Propofol acts within about 12 seconds," notes Dr Goel. "We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases."</p><p>The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.</p><p>So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.</p><p>"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano," says Dr Husain. "The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd22/live/a51ebd90-c2c0-11f0-bd8a-f3f60edded8d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A pilot on eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups "></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The results were striking.</p><p>Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. "Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia," the researchers write, "music can still shape the brain's internal state."</p><p>Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. "The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious," says Dr Wadhawan. "You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it."</p><p>The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of "intraoperative awareness" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. </p><p>If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.</p><p>"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music," says Dr Husain. "It's a way of humanising the operating room."</p><p>Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.</p><p>If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.</p><p>As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

I had a few criteria in mind and was curious to see if anyone had _ recently_ shared something similar, but I couldn’t find anything that was relevant.</p>

<p>In fact,  I found that the communities I was looking for answers in were actively hostile towards what I wanted to do.  This resulted in my decision <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2012/01/do-it-yourself-network-attached-storage.html" title="My First DIY NAS: Building a NAS: Choosing Hardware">to build my own DIY NAS</a> and share that as one of my very first blogs.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, people were very interested in that blog! Ever since, I’ve been building a similar DIY NAS machine almost every year trying to satisfy the curiosity of other prospective DIY NAS builders.</p>

<p>Here are those criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Small form factor</strong>: It’s not the case for me any more, but at the time the space was limited in my office. I always assume that space in everybody’s office is limited. As a result, I want my DIY NAS builds to occupy as little of that office space as I can.</li>
  <li><strong>At least six drive bays</strong>: Back when I built my NAS, it took about four drives’ worth of storage to meet my storage needs. Plus I desired two empty drive bays for future use. However, in the years since hard drive capacities have increased dramatically. At some point in the future, I may reduce this to four drive bays.</li>
  <li><strong>An integrated, low power CPU</strong>: I intend my DIY NAS to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year. When it comes to power consumption, that can do some damage on your electric bill! Thankfully our electricity here isn’t as expensive as others’ in the United States, or even further outside its borders, but I try and keep power consumption in mind when picking components for a DIY NAS build.</li>
  <li><strong>Homelab potential</strong>: It does not take up a lot of CPU horsepower for a NAS to serve up files, which means that on modern hardware there’s a lot of untapped potential in a DIY NAS for virtual machines or containers to self-host services.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s important to remember that <strong><em>these are my criteria</em></strong>, and not necessarily yours. Every DIY NAS builder should be making their own list of criteria and reconcile all of their component purchases against the criteria that’s important to them.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-even-a-good-time-to-build-a-nas">Is it even a good time to build a NAS?</h2>

<p>As I prepared to build this NAS, component prices disappointed me. Hard drives, SSDs, and RAM prices were all rising. Based on what I’ve been told, I expect Intel CPU prices to increase as well. My contact at Topton has been encouraging me to stock up on motherboards while they still have some in inventory. Based on what’s been explained to me, I expect the motherboard’s prices to rise and for their availability to potentially dwindle.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/ssd_prices.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/ssd_prices_600.png" alt="1TB NVMe SSD prices"></a></p>

<p>In short, the economy sucks and the price of DIY NAS components is a pretty good reflection of just how sucky things are becoming. I briefly considered not publishing a DIY NAS build this year hoping that things would improve a few months down the road. But then I asked myself, “What if it’s even worse in a few months?”</p>

<p>I sure hope things get better, but I fear and expect that they’ll get worse.</p>

<h2 id="motherboard-and-cpu">Motherboard and CPU</h2>
<p>I built <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2023/03/diy-nas-2023-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2023 Edition">my first DIY NAS with a Topton motherboard in 2023</a>. Each DIY NAS since then has also featured a Topton motherboard. My only complaint about the motherboards has been that buying them from one of the Chinese e-tail sites like AliExpress is considered problematic by some. With every DIY NAS build, I try and go through all the motherboards that I can find  while searching for something with a better value proposition, but for each of the past three years I’ve landed on the latest offering from Topton.</p>

<p><a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" target="_blank" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/topton_n22_175.png"></a>For the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>, I chose the <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N22 motherboard</a> with the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/231803/intel-processor-n100-6m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz/specifications.html" title="Intel® Processor N100">Intel Core 3 N355</a> CPU. The motherboard is similar to last year’s <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/127014563991" title="Topton N18 N100/N150/N305 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard:6xSATA/2xM.2/2x2.5GbE/1x10GbE">Topton N18</a> but has incrementally more compelling features, particularly the extra 2 SATA ports, the PCI-e x1 slot, and the N355 CPU!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mini-ITX Form Factor</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/231803/intel-processor-n100-6m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz/specifications.html" target="_blank" title="Intel® Processor N100">Intel® Processor Core 3 N355</a>
    <ul>
      <li>8 cores / 8 threads / Max Turbo 3.9GHz</li>
      <li>15 W TDP</li>
      <li>Integrated GPU with Intel Quick Sync Video</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1 x DDR5 SO-DIMM</li>
  <li>8 x SATA 3.0 Ports (Asmedia ASM1164)</li>
  <li>2 x M.2 NVMe Slots (PCIe 3.0 x1)</li>
  <li>1 x 10Gbps NIC (Marvell AQC113C)</li>
  <li>2 x 2.5Gbps NICs (Intel i226-V)</li>
  <li>1 x PCI-e x1 or M.2 E-Key slot</li>
</ul>

<p>I opted for the motherboard with the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/231803/intel-processor-n100-6m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz/specifications.html" target="_blank" title="Intel® Processor N100">Intel Core 3 N355</a> CPU. This makes the server a more capable homelab machine than prior years’ DIY NAS builds. The extra cores and threads come in handy for streaming media, replacing your cloud storage, facilitating home automation, hosting game servers, etc.</p>

<h2 id="case">Case</h2>
<p>Just like Topton has been making great motherboards for DIY NAS machines, JONSBO has been steadily releasing great cases for DIY NAS machines. This year SilverStone Technology released a new case, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-hot-swappable-Performance-SST-CS383/dp/B0FDPNRYG9?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=61605bf99f3551af48cd50574aa64608&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="SilverStone Technology CS383 8-Bay hot-swappable high Performance Full Tower NAS Chassis, SST-CS383">CS383</a> (<a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/cs383/" title="SilverStone Technology CS383 Specs">specs</a>) which I was <strong><em>very interested</em></strong> in buying one for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>. Unfortunately it carries a pretty hefty price tag to go along with all of its incredible features!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/jonsbo-n4_200.png"></a>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a> (<a href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/N4Black.html" title="JONSBO N4 Case specs">specs</a>) is a third the price, adheres to my “smaller footprint” criteria, and it is rather impressive on its own. It’s a <em>tiny</em> bit larger case than last year’s DIY NAS, but I really like that it has drive bays for six 3.5” drives and two 2.5” drives.</p>

<p>Although, it’s peculiar in that two of the 3.5” drive bays (and the two 2.5” drive bays) aren’t attached to a SATA backplane and can’t be swapped anywhere as easily as the other four 3.5” bays. However, this peculiar decision seems to have caused the JONSBO N4 to sell for a bit less ($20-$40) than similar offerings from JONSBO. At its price, it’s a compelling value proposition!</p>

<h3 id="case-fan">Case Fan</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C6DQDNT?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=a917ad99ae5994be300a55a6e8fc8fe2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.Black.swap, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (120mm, Black) "><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/NF-A12x25_175.png"></a>In the past, I’ve found that the fans which come with JONSBO cases are too noisy. They’ve been noisy for two reasons; the design quality of the fans make them  loud. And the fans are constantly running at their top speed because of the fan header they’re plugged into on the cases’ SATA backplanes.</p>

<p>I anticipated that fan efficiency and noise would be a problem, so I picked out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C6DQDNT?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=a917ad99ae5994be300a55a6e8fc8fe2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.Black.swap, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (120mm, Black) ">Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM</a> to solve it. Firstly, swapping in a high-quality fan that pushes more air <strong><em>and</em></strong> generates less noise–especially at its top speed–is a good first step. Secondly, I’d address the problem by plugging the fan into the motherboard’s <code>SYS_FAN</code> header instead of on the SATA backplane. This provides the opportunity to tune the fan’s RPMs directly in the BIOS and generate far less noise.</p>

<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-4800MHz-Laptop-Memory-CT32G48C40S5/dp/B09RVNMGFH?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=8a98ba9480c4e010efbe51f71f992fbd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Crucial 32GB DDR5 RAM 4800MHz (CT32G48C40S5)"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/CT32G48C40S5-C16A1_175.png"></a>The first time I first asked myself, “Should I even build the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>?” came as I was checking prices on DDR5 memory. Thankfully for me I had leftover RAM after purchasing DDR5 4800MHz SODIMMs for the <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2024/11/diy-nas-2025-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2025 Edition">DIY NAS: 2025 Edition</a>,  <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2025/03/an-all-flash-diy-nas-that-fits-in-my-pocket.html" title="An all-flash DIY NAS that fits in my pocket!">the Pocket Mini NAS</a>, and then again for the <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2025/09/diy-nas-2025-texas-linux-fest-edition.html" title="DIY NAS: 2025 Texas Linux Fest Edition">DIY NAS that I built and gave away at 2025’s Texas Linux Fest</a>. I was personally thankful that I had one brand new  32GB DDR5 4800MHz SODIMM laying around, but I was wildly disappointed for everybody who will try and follow this build when I saw the price of those same SODIMMs.</p>

<p>Regardless, I felt a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-4800MHz-Laptop-Memory-CT32G48C40S5/dp/B09RVNMGFH?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=8a98ba9480c4e010efbe51f71f992fbd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Crucial 32GB DDR5 RAM 4800MHz (CT32G48C40S5)">Crucial 32GB DDR5 4800MHz SODIMM</a> (<a href="https://www.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/CT32G48C40S5" title="Crucial 32GB DDR5-4800 SODIMM specs">specs</a>) was the right amount of RAM to get started with for a DIY NAS build in 2025. Whether you just need storage or you wish to also host virtual machines, you will benefit from having more than the bare minimum recommendation of RAM. I really wanted to buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-5600MT-5200MT-4800MT-CT48G56C46S5/dp/B0C79T2CP7?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=36fd2ef6ac56fee00617824bfe0a0676&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" title="Crucial 48GB DDR5 RAM, 5600MHz (or 5200MHz or 4800MHz) Laptop Memory, SODIMM 262-Pin, Compatible with 13th Gen Intel Core and AMD Ryzen 6000 - CT48G56C46S5 ">48GB DDR5 4800MHZ SODIMM</a> for this DIY NAS build, but I couldn’t talk myself into spending the $250-$300 that it would’ve wound up costing.</p>

<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>

<p>A quick disclaimer about all the drives that I purchased for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>, I already had all of them! I tend to buy things when I see them on sale and as a result, I have a collection of brand new parts for machines in my homelab or for upcoming projects. I raided that collection of spare parts for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>.</p>

<h3 id="boot-drive">Boot Drive</h3>

<p>If you ranked the drives in your DIY NAS in order of importance, the boot drive should be the least-important drive. That is <strong><em>not</em></strong> saying that boot drive isn’t performing an important function, but I am suggesting that you shouldn’t invest a bunch of energy and money into picking the optimal boot drive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0963SGYGF?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=335ccbcac1cb1beb1ad0bbbe951f4cea&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Silicon Power 128GB A55 SATA SSD (SU128GBSS3A55S25AH)"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/sp-a55-128gb_175.png"></a>Because the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a> has a pair of 2.5” drive bays, I decided that a 2.5” SATA SSD would be ideal for the boot drives. As a rule of thumb, I try and spend less than $30 per boot drive in my DIY NAS builds.</p>

<p>Ultimately I selected a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0963SGYGF?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=335ccbcac1cb1beb1ad0bbbe951f4cea&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Silicon Power 128GB A55 SATA SSD (SU128GBSS3A55S25AH)">128GB Silicon Power A55 SSDs</a> (<a href="https://www.silicon-power.com/product-detail/ace_a55/" title="Silicon Power 128GB A55 SATA SSD specs">specs</a>). I’ve used these before, I’d use them again in the future, and I even have four of their higher capacity (1TB) SSDs in a pool in my own NAS.</p>

<h3 id="app-and-virtual-machine-nvme-ssds">App and Virtual Machine NVMe SSDs</h3>

<p>Self-hosting apps and virtual machines on your DIY NAS has really exploded in the past few years. The developers of NAS appliance packages have made it much easier and the self-hosted products themselves have become as good–or often better–than things you’re probably subscribing to today. Because of that, I saved the highest-performing storage options on the <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" target="_blank" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N22 motherboard</a> for apps and VMs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZGJVTZK?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=27613853bea52aac53f1068188e5c5e3&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Teamgroup MP44 1TB NVMe SSD"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/SiliconPower-SSD-P34A60-Product_175.png"></a>However, it’s important to point out that these M.2 slots are PCI-e version 3 and capped at a single PCI-e lane. This is a consequence of the limited number of PCI-e lanes available for each of the CPU options available for  the <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N22 motherboard</a> (N100, N150, N305, and N355).</p>

<p>I opted for a NVMe drive that was a good value rather than a high performer and chose two of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZGJVTZK?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=27613853bea52aac53f1068188e5c5e3&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Teamgroup MP44 1TB NVMe SSD">Silicon Power 1TB M.2 NVMe SSDs (SP001TBP34A60M28)</a> (<a href="https://www.silicon-power.com/product-detail/PCIe_Gen_3x4_P34A60/">specs</a>).</p>

<h3 id="bulk-storage-hard-disk-drives">Bulk Storage Hard Disk Drives</h3>
<p><a href="https://serverpartdeals.com/collections/hard-drives" target="_blank" title="ServerPartDeas: One of Brian's favorite places to shop for hard drives."><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2025/diynas/pp/ST18000NM003D_175.png"></a>Thanks to rising prices, I opted to do like I’ve done with past DIY NAS builds and skip buying hard drives for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>.</p>

<p>When planning your DIY NAS, it is good to always remember that <strong><em>storage will ultimately be your costliest and most important expense</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s a few things to consider when buying hard drives:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Determine your hardware redundancy preferences. I recommend having two hard disk drives’ worth of redundancy (RAIDZ2, RAID6, etc.)</li>
  <li>Focus on price-per-terabyte when comparing prices of drives.</li>
  <li>Do some <a href="https://github.com/Spearfoot/disk-burnin-and-testing" target="_blank" title="Spearfoot's disk-burnin-and-testing Script on GitHub">burn in testing</a> of your hard drives before putting them to use.</li>
  <li>When buying new drives of the same model, try and buy them from multiple vendors to increase the chances of buying drives manufactured in separate batches.</li>
  <li>Plan Ahead! Understand the rate that your storage grows so that you can craft a strategy to grow your storage down the road.</li>
  <li>Being cheap today can and will paint you into a corner that’s quite expensive to get out of.</li>
  <li>Understand that RAID is not a backup!</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully, I’ve collected a bunch of my own decomissioned hard drives which I used to thoroughly test this DIY NAS build.</p>

<h2 id="sata-cables">SATA Cables</h2>

<h2 id="power-supply">Power Supply</h2>
<p>The one thing that I have routinely disliked about building small form factor DIY NAS machines is the price tag that accompanies a small form factor power supply (SFX) like is required with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a>.</p>

Its 500W rating exceeds the needs of all the components that I’d picked out for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>. Plus the power supply’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus">80 Plus Gold</a> rating aligns well with my criteria for power efficiency.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether it was called FreeNAS, TrueNAS, TrueNAS CORE, TrueNAS SCALE, or now <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/" target="_blank" title="TrueNAS Community Edition">TrueNAS Community Edition</a>, the storage appliance product(s) from iXSystems have always been my go-to choice. For each yearly DIY NAS build, I wander over to the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/software-status/">TrueNAS Software Status page</a> and look at the state of the current builds.</p>

<p>I’m conservative with my personal NAS setup. However, for these blog builds, I typically choose Early Adopter releases. This year that’s <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.10/gettingstarted/versionnotes/" target="_blank" title="TrueNAS 25.10 (Goldeye) Version Notes">TrueNAS 25.10.0.1 (aka Goldeye)</a>. I enjoy being able to use these DIY NAS builds as a preview to the latest and greatest that TrueNAS has to offer.</p>

<p>I repeatedly choose TrueNAS because it’s what I’ve become accustomed to; it’s legitimately an enterprise-grade storage product, which is exactly the quality of solution that I want my data to depend on. At the same time it does not feel like you need a specialized certification and a truckload of enterprise storage experience to meet set up a NAS that exceeds your needs at home.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/" target="_blank" title="TrueNAS Community Edition"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/truenas_open_storage-logo-full-color-rgb.png"></a></p>

<p>Many times I have been asked, “Why not <em>&lt;insert NAS appliance or OS here&gt;</em>?”  My answer to that question is, TrueNAS has always done everything that I need it to and they haven’t given me any reason to consider anything else. As a result, there’s never been a need for me to evaluate something else.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-assembly-bios-configuration-and-burn-in">Hardware Assembly, BIOS Configuration, and Burn-In</h2>

<h3 id="hardware-assembly">Hardware Assembly</h3>

<p>I wanted the smallest possible DIY NAS. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a> case initially felt too large since it accommodates Micro ATX motherboards. However, I grew to accept its slightly larger footprint. However, putting the <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N22 motherboard</a> into the case felt roomy and luxurious. Building the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> compared to prior years’ felt a lot like coming home to put on sweatpants and a t-shirt after wearing a suit and tie all day long.</p>

<p>I wasn’t too fond of the cable-management of the power supply’s cables. The layout of the case pretty much makes the front of the power supply inaccessible once it is installed. One consequence of this is that the power cable which powered the SATA backplane initially prevented the 120mm case fan from spinning up. That issue was relatively minor and was resolved with zip ties.</p>

<p>Overall, I felt pretty good about the assembly of the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>, but things would take a turn for the worse when I decided to fill all the 3.5-inch drive bays up with some of my decommissioned 8TB HDDs. Now this is probably my fault, I wouldn’t be surprised at all that the manual of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a> warned me against this, but putting the drives in last turned out to be a major pain in the neck for each of the four drive bays <strong><em>without</em></strong> a SATA backplane.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/800/diynas2026_backwards.png" alt="DIY NAS: 2026 Edition with half its drives installed backwards!"></p>

<p>I had wrongly guessed that you accessed those drives’ power and data ports from the front of the case. I worked really hard to route the cables and even managed to install all of the drives before realizing my error and learning my lesson.  I’m understanding now why the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a> is cheaper than all of its siblings. Partly because there’s a missing SATA backplane, but also because those other 4 drive bays’ layout is frustrating.</p>

<p>Don’t let my last couple paragraphs sour you on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4</a>, though. I still really like its size, it feels big when you’re working in it with a Mini ITX motherboard. If you wind up deciding to use the JONSBO N4, then I suggest that you put those four drives and their cables in first before you do anything else. That would’ve made a world of difference for me. Actually looking at the documentation before getting started might have saved me quite a bit of aggravation, too!</p>

<p>If I have ruined the JONSBO N4 for you, then check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mini-ITX-Chassis-Computer-Aluminum-Support/dp/B0CMVBMVHT?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=9140995b2e4f34809c8202effd2750ac&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N3 Mini-ITX NAS PC Chassis">JONSBO N3</a>. It’s <strong><em>eight</em></strong> 3.5-inch drive bays pair up really nicely with the <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N22 motherboard</a>. You can see what I thought of the JONSBO N3 by reading the <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2024/09/diy-nas-2024-edition-and-econonas.html" title="DIY NAS: 2024 Edition">DIY NAS: 2024 Edition</a> blog.</p>



<h3 id="bios-configuration">BIOS Configuration</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, I do as little as I possibly can in the BIOS. Normally I strive to only set the time and change the boot order. However, I did a bit more for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> since I’m using the <code>SYS_FAN</code> header for the fan which is responsible for cooling the hard drives.  Here are the changes that I made in the BIOS:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set the <strong>System Date</strong> and <strong>System Time</strong> to Greenwich Mean Time
    <ol>
      <li>Advanced
        <ol>
          <li>Hardware Monitor ( Advanced)
            <ol>
              <li>Set <strong>SYS SmartFan Mode</strong> to  <code>Disabled</code>.</li>
              <li>Set the <strong>Manual PWM Setting</strong> (for <code>SYS_FAN</code>) to 180.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Set <strong>PWRON After Power Loss</strong> to <code>Always On</code></li>
      <li>Boot
        <ol>
          <li>Set <strong>Boot Option #1</strong> to the TrueNAS boot device.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not at all interested in venturing into the rabbit’s hole of trying to completely minimize how much power the NAS uses. However, I imagine there’s some opportunities for power savings lurking in the BIOS. I didn’t go looking for them myself, but if you’re intrepid enough to do so here’s a few suggestions that I have to save some additional power:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disable the onboard audio.</li>
  <li>Disable any network interfaces that you don’t wind up using.</li>
  <li>Tinker with the CPU settings.</li>
  <li>Got other suggestions?  <em>Share them in the comments!</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="burn-in">Burn-In</h3>

<p>Because all of the hardware is brand-new to me brand-new components are not guaranteed to be free of defects, I always do a little bit of burn-in testing to establish some trust in the hardware that I’ve picked out for each DIY NAS build. While I think doing <em>some</em> burn-in testing critically important, I also think the value of subsequent burn-in testing drops the more that you do. Don’t get too carried away and do your own  burn-in testing in moderation!</p>

<h4 id="memtest86"><a href="https://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" title="Memtest86+">Memtest86+</a></h4>

<p>I <em>always</em> use Memtest86+ to burn-in the RAM. I always run at least 3+ passes of Memtest86+. Typically, I run many more passes because I tend to let the system keep running additional passes overnight. Secondarily, running these many passes give the CPU a little bit of work to do and there’s enough information displayed by Memtest86+ to give me confidence in the CPU and its settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/diynas2026-memtest_1280.png"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/diynas2026-memtest_600.png" alt="Memtest86+"></a></p>

<h4 id="hard-drives">Hard Drives</h4>

<p>The failure rate of hard drives is highest when the drives are new and then again when they’re old. Regardless of type of hard drives that I buy or when I buy them, I always do some disk burn in. I tend to run <a href="https://github.com/Spearfoot/disk-burnin-and-testing" target="_blank" title="Spearfoot's disk-burnin-and-testing Script on GitHub">Spearfoot’s Disk Burn-in and Testing script</a> on all of my new drives. However executing this script against all of the drives can take quite a long time, even if you use something like  <code>tmux</code> to run the tests in parallel.</p>

<h2 id="initial-truenas-ce-setup">Initial TrueNAS CE Setup</h2>

<p>There’s always a little bit of setup that I do for a new TrueNAS machine. This isn’t intended to be an all inclusive step-by-step guide for all the things you should do with your DIY NAS. Instead, it’s more of a list of things I kept track of while I made sure that the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> was functional enough for me to finish writing this blog. That being said, I do think your NAS would be rather functional if you decided to do the same configuration.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Updated the hostname to <code>diynas2026</code>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Note:  This is only to avoid issues with another NAS on my network.</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Updated the timezone.</li>
  <li>Enabled the following services and set them to start automatically.
    <ol>
      <li>SMB</li>
      <li>SSH</li>
      <li>NFS</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Enabled password login for the <code>truenas_admin</code> user.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Note: If I were planning to use this DIY NAS long-term, I wouldn’t have done this. Using SSH keys for authentication is a better idea</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Edited the TrueNAS Dashboard widgets to reflect the 10Gb interface (<code>enp1s0</code>).</li>
  <li>Created a pool named <code>flash</code> which consisted of mirrored vdev using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZGJVTZK?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=27613853bea52aac53f1068188e5c5e3&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="Teamgroup MP44 1TB NVMe SSD">Teamgroup MP44 1TB NVMe SSDs</a>.</li>
  <li>Created a pool named <code>rust</code> which consisted of a single RAID-Z2 vdev using eight hard drives that I had sitting on my shelf after they were decomissioned.</li>
  <li>Configured the Apps to use the <code>flash</code> pool for the apps’ dataset.</li>
  <li>Made sure that the System Dataset Pool was set to <code>flash</code>.</li>
  <li>Confirmed that there were Scrub Tasks set up for the <code>flash</code> and <code>rust</code> pools.</li>
  <li>Created a dataset on each pool for testing;  <code>flash-test</code> and <code>rust-test</code></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny" target="_blank" title="Scrutiny: WebUI for smartd S.M.A.R.T monitoring">Scrutiny</a> app found in the App Catalog.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I were planning to keep this NAS and use it for my own purposes, I would also:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up a <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.10/scaletutorials/credentials/certificates/settingupletsencryptcertificates/" target="_blank" title="Creating ACME Certificates">Let’s Encrypt certificate</a>.</li>
  <li>Hook up the NAS to <a href="https://networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html" target="_blank" title="Network UPS Tools Hardware Compatability List">a compatible UPS</a>, enable the UPS service, and configure the UPS service to shut down the NAS before the battery runs out of juice.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.10/scaleuireference/toptoolbar/alerts/alertsettingsscreen/" target="_blank" title="TrueNAS Scale Alert Settings Screens">Set up system email alert service</a>.</li>
  <li>Create <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.10/scaletutorials/dataprotection/replication/" target="_blank" title="TrueNAS Replication Tasks">replication tasks</a> to back up critical data to my <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2024/06/one-3d-printed-nas-wasn-t-enough-so-i-printed-two-more.html" title="One 3D-printed NAS wasn't enough, so I printed two more!">off-site NAS</a>.</li>
  <li>Add the new NAS to my Tailscale tailnet using the <a href="https://github.com/truenas/apps/tree/master/ix-dev/community/tailscale" target="_blank" title="Tailscale from the official TrueNAS App Catalog">Tailscale app from the official catalog</a>.</li>
  <li>As the NAS is seeded with data, create and maintain a suite of <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.10/scaletutorials/dataprotection/periodicsnapshottasksscale/" target="_blank" title="Adding Periodic Snapshot Tasks">snapshot tasks</a> tailored to the importance of the different data being stored on the NAS.</li>
  <li>Set up S.M.A.R.T. tests for all of the drives:
    <ol>
      <li>Weekly Short Test</li>
      <li>Monthly Long Test</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Just about every year, I benchmark each DIY NAS build and almost always come to the same conclusion; the NAS will outperform your network at home. Your first bottleneck is almost always going to be the network and the overlwhelming majority of us have gigabit networks at home–but that’s slowly changing since 2.5Gbps and 10Gbps network hardware has started to get reasonable lately.</p>

<p>Even though I always come to the same conclusion, I still like to do the benchmarks for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It helps me build confidence that the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> works well.</li>
  <li>People tend to enjoy consuming benchmarks <strong><em>and</em></strong> it’s fun for me to see the DIY NAS’ network card get saturated during the testing.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>

<p>I like to do three categories of tests to measure the throughput of the NAS:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use <a href="https://iperf.fr/" target="_blank" title="iPerf - The ultimate speed test tool for TCP, UDP and SCTP">iperf3</a> to benchmark throughput between my NAS and another machine on my network.</li>
  <li>Benchmark the throughput of the pool(s) locally on the NAS using <code>fio</code>.</li>
  <li>Set up SMB shares on each of the pools and then benchmark the throughput when using those shares.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every year I try and mention that Tom Lawrence from <a href="https://lawrencesystems.com/" target="_blank">Lawrence Systems</a> published <a href="https://youtu.be/TASYaWTkg0U">a great video about benchmarking storage with FIO</a> and shared <a href="https://forums.lawrencesystems.com/t/linux-benchmarking-with-fio/11122">the FIO commands from his video in their forums</a>. I use these FIO commands constantly as a reference point for testing ZFS pools’ throughput. Importantly I’d like to point out that, in that same video, Tom says something very wise:</p>

<p>What do I think these benchmarks and my use of the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> tell me?  In the grand scheme of things, not a whole lot.</p>

<p>However, these benchmarks do back up what I expected, the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> is quite capable and more than ready to meet my storage needs. I especially like that the CrystalDiskMark benchmark of the SMB shares were <strong><em>both faster than a SATA SSD</em></strong>, and the throughput to the share on the <code>flash</code> pool practically saturated the NAS’ 10GbE network connection.</p>

<h4 id="fio-tests">FIO Tests</h4>

<p>Every time I benchmark a NAS, I seem to either be refining what I tried in prior years or completely reinventing the wheel. As a result, I wouldn’t recommend comparing these results with results that I shared in prior years’ DIY NAS build blogs. I haven’t really put a ton of effort into developing a standard suite of benchmarks. Things in my homelab change enough between DIY NAS blogs that trying to create and maintain an environment for a standard suite of benchmarks is beyond what my budget, spare time, and attention span will allow.</p>

<p>I’m going to paste these <code>fio</code> commands here in the blog for my own use in future DIY NAS build blogs. If you wind up building something similar, these <em>might</em> be helpful to measure your new NAS’ filesystem’s performance and compare it to mine!</p>

<h3 id="power-consumption">Power Consumption</h3>

<p>One not-so-obvious cost of running a DIY NAS is how much power it consumes. While I specifically tried to pick items that were efficient in terms of power consumption, it’s also important to realize that all the other bells and whistles on the awesome <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" target="_blank" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N18 NAS motherboard</a> consume power, too. And that the biggest consumer of power in a NAS is almost always the hard disk drives.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-an-econonas">What about an EconoNAS?</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/ai-dollar-bill-sign.png">Shortly before prices skyrocketed, I decided I wasn’t very interested in doing a separate EconoNAS builds. Several months ago, I realized that there were several off-the-shelf NAS machines that were more-than-capable of running TrueNAS and they were selling at economical prices that couldn’t be topped by a DIY approach. I will dive deeper into this in a future blog, eventually … <strong><em>maybe</em></strong>?</p>

<p>All that being said–it’d be incredibly easy to make some compromises which result in the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> becoming quite a bit more economical. Here’s a list of changes that I would consider to be more budget-friendly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different motherboard/CPU combo: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/127014563991" target="_blank" title="Topton N18 N100/N150/N305 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard:6xSATA/2xM.2/2x2.5GbE/1x10GbE">N18 w/ N100 CPU</a> (-$224), <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/127014563991" title="Topton N18 N100/N150/N305 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard:6xSATA/2xM.2/2x2.5GbE/1x10GbE">N18 w/ N150 CPU</a> (-$214), or <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/127525459090" title="Topton N22 Motherboard w/ N150 CPU on Brian's eBay Store">N22 w/ N150 CPU</a> (-$180)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/4ai7M2V" target="_blank">16GB of DDR5 RAM</a> (-$39) instead of 32GB.</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/4qSQBLa" target="_blank">Thermal Right TL-C12015 Slim Fan</a> instead of the Noctua NF-A12x25 (-$26)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3LFJSnP" target="_blank">Apevia SFX-AP500W Power Supply</a> (-$104)</li>
  <li>Skip the redundancy for the boot pool (-$22)</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether, these savings could add up to more than $400, which is pretty considerable!  If you made all of these changes, you’d have something that’s going to be nearly equivalent to the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> but at a fraction of the price.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/ai-brian-ock-buying-drives.png"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/ai-brian-ock-buying-drives_640.png" alt="Brian as a Super Villian shopping for economical DIY NAS deals!"></a></p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-going-to-do-with-the-diy-nas-2026-edition">What am I going to do with the DIY NAS: 2026 Edition?!</h2>

<p>My DIY NAS is aging quite gracefully, but I’ve recently been wondering about replacing it. Shortly before ordering all the parts for the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>, I briefly considered using this year’s DIY NAS build to replace my personal NAS. However, I decided not to do that. Then prices skyrocketed and I shelved the idea of building a replacement for my own NAS and I nearly shelved the idea of a DIY NAS in 2026!</p>

<p>So that begs the question, “What is Brian going to do with the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>?”</p>

<p>I’m going to auction it off on the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/briancmosesdotcom" target="_blank" title="briancmosesdotcom store on eBay">briancmosesdotcom store on eBay</a>! Shortly after publishing this blog, I’ll list it on eBay. In response to skyrocketing prices for PC components, I’m going to do a no-reserve auction. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder wins and hopefully they’ll get a pretty good deal!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/127527163731" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/ebay-auction_800.png" alt="eBay auction of the DIY NAS: 2026 Edition"></a></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, I’m pleased with the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em>. The <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF" target="_blank" title="Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)">Topton N22 motherboard</a> is a significant improvement over last year’s <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/127014563991" title="Topton N18 N100/N150/N305 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard:6xSATA/2xM.2/2x2.5GbE/1x10GbE">Topton N18 motherboard</a>, primarily due to its extra two SATA ports. This provides 33.3% more gross storage capacity.</p>

<p>While testing, I found the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/231803/intel-processor-n100-6m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz/specifications.html" target="_blank" title="Intel® Processor N100">Intel Core 3 N355 CPU</a> somewhat excessive for basic NAS functions. However, the substantial untapped CPU horsepower offers luxurious performance potential. This makes the build compelling for anyone planning extensive self-hosting projects.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YH7D3J?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=5636db0ca3c62e86da5f02b641c0f283&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="JONSBO N4 Black NAS Pc Case, Walnut Wood, 8-Drive Bay/6 x 3.5-inch HDD (4 hot-swap,2 Non hot-swap),2 x 2.5-inch SSD, Micro ATX Chassis">JONSBO N4 case</a>. The four right-side drive bays lack SATA backplane connectivity. Without creative cabling solutions, individual drive replacement becomes challenging. However, the case’s ~$125 price point compensates for this inconvenience. I anticipate that those the cost savings will justify the compromise for most builders. If I were to build the <em>DIY NAS: 2026 Edition</em> all over again, I’d be tempted to use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mini-ITX-Chassis-Computer-Aluminum-Support/dp/B0CMVBMVHT?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=9140995b2e4f34809c8202effd2750ac&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" title="JONSBO N3 Mini-ITX NAS PC Chassis">JONSBO N3 case</a> or even the <a href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/N6Black.html" title="JONSBO N6">JONSBO N6</a> which isn’t quite obtainable, yet.</p>

<p>The DIY NAS: 2026 Edition delivers excellent performance and superior specifications. In my opinion, it represents better value than off-the-shelf alternatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/QNAP-TS-832PX-4G-High-Capacity-10GbE-2-5GbE/dp/B08P42JR89?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=8d7e5630a6e8c1a01d6f791658a8652e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="QNAP TS-832PX-4G 8 Bay High-Capacity NAS with 10GbE SFP+ and 2.5GbE ">QNAP TS-832PX-4G</a> ($880)</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP8800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22HGH4N?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=351f2f13b717fb8ca116986ad227ec9c&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" title="UGREEN NASync DXP8800 Plus 8-Bay Desktop NAS, Intel i5 1235u 10-Core CPU, 8GB DDR5 RAM, 128G SSD, 2X 10GbE, 2X M.2 NVMe Slots, 8K HDMI, 2X TBT4, Network Attached Storage (Diskless) ">UGREEN NASync DXP8800</a> ($1200)</li>
</ul>

<p>Building your own NAS provides significant advantages. Years later, you can upgrade RAM, motherboard, case, or add PCI-e (x1) expansion cards. These off-the-shelf alternatives offer severely limited upgrade paths.</p>

<p dir="auto">Penpot is the first <strong>open-source</strong> design tool for design and code collaboration. Designers can create stunning designs, interactive prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast. And all of this with no handoff drama.</p>
<p dir="auto">Available on browser or self-hosted, Penpot works with open standards like SVG, CSS, HTML and JSON, and it’s free!</p>
<p dir="auto">The latest updates take Penpot even further. It’s the first design tool to integrate native <a href="https://penpot.dev/collaboration/design-tokens" rel="nofollow">design tokens</a>—a single source of truth to improve efficiency and collaboration between product design and development.
With the <a href="https://penpot.app/dev-diaries" rel="nofollow">huge 2.0 release</a>, Penpot took the platform to a whole new level. This update introduces the ground-breaking <a href="https://penpot.app/penpot-2.0" rel="nofollow">CSS Grid Layout feature</a>, a complete UI redesign, a new Components system, and much more.
For organizations that need extra service for its teams, <a href="https://cal.com/team/penpot/talk-to-us" rel="nofollow">get in touch</a></p>
<p dir="auto">🎇 Design, code, and Open Source meet at <a href="https://penpot.app/penpotfest" rel="nofollow">Penpot Fest</a>! Be part of the 2025 edition in Madrid, Spain, on October 9-10.</p>

<p> This book is an introduction to data structures and algorithms for
functional languages, with a focus on proofs. It covers both
functional correctness and running time analysis. It does so in a
unified manner with inductive proofs about functional programs and
their running time functions.  All proofs have been
machine-checked by the proof assistant <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle</a>. The pdf contains
links to the corresponding Isabelle theories.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
    
      <p><a id="back" href="https://ziglang.org/news/">
        ← Back to
        <b>News</b>
        page
      </a></p>
    <h3>November 26, 2025</h3>
    
    <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig" target="_blank">https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig</a></p><p>Ever since <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/src/commit/8e08cf4bec80b87a7a22a18086a3db5c2c0f1772" target="_blank"><code>git init</code> ten years ago</a>, Zig has been hosted on GitHub. Unfortunately, when it <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-microsoft/" target="_blank">sold out to Microsoft</a>, the <a href="https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/" target="_blank">clock started ticking</a>. “Please just give me 5 years before everything goes to shit,” I thought to myself. And here we are, 7 years later, living on borrowed time.</p><p>Putting aside GitHub’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/9/20906605/github-ice-contract-immigration-ice-dan-friedman" target="_blank">relationship with ICE</a>, it’s abundantly clear that the talented folks who used to work on the product have moved on to bigger and better things, with the remaining losers eager to inflict some kind of bloated, buggy JavaScript framework on us in the name of progress. Stuff that used to be snappy is now sluggish and often entirely broken.</p><p>More importantly, Actions is <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3792#issuecomment-3182746514" target="_blank">created by monkeys</a> and <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/385" target="_blank">completely neglected</a>. After the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-developers-embrace-ai-or-get-out-2025-8" target="_blank">CEO of GitHub said to “embrace AI or get out”</a>, it seems the lackeys at Microsoft took the hint, because GitHub Actions started “vibe-scheduling”; choosing jobs to run seemingly at random. Combined with other bugs and inability to manually intervene, this causes our CI system to get so backed up that not even master branch commits get checked.</p><p>Rather than wasting donation money on more CI hardware to work around this crumbling infrastructure, we’ve opted to switch Git hosting providers instead.</p><p>As a bonus, we look forward to fewer violations (exhibit <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25974" target="_blank">A</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/24983" target="_blank">B</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/www.ziglang.org/pull/502" target="_blank">C</a>) of our <a href="https://ziglang.org/code-of-conduct/#strict-no-llm-no-ai-policy">strict no LLM / no AI policy</a>, which I believe are at least in part due to GitHub aggressively pushing the “file an issue with Copilot” feature in everyone’s face.</p><h2>GitHub Sponsors</h2><p>The only concern we have in leaving GitHub behind has to do with GitHub Sponsors. This product was key to Zig’s early fundraising success, and it <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/2025-financials/">remains a large portion of our revenue today</a>. I can’t thank <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/" target="_blank">Devon Zuegel</a> enough. She appeared like an angel from heaven and single-handedly made GitHub into a viable source of income for thousands of developers. Under her leadership, the future of GitHub Sponsors looked bright, but sadly for us, she, too, moved on to bigger and better things. Since she left, that product as well has been neglected and is already starting to decline.</p><p>Although GitHub Sponsors is a large fraction of Zig Software Foundation’s donation income, <strong>we consider it a liability</strong>. We humbly ask if you, reader, are currently donating through GitHub Sponsors, that you consider <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">moving your recurring donation to Every.org</a>, which is itself a non-profit organization.</p><p>As part of this, we are sunsetting the GitHub Sponsors perks. These perks are things like getting your name onto the home page, and getting your name into the release notes, based on how much you donate monthly. We are working with the folks at Every.org so that we can offer the equivalent perks through that platform.</p><h2>Migration Plan</h2><p>Effective immediately, I have made <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/" target="_blank">ziglang/zig on GitHub</a> read-only, and the canonical origin/master branch of the main Zig project repository is <code>https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig.git</code>.</p><p>Thank you to the Forgejo contributors who helped us with our issues switching to the platform, as well as the Codeberg folks who worked with us on the migration - in particular <a href="https://codeberg.org/earl-warren" target="_blank">Earl Warren</a>, <a href="https://codeberg.org/fnetX" target="_blank">Otto</a>, <a href="https://codeberg.org/Gusted" target="_blank">Gusted</a>, and <a href="https://codeberg.org/mfenniak" target="_blank">Mathieu Fenniak</a>.</p><p>In the end, we opted for a simple strategy, sidestepping GitHub’s aggressive vendor lock-in: leave the existing issues open and unmigrated, but start counting issues at 30000 on Codeberg so that all issue numbers remain unambiguous. Let us please consider the GitHub issues that remain open as metaphorically “copy-on-write”. <strong>Please leave all your existing GitHub issues and pull requests alone</strong>. No need to move your stuff over to Codeberg unless you need to make edits, additional comments, or rebase. <strong>We’re still going to look at the already open pull requests and issues</strong>; don’t worry.</p><hr><p>In this modern era of acquisitions, weak antitrust regulations, and platform capitalism leading to extreme concentrations of wealth, non-profits remain a bastion defending what remains of the commons.</p><p>Happy hacking,</p><p>Andrew</p>

<p>Created on 26.11.25</p>

<p>Earlier this year I <a href="https://youtu.be/VTbShvf97kI">demoed</a> iOS 6 running on an iPod touch 3 - a device that Apple never gave iOS 6 to, making iOS 5.1.1 the latest build it can run</p>
<p>A few months later I also released a <a href="https://github.com/NyanSatan/SundanceInH2A">script</a> that generates an iOS 6 restore image installable on that iPod touch model</p>
<p>This article describes technical details behind this work. Certain proficiency in iOS internals is assumed</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://nyansatan.github.io/resources/projects/sundanceh2a.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="ill-show-you-what-ios-is-made-of">I'll show you what iOS is made of</h2>
<p>First of all, let's recap what software components iOS consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>iBoot</strong> - the bootloader. Has 4 different types for different scenarios - iBSS, iBEC, LLB and iBoot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kernelcache</strong> - the OS kernel + kernel extensions (drivers) built into a single binary blob</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DeviceTree</strong> - structured list of hardware used by specific device model + some parameters that specify software behavior. The copy included in an IPSW is more of a template that is heavily modified by iBoot before jumping into kernel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Userspace filesystem - tiny <strong>restore ramdisk</strong> used purely for OS installation or the actual <strong>root filesystem</strong> of iOS installed persistently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various firmwares for coprocessors, be they internal or external to the main SoC - like, baseband, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, multitouch and etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="iphone-3gs-tests">iPhone 3GS tests</h2>
<p>iPhone 3GS was released the same year as iPod touch 3 (2009), and has a very similar hardware (<strong>S5L8920X</strong> SoC vs. <strong>S5L8922X</strong>). But the most important part is that it actually got iOS 6 officially</p>
<p>Before doing anything on the iPod I decided to try to boot iOS 6.0 with iOS 5.1.1 iBoot &amp; DeviceTree on the iPhone and see what's gonna break and how</p>
<h2 id="devicetree">DeviceTree</h2>
<p>The most broken thing was DeviceTree - iOS 6 added a lot of new nodes and properties. To fix it in automated manner I wrote a stupid Python script that decodes and computes a diff between 2 DeviceTrees. Such diff can also be applied to another DeviceTree</p>
<p>The script is available in the <strong>SundanceInH2A</strong> <a href="https://github.com/NyanSatan/SundanceInH2A/blob/master/dt/ddt.py">repo</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned above a lot of things in a DeviceTree is filled by iBoot at runtime. One of such new properties is <code>nvram-proxy-data</code> in <code>chosen</code> node</p>
<p>The property must contain a raw NVRAM dump - leaving it empty will make kernel get stuck somewhere very early</p>
<p>For iPod touch 3 I also had to clean-up the diff out of iPhone-specific things before applying it to iPod's 5.1.1 DeviceTree</p>
<h2 id="iboot">iBoot</h2>
<p>iBoot didn't require any major changes in this case. Just typical Image3 signature check patch, boot-args injection and <code>debug-enabled</code> patch so kernel is going to actually respect AMFI boot-args</p>
<p>One important thing is to actually populate <code>nvram-proxy-data</code> dynamically, at least for normal boots (aka non-restore). Restore boot will be fine with some random NVRAM hardcoded into DeviceTree, but normal one will overwrite your actual NVRAM with the random one if it decides to sync it at some point</p>
<p>I do it by replacing a call to <code>UpdateDeviceTree()</code> with my own little function that calls the real <code>UpdateDeviceTree()</code>, but also populates actual <code>nvram-proxy-data</code> and <code>random-seed</code> (this one shouldn't be of any importance)</p>
<p>For boot-args I always add <code>amfi=0xff</code> to disable code-signing, but that's pretty cannonical as well</p>
<p>Please note that other iBoot+kernel combos might require more changes - if you ever try something and it doesn't work, I recommend looking into DeviceTree differences (both the initial template and how iBoot fills it) and also <code>boot_args</code> structure iBoot passes to kernel (not to be confused with boot-args <em>string</em>, the <code>boot_args</code> <em>structure</em> is a different thing)</p>
<h2 id="kernelcache">Kernelcache</h2>
<p>The most complex part. iPod touch 3 never got iOS 6 officialy, yes, but it was rumored that initially it was meant to have it, but Apple's marketing team said no. Either way, almost every internal iOS 6 build got both standalone S5L8922X kernel and even standalone kexts (including ones specific to iPod touch 3)</p>
<p>The question is how to load them all simultaneously. My initial idea was to do it just as older Mac OS X could do - load all kexts dynamically on bootloader level. Long story short, my strategy was the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>In iBoot context, load all kexts from filesystem - binary itself + Info.plist</li>
<li>Lay them out in memory and add corresponding entries to <code>chosen/memory-map</code> node of DeviceTree</li>
<li>Boot standalone kernel which will then pick them up and load</li>
</ol>
<p>The sad outcome:</p>
<pre><code>panic(cpu 0 caller 0x802e5223): "kern_return_t kxld_link_file(KXLDContext *, u_char *, u_long, const char *, void *, KXLDDependency *, u_int, u_char **, kxld_addr_t *) (com.apple.kec.corecrypto) called in kernel without kxld support"
</code></pre>
<p>The kernel has all the code to pick them up, but not to actually link...</p>
<h3 id="glueing-a-prelinked-kernelcache">Glueing a prelinked kernelcache</h3>
<p>So creating a legit kernelcache is the only way after all. I was already imagining all the horrors of writing software to parse and apply <code>LINKEDIT</code> and etc., but then it occured to me! Mac OS X (before Apple Silicon) was generating such kernelcaches somehow! What if we use that logic to build our iOS kernelcache?</p>
<pre><code>kcgen \
    -c output.bin \
    $(cat n18.10A403.kextlist | sed 's/^/--bundle-id /') \
    -kernel kernels_kexts_10A63970m/mach.development.s5l8922x \
    -arch armv7 \
    -all-personalities \
    -strip-symbols \
    -uncompressed \
    -- \
    kernels_kexts_10A63970m/Extensions
</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>/usr/local/bin/kcgen</code> from internal Sierra build (can be found online as "Phoenix A1708.dmg"), but it seems that even latest macOS <code>kextcache</code> can do it (included by default)</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-c output.bin</code> - output file to write resulting kernelcache to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$(cat n18.10A403.kextlist | sed 's/^/--bundle-id /')</code> - this weird expression appends <code>--bundle-id</code> to every line from the file at <code>n18.10A403.kextlist</code>. This is to specify which kexts we'd like to include. How I created such list is described below</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-arch armv7</code> - obviously only build armv7 slice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-all-personalities</code> - very important flag that prevents <em>irrelevant</em> IOKit personalities to be stripped. "Irrelevant" as in "irrelevant to current machine", meaning everything <em>relevant</em> to iPod touch 3 is going to be stripped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-strip-symbols</code> - strips unnecessary symbols. This flag can be omitted theoretically, but I recommend keeping it to make resulting kernelcache smaller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-uncompressed</code> - do not apply compression. Since we'll have to change one little thing later, compression would have to be reapplied anyway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--</code> means the rest of the args will point to directories to grab kexts from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>kernels_kexts_10A63970m/Extensions</code> is a path to a folder containing kexts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The little thing to do is to remove fat header. For some reason, it creates a fat Mach-O with a single slice. iBoot doesn't like it, so let's strip it:</p>
<pre><code>lipo -thin armv7 output.bin -o output.thin.bin
</code></pre>
<p>The kernel cache is ready now! Just needs to be compressed and packaged into Image3 container</p>
<h4 id="about-kext-lists">About kext lists</h4>
<p>Once again I compared iPhone 3GS' iOS 5.1.1 vs. 6.0 - some kexts were added, some removed, some changed their bundle IDs, some were irrelevant for iPod touch 3</p>
<p>Do not forget to include the pseudo-extensions as well!</p>
<p>Samples can be found in <strong>SundanceInH2A</strong> <a href="https://github.com/NyanSatan/SundanceInH2A/tree/master/kc/kext_lists">repository</a></p>
<h4 id="about-iokit-personalities">About IOKit personalities</h4>
<p>In this specific case I had to patch up Info.plist of the Wi-Fi kext. As always there is a sample in the <a href="https://github.com/NyanSatan/SundanceInH2A/blob/master/kc/iokit_personalities.plist">repo</a></p>
<h2 id="restore-ramdisk-filesystem">Restore ramdisk filesystem</h2>
<p>Pretty cannonical here. I patched <code>asr</code> as usual and also had to move <code>options.n88.plist</code> to <code>options.n18.plist</code> so it can lay out partitions properly</p>
<p>However, I also have to install the iBoot exploit. To do that I reimplement <code>rc.boot</code> binary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remount ramdisk and set <code>umask</code> just like the original one does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call <code>restored_external</code>, but with <code>-server</code> argument, so it doesn't reboot after finishing restore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If restore was completed properly, I add a third partition, write the exploit there and set <code>boot-partition</code> to <code>2</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot the device</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My implementation is available guess where? Yes, in the <a href="https://github.com/NyanSatan/SundanceInH2A/tree/master/rc_boot">repository</a></p>
<h2 id="root-filesystem">Root filesystem</h2>
<p>This needed a lot of changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add matching SpringBoard's hardware feature plist (<code>/System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/N18AP.plist</code> in this case)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I took the iOS 5.1.1 variant as a base and added iOS 6 specific capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried to keep <em>original</em> enough Home screen icon order by <em>merging</em> iPod touch 3 iOS 5.1.1 and iPod touch 4 6.x layouts</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add multitouch &amp; Wi-Fi firmwares</p>
<ul>
<li>I use versions from 5.1.1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Bluetooth firmware and scripts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is more complicated, as those are all hardcoded into <code>/usr/sbin/BlueTool</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luckily, they can also be overriden by files in <code>/etc/bluetool</code> - as always check my code for reference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I extracted both firmware and scripts from 5.1.1 <code>BlueTool</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FairPlay</strong> daemon is limited to <code>N88AP</code> (iPhone 3GS)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It has <code>LimitLoadToHardware</code> key in its' LaunchDaemon plist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if we simply remove the key, it works on iPod touch 3 as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is important, because otherwise we cannot activate device through Apple's servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This trick will be harder to pull off on iOS 6.1+ because they load LaunchDaemons from a signed cache. Still can be bypassed in many ways - for instance, patching <code>launchd</code> or forcefully loading another plist via <code>launchctl</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DYLD shared cache patches</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Product ID map patch</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 6 brings a concept of "product ID" in the form of a long byte sequence</li>
<li>It is filled by iBoot into <code>product</code> node of DeviceTree (which didn't even exist before)</li>
<li>I hardcode the value of iPhone 3GS straight into DeviceTree (<code>8784AE8D7066B0F0136BE91DCFE632A436FFD6FB</code>)</li>
<li>There is also a short form of this identifier - 16-bit integer - which existed before iOS 6</li>
<li>iPhone 3GS is <code>0x2714</code> and the iPod is <code>0x2715</code></li>
<li><strong>MobileGestalt</strong> framework has a table that matches the short form by the long one - I swap <code>0x2714</code> with <code>0x2715</code> there</li>
<li>I believe it's better for iTunes and etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>getDeviceVariant()</code> patch</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MobileGestalt</strong> once again messes us up our business</li>
<li><em>Device variant</em> is a letter - usually "A" or "B"</li>
<li>It seems to depend on Wi-Fi transciever vendor used in exact device (?)</li>
<li>iOS 6 fails miserably to determine this value for iPod touch 3</li>
<li>This crashes activation process, for example</li>
<li>To fix it, I patch the function to always return "A" (in form of <code>CFString</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing code signature</p>
<ul>
<li>This is much easier than most people think</li>
<li>Shared cache files have the same format of signature as normal Mach-Os</li>
<li>And since it's just ad-hoc, all you need to do is to recalculate SHA-1 hash for pages you modified and update the signature</li>
<li>So easy, it can be done with just a hex-editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-iboot-exploit">The iBoot exploit</h2>
<p>iOS 5 iBoot had a bug in <strong>HFS+</strong> filesystem driver. I did make an exploit many years ago but it was <em>bad</em>. Like, truly <em>bad</em>. I reimplemented it from scratch for this project making it deterministic (hopefully...)</p>
<p>This subject probably deserves a separate article</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-future-plans">Conclusion &amp; future plans</h2>
<p>This was not easy to do, and yet easier than I expected initially</p>
<p>After releasing the tool many people asked me about jailbreaking. The old tools are not going to work, but it should be easy to just patch the kernel and drop Cydia tarball onto the filesystem. I guess I will give it a try later</p>
<p>There was another device that Apple dropped support for in that year - iPad 1. I will try that soon enough as well</p>
<p>I hope that the information from this write-up will help you making other crazy combinations, like iOS 4 on iPhone 4S or iOS 5 on iPad mini 1</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m done. I’m done arriving at hotels and discovering that they have removed the bathroom door. Something that should be as standard as having a bed, has been sacrificed in the name of “aesthetic”.</p>



<p>I get it, you can save on material costs and make the room feel bigger, but what about my dignity??? I can’t save that when you don’t include a bathroom door.</p>



<p>It’s why I’ve built this website, where I compiled hotels that are guaranteed to have bathroom doors, and hotels that need to work on privacy. </p>



<p>I’ve emailed hundreds of hotels and I asked them two things: do your doors close all the way, and are they made of glass? Everyone that says yes to their doors closing, and no to being made of glass has been sorted by price range and city for you to easily find places to stay that are <strong><em>guaranteed</em></strong> to have a bathroom door.</p>







<hr>



<p>Quickly check to see if the hotel you’re thinking of booking has been reported as lacking in doors by a previous guest.</p>







<hr>



<p>Finally, this passion project could not exist without people submitting hotels without bathroom doors for public shaming. If you’ve stayed at a doorless hotel send me an email with the hotel name to bringbackdoors@gmail.com, or send me a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bring_back_doors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM on Instagram</a> with the hotel name and a photo of the doorless setup to be publicly posted.</p>



<p>Let’s name and shame these hotels to protect the dignity of future travelers.</p>

<p>Last year, Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ios-18-brings-rcs-to-major-carrier-iphones-but-prepaid-plans-are-still-waiting/">finally added support</a> for Rich Communications Services (RCS) texting to its platforms, improving consistency, reliability, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/rcs-texting-updates-will-bring-end-to-end-encryption-to-green-bubble-chats/">security</a> when exchanging green-bubble texts between the competing iPhone and Android ecosystems. Today, Google is announcing another small step forward in interoperability, pointing to a slightly less annoying future for friend groups or households where not everyone owns an iPhone.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/quick-share-airdrop/">has updated</a> Android’s Quick Share feature to support Apple’s AirDrop, which allows users of Apple devices to share files directly using a local peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection. Apple devices with AirDrop enabled and set to “everyone for 10 minutes” mode will show up in the Quick Share device list just like another Android phone would, and Android devices that support this new Quick Share version will also show up in the AirDrop menu.</p>
<p>Google will only support this feature on the Pixel 10 series, at least to start. The company is “looking forward to improving the experience and expanding it to more Android devices,” but it didn’t announce anything about a timeline or any hardware or software requirements. Quick Share also won’t work with AirDrop devices working in the default “contacts only” mode, though Google “[welcomes] the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future.” (Reading between the lines: Google and Apple are not currently working together to enable this, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825228/iphone-airdrop-android-quick-share-pixel-10">Google confirmed to The Verge</a> that Apple hadn’t been involved in this at all.)</p>
<p>Like AirDrop, Google notes that files shared via Quick Share are transferred directly between devices, without being sent to either company’s servers first.</p>
<p>Google shared a little more information in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html">a separate post about Quick Share’s security</a>, crediting Android’s use of the memory-safe Rust programming language with making secure file sharing between platforms possible.</p>
<p>“Its compiler enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules at compile time, which guarantees memory safety,” writes Google VP of Platforms Security and Privacy Dave Kleidermacher. “Rust removes entire classes of memory-related bugs. This means our implementation is inherently resilient against attackers attempting to use maliciously crafted data packets to exploit memory errors.”</p>

<h2>Why is this happening now?</h2>
<p>Google doesn’t mention it in either Quick Share post, but if you’re wondering why it’s suddenly possible for Quick Share to work with AirDrop, it can almost certainly be credited to European Union regulations imposed under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p>Let’s start with how AirDrop works. Like many of Apple’s “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108046">Continuity</a>” features that rely on wireless communication between devices, AirDrop uses Bluetooth to allow devices to find each other, and a fast peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection to actually transfer files and other data. This isn’t exotic hardware; all smartphones, tablets, and computers sold today include some flavor of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>But to make those Continuity features work, Apple also developed a proprietary protocol called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) to facilitate the actual connection between devices and the data transfer. Because this wasn’t a standard anyone could use, other companies couldn’t try to make their own wireless sharing features compatible with AirDrop.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816">earlier this year</a>, the EU <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/questions-and-answers/interoperability_en">adopted new specification decisions</a> that required Apple to adopt new interoperable wireless standards, starting in this year’s iOS 26 release. If you don’t want to wade through the regulatory documents, <a href="https://www.ditto.com/blog/cross-platform-p2p-wi-fi-how-the-eu-killed-awdl">this post</a> from cloud services company Ditto is a useful timeline of events written in plainer language.</p>

<p>The rulings required Apple to add support for the Wi-Fi Alliance’s <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/alternative-topologies">Wi-Fi Aware standard</a> instead of AWDL—and in fact required Apple to deprecate AWDL and to help add its features to Wi-Fi Aware so that any device could benefit from them. This wasn’t quite the imposition it sounded like; Wi-Fi Aware <a href="https://owlink.org/wiki/">was developed with Apple’s help</a>, based on the work Apple had already done on AWDL. But it meant that Apple could no longer keep other companies out of AirDrop by using a functionally similar but private communication protocol instead of the standardized version.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>In some ways, Apple’s journey to Wi-Fi Aware recalls the iPhone’s journey to USB-C: first, Apple developed a proprietary port that achieved some of the same goals as USB-C; Apple then contributed work to what would become the standardized USB-C connector; but then the company hesitated to actually adopt the standardized port in its phones until its hand was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/the-clock-is-rapidly-ticking-on-apples-lightning-charger/">forced by regulators</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, Wi-Fi Aware was added to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WiFiAware">Apple’s developer documentation</a> lists the specific hardware that supports it (the iPhone 12 and later, and most iPads released within the last three or four years). For Android users, that likely means that Quick Share will only work with AirDrop on those devices, if they’ve been updated to iOS/iPadOS 26 or later. Google <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/wifi/wifi-aware">has supported Wi-Fi Aware</a> in Android since version 8.0, so it should at least theoretically be possible for most modern Android phones to add support for the feature in software updates somewhere down the line.</p>
<p>Apple’s hardware support list also suggests that Android phones <em>won’t</em> work with AirDrop on the Mac, since macOS 26 isn’t listed as a supported operating system on Apple’s Wi-Fi Aware (it’s likely not a coincidence that macOS is not considered to be a “gatekeeper” operating system under the DMA, as both iOS and iPadOS are).</p>
<p>If I had to guess why neither of Google’s Quick Share posts mentions Wi-Fi interoperability standards or the DMA, it may be because Google has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/on-dma-eve-google-whines-apple-sounds-alarms-and-tiktok-wants-out/">complaining</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/uk-antitrust-regulator-takes-aim-at-googles-search-dominance/">various aspects of the law</a> and its enforcement since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/eu-to-regulate-gatekeepers-in-crackdown-on-google-apple-amazon-facebook/">before it was even passed</a> (as have many US tech companies designated as gatekeepers by the law). Google has occasionally tried to take advantage of the DMA, as it did <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-argues-imessage-should-be-regulated-by-the-eus-digital-markets-act/">when it argued</a> that Apple’s iMessage service should be opened up. But it may be that Google doesn’t want to explicitly credit or praise the DMA in its press releases when the company is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/eu-accuses-google-and-apple-of-stifling-competition-under-digital-markets-act/">facing the possibility of huge fines</a> under the same law.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/europe-big-tech.html">reported earlier this week</a> that EU regulators are considering changes to some of its tech regulations, citing concerns about “overregulation” and “competitiveness,” but that the EU was not currently considering changes to the DMA. For its part, Apple recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/apple-demands-eu-repeal-the-digital-markets-act/">called for the DMA to be repealed entirely</a>.</p>

<p>Willie Shane broke the asphalt on Elon Musk’s Music City Loop project this summer. Seven of his crew had been the sole excavators, fabricators and dump trucking company on The Boring Company’s proposed tunnel through Nashville for months.</p>

<p>Then came Monday night, when they walked off the site.</p>

<p>“I moved the equipment myself,” Shane said in an interview with the <em>Banner</em> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We were really skeptical from the beginning, and then since then, things pretty much just went downhill,” he added.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Musk’s company has <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/08/08/elon-musk-music-city-loop-proposal/">a spotty record of completing similar tunnels in other cities</a>, often snagging on government regulations and contractual issues. When Shane’s company, Shane Trucking and Excavating, which works with major local clients like the Grand Ole Opry and the Nashville International Airport, was approached by The Boring Company, he said he had some reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I told them very bluntly — and I don’t want this to come across like egotistical — but I told them, ‘Hey, my dad worked really hard to build a reputation in Nashville, and my brother and I work very hard to keep that reputation,’” Shane said. “If you guys are actually serious about doing this, you need to be 100 percent serious, because this is going to be our reputation as part of this too.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>After being reassured, Shane’s team took the job in July.&nbsp;</p>


<p>He and his crew left the state-owned property on Rosa L Parks Boulevard, where they had been working on the proposed 9-mile tunnel from the state capitol to the airport after months of safety and financial issues with Musk’s company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It started about a month in with a change in pay.</p>

<p>“We were supposed to be paid every 15 days. And then they switched accounting firms, and then it went from 15 days to 60,” Shane said. Now it’s been 123 days since they started digging, and Shane says The Boring Company has only paid out about five percent of what he’s owed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Shane, he has still been able to pay his employees on time, but the local trucking company is left holding the bag for money unpaid by The Boring Company. Other subcontractors, he says, have also severed ties due to nonpayment on the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final straw that caused Shane to pull his crew from the site was when multiple employees reported that a representative of The Boring Company was soliciting them to bail on Shane and work directly for TBC on Monday.&nbsp;</p>


<p>“One of their head guys texts two of my welders, offering them a job for $45 an hour from his work phone,” Shane described, noting that the same TBC employee denied sending the texts when confronted with screenshots. “That’s actually a breach of contract.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shane also says he and other vendors have filed multiple OSHA safety complaints since working on the site but have gotten no response. His biggest concerns have been Boring employees on the jobsite not wearing proper personal protective equipment, such as hard hats, and unsafe shoring, which he says he’s repeatedly complained about to the Boring Company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Where we’re digging, we’re so far down, there should be concrete and different structures like that to hold the slope back from falling on you while you’re working,” Shane explained. “Where most people use concrete, they currently have — I’m not even kidding — they currently have wood. They had us install wood 2x12s.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The safety concerns are why Shane says he decided to make the issue public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’re not coming forward in like a vindictive way,” Shane said. “I just don’t want someone to get hurt, sure, and then, in the future, I have to be like, ‘Dang, I worked on there, and I turned a blind eye to it.’”</p>


<p>In the meantime, Shane said that the amount of backpay owed to his company is in the six figures and that he has retained a lawyer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Boring Company response</h3>

<p>After the <em>Banner</em> contacted The Boring Company about Shane’s claims, Vice President David Buss said he connected with Shane and would make good on the outstanding invoices by the end of the day Wednesday and would do a “full audit” on the error.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It does look like we had some invoicing errors on that,” Buss told the <em>Banner</em>. “It was, you know, unfortunately, too common of a thing, but I assured them that we are going to make sure that invoices are wired tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Buss later clarified that he does not believe The Boring Company has a “common” practice of missing payments to vendors, but rather missed payments happen sometimes during “the normal course of business.”</p>

<p>“You hate to have an unhappy vendor. We certainly aim to have great relationships,” Buss said. “And so my goal will be to figure out what happened in this incident and then make sure that that’s not extrapolated to any other incidents.”</p>


<p>Buss also said he was looking into Shane’s claims about The Boring Company trying to hire contractors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It is definitely not our practice to try to poach anybody, so I understand the frustrations on their side,” Buss said. “Hopefully it’s something where we’re able to smooth that over and correct some of the things that happened on site and that led to this.”</p>

<p>Asked about the safety complaints, Buss said Shane did not raise any concerns on their call Tuesday and said he was unaware of any OSHA complaints, but would look into it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Safety is existential to our company,” Buss said. “We thankfully have a long history of seven years of tunneling in Las Vegas, and we’ve had one construction-related injury that was not the company’s fault in a violation.”</p>

<h3>Hiring headaches</h3>

<p>According to Buss, the projected timeline had not changed, and work had not been slowed by the crews’ departure from the site. Shane, however, painted a different picture.&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Actually, we were the crew that was building the tunnel boring machine. So there’s nobody building the tunnel boring machine right now, and the Boring Company has been trying to hire welders, but they haven’t been able to secure any help,” Shane said Tuesday, noting that many prospective employees won’t work on the project because of Musk’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“A lot of people don’t like Elon and their payment terms; the way that they pay their employees, is not traditional,” Shane said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buss denied any hiring trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’ve had zero issues finding great talent thus far in Nashville,” Buss said. “I think we’ve hired about 14 people now, and we’re going to start to grow the team as we begin mining operations.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instability and safety have been pervasive concerns around the project since its <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/07/29/elon-musk-underground-music-city-loop/">hurried public rollout this summer</a>, in which<a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/08/13/nashville-music-city-loop-concerns/"> little-to-no public input was received by the state</a> before <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/08/01/elon-musk-music-city-loop/">approving a lease of the state-owned property</a> where digging is taking place.</p>

<p>As reports of a second Boring tunnel under Broadway and West End surfaced, Boring Company CEO Steve Davis hosted a two-hour live update session on X, the social media website also owned by Musk Monday evening, in which he touted progress on the Music City Loop and described the project as smoothly underway, with boring set to begin around January after the proper permits are secured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An hour later, Shane’s team left the site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During Davis’ virtual meeting, members of the public could submit questions, some of which were answered by Boring Company leadership. Many of those questions came from State Sen. Heidi Campbell (D-Nashville), who represents the area and has been a vocal critic of the project since it was announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I would say the promotional session that they had last night on on Twitter was disingenuous at best, if not dishonest, because it was, it sounded like a utopian project and then, lo and behold, the very next day, we find out that there are people leaving the site because they’re not getting paid and they’re not being treated well,” Campbell told the <em>Banner</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to her concerns about irreparable damage to the site and whether the project would even be completed, Campbell said she was concerned about the state’s liability if there were unsafe working conditions on the leased property and whether there was any way for lawmakers to stop the process.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to hold The Boring Company accountable for any of these things,” Campbell said of the lease. “They’ve already dug a big hole. But then on top of it, if they move forward, forward in any capacity, they have not proven that they are reliable to take care of the damage that they cause.”</p>

<p>When Shane first spoke to the <em>Banner</em>, he said he did not intend to return to the job even if they received payment, noting that his employees had expressed discomfort “because they didn’t feel the management there was very good.”</p>

<p>Hours later, after hearing from Buss, Shane said he would consider returning “if they correct the situation on their end.”</p>

        <p>Companies want you to download apps. Here in Taiwan it’s particularly bad: I’ve had shop staff tell
me about some discount if you download their app, and when I decline, say something like “It’s really easy! Here, just give me your phone and I’ll do it for you.”
Once when I was setting up my phone plan, the staff wanted my phone to, idk, note my IMEI or something, and then when I wasn’t paying attention,
installed a local e-commerce app, using my new phone number and name as login details,
then proudly told me, “Now you get 300NTD off your first phone bill!” Thanks, for 10$ I can get weekly text and email
spam from Shopee, great.</p>
<p>So first tip, in Taiwan, never hand your phone over the counter.</p>
<p>Second tip, never download the app. Corps have all sorts of ways to try to convince you: Use the app to order in-store rather than the kiosk,
get free chicken nuggets. Download our app at checkout, get a discount. Whatever the reason, don’t do it, you’re giving more than you’re getting.</p>
<p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>First, we’ve entered an era defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. Companies try to get
as much data on you as possible, and then treat you differently based on the data they have on file for you. We all know this as seeing poorly-tuned
ads (you just bought a refridgerator? You must love refridgerators! Here’s 100 refridgerator ads), but the new trend is <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/">surveillance pricing</a>.
A company will know that you just got paid and so charge you just a bit more for your chicken nuggets than they do when you haven’t been paid in two weeks.
Annoying, don’t download them app, don’t give them more data than they already have.</p>
<p>The other scary thing though is that that gives the power of currency valuation to companies. WIthout surveillance pricing, everyone pays the same for a cheeseburger.
Rich people can buy more cheeseburgers, sure, but at least the price of cheeseburgers is pegged against a dollar, so if someone starts charging too much for cheeseburgers,
you can take your dollars to a competitor. Once companies can start charging individual prices, the global economy doesn’t determine how many cheeseburgers your dollars can buy,
McDonald’s does. Way too much power to give to these companies that already have too much power.</p>
<p>Second reason, binding arbitration. Binding arbitration is when you sign an agreement with someone that has a clause that says,
“if there’s a dispupte, we don’t sue eachother, instead we go through a private process outside the court system and let a mediator decide the outcome.”
Bonus, unlike judges, whose salaries are paid for by the taxpayers and therefore you don’t pay a “judge fee” when you go to court (mostly), a mediator
needs to be hired. Guess who hires them? Not you!</p>
<p>Walking into a restaurant to buy a cheeseburger, there’s no way a company can force you to enter a contractual agreement that includes binding arbitration.
Downloading an app, however, requires agreeing to a “Terms of Service,” and those can <em>absolutely</em> include a binding arbitration clause, and that clause
can be applied even to cases outside the app. This happened to Jeffrey Piccolo when his wife died of food poisoning in a Disney World. Disney made a motion
to dismiss because a couple years back, Jeffrey had signed up for a free trial of Disney+, which included a binding arbitration clause, which meant that
if Jeffrey wanted to complain about how Disney murdered his wife, they’d have to settle it out of court with a mediator that Disney hired. No jury, no judge,
no oversight. In the end the only reason Disney dropped this motion is because the news picked it up. That won’t always happen.</p>
<p>At least in the USA, binding arbitration is totally cool according to the Supreme Court, so don’t count on the government to save you. You need to take
personal steps to make sure you aren’t signing your rights away. So, don’t download apps.</p>
<p>Predictions: Sometime in the next 5 years, someone will be forced into arbitration with Uber after being hit by one of their self driving cars, because
they use Uber Eats. Sometime in the next 5 years, someone’s house will burn down from their Tesla exploding, and they’ll be forced into arbitration
because they had a Twitter account, and Twitter is now a subsidiary of TeXla. Sometime in the next 5 years, an Amazon employee who lost a finger on the job
will be forced into arbitration because they have a WaPo subscription.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/27/shit-shack/">Cory Doctorow</a> covers the topic in much more detail.</p>
